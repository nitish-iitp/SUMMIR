England vs Switzerland Quarter Final, UEFA Euro 2024 Highlights: England scored all of their spot-kicks to beat Switzerland 5-3 in penalties to make their way into the Euro 2024 semi-finals.

Earlier, in a pulsating draw at Dusseldorf, Breel Embolo gave the Swiss the advantage in the 75th minute by scoring off a low cross. The advantage was nullified by Bukayo Saka five minutes later as he scored a stunner from outside the box. England will play the winner of the game between Netherlands and Turkey. For Switzerland, the spot-kicks brought a cruel end to the dream of making into their first-ever European Championships semi-final.

Starting XI – England: Pickford; Walker, Stones, Konsa; Trippier, Rice, Mainoo, Saka; Foden, Bellingham, Kane; Subs: Ramsdale, Henderson, Shaw, Alexander-Arnold, Dunk, Gallagher, Toney, Gordon, Watkins, Bowen, Eze, Gomez, Palmer, Wharton; Switzerland: Sommer, Schar, Akanji, Rodriguez, Ndoye, Freuler, Xhaka, Aebischer, Rieder, Vargas, Embolo; Subs: Stergiou, Widmer, Elvedi, Zakaria, Okafor, Steffen, Mvogo, Zuber, Zesiger, Sierro, Duah, Kobel, Shaqiri, Jashari, Amdouni

England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: One of my best nights for England, says Saka

Bukayo Saka: “I am going to put it there with the best nights for England. It was special with how we fought back. I am proud of everyone. “I felt we dominated the whole game and would get another chance. “I have faith in God to come back from something like [missing the penalty in the Euro 2020 final] that is difficult but I used it to make me stronger. “It shows how much we want to win the tournament. In the past two games we have gone down and come back. Hopefully we can win the next game in 90 minutes.”

England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: Redemption for Bukayo Saka

As his England teammates sprinted their way towards Trent Alexander Arnold, who'd just whipped the winning penalty, Bukayo Saka went down on his knees with moist eyes. For him, it was a moment of redemption from the spot-kicks. In England's last penalty shootout at the Euros, he had missed from the spot, a miss that handed Italy the title. A miss that was followed by racial slurs being thrown at the young winger. On Saturday, when the moment came his way, Saka buried his penalty past Sommer. Not to forget, it was his goal in regulation period that kept England alive in the game. A stunning finish from outside the box, that kept his team in the competition.

07 JUL 2024
England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: Sweet Caroline blares in Dusseldorf!

Oh penalties, you cruel cruel thing!

Manuel Akanji was the only player who missed from the spot-kick, and the he's in tears because that was enough to decide the fate of the game. England clinical with their five kicks and onto another semi-final under Gareth Southgate. They have been scrutinised for their style of play, or lack thereof, but it won't matter to them now.

England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: Off we go to penalties

England with one last throw of the dice. Long ball hurled into the box, Ivan Toney positions himself but goes down all too easily inside the box. The ref isn't having it and calls it time in the Extra Time. Penalties it is then.

06 JUL 2024
England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: 109' | Shaqiri comes on

Switzerland make a change of their own. Breel Embolo, the goal scorer makes way for Xherdan Shaqiri. Is it too much to ask for a wonder-goal at this point? Not from this guy, one would think.

23:47 (IST)
06 JUL 2024

06 JUL 2024
England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: Halftime, ET

Luke Shaw tries to pick out Eberech Eze with a lofted pass forward. Schar intercepts and heads the ball back to Sommer. It’s half-time in extra time.

The first period of extra time wraps up without a goal, leaving just 15 minutes separating England and Switzerland from penalties. Southgate’s side look to have wrestled back some momentum, with Eze and Saka looking lively down the wings, but Switzerland’s organised shape and Sommer’s alert goalkeeping have left them frustrated. Just a quarter-hour to go until it comes down to spot-kicks!

England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: 91' | Schar's wayward cross

ENG 1-1 SUI

23:25 (IST)
06 JUL 2024
England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: Extra-time begins!

Switzerland get us underway in the extra-time, kicking from right to left. That Breel Embolo goal had looked just about enough to seal the game for the Swiss but out of nowhere came a Bukayo Saka stunner. 

Just like last night, this game seems more destined to be decided from the spot-kicks rather than another goal. But then again, crazier things have happened in the sport. 

ENG 1-1 SUI

23:20 (IST)
06 JUL 2024
England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: FULLTIME

England have thrown all their shirts back as Switzerland hold the ball outside the box, exchanging small passes, peeping an opening. It came. A cross from the right from Fabian Schar finds a couple of Swiss shirts at the far post but they are unable to latch onto it. 

And that will do for the 90 minutes. For the third quarter-final in a row, we will go into extra-time to seek a winner.

06 JUL 2024
England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: 84' | Another twist in the tale?

A game that was dead for three quarters has come alive in the last. Switzerland and England score one goal each in the space of five minutes. Is another goal coming our way to decide this game in the 90 minutes? Remember, both the quarter-finals yesterday went into extra time.

The Swiss attack down the left and the ball’s crossed towards Embolo at the far post. Luke Shaw leaps to head clear. Cole Palmer tries to break upfield but Silvan Widmer puts an illegal stop to his gallop. Yellow card.

ENG 1-1 SUI

England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: 80' | SAKA SCORES!

A STUNNER FROM OUTSIDE THE BOX!

Ecstatic scenes down the England goal, where the Swiss fans are seated. As it stands, their team are on their way to a first-ever Euros semifinal.

06 JUL 2024
England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: 53' | A silver lining for ENG

There is one silver lining for England. So far, they have managed to avoid Switzerland running the play, which they did so well against Italy, the defending champions in their Round of 16 game. For a team that looked second best against the likes of Slovakia and Slovenia (for much of the game), it's a positive, alright.

England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: 51' | First shot on target, at last

Would you believe it? We have our first shot on target after 50 minutes of play.

Embolo latches onto Freuler's pass to hit a slow, low shot that barely troubles Jordan. But hey, atleast Switzerland have registered a shot on target. England....

England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: Gentle reminder, from the Swiss

In their last three European Championships knockout matches, Switzerland have knocked out France (2021) and current holders Italy (2024), as well as almost beaten Spain on penalties (2021). England are in for quite the test.

22:26 (IST)

England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: Can Bellingham rescue ENG, again?

If not for the 21-year-old’s splendid, 95th-minute bicycle kick in the Round of 16 clash against Slovakia, a sub-par England would have been on the flight back home. The goal, his celebration, and the comeback it sparked only added to the hype around Bellingham.

I was more blown away with his intelligence of the game at 15. The know-how of it. His understanding of formations, where he needed to be, was astonishing,” says Paul Robinson, who was Birmingham City’s U-21 coach when Bellingham played there. (The makings of England's star boy, READ HERE)

England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: HALFTIME!

There was barely another minute added in that half as the referee blows for half-time. A bleak affair so far. England manager Gareth Southgate had sounded confident that his team would turn the page in the quarter-final. They've hardly tested the Swiss goalkeeper Yan Sommer. 

Switzerland, who were expected to be the more attacking team of the two in the opening minutes, had their share of chances but were unable to carve anything promising. 

ENG 0-0 SUI

06 JUL 2024
England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: 44' | Saka goes down, no penalty

Saka wriggles into the box on the right and Aebischer is unable to get hold of the Arsenal winger, who goes down but the referee isn't interested. Swiss skipper Granit Xhaka however, has done them a favor, making a timely block to Mainoo's shot at the end of the move. The resulting corner for England is short and doesn't test Sommer. 

ENG 0-0 SUI

England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: 40' | Nothing to separate the two

A delicately poised game with five minutes to go in the half, the outlook of the entire contest can change dramatically with a goal just ahead of the interval. Neither side have looked particularly like scoring from open play though, with a big role for set-pieces no doubt in store.

England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: 38' | Foden gives away the ball

As if England's attacking prowess wasn't under intense scrutiny, now their ball possession capability looks vulnerable. Phil Foden, making inroads in the attacking third, gives away the ball cheaply and Embolo breaks on counter. Thankfully for the Manchester City winger, it's cut short. 

ENG 0-0 SUI

22:09 (IST)
06 JUL 2024
England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: 36' | Sommer quick to read ENG's play

Saka cuts back onto his left foot on the right wing and curls a cross towards the penalty spot for Bellingham, who looks to jump over the ball to confuse Sommer. It’s a decent idea from the Real Madrid midfielder - marked closely by Akanji - but Sommer reads it the whole time and comes off his line to collect.

ENG 0-0 SUI

06 JUL 2024
England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: 32' | Cross into the top-tier

Switzerland on the offensive once again with those neat little exchanges and forward movement. Akanji opens up the pitch with a pass to the right flank but Schar is unable to deliver an accurate cross. Infact, his mishit may just have ended up in the top-tier at the Dusseldorf Arena.

England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: 30' | First booking of the game

Switzerland turn page to have their own moment with grounded passes being exchanged outside the opposition box. England manage to retrieve the ball without damage and Jude Bellingham is off on the counter. He just has one man on the left to beat and Schar decides to bring down the England midfielder. Takes one for the team as the referee reaches to his pocket. First booking of the game.

England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: 27' | ENG searching for an opening

Swiss shirts have been forced back for a prolonged passage of play. England converging outside the Swiss box in numbers, exchanging short passes, looking for that opening. But it hasn't come so far. They win a corner to the right. Maybe a dead-ball delivery is what will bring this game to life. 

SUI 0-0 ENG

21:57 (IST)
06 JUL 2024
England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: 24' | ENG squander free-kick

England win a free kick in a position of promise just outside the Swiss box on the inside-left. Bellingham is fouled, he has been England's most successful player at drawing the tackles this Euros. Phil Foden stands on the ball, but his free kick is overhit and Swiss will take the goal-kick. Yann Sommer might as well take a nap at this point. 

SUI 0-0 ENG

06 JUL 2024
England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: 22' | Kane, where are you?

Saka beats his man and sends a cross into the six-yard box, where there’s no sign of his captain, Harry Kane. It’s turned behind for a corner, from which nothing comes. For someone, who's made a career out of finding pockets of space, England's all-time leading goal-scorer has failed spectacularly to do so this summer. 

ENG 0-0 SUI

21:51 (IST)
06 JUL 2024
England vs Switzerland, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: 18' | SUI chance cut short by foul!

Switzerland at the other end create a promising opening. Freuler moves through midfield and plays a one-two pass with Embolo, breaking into the penalty area but concedes a needless free-kick - tugging Kyle Walker who was covering him.

Former coach on Jude Bellingham: ‘As a kid, he watched his dad get kicked all over the place’

On ITV’s This Morning show, a guest didn’t hold back when the possibility of Jude Bellingham being banned for England’s quarterfinals against Switzerland was discussed.

“UEFA’s headquarters are in Switzerland. If they ban Jude, we burn the place to the ground,” the guest fumed. His comment captured the mood of the nation days before the clash on Saturday night, especially about their undisputed star.

If not for the 21-year-old’s splendid, 95th-minute bicycle kick in the Round of 16 clash against Slovakia, a sub-par England would have been on the flight back home. The goal, his celebration, and the comeback it sparked only added to the hype around Bellingham. READ MORE
