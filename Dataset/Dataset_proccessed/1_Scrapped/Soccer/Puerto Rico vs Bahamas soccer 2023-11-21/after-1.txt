#THE SPIA 2023 Relays Challenge had some challenges at the start of the competition on Saturday, but it turned out to be a great day for the participants at the University of the Bahamas.

#Organiser Rashad Patton said they had to delay the start of the event because of the amount of water that had settled on the grass track from the downpour of the rain on Friday.

#But once they got started, the participants from the UB Mingoes track team, local track clubs and schools, raced under the adverse conditions and there were even some falls in the puddles, but it in no way diminished the level of competition.

#“It was a good experience to see in November where our athletes are at,” Patton said. “So we decided to invite some of the clubs to participate as well so that they can test their athletes.”

#Despite not drawing a larger crowd of teams, Patton said those who participated performed very well. “I’m really thankful to the teams who showed up and participated,” Patton said. “I was a little concerned because of the rain, but we still had some good performances out there today.”

#Teams competed in the 4 x 800, 4 x 600 and 4 x 500 metre relays in the open, under-17, under-15, under-13, under-11 and under-9 men and mixed divisions. Trophies and medals were awarded to the top performers. UB’s head coach Ednal Rolle, who also assisted in getting the meet off the ground, admitted that it was a rough start, but he too was pleased with what he saw.

#“I just wanted to see where they are. We have our timed trials next week, so I wanted to see how they would handle the relays,” he said. “My cross country team won the 4 x 800m and the mixed relay.

#“Our team is much stronger than last year. The 4 x 400m team should break the school record this year because I’m looking for them to do much better this year. A few of them are running on our cross country team. So we’re looking good.”

#The Mingoes men’s 4 x 800m team that dominated the event were Kenold Jewan, Dennis Williamson, Jackson Ozias and Lhevinne Joseph.

#After getting sidelined by the rain from Friday, Rolle said the track was a little flooded, so they had to delay the start just so that some of the water could subside.

#“But running events like this is all about the conditions on the course,” Rolle pointed out. “It was a good condition for the athletes to get in the challenge, so they had to run through it. So we’re pleased with the performances.”

#Andrew Tynes, coach of Swift Athletics, said they welcome any and every opportunity they get to compete under any condition.

#“This is November, so it’s good for us to take a look at them and to see how far they have come,” he insisted. “I was really grateful that they had this meet to compete in and the conditions on the grass is something that they have to get used to because if they get to go to college, they don’t know what conditions they have to compete under.”

#Cedricka,Rolle coach of the 3PA Stallions, in assessing her 3PA Stallions’ team performances, admitted that she got a good chance to view their level of fitness as they move forward.

#“We’re trying to get them prepared for an indoor meet in December in Ohio, so they are using these markers to know what we have to work on to get ready for that trip,” she insisted.

#Rolle was impressed with her athletes, particularly Jasmine Mackey (Carifta athlete in the 800 and 1,500m), Dahjia Mesidor (800m, shot put) and Zantea Ferguson (triple jump).

#Coach Clinton Smikle said his Quick Step Athletics’ team did what they had to do.

#“Our team performed very well. They are in pretty good shape and so going into the season, it was a good way for us to gauge what we are doing,” he said. “We have the Carifta trials coming up and so we want to get them ready for that.”

#His team consisted of Dillan Simon, Mario Miller, Clyde Richards and Yulianas Akompi.

#Coach Latoya Bain-Sturrup, who brought a number of her athletes from Claridge Primary, noted that her team did an excellent job.

#“It was a conditioning meet and some of the athletes are just getting in shape, so it showed where we’re at and what we need to work on,” Bain-Sturrup said. “So I was very pleased.

#“The kids also had fun and they competed against clubs and athletes who are always training, so I thought we had a wonderful time on Saturday. It was all about the kids being exposed to the UB track and to run against other clubs and schools. I was very pleased with their performances.”

#Here’s a look at the results posted by the various teams during the event:

#Men’s Open 4 x 800m relay – University of the Bahamas – 9:09.50; SPIA Track Club – 9:45.15.

#WHILE the ladies and men’s collegiate teams are in New Providence for the various basketball tournaments, Grand Bahama will showcase a number of visiting high school senior boys’ teams over the Thanksgiving weekend.

#The Tabernacle Baptist Academy/Dale Burns Thanksgiving Basketball Tournament, now in its 23rd year, will feature three high school teams from Grand Bahama against five visiting teams from the United States.

#The tournament will start on Wednesday and run through Saturday at St George’s High Gymnasium and, according to Norris Bain, the deputy director of sports in the Ministry of Youth, Sports and Culture, the event will give the island an economic boost this weekend.

#“We have the number one ranked school out of Georgia in Colombia High and the fifth ranked out of Georgia in 6A in Jonesboro,” Bain said. “They are two highly-ranked schools. We will also have a very good team in Oakridge High out of Tennessee.

#“So we will have some very good high school basketball competition here in Grand Bahama, while they have the college teams playing in New Providence.”

#The Ministry of Youth, Sports and Culture is partnering with Tabernacle Baptist to sponsor the tournament, which is expected to attract over 100 fans from the various schools coming in.

#With the three local teams participating, Bain said they anticipate that the fans will have an exciting four days of competition as the island tries to reclaim the title as the sporting capital of the Bahamas.

#“This will be a good test for the teams in Grand Bahama to see where they are because they will have some nationally ranked teams to compete against. This will also give the coaches the opportunity to match their skills against their American counterparts.”

#Bain, a former coach of Tabernacle and the men’s national team, said through the tournament, they hope that a few more players from Grand Bahama will be able to obtain athletic scholarships to attend colleges and universities in the United States.

#“This is a good opportunity for our boys to perform in front of some high level coaches and scouts, who are also expected to be in town to view the tournament,” Bain said.

#At the same time, Bain encouraged the residents of Grand Bahama to come out as they usually do to support the tournament and at the same time get to view some high level competition from the high school level.

#Stacked in pool A are Tabernacle Baptist Academy Falcons and St George’s Jaguars against visiting teams Columbus High and Lakeside High, both out of Georgia.

#In pool B are the Sunland Lutheran Stingers against the visiting Oakridge High out of Tennessee and both SouthWest Dekalb and Jonesboro High out of Georgia.

#Here’s a look at the schedule of games on tap:

#Wednesday’s schedule

#3:30 pm Jonesboro vs SouthWest Dekalb.

#4:30 pm Columbia vs St George’s.

BAYAMÓN, Puerto Rico — With The Bahamas senior men’s national soccer team in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, are two high school student-athletes, Nahum Johnson and Cameron Pratt, soaking up the experience of representing the country in the 2023 Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) Nations League competition.

Johnson is the youngest Bahamian to score a goal Nations League competition for The Bahamas. Pratt, the youngest player on the team, has been the number two goalkeeper in all of The Bahamas’ games this season as he patiently waits for his name to be called

“Playing against older players is good for younger players like me because of the challenge. It helps me to get better and I like the challenge so far. I hope it helps me get recognized and helps me in my career,” Johnson said.

Pratt, who is 17-years-old, said that it has been an unforgettable experience to be on the team and to represent his country.

“I learned a lot of new things. Although I am the youngest on the team, they handle me with care, how to play on and off the field. Being able to practice at a high level with goalkeeper coach Avery Kemp was beneficial for me. I was able to learn new things such as shot blocking, spatial awareness, goal awareness and communication on the field,” Pratt said.

Johnson plays the forward position and will never forget October 17, 2023 because he scored an equalizer goal for The Bahamas on that date, his first senior men’s goal for The Bahamas, giving the country its first point of the 2023-2024 Nations League competition. That goal came against Antigua and Barbuda.

“I was excited but I still had to stay focused because it was only the 81st minute of the game. When I scored that goal, my mind was blown away as I scored a goal to help my team at the age of 17. It was a great accomplishment. I want to score more goals to help my team,” Johnson said.https://77e4dc8d1da7fdfab1eb1e0e55736418.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-40/html/container.html

The Aquinas College grade 11 student says that he is looking to stay humble. He was to make his first start for the senior men’s program against Jamaica. There is a strong chance that Head Coach Nesly Jean and Assistant Coach Kevin Davies may give him a starting job against Puerto Rico today. The opportunity is something that he is thankful for, he said.

Pratt, who plays for Dynamos FC locally, has not played a minute in Nations League competition but he has been ready to hear the coaches call him into action.

“I stay ready at all times because the best goalkeeper will be on the field and something can happen. I always keep it in my head that I can go on the field and play. I do get disappointed when I don’t get to play in this or that game, but I look forward to the next game because I know that in practice if I keep my level up I can shock my coaches and may be I can get to play.”

The St. John’s College grade 11 student has been playing soccer since he was seven years old and credits his mother Deeian Pratt for getting him into the sport. Kemp played a role in him choosing to play that position. 

“My teacher, family and friends hold me to a high level of accountability. I still manage to put aside time to play and practice and still be able to stay on top of my school work,” Pratt stated.

He is looking to go to Europe to play soccer but playing for a college team is also on his radar.

For Johnson, who plays for Renegade FC locally, balancing between school and soccer has been something he has been able to do successfully. He said his teachers have helped him. Johnson is thankful for his mother Stacy Johnson for her dedication and support. He hopes to one day be a professional soccer player and he hopes to go off to school or to a soccer academy.https://77e4dc8d1da7fdfab1eb1e0e55736418.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-40/html/container.html

The match against Puerto Rico is set for this evening at the Estadio Juan Ramón Loubriel in Bayamón, Puerto Rico.

BAYAMÓN, Puerto Rico — The Bahamas senior men’s national soccer team experienced mental disorder recently as their match against Guyana was postponed twice over the weekend due to adverse weather and tragedy in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Head Coach for The Bahamas Nesly Jean said that they will now turn their attention to securing maximum points against Puerto Rico on Tuesday.

That game in the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) Nations League’s League B Group D division will be played at the Estadio Juan Ramón Loubriel in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, starting at 8 p.m.https://f6f6f0c4323eeaa8a450c6f7d4046184.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-40/html/container.html

“It’s an unfortunate situation that happened, but then again, we have to move on and try to get our mindset focused on different tactics on what we want to do against Puerto Rico,” he said.

This is indeed another key matchup for The Bahamas as they intend to bring three points back home, looking to avenge a 6-1 loss to Puerto Rico at the Thomas A. Robinson National Stadium in September.

“I think any match we play at the moment is important. This is our last two matches, so obviously we want to get the points. We want to move up in the group stage. The guys are really anxious to play, so let’s see what happens in Puerto Rico. Obviously they’re ready. We’re going to give 100 percent and try to get three points,” Jean said.

Puerto Rico is coming off a tough 3-2 victory over Antigua and Barbuda in Piggotts, Antigua and Barbuda, on Saturday. The Bahamas is well-rested, having not played on the weekend but Jean said he does not see it as an advantage as Puerto Rico is playing at home.

“They played at home and we were travelling. With all that was going on, officials were trying to figure out if you have a game or not, so guys were up pretty early, still trying to figure out if we’re playing or not. Guys didn’t really rest this morning, so I wouldn’t say we have an advantage. I would say going into the game, it’s quite even. We just got to go and perform. We just have to do our job to the best of our ability,” Jean said.https://f6f6f0c4323eeaa8a450c6f7d4046184.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-40/html/container.html

It has been a long five months for the players, having played in four matches and going through training. The Bahamas is a little banged up but having a physiotherapist with the team helps.

“Some of the guys had a few injuries, but of course, with a day off, it helps them to recover a little bit. Obviously, getting the physio, treating them as well, so that helps them in a way. Again, at this point, there are no excuses. It’s game time,” said Jean. “We just have to go and stick to the game plan and hopefully they play to their full potential.”

The team held its final practice yesterday afternoon, fine tuning for today’s match.

Bahamian Yolett ‘Coach Yo’ McPhee-McCuin, the women’s basketball head coach at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss), was determined to leave the country with a championship and her team made sure of that as they easily took care of the Michigan Wolverines in the championship game of the Bad Boy Mowers Battle 4 Atlantis (B4A) Women’s Basketball Tournament. The tournament wrapped up inside the Imperial Arena at the Atlantis Resort on Paradise Island, The Bahamas, on Monday, with the Ole Miss Rebels winning 60-49 over the Wolverines.

For McPhee-McCuin, it was her second title as women’s basketball head coach at Ole Miss.

Unlike their previous two games of the three-day tournament, playing every day, the Lady Rebels got out to a fast start on Monday and never looked back in the complete wire-to-wire performance. They led by as much as 20 points in the one-sided affair, coasting to the comfortable win.

“I knew they would be prepared and I knew they would be well-coached so for us, we wanted to win the first four minutes of the game and then go from there,” said McPhee-McCuin. “We wanted to send a message that we were here to win a championship. I felt like we were able to do that.”

The only setback in the game for the Lady Rebels was an injury sustained by starting point guard Kirsten ‘KK’ Deans. She went down with a knee injury at the 2:29 mark of the opening quarter, and tried to come back, but she had an obvious limp and was forced to sit out. Fortunately for the Rebels, her services won’t be needed as they controlled the game with their defense and their offense fed off that.

Marija Avlijas, who got most of the minutes in Deans’ absence, led the Rebels in scoring with 11 points, tournament Most Valuable Player (MVP) Madison Scott added 10 points and seven rebounds and Marquesha Davis and Silentianna ‘Snudda’ Collins scored nine apiece.

“‘KK’ is an important piece to what we have going on. It shook me up and it shook up the team, so this win, through adversity, will be one for the books,” said McPhee-McCuin. “We’re going to hope for the best with ‘KK’. We intend to rally around her and play Ole Miss basketball the rest of the way.”

Others were able to come in and stepped up in Deans’ absence, particularly Avlijas and fellow point guard Zakiya Stephenson.

“I was able to play 12 players today and that just shows our depth,” said McPhee-McCuin. “I’m using non-conference to develop the bench, to continue to develop continuity and chemistry in the team, discover our identity and be challenged like we were in this tournament and beyond. We can’t win a championship one through five, but we could win a championship one through fifteen. We have people who come off the bench who could start. Hopefully that gives them confidence to continue to build and accept their roles on this team.”

Laila Phelia led Michigan with 21 points. She was 4-for-18 from the field but made 11-for-12 from the free throw line. Jordan Hobbs had the second-most points for the Michigan starters with six. Wolverines’ Head Coach Kim Barnes Arico said it was a tough ending but they enjoyed themselves regardless.

“The tournament and the competition was amazing. It gave us an opportunity to play three days in a row which is going to be preparation for the Big Ten Tournament,” she said. “We couldn’t have asked for a better three days than obviously coming away with a win today. We really learned a lot about our team and this is going to give us an opportunity to go back home and work on some things. We are going to learn from this and we will be better because of it. The hospitality has been exceptional and the tournament was well ran. It’s been really beautiful and just phenomenal.”

Ole Miss defense was suffocating. They held an opponent to less than 50 points for the third time this season, and since the start of the 2021-22 season, Ole Miss has held eight Power Five opponents under 50 points.

They led 16-11 after one, 27-19 at the half and were up by as much as 20 points in the second half. Tyia Singleton made a layup just before the third-quarter buzzer to extend their lead to 48-30.

“I knew they were going to be disciplined and they wanted to play inside-out, so we had to make a decision as to where we wanted to dictate their offense,” said McPhee-McCuin. “We just tried to clog up the paint and make them kick it out and then we used our athleticism to contest shots. It took a team effort to get it done today because they are so good inside.”

Dancing to the beat of the goatskin drums, the blowing of the horns and clanging of the cowbells afterwards, the Bahamian sports legend said this is the feeling she came home to experience. Last year, she was unable to enjoy it like she wanted to as they fell short in the Baha Mar Hoops Pink Flamingo Championship inside the Baha Mar Convention Center at Baha Mar.

“I love junkanoo music and the fact that I couldn’t dance last year kept me up at night. This meant a lot,” McPhee-McCuin said. “The Bahamian people helped will us to a win today and for that we are grateful. It feels great to win. Inside, I am screaming with joy. It means a lot.”

Following their semifinal win over Arizona, McPhee-McCuin made a clarion call for the Bahamian people to come out and show them love and support in the championship game and they got just that. Students from a couple schools were in attendance as well as scores of other Bahamians.

Adorned in Bahari shirts for the duration of the tournament, she said she wanted to show her love and loyalty for The Bahamas and is always grateful for the support she receives.

“For me to be able to come home and do this hopefully provides inspiration for the youth,” said McPhee-McCuin. “I was born and raised in the 242 (The Bahamas) and to be able to go out and live a dream – play college basketball and have an opportunity to do what I’m doing, I hope that it provides inspiration. There are truly no ceilings as long as you have work ethic and keep God first and good people around you.” 

The Bahamian coach thanked the team at Battle 4 Atlantis and everyone who played a part in staging the three-day basketball tournament. The men’s Battle 4 Atlantis tournament will get underway tomorrow.

Ole Miss returns home for two games, hosting the University of Arkansas at Little Rock Trojans on Saturday and the University of Louisville Cardinals on November 29. Michigan will host the Eastern Michigan University Eagles on Friday and the Southern Illinois University (SIU) at Edwardsville Cougars on November 29.

BAYAMÓN, Puerto Rico — The Bahamas senior men’s national soccer team was in action last night against Puerto Rico in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, and like a vast majority of athletes, a pre-game routine is something that is almost innate for them.

Several players from Team Bahamas shared how they get ready for games on actual game day. They played at the Estadio de Juan Ramón Loubriel in the 2023 Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) Nations League in Bayamón last nigh

“I don’t have much of a routine, but I just relax and play some music – kompa music to get in a groove and keep my mind clear for the task at hand,” St. Fleur said.

One of the most vocal players on the team is Marcel Joseph. He missed the first window that included games against Puerto Rico and Guyana but he played in the next window and is available for this window.

“I love to play dancehall music to keep my energy up, and touching the ball during warm-up. Going through a routine before a game will help me stay focused,” he said.

Jean Tilo, who has his hair locked, was watching the humidity last night, trying to decide whether or not to put his hair in one. This is the second away game that he got to play in.

“I normally relax before a game. I play better when I am calm. I like to study my opponents play and I was able to watch Puerto Rico play to see where they can be exploited. I also listen to rap, dancehall and afrobeats to get me focused,” Tilo said.

The Bahamas’ leading goal scorer this season is Wood Julmis. He is a little different from Tilo, St. Fleur and Joseph.

“For me, I like to take a cold shower and relax. After a cold shower, I like to turn the hot water up and let the steam help me to focus,” Julmis said. He is a forward on the field and is hoping to score more goals so he can break out his celebration moves.

Jonathan Miller has been playing for The Bahamas since 2018. The 25-year-old said he ensures that he gets in enough water and listen to music.

“I try to zone out and visualize what I am going to do in the game and see what I need to work on. I look at the other team’s strengths and weaknesses and think about the next 90 minutes,” Miller said.

Ricardo McPhee, who plays midfield, said he does a lot of self-motivation and reflection before a game.

“That pre-game routine puts me in the right mindset and state of mind. I tell myself that is a beautiful day to play football and it gets me going,” McPhee said.

St. Fleur said that it is important to get relaxed and do whatever you have to do to get to that point before a game.

As a team, they pray in the huddle and have a little talk after the anthems are sung at the beginning of each game.

This was set to be the year that former junior national team standout Rhema Collins gets her feet wet with Yolett ‘Coach Yo’ McPhee-McCuin and the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) Rebels women’s basketball team, but that will have to take a backseat for now as she recovers from a concussion.

Still in concussion protocol, the talented freshman is looking forward to the day when she will step on the court in action for her new team, getting her collegiate career underway. Without her, the Rebels have raced to a start of five wins and one loss, falling just to the Oklahoma Sooners in the first week of the season. They won three games in three days at the Bad Boy Mowers Battle 4 Atlantis (B4A) Women’s Basketball Tournament, to cart off that title in the Imperial Arena at the Atlantis resort on Paradise Island, The Bahamas, on Monda

Collins, a 6’2” freshman forward, could be out of action until the start of conference play in January.

In the meantime, she said she will continue to work out in anticipation of getting stronger in time for her collegiate debut. She said it felt great being back in The Bahamas, cheering on her squad during the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament, and was also able to catch up with family and friends.

“I’m glad I came to Ole Miss. This is a once-in-a-lifetime

opportunity for me and it’s a good feeling. I feel comfortable. I feel at home,” she said. “I just plan on getting better and stronger. This concussion is a minor setback, but I know it will all work out in the end.”

Collins, 18, completed her high school career with The Webb School in Bell Buckle, Tennessee, helping the school win back-to-back Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (TSSAA) Division II-A state titles. This fall, she starts her journey with the Ole Miss Rebels after being recruited by five division one schools, albeit as a spectator for now. She will become the second Bahamian to play for McPhee-McCuin and the Rebels, following in the footsteps of Valerie Nesbitt who suited up for two seasons for the program.

“I’m very proud of this team (Ole Miss), we went through a lot of adversity. I’m just happy that we were able to pull through and I’m happy to be here,” she said.

The Bahamian spent a lot of time in the post in her junior career, but said McPhee-McCuin and the Rebels have plans to alter her game in college.

“‘Coach Yo’ and the program have a plan – that is for me to be a big guard, so I definitely have to improve my ball handling,” said Collins. “I knew from the beginning what they had planned. I know that she (McPhee-McCuin) will take care of me and put in the best position to succeed and be where I want to go. I’ve been working out, but I’m not able to do anything with contact at the moment. Right now, it’s just about taking small steps to see where I’m at, but I feel like I’ll be ready. I trust ‘Coach Yo’ and I trust what they have in store for me.”

At just 14, Collins represented The Bahamas at the 2019 Centrobasket Under-17 (U17) Women’s Championship, averaging a double-double in five games. She dropped in 11 points and added 10.8 rebounds and 0.8 assists per game.

Now a young lady, she is looking forward to starting her National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) journey, and said she couldn’t have asked for a better transition than joining McPhee-McCuin and the Ole Miss Rebels. The Rebels play out of a tough Southeastern Conference (SEC) in NCAA Division I women’s basketball.

They return home to the Sandy and John Black Pavilion at Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi, to host two games – taking on the University of Arkansas at Little Rock Trojans on Saturday and the University of Louisville Cardinals on November 29 – a team that eliminated them in the NCAA Sweet Sixteen a season ago.

The Rebels advancement to the Sweet Sixteen was their best finish in 16 years, and McPhee-McCuin and her team are looking for continued progression this year.

BAYAMÓN, Puerto Rico – Different day, same result.

It was not the way The Bahamas senior men’s national soccer team envisioned their match against Puerto Rico going last night as they fell 6-1 on a slippery field at the Estadio Juan Ramón Loubriel in Bayamón, Puerto Rico.

Playing at home for the first time in this edition of the Nations League, Puerto Rico pounced on The Bahamas in the second minute, going up 1-0 on a goal from Ricardo Rivera. He came back four minutes later and found the back of the net again.

“We started off very slow,” said Team Bahamas Head Coach Nesly Jean. “We had a game plan that we did not follow. We need to be more disciplined at this level. We explained to the guys that when we make mistakes we are going to get punished. It is a learning process for the guys. They are improving, but we need to get better moving forward.”

The Bahamas got used to the slippery grass and were able to defend the goal before Rivera struck again, completing a hat trick in the 19th minute to give his team a good cushion. Puerto Rico scored one more in the first half to go up 4-0, and the game began to get out of reach for The Bahamas.

Winger Marcel Joseph pulled The Bahamas back when he scored in the 53rd minute on a free kick. Joseph kicked the ball and Puerto Rican goalkeeper Joel Serrano saved it, or so he thought. The assistant referee who was closer to that play saw that Serrano caught the ball in the goal and awarded Joseph the goal. The goal was a good goal, but at the same time it was not impactful as Puerto Rico led 4-1 at that point.

“When I hit the ball and saw he stepped forward, I saw he caught it in the goal. I just wanted to hit the ball as hard as I could and luckily on a day like today, the ball went in. I am happy that it went in and I got myself a goal, but it is a goal that I am not satisfied with,” said Joseph who added that he would have liked it to come with a win.https://9aca1daf49dd432c78224e7be4ef4377.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-40/html/container.html

Puerto Rico scored two more goals – one in the 74th minute by Gerald Diaz and the other from Wilfredo Rivera three minutes later.

The loss has The Bahamas at the bottom of the group with one point and a 0-1-4 win/loss/draw record. Puerto Rico officially finished second in the group with 12 points and a 5-0 record. Guyana officially won the group after shutting out Antigua and Barbuda, 6-0, last night. The Bahamas still has a chance to stay in the group if they beat Guyana by two goals. A decision on when that game will be played will come at a later date.

Mississippi coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin with the trophy

#(AP) — Marija Avlijas scored 11 points, Madison Scott added 10 points and No. 24 Mississippi beat Michigan 60-49 on Monday in the Battle 4 Atlantis championship game – making coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin the first Bahamian to win the event.

#Ole Miss (5-1) held an opponent to less than 50 points for the third time this season. Since the start of the 2021-22 season, Ole Miss has held eight Power Five opponents under 50 points.

#The Rebels led 27-19 at halftime after shooting 50% from the field. Michigan was just 4-of-27 shooting (15%) in the half but scored nine points at the free-throw line to stay close. Tyia Singleton made a layup just before the third-quarter buzzer to extend Mississippi’s lead to 48-30.

#Marquesha Davis and Snudda Collins each scored nine points for Ole Miss. Scott, who secured her 24th career double-double against Arizona on Sunday, was named the tournament MVP.

#Laila Phelia led Michigan (4-1) with 21 points. She was 4 of 18 from the field but made 11 of 12 free throws. Jordan Hobbs had the second-most points for the Michigan starters with six. Cameron Williams had a team-high eight rebounds.

#Ole Miss returns home for two games, hosting Little Rock on Saturday and Louisville on Nov. 29. The second game is a rematch of the 2023 Sweet 16 in the inaugural ACC/SEC Challenge.

#The University of Mississippi Ole Miss Rebels are headed to their first Battle 4 Atlantis finals after completing a 9-point comeback victory against the University of Arizona Wildcats at the Imperial Arena, Paradise Island, in the Bad Boy Mowers Battle 4 Atlantis women’s semifinals yesterday.

#The Ole Miss Rebels dropped the Wildcats 56-47 over the weekend to make their debut in the final round.

#The Southeastern Conference (SEC) National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) D1 team is slated to face the University of Michigan Wolverines in the championship game today at noon.

#The third women’s basketball tournament got off to a rousing start for the Ole Miss Rebels, led by Grand Bahama native Yolett ‘Coach Yo’ McPhee-McCuin, on Saturday where they knocked off the Howard University Bison in the tourney opener 67-54. Following this showing in game one, they reeled off a gritty win in the semifinals against the Wildcats who came into the matchup sporting a 5-0 win/loss record. Coach Yo, who was overjoyed to be back on home soil, credited the come-from-behind victory to a last minute defensive change in preparation for yesterday’s semifinals against the Wildcats.

#“I was so proud of our team, they really just believed in our game plan that we just put in, in the wee hours of the night. My heart was like you need to play zone and that is what our culture is about, the four ins – believe in, buy in, lock in and be all in – and that is what you saw,” the Grand Bahamian said.

#Over the weekend, it was a common theme for the Ole Miss Rebels to get off to a sluggish start on offence in the first half but ramp up their intensity on defence in the second half.

#Coach Yo’s team stayed true to the narrative against the Wildcats, who they trailed 22-16 to conclude the first half of the semifinals. Within the first two quarters, the Wildcats ran out to their biggest lead of the game, 11, at the 4:13 mark in the second period to take charge against the no.23 ranked team.

#However, after the halftime break the momentum shifted in favour of the Ole Miss Rebels. Forward Marquesha Davis was electric and turned in a game-high 17 points, complemented by six rebounds and two steals. Davis shot an efficient 7-for-11 on a 63 per cent shooting clip from the field.

#Madison Scott was also instrumental for the Ole Miss Rebels, putting up her second consecutive double-double in two days with 10 points and 11 rebounds.

#In the third period, Coach Yo’s women’s team turned up the heat on offence and defence. They opened the quarter on a 13-0 run to secure their first lead of the bout and clamped down defensively to stall the Wildcats offence for almost six minutes.

#At the end of the third quarter, they outscored the Wildcats 25-11 and were in the driver’s seat 41-33 headed into the final segment of the game.

#Coach Yo talked about her message and adjustment to the team’s strategy during the halftime break.

#“That was the biggest team we have seen this season and we were trying to play their game because that is our game getting to the paint, and creating fouls but they were so big and long that they were dominating us and it kind of got us rattled.

#“We made adjustments to open up the floor for our team because they were so big. Usually when someone is big, laterally they are not as good.

#“Our zone held up that we just put in place last night, and we were able to get in the paint and create offence from our defence because they were missing in the zone and we were able to get out in transition,” the head coach said.

#The Rebels bested the Wildcats in the paint 32 to 26. Additionally, they earned 12 points from fastbreak opportunities compared to eight from their opponents.

#Despite it being an ugly offensive game for both teams, with both squads shooting under 40 per cent, the Ole Miss Rebels now have their sights set on the 4-0 Wolverines.

#The latter solidified their finals spot after defeating the South Dakota Coyotes 70-52 for an 18-point win yesterday.

#Coach Yo was ecstatic for the Rebels to hold a spot in the championship game and she is expecting big results from her team today. “We like to win so we want to win a championship, that is something as a staff we promise our players and that is something I know team 49 really wants. It will be huge for our programme, continue to help our numbers in the net, and give our team something to be proud of,” she said.

#As previously mentioned, the Michigan Wolverines and Ole Miss Rebels battle for championship bragging rights today at noon in the Imperial Arena, Paradise Island.
