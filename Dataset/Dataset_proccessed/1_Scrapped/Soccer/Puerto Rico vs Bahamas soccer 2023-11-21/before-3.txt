Why do you love entrepreneurship? For me, it’s the freedom to choose who I spend each day with, and how I spend my time. It’s what I make of it. Whether it’s a massive success or a massive failure, I like knowing that it’s all on me. I love the challenge of taking on the “impossible”, because I love finding ways to innovate and taking on things that have never been done before. The amount of risk I’ve taken on throughout my career would shock most people, but I do this because the reward can be so high. I just absolutely love bringing good people together, to innovate and make each project a success. I’m looking forward to sharing my stories of all the ups and downs, and I hope that they will bring some value to some people. #entrepreneurship #thehobby #stories #innovation #risk #reward #passion #cardcollector #sportscards #m1nt #m1ntaverse #fyp

For decades, I’ve been frustrated with the dated and tacky protection and display options in the hobby. It’s time to give the cards the dignity they deserve. I’m excited to finally introduce my company M1NT, which is focused on protecting, preserving and presenting collectibles through cutting-edge design and high-grade materials. I look forward to all of you joining us on this journey as I share so much more about the company and where all of this is headed!   It’s time to upgrade our hobby.

I never asked for investment while building Sixtus; I told people what I was doing and investors came to me. The year 2009 was ripe for innovation, especially in tourism and entertainment, and I had a plan to make meaningful change. When you're focused, persistent, and working on an idea that challenges the status quo, people will see its potential and want to be part of your journey. #innovation #investors #entertainment #tourism #entrepreneurship #fyp

Nothing fuels me more than hearing those two words: it’s impossible. In 2009, I was on a mission to create the first American-produced show for broadcast in China, and was ready to do whatever it took to make it happen. I was beyond determined to make my dream a reality. But nothing could have prepared me for this massive embezzlement—especially by someone I considered a friend. For the full story, tune in to episode 2 of my podcast, @Car Policy #tvshow #entrepreneurship #stories #embezzlement #fyp

This guy has the luckiest hands! He pulls nothing but relics! Need a breaker? He might just be your guy. 😂 Filmed two years ago at Wrigley Field in Chicago—what an incredible stadium! Definitely one of my favorites in the country. #baberuth #relic #baseballcards #cardcollector #sportscards #nostalgia #fyp
