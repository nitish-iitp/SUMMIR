Save for Christmas Morning 💫✨ this 5 ingredient monkey bread is sooo good! ♥️ we absolutely love this monkey bread year round! I used brown and white sugar, but typically I just buy coconut sugar and use it for both which makes it only 4 ingredients. We prefer coconut sugar since it’s lighter! 🎁 Ingredients: 2 cans of southern style Pillsbury biscuit dough 2 tsp cinnamon 1/2 c of white sugar ( I usually scale back on the sugar do almost a full 1/2 cup) The glaze on top: 1/2 cup of brown sugar 3/4 cup butter Directions: 1. preheat oven to 350 2. In a Bundt pan, spray well. Cut biscuit dough into quarters. Mix together cinnamon and white sugar. Dip generously each biscuit piece with the sugar cinnamon mixture. Place in the pan. 3. Whisk together in a separate bowl brown sugar and melted butter. Add glaze on top before baking. 4. Bake at 350 for 25-30 mins, depending on your oven. #christmas #christmasbreakfast #monkeybread #christmasbrunch #EasyRecipe #easybreakfast #brunchideas #holidayparty #holidaybrunch #holidaybreakfast #monkeybreadrecipe #christmasbaking #christmasrecipe #christmasmorning #christmasideas #brunchideas

This was a hit! I left the pumpkin spice out and added about 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice for some zing. It was a hit at my Friendsgiving party! Definitely gonna do this again next year!
