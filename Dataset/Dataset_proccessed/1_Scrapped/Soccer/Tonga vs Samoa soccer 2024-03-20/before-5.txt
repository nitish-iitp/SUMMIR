Is anyone e else having issues with the Mossberg Forum? I attempted to join, as I own an MVP LR in 5.56NATO. Nope. The site claims my email 'resembles SPAM'. I've gotten ZERO responsw from the admins, even though 'they' encouraged me to contact them. Jeeeez....

I don't know about that specific site, but some forums do not allow you to sign up when using a free email provider to do so, like Gmail.

Yeah, I don't really feel any need to talk to people about my 930 SPX. It functions, and I shoot it maybe 2-3 times a year. Definitely not forum worthy.

Will be interesting to see how this shakes out long term as many ISP's are no longer hosting their own email and having users migrate to yahoo and gmail.

Still ZERO response or rational explanation from mossbergowners.com's admins. Not only won't they respond, but I am totally blocked from even reading the site's material.

I have the 590A1 SPX in 12 ga (with bayonette.) I shoot slugs and it does what I need it to do. At 25 yards or so, it makes really big holes. About the only time I am actually going to use shot is on eastern spring turkey.

The Mossberg 500 is the best pump shotgun ever! Change my mind.

I'll take my 80s Wingmaster that I rebuilt into a tac shotgun any day over a clunky shitty 500 action.

Also the 590 exists.

The old wingmasters are way better than any 500 or the 870 express garbage.
