Combination Eyewash Shower Station: What It Is and How It Works

A combination eyewash shower station is a critical safety feature in industrial environments, designed to offer immediate decontamination relief to individuals exposed to hazardous substances. This integrated unit combines a high-volume emergency shower with a dedicated eyewash station, allowing for simultaneous or separate use depending on the severity of the exposure. Upon activation, the eyewash dispenses a gentle yet steady stream of water to flush out contaminants from the eyes, while the overhead shower provides a robust flow to cleanse the entire body, mitigating injury risks and facilitating rapid first aid response in emergencies.

 

Combination Station vs. Separate Emergency Showers and Eyewash Stations

Opting for a combination eyewash and shower station offers a space-saving solution, integrating two essential safety functions into one unit. This not only conserves valuable floor space but also enhances accessibility, ensuring that affected individuals can simultaneously receive comprehensive decontamination. Compared to separate installations, combination stations facilitate quicker response times during emergencies, reducing the potential for injury and improving overall workplace safety.

 

Features to Consider Before Choosing a Combination Eyewash and Shower Station

When selecting a combination eyewash and shower station, consider the unit's compliance with safety standards, materials’ resistance to hazardous substances, flow rate consistency, and adaptability to specific industrial needs, ensuring a reliable and effective emergency response solution.

Appropriate Model for Type of Hazards Present

The specific hazards in a workplace, such as exposure to chemicals, particulates, or biological agents, dictate the necessary features of an eyewash shower station. For example, environments with volatile chemicals may require stations made from materials resistant to corrosion and chemical damage, while areas with particulate hazards might need units with specially designed eye wash nozzles to ensure thorough cleansing.

Material and Construction

The durability and chemical resistance of an eyewash shower station are critical for ensuring long-term functionality and safety. Materials such as stainless steel or chemically resistant plastics are preferred for their ability to withstand harsh substances and environmental conditions. The construction should also prevent rust and corrosion, ensuring the station remains operational and safe to use even in aggressive environments.

Flow Rate and Water Pressure

Adequate flow rate and water pressure are essential for effective decontamination, providing enough fluid to thoroughly flush out contaminants from the eyes and body. ANSI standards typically require that eyewash stations deliver at least 0.4 gallons per minute for 15 minutes, and shower units should provide at least 20 gallons per minute, ensuring a consistent and adequate flow to remove hazardous substances effectively.

Availability of Tepid Water

Providing tepid water, typically between 60°F and 100°F, is crucial to prevent thermal shock or hypothermia during decontamination, especially when the affected individual is exposed for an extended period. Tepid water also encourages victims to complete the full recommended flushing time, as extremely cold or hot water can be uncomfortable or even harmful, potentially exacerbating injuries or discouraging thorough decontamination.

Ease of Use

For effective emergency response, an emergency shower eyewash station must be user-friendly. Features like simple activation mechanisms and adjustable components ensure quick and efficient operation, which is crucial for mitigating injury during critical moments.

Maintenance and Inspection

Regular maintenance and inspection of emergency eyewash and safety shower stations are imperative to ensure operational readiness. Choose a station that is easy to maintain when it comes to checking flow rates, cleanliness, and mechanical integrity to guarantee the reliability and effectiveness of the emergency response equipment.

Types of Hazards and Facilities That Need Emergency Eyewash and Safety Shower Station

Emergency eyewash and safety shower stations are essential in facilities handling chemicals, corrosives, or hazardous materials, like laboratories, manufacturing plants, and construction sites. They are crucial in areas where the risk of exposure to toxic substances, flammable liquids, or corrosive chemicals is high. Industries such as pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and agrochemicals, where employees work with or around hazardous liquids and materials, necessitate these safety installations to provide immediate decontamination and mitigate the risks of serious injuries or chemical burns.

 

Understanding OSHA and ANSI Regulations

OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) and ANSI (American National Standards Institute) regulations mandate stringent guidelines for eyewash shower stations. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.151(c) enforces workplace safety, requiring accessible emergency equipment for quick drenching or flushing of the eyes and body when exposed to injurious corrosive materials. It should follow ANSI Z358.1 standards that provide details for the design, installation, and performance. Compliance ensures that stations are optimally located, properly maintained, and capable of delivering the required water flow for effective decontamination, minimizing the severity of chemical exposures and injuries.

Eyewash Shower Station Requirements 
Accessibility: Stations must be easily accessible, within 10 seconds or 55 feet of hazard exposure areas, with a clear path free of obstructions.
Identification: Stations should be clearly marked with visible signage to facilitate quick identification in an emergency.
Water flow and pressure: Must meet ANSI minimum flow requirements of 0.4 gallons per minute for eyewashes and 20 gallons per minute for showers, with water pressure sufficient to sustain this flow.
Water quality: Water used in the stations must be clean and safe for flushing eyes and skin, free from contaminants and at a tepid temperature (60°F to 100°F).
Operation: Stations must have stay-open valves to ensure they remain activated without the user's hands, providing at least 15 minutes of continuous water flow.
Maintenance: Regular inspection, testing, and maintenance must be conducted to ensure operational readiness and compliance with safety standards. 
Training Employees for Emergency Response

Training employees on the proper use of the emergency eyewash and safety shower station is crucial for ensuring an effective response to chemical exposures. Workers should be familiar with the location and operation of the stations, including how to quickly activate the flow of water. Regular drills and training sessions help reinforce the importance of immediate action following exposure, improve response times, and ensure that all staff are prepared to handle emergencies safely and efficiently.

 

FAQs
How to use eyewash and shower station?
