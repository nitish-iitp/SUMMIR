BC Rangers played against Eastern at Mong Kok Stadium for the Hong Kong Premier League Cup 3rd Place Playoff. BC Rangers defeated Eastern by 3:0

BC Rangers clinched the third place in the HKPLC Cup with a dominant 3:0 victory over Eastern at Mong Kok Stadium.

Eastern threatened early on in the 12th minute, as Wong Ho Chun fired a powerful shot that tested BC Rangers' goalkeeper but failed to find the back of the net.

BC Rangers gradually gained control of the game and showcased their prowess in the 14th minute when Kanda Yumemi's corner kick was met by Lau Chi Lok's head pass towards the goalmouth, but Umeofia’s header was denied by a brilliant save from the Eastern goalkeeper.

However, BC Rangers broke the deadlock just four minutes later. Kanda Yumemi was fouled inside the box by Lam Chin Yu, leading to a penalty kick. Au Yeung Yiu Chung confidently stepped up and fired the ball home with a ferocious strike , giving BC Rangers a well-deserved 1:0 lead.

In the 30th minute, BC Rangers showcased their attacking prowess once again with a well-coordinated team play. Au Yeung Yiu Chung played a delightful pass to Lo Kwan Yee, who intelligently flicked the ball into the path of Umeofia. Umeofia calmly slotted the ball into the net, extending BC Rangers’ lead to 2:0.

Eastern had a chance to pull one back before halftime when Wong Ho Chun's corner kick found Wong Ho Yin, but his powerful header rattled the crossbar. BC Rangers entered the break with a comfortable 2:0 advantage.

Although Eastern regained some control of the ball in the second half, they struggled to create meaningful scoring opportunities. In the 60th minute, Ng Yu Hei's shot from the edge of the box was easily gathered by the goalkeeper.

BC Rangers sealed the victory in the 87th minute through a fantastic individual effort. Chan Yiu Cho Joe shook off the opposition's defender and delivered a precise pass to substitute Leung Hoi Chun. Leung exhibited great composure as he unleashed a thunderous left-footed strike from outside the box, finding the bottom corner of the net to make it 3:0 in favor of BC Rangers.

Both teams failed to find the back of the net in the remaining minutes, and BC Rangers ultimately emerged victorious with a convincing 3:0 win over Eastern, securing the third-place finish in the HKPLC Cup.
