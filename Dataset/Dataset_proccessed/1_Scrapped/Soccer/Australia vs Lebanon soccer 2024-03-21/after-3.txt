Match report

Here is Joey Lynch’s report from CommBank Stadium in Parramatta:

Australia has now played three games on the road to the 2026 Fifa World Cup. They have emerged triumphant in all three games and after their 2-0 win over Lebanon, they already have one foot in the third round of Asian World Cup qualifying. But the victory over the Cedars in Sydney’s West has extracted a significant price on Graham Arnold’s side.

Summary
Jonathan Howcroft

Thank you for joining me tonight. We’ll be back here to do it all again on Tuesday, this time for a Lebanon “home” fixture from Canberra. I’ll see you then.

It devolved into a tricky game to appraise. For the first half-hour or so Australia looked well drilled, urgent, and worth their 1-0 lead. But as the game wore on the Socceroos lost their rhythm and Lebanon grew in belief. By the end the visitors were the more likely side to score.

Despite bossing possession the Socceroos created few clear chances and there was no shortage of fortune about both goals. Adam Taggart will be disappointed with his night’s work after being repeatedly caught offside and failing to execute an assured first touch as shooting opportunities unfolded.

Ajdin Hrustic shone amongst the chaos, but his free roaming role drifting in from the right played its own part in the unstructured second half, one in which Keanu Baccus was increasingly isolated at the base of midfield. Earlier injuries to Riley McGree and Jordy Bos disrupted what was already an experimental line-up.

“We can do better,” bemoans Connor Metcalfe immediately after the final whistle. Adding, “sloppy… individual errors… it’s not easy switching between systems.”

Full-time: Australia 2-0 Lebanon

Much to Australia’s relief, the referee blows the whistle for full-time. Two-nil, three points, three wins from three in this stage of qualifying, but that was not a convincing performance from the Socceroos.

90+5 mins: Darwich takes it – and it draws a tremendous diving save from Ryan away to his left. Lebanon keep the ball alive and the cross is hurled over for Lajud to glance wide!

90+4 mins: Handball against Hrustic right on the edge of Australia’s box. Lebanon with a decent set-piece opportunity to snatch a consolation goal.

90+3 mins: Australia’s inability to retain possession in midfield has become a chronic issue late in the game. Better opposition would have punished them for it by now.

21 Mar 2024
07.05 EDT

90+2 mins: Just five minutes of stoppage time for Australia to navigate and they can look ahead to Tuesday’s return fixture.

07.04 EDT

90+1 mins: The corner is dangerous but Matar does well to punch the second effort clear. Baccus keeps the opportunity alive and eventually Metcalfe drills a sweetly struck effort straight at the keeper.

07.03 EDT

90 mins: Irvine has a clear sight of goal running with the ball into the penalty area, but his sidef-ooted effort is deflected wide of the post and out for a corner.

88 mins: Iredale has a decent shot from range that’s saved comfortably. Australia haven’t had too many efforts on goal tonight.

Share
21 Mar 2024
07.00 EDT

85 mins: Superb lone-striker play from Duke, leaping to win the clearance then finding Metcalfe with the second ball, but the cross is poor and cleared easily. Lebanon are playing with belief now. Probably too little too late, but they’re making Australia scrap in these closing stages.

Share

06.58 EDT

83 mins: That was a major scare for Australia who have lost control of the physical and tactical battle in the past 10-15 minutes. Lebanon’s substitutes have made an impact and the stop-start nature of the game has robbed the Socceroos of any fluidity.

06.56 EDT

81 mins: Australia break out of defence but Irvine doesn’t free Hrustic bursting through the middle. Instead the skipper retains possession and the ball is rolled across the Socceroos defence… but Burgess takes his eye off the ball and red shirts swarm around him. Lebanon have numbers, and fashion a chance for Lajud – who curls an effort against the inside of Ryan’s near post! So so close for the visitors.

06.53 EDT

79 mins: Decent effort from Lebanon who work the ball out of congestion on the right for Lajud to have a lash on goal but his swipe skews well wide.

74 mins: Gorgeous outside-of-the-left-boot flick from Hrustic into the right channel, but Duke is offside in pursuit of it. There is a touch of class in the playmaker that nobody else in Australia is currently capable of. If the Socceroos are to progress against better opponents Arnold is going to need to figure out a formation that allows Hrustic to flourish.

73 mins: Ryan finds Atkinson with an early throw but the fullback eschews the angled run of Duke in favour of a long hopeful whack to the isolated Metcalfe. Lebanon clear.

71 mins: News from ptichiside is that Jordy Bos’s knee injury doesn’t appear too serious, which is excellent to hear. Meanwhile the scrappiness continues out on the field.

69 mins: Australia have lost those patterns of play that served them so well in the first half. The game is becoming increasingly fractured and reliant on individual moments.

67 mins: It’s subs o’clock in Parramatta with both sides making changes. The Socceroos elect to replace their forward line with Duke and Iredale coming on for Yengi and Taggart. While for Lebanon Hassan Maatouk is replaced by Daniel Lajud.

66' | Substitution: Our final changes.

65 mins: Australia finally find some timing and isolate Metcalfe one-on-one on the left. He goes outside his marker but then overhits his cross.

06.38 EDT

64 mins: It’s all got a bit scrappy again with neither side able to assert any control in midfield.

21 Mar 2024
06.36 EDT

61 mins: Well, Martin, it very nearly did! From a very narrow angle Ryan is forced into his first acrobatic save of the night, forcing the ball clear at full stretch from a fierce Tneich drive.

Nathaniel Atkinson is then booked for making slight contact in midfield. Lebanon’s propensity to go to ground is not endearing them to me.

Share
21 Mar 2024
06.33 EDT

60 mins: Cometh the hour, cometh the man. That man is Martin Turnbull: “Not a bad game to date. Shame about Bos. Lebanon are an extremely limited side. Hope that doesn’t come back to bite me!”

21 Mar 2024
06.33 EDT

58 mins: As if scripted, another example materialises when Hrustic conjures an impudent flick on the edge of the box to unpick the Lebanon defence, but Taggart is not alert to the moment and his touch evades him yet again.

Share
21 Mar 2024
06.32 EDT

56 mins: Lebanon will have to come out of their shell now and allow Australia more room to play. Hrustic anticipates just that and picks out the running Taggart (onside this time) but the striker’s layoff to Atkinson misses its target. Taggart has got through a power of work tonight but his touch has been found wanting often.

GOAL! Australia 2-0 Lebanon (Rowles, 54)

And from the resulting corner Australia go 2-0 up! The corner to the near post comes off a bundle of bodies and drops to the feet of Kye Rowles. He swings a left boot at the ball like a novice golfer might a driver, and he makes solid enough connection to slice the ball awkwardly in off the near post.

Share
21 Mar 2024
06.27 EDT

53 mins: Haidar wins a free-kick on halfway on the left but instead of turning it into an attack the ball is played all the way back to the goalkeeper. The Socceroos pounce, force the turnover and Irvine has a snapshot deflected into the side-netting.

51 mins: Australia have dominated possession since the break, calmly keeping the ball out of Lebanon’s reach. For the time being the Cedars are happy to sit in and hold their shape.

49 mins: … once more for luck! Hrustic to Taggart through on the goal but there’s no end product because the forward didn’t bend his run enough before accepting possession. Three near identical incidents in a matter of seconds.

49 mins: Hrustic again, switching from touchline to touchline to open the play and find Metcalfe, then slipping Taggart through with a delightful pass only for the Perth Glory striker to be caught offside.

06.20 EDT

47 mins: Hrustic is quickly into the game, drifting in from the right and lofting a cross that almost reaches the poised Yengi.

Half-time: Australia 1-0 Lebanon

The Socceroos take a slender lead into the break. Their performance has been bright and energetic but they have created very little in front of goal for all their endeavour. The first-half headline may yet prove to be the injuries to McGree and Bos that forced both left-sided attackers off the field.

40 mins: Chaaban goes down theatrically in the box, but there’s nothing doing. Then the follow-up shot needs saving low to his left by Ryan. Lebanon’s first look at goal for the night.

Meanwhile, Bos is back down on the turf shaking his head. That knee injury looks to be forcing him off.

38 mins: … not just into the fray but whipping in a gorgeous left-footed cross from the touchline that is begging to be thumped home by either striker, only for it to evade both Taggart and Yengi.

36 mins: But Arnie will not be happy to see another left-sided attacker down injured. Bos landed heavily in a shoulder-to-shoulder clash in the left corner and at first it looked like he could have done himself a serious mischief, but he’s eventually back to his feet and into the fray.
