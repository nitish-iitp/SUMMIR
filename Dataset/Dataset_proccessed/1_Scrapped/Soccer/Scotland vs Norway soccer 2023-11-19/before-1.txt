Scotland Euro 2024 qualifying: Group, fixtures, results & where to watch
Scotland
European Championship

Everything you need to know about Scotland's European Championship qualification campaign.

Having failed to make it to the 2022 World Cup, Scotland have recovered in style and have qualified for Euro 2024 with two games to spare courtesy of Spain's 1-0 win over Norway in mid-October.

Having claimed five wins from their opening six games, the Scots currently trail Spain on goal difference but Norway, five points adrift with just one game remaining, cannot overtake either side in Group A.

Euro 2024 qualifying began in March 2023 with the group stage running until late November 2023.

Scotland's first games were at Hampden Park against Cyprus and Spain on March 25 and 28 respectively. The Tartan Army kicked off with an emphatic win over Cyprus and followed it up with a surprise 2-0 victory against Spain.

Then in June, Scotland pulled off a narrow victory away to Norway on the 17th, with goals from Lyndon Dykes and Kenneth McLean cancelling out Erling Haaland's penalty. They defeated Georgia 2-0 three days later and then brushed aside Cyprus 3-0 with goals from Scott Mctominay, Ryan Porteous, and John McGinn guiding them to victory.

Their first defeat in the qualifying campaign came against Spain on October 12 when they lost 2-0 to La Furia Roja, whose subsequent 1-0 win over Norway guaranteed Steve Clark's side a top-two finish in Group A, and a confirmed ticket to the European Championship finals in Germany next year, with two games to spare.

Scotland have just one game left after their 2-2 draw against Georgia as Napoli forward's Khvicha Kvaratskhelia scored a magnificent brace but goals from Scott Mctominay and Lawrence Shankland in the second-half equalised the billing for the visitors. Scotland host Norway next as they conclude their Euro 2024 Qualifying campaign.
