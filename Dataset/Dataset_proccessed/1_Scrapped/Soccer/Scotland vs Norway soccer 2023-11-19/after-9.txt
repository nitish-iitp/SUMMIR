What does it all mean?

Two more nights of qualifiers to come but:

Via ESPN’s Dale Johnson: “Qualified automatically: Belgium, France, Portugal, Spain, Scotland, Turkey, Austria, England, Hungary, Slovakia, Albania, Denmark, Netherlands, Romania, Switzerland, Serbia.”

That leaves four automatic places still to be won across the final round.

There are three playoff paths through the UEFA Nations League - A, B and C.

From tonight’s Group A conclusion

Georgia are guaranteed to take part in the UEFA Nations League C playoff path.

Cyprus and Norway have been eliminated.


From tonight’s Group J conclusion:

Luxembourg will be in the UEFA Nations League C playoffs.

Iceland have a chance of a place in the UEFA Nations League B playoff path.

Bosnia and Herzegovina will take part in the UEFA Nations League B path.

Scotland captain John McGinn spoke to Viaplay: “The main thing is we’re going to Germany. There was a lot said about Erling Haaland and Martin Odegaard missing, but we had a lot missing tonight too.

“Qualifying the last time was incredible. This time has been strange. It’s not like us to qualify early.”

An entertaining old stramash and that’s the end of it. Steve Clarke’s men already had the job done, and they didn’t manage to top the group or claim a top-seed place but still, they were able to let their hair down. Just 200 days until the finals now in Germany and Scotland will be there.

Scotland 3-3 Norway: A Sander Berge fouls means the Scots can get the ball launched into the opposing area. Nothing doing, and the clock ticks on towards a draw. This would be only the third draw at Hampden in 19; they’ve won 15. A fortress.

Gavi suffers serious knee injury?

One of the game’s great talents looks to have suffered an untimely injury. Think I am correct in saying it was a surprise he started against Georgia.

🚨🇪🇸 Initial tests completed by Spanish national team showing a “major knee injury” for Pablo Gavi.

More tests will follow in the next 24h to clarify his conditions…

Spain v Georgia:

Minute 20-23: Gavi seems to suffer a knee injury, tries to get back onto the pitch, but injures it again(?). Is subbed off.

Minute 55: Ferran Torres scores, celebrates by holding up Gavi's shirt.

I assume they have gotten some bad news from the medics pic.twitter.com/nunn9f3wmX

Goal! Scotland 3-3 Norway (Elyououssi, 87)

It had been coming, in truth, and it came down the left-hand side of the Scottish team, a beaut of a cross from Ryerson and the former Southampton man, Zander Clark out of the picture nods in.

Scotland 3-2 Norway: Gerry Scott gets in touch: “Simon McMahon is entirely correct on the subject of Flower of Scotland. I suggest Lloyd I’m Ready to be Heartbroken by Camera Obscura as the replacement.”

Pat Nevin likes this.

Simon McMahon is back: “Chris McMillan is right, though that particular anthem was indelibly linked to the whole Euro 20/21 experience, even if it has endured beyond. What next years anthem, official or unofficial, will be I’m not sure. Though it won’t be better than this.

Scotland 3-2 Norway: Good save by Clark from a Thorsvedt header. Norway have really come at them since those subs. Zander Clark did very well to make the save.

Scotland 3-2 Norway: Worry for Villa fans as John McGinn goes down. He looks in some pain. A knee problem? He’s limping but as Ryan Jack is brought on for him he jogs off looking a bit happier with life. What a campaign he’s had.

Scotland 3-2 Norway: There was a lengthy VAR check of what a was a perfectly decentr and very good goal. Norway had time to make two subs as the refs dithered. Aursnes and Donnum went off, and Elyonoussi and Kristian Thorsvedt come on. And, yes, he’s the son of Erik Thorsvedt, the Spurs legend.

Ya beauty. Great ball in from Patterson, Armstrong keeps the ball in play, and then McGinn plays a reverse ball with Armstrong who picks out his spot, and sends it back where the goalie was going.

Kári Tulinius gets in touch: “Portugal just went one up through a good goal by Bruno Fernandez, but as an Icelander I’m finding it hard to care about this game, because due to the magic of modern qualifying, Iceland’s chances of making the playoffs for the Euros entirely depend on Moldavia not beating the Czechs tomorrow on the banks of the Morava, in a completely different group.”

Feels like Monday and Tuesday will be big nights out for the co-efficient crew.
