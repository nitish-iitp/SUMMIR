Scotland vs Norway: Live stream, TV channel, kick-off time & where to watch
Scotland
Norway

How to watch the UEFA European Championship Qualifiers match between Scotland and Norway, as well as kick-off time and team news.

Scotland will look to close their impressive Euro 2024 qualifying campaign with a victory against Norway with the latter being dumped out of the showpiece event in Germany next year.

Throughout the Euro Qualifiers, Scotland showed signs of improvement as they are just two points behind group leaders Spain with a game left for both nations. With 16 points from their seven games, Scotland won five games and have lost just once. Having already secured qualification, Scotland could test some young names in their squad as they continue their preparations for Euro 2024.

Despite having Premier League stars like Erling Haaland and Martin Odegaard, Norway failed to make it through a difficult Group A in the Euro Qualifiers. In the seven games they have played, Norway won just three games all of which came in their previous four games. The shambolic start to the qualifiers was met with an early exit and Norway will be vying to rebuild their side with multiple young stars coming through the ranks.

Here GOAL brings you everything you need to know about how to watch, including TV channel, streaming details and more.

Norway team news

Norway suffered a massive blow when star forward Erling Haaland went down holding his ankle in their last game after being introduced in the second-half.
