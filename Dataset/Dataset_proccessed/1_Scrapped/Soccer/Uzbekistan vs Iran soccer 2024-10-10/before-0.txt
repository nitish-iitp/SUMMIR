Preview: United Arab Emirates vs. North Korea - prediction, team news, lineups

Looking to challenge for a top-two spot in Group A of round three, United Arab Emirates will host a winless North Korea at Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium in the AFC World Cup qualifiers on Thursday night.

Al Abyad lost narrowly to 2022 World Cup participants Iran last time out, whilst Chollima managed to secure a share of the spoils against Asian Cup holders Qatar.

Kicking off the third round of AFC qualifying for the 2026 tournament in September, United Arab Emirates faced off against the two sides in the six-team section who made it to the most recent World Cup in 2022, as Thursday's hosts collected a respectable three points across battles against Qatar and Iran.

The highlight of the last international break for Al Abyad arrived on September 5 at Ahmad bin Ali Stadium in Ar-Rayyan, where the visitors secured a 3-1 success over the Asian Cup champions courtesy of strikes from Harib Abdalla Suhail, Khaled Aldhanhani and substitute Ali Saleh.

All three of the UAE's goalscorers in that marvellous victory versus Qatar currently ply their trade in the top tier of UAE football, but there is a familiar face in Al Abyad's ranks for supporters of the EFL in the form of defender MacKenzie Hunt, who is on the books of League Two side Fleetwood Town.

Earning three points from a pair of tricky opening fixtures in the third round, UAE occupy third place heading into the October international schedule, three points behind league leaders Uzbekistan and Iran in second, with both making flawless starts to this part of qualification.

Considering the competitiveness of Group A, UAE should really fancy their chances of making their second-ever World Cup after a maiden appearance on football's grandest stage at Italia 1990, in which Al Abyad finished bottom of their group, losing all three of their matches.

Following their abrupt withdrawal from the qualification process for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, North Korea are on a mission to appear at the North American tournament in two years time, fighting to return to football's biggest stage for the first time since South Africa 2010.

With the revamped 48-team competition allowing double the amount of automatic AFC qualifiers compared to the previous edition in the Middle East, Chollima will fancy their chances of making a third-ever appearance at a World Cup finals, with the first arriving in England in 1966.

That being said, North Korea have serious work to do if they wish to secure a top-two finish in Group A of the third round, as Thursday's visitors to Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium are without a win after two qualification matches, meaning that they lie five points behind second-placed Iran.

Chollima showcased their considerable powers of recovery during their most recent qualification fixture on September 10, when a second-half strike from Kuk-Chol Kang II forced a share of the points at home to Qatar, despite the hosts going down to 10 men after just 28 minutes.

The overwhelming majority of the North Korea squad play their club football in the nation's domestic league, but there are some in the ranks who have moved further afield in the past, with striker Kwang-Song Han once on the books of Italian sides Juventus and Cagliari.

Despite failing to keep a clean sheet last time out against Iran, UAE should stick with a centre-back pairing of Khalifa Al Hammadi and Kouame Autonne.

There could be some alterations to Al Abyad's attacking line, though, with the likes of Saleh and 31-year-old Fabio Lima pushing for starts.

A top candidate for a demotion to the UAE bench is Yahya Al Ghassani, who was hooked off soon after the half-time break during the loss to Iran.

Due to his dismissal in the draw with Qatar, Kuk-Chol Jang will be unavailable on Thursday night for North Korea, meaning that Yu-Song Kim will require a new partner at centre-back.

Making his international debut last year, Kum-Song Jong is the defender set for a promotion to the starting XI, with the 27-year-old preparing to receive his third senior cap.


United Arab Emirates possible starting lineup:
Eisa; Aldhanhani, Al Hammadi, Autonne, Idrees; Nader, Suhail, Hamad, Al Zaabi, Saleh; Caio

North Korea possible starting lineup:
Ju-Hyok; Ok-Chol, Kum-Song, Yu-Song, Pom-Hyok; Chung-Song, Kuk-Bom, Kuk-Chol K, Il-Song; Hwang-Song, Jo-Guk



We say: United Arab Emirates 1-0 North Korea

Providing Iran with a good test last time out, UAE should be confident of putting North Korea to the sword at Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium on Thursday night.

Chollima struggled to pose a threat on the road against Uzbekistan in September, and we feel that it could be a similar story for the visitors in Al Ain.
