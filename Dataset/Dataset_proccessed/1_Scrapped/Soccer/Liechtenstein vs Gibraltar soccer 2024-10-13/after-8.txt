The Academy portal gives you club, player and competitions statistics in Football. We cover Cups, Leagues, Tournaments and Friendly Games from countries and teams from around the globe. We offer from goal scorers to, final and half-time results, red and yellow cards, among other functions and events that will help the users to have a more enjoyable and complete knowledge of the available sports. You can follow live scores from competitions such as the Portuguese League, Spanish League, Premier League, Champions League, Europa League, among others.

We provide as well the written analysis of several games of the most diverse sports. Despite the analysis representing the reasoned opinion of our profession editors, we do not recommend that they be followed blindly because they only refer to some of the personal conclusions and expectations of the editor about that game. These previews and analysis are not immune to mistakes and must fall to the reader the responsibility of how to include there opinions on their betting methods. As a portal, our contribution is to facilitate the availability of these contents, as well as providing a systematic analysis to insure the constant improvement of our previews.

We promote gambling as an enjoyable leisure activity and we believe that gambling can only remain this way if you stay in control and gamble responsibly.
