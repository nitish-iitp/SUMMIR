Playing in their first League A home match in the CONCACAF Nations League, Guadeloupe host Suriname at Stade Roger Zami on Monday.

Earlier this week, the Guadeloupeans were beaten 3-0 by Costa Rica, while Natio came away with a 3-1 victory versus Guyana.

The debut match in League A for Jocelyn Angloma's Guadeloupe side ended in disappointment as they could only keep the Costa Ricans at bay through the opening half before the floodgates opened.

Whatever the half-time team talk was, it did not work, with the Guadeloupeans conceding four minutes after the break and showing little going forward, with only 38% possession.

Those three goals conceded were more than this side had given up in their previous six matches combined in this competition a year ago (two), albeit in League B.

Last year, this side had a 100% home record at this tournament, and they have not lost a Nations League fixture in Guadeloupe since suffering a 1-0 defeat to Antigua and Barbuda in March 2023.

One strong trademark of this side under Angloma has been their resilience after a tough outing, following up their previous two defeats with a victory in their subsequent match.

Les Gwada Boys have never lost a home contest versus Suriname, defeating them on penalties the previous time they met in Guadeloupe at the Caribbean Cup qualification stage in 2016 (3-2).

Another strong showing by Suriname has them in a tie for first in Group A, increasing their unbeaten run to six matches across all competitions with their victory on Thursday.

Under Stanley Menzo, this side are not only unbeaten but have also become an attacking juggernaut, scoring 11 goals in their last three games.

On the other side, Suriname have maintained a strong defensive line, conceding a goal or fewer in all of their matches ever played in League A of this competition.

They have an opportunity on Monday to win consecutive games in the same Nations League tournament, something they have never done before in League A.

Their victory on matchday one was the first for this nation away from home in League A, scoring more goals on Thursday than they had in their four previous League A fixtures combined (two).

Suriname have won their last two meetings with Guadeloupe, most recently at the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup in the United States (2-1).

Noah Cadiou and Keyvan Beaumont are still seeking their first caps with the Guadeloupe senior squad, with the former not on the teamsheet on matchday one and the latter an unused substitute.

Only three players who began their previous match against Saint Kitts and Nevis last November were in the starting 11 versus Costa Rica, Jerome Roussillon, Jordan Leborgne and Matthias Phaeton.

From their World Cup qualification match versus Anguilla and their opening game of this tournament, Suriname made three changes to their starting 11, with Gyrano Kerk, Shaquille Pinas and Gleofilo Vlijter replacing Jaden Montnor, Kenneth Paal and Tyrone Conraad.

Djevencio van der Kust, Montnor and Virgil Misidjan all found the back of the net on matchday one to propel this side to another victory.

Guadeloupe possible starting lineup:
Bartouche; Gravillon, Baron, Cavare, Roussillon; Arenate, Saint-Maximin, Solvet; Coco, Tell, Phaeton

Suriname possible starting lineup:
Vaessen; Dijksteel, Abena, Denswil, Van der Kust; Jubitana, Misidjan; Montnor, Lonwijk, Pinas; Vlijter



We say: Guadeloupe 0-2 Suriname

Belief and momentum are two x-factors that can often push a team to victory, and Suriname have both of those in abundance at the moment, along with plenty of attacking depth to give the Guadeloupeans fits in this encounter.
