Agent reveals Mohamed Salah to miss up to 28 days with injury

The agent of Liverpool winger Mohamed Salah has admitted that the Egyptian's injury is worse than first feared and he could spend up to a month out of action.

After scoring one goal and setting up another in his side's opening 2-2 Africa Cup of Nations draw with Mozambique, Salah pulled up with an issue in the first half of Egypt's subsequent four-goal stalemate with Ghana.

The 31-year-old was withdrawn just before the break, and while Pharaohs boss Rui Vitoria immediately allayed fears of a long-term problem for his client, Jurgen Klopp insisted that it was too early to ascertain how severe his injury was.

Salah himself remained tight-lipped on the injury - a posterior muscular strain - before Egypt's closing AFCON Group B battle against Cape Verde, but the Pharaohs FA subsequently confirmed that the ex-Chelsea and Roma man would be returning to England for treatment.

In a statement, Egypt also expressed confidence that Salah would return to Ivory Coast for the AFCON semi-finals, which are due to take place on February 7 before the corresponding third-placed playoff and final encounters.

On Monday evening, however, Salah's representative Ramy Abbas Issa shared an agonising update on X - formerly known as Twitter - revealing that the attacker's problem will render him unavailable for between three and four weeks.

"Mohamed's injury is more serious than first thought and he will be out for 21-28 days, and not two games," Abbas said. "His best chance at participating in the current AFCON is by undergoing intensive rehabilitation in the UK and rejoining the team as soon as he is fit."

In spite of the fact that the Africa Cup of Nations is due to conclude in under three weeks' time, Abbas Issa did not completely rule out the prospect of Salah returning to compete for his country in the latter stages of the tournament.

Vitoria's side were at risk of missing out on a top-two finish in Group B, but with Ghana and Mozambique playing out a draw in the section's other match on Monday, Egypt's pulsating 2-2 stalemate with Cape Verde was enough to seal a second-placed ranking.

The Pharaohs - who may have had a chance to qualify for the knockout rounds as one of the four best third-placed sides had they lost to Cape Verde - will now face the runner-up of Group F, comprising Morocco, Tanzania, DR Conga and Zambia, for a spot in the quarters on January 28.

Salah will sit out the Pharaohs' last-16 encounter later this month, though, while the quarter-finals - which will take place on February 2 and February 3 - will also come too soon for the attacker to make his return.

In terms of Liverpool fixtures, the 31-year-old could sit out up to seven domestic matches over the course of the next few weeks, starting with Wednesday's EFL Cup semi-final second leg with Fulham.

On the same day as Egypt's AFCON last-16 clash, Liverpool tackle Norwich City without Salah in the fourth round of the FA Cup, three days before a Premier League showdown with Chelsea.

The Reds must also head to the Emirates to face Arsenal on February 4 without the services of the Egyptian, while fixtures with Burnley (February 10), Brentford (February 17) and Luton Town (February 24) could also come too soon.

Salah has been in scintillating form for Liverpool this season, banking 18 goals and nine assists from 27 games in all tournaments, including 14 strikes from 20 top-flight outings.
