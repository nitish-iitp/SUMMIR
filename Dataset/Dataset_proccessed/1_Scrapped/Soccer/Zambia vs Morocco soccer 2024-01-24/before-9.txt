JOSH BROWN MAKES BBL HISTORY

Jan 23, 2024

Cooper Cricket bat-maker Josh Brown has made history by smashing 12 sixes in a single innings - the most number of sixes in a single innings in BBL history. 

In the match against the Adelaide Strikers on 22 January 2024, Brown made 140 runs from just 57 balls - equal second-fastest hundred in BBL history. 

Brown's score was the highest ever in a BBL finals game, assisting the Brisbane Heat secure a place in the big dance against the Sydney Sixers on 24 January 2024.

Good luck Josh! We can't wait to see the Grand Final!
