In kicking off Friday’s list of 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, Zambia and Chad played to a tense 0-0 draw in their latest Group G assignment at the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium.

Zambia took charge of the match early on and showcased their attacking intent from the kick-off. 

Zambia came close to opening the scoring in the 10th minute after Kelvin Kampamba’s shot from range was saved by Gabin Allahbatnan in goal.

Zambia continued to dominate the ball possession count during the opening exchanges of the match while Chad battled to make it out of their half.

Kennedy Musonda proved to be the attacker-in-chief for his nation and actively searched to make an impact going forward.

The score remained deadlocked midway through the first half, with Zambia being the dominant side after 25 minutes on the clock.

Musonda once again asserted himself in the opposition penalty area with a headed attempt after the half-hour mark, however, his effort went sailing over the bar.

The Copper Bullets did not hold back and continued to take aim at the Chad defence after the restart. 

Musonda again found himself in a favourable position inside the area but was unable to convert a golden opportunity in the 53rd minute.

It was one way traffic for Zambia at the hour-mark as they continued to to chisel away in Chad’s half of the pitch.

Les Sao remained blunt in attack and did little to threaten the Zambia backline.

Zambia's attacking intent increased after the 80th minute but Chad held on and managed to thwart Chipolopolo's advances.

With Zambia battling to make their attempts stick during the closing stages of the match, the referee called time on the affair with the score tied at 0-0.
