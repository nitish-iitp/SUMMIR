A dominant performance from Mountain View’s defense made it so Jordan Best’s touchdown return on the opening kickoff was all the points that the Cougars needed to win their 14th consecutive regular-season game.

But for good measure, Mountain View added a few more touchdowns to blow by Caldera 35-0 in Friday night’s Intermountain Conference football opener in front of a standing-room-only crowd at Mountain View’s Jack Harris Stadium.
