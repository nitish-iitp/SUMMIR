Sierra Leone face African Champions to raise Afcon hopes
 October 10, 2024

On October 11, 2024, Sierra Leone is scheduled to confront the reigning African Champions, Ivory Coast, in a crucial Africa Cup of Nations Qualification match. The highly anticipated game will take place at the Stade Laurent Pokou in San Pedro, with the kickoff set for 19:00 GMT.

Coach Amidu Karim’s team is seeking their first victory in the journey to Morocco 2025. A win for Ivory Coast could potentially harm the Leone Stars’ chances.

The Leone Stars have never won against Ivory Coast in their last eight competitive matches. On January 6, 2024, Ivory Coast defeated a predominantly home-based Leone Stars 5-1 in a friendly match before the 2023 AFCON tournament, which they won on home soil.

The Ivorians has been on fire, winning seven games, drawing three, and not losing a single match in their last ten outings, boasting an impressive 70% win rate.

Meanwhile, Sierra Leone’s journey has been filled with ups and downs, with a notable victory against Djibouti in the World Cup qualifiers, along with some hard-fought draws and challenging defeats to Egypt and Zambia in various competitions.

Group G wrap-up

The team from Côte d’Ivoire has shown its strength in Group G by securing two wins, and they are now gearing up for a match against Sierra Leone, who are still in search of their first win.

Meanwhile, Zambia is in hot pursuit and will face Chad, eager to cement their position in the group standings.

This matchday provides a pivotal opportunity for the lower-ranked teams to make their mark and keep their dreams of qualifying alive.
