Zambia was unable to defeat Chad in the third match of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers at the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium on Friday.

Currently, Zambia is in 2nd place in Group G with four points. However, the team’s performance left a bitter taste for Chipolopolo’s fans, who were hoping for a back-to-back win for the first time in the group.

In a recap of the match, Zambia and Chad played to a 0-0 draw at the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium. Despite dominating possession, Chipolopolo failed to score against a resilient Chad side, which was content to absorb pressure and counterattack when possible.

Zambia is currently in second place in the group with four points from three matches. Cote d’Ivoire is leading with six points and a game in hand. Chad is in third place with two points, and Sierra Leone is at the bottom with one point.

Zambia almost scored when Francisco Mwepu hit the post in the 84th minute, but Chad’s defense held firm to secure a valuable point away from home.
