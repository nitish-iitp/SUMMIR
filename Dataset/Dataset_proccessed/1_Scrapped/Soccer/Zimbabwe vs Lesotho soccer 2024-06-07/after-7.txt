Zimbabwe are looking for their first qualifier win

Zimbabwe and Lesotho clash at the Orlando Stadium in Soweto, South Africa on Friday for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Both are looking for their first win in the campaign.

Interestingly, the sides have drawn both their qualifying games thus far and have accumulated only two points, thereby sitting outside of contention for qualifying at this stage.

Ranked 122nd in the world, Zimbabwe began their qualifiers with a 0-0 draw away to Rwanda, before a 1-1 stalemate with Nigeria on home turf.

Their winless run continued in 2024 as the Warriors failed to win either of their friendlies against Zambia and Kenya. In fact, the Southern African outfit have not won an official game since January 2022, when Zimbabwe beat Guinea 2-1 at the Africa Cup of Nations.

Meanwhile, Lesotho kept themselves active with a series of friendlies in the 2024 calendar year, but their results were mostly disappointing. The Crocodiles only won once: a 2-1 victory away to Ethiopia, out of four clashes, and they have lost twice.

In Group C of the CAF zone of World Cup qualifiers, Lesotho are in fourth position out of six teams, one point ahead of Zimbabwe.

Zimbabwe vs Lesotho Prediction

Given the underwhelming form of both sides, we are likely to see Zimbabwe and Lesotho produce the same result as their last, but this time, with a few goals to entertain the fans.

Prediction: Zimbabwe 1-1 Lesotho
