Prediction: 2-0

	

Albania

Ukraine and Albania face each other at epet Arena (neutral location, Prague) on Saturday evening in what will be their first meeting since June 2018. Back then Ukraine outplayed Albania 4-1 in a friendly and Serhii Rebrov’s men are seen as favourites to win the Nations League game as well. Everton defender Vitali Mykolenko has overcome the injury he suffered at the European Championship finals, with star players Mudryk, Zinchenko, Dovbyk, Tsygankov, and Shaparenko making the cut as well.

Dynamo Kyiv ace Andriy Yarmolenko will be yet another man to watch in the home team. The Albanians, on the other hand, were producing fine displays at the EURO 2024, with the team holding Croatia to a 2-2 draw in the group stages, but given their shaky defence, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the Ukrainians. Rubin Kazan forward Mirlind Daku is back from suspension for the visiting side.

HIGHLIGHTED PLAYER (VIKTOR TSYGANKOV):

Viktor Tsygankov is a Ukrainian footballer who plays for Dynamo Kiev. Tsygankov is a product of Nyva Vinnytsia football school, but in 2011 he moved to Dynamo Kiev at the age of 14. Despite being born in Nahariya, Israel on November 15, 1997, Viktor Tsygankov represents Ukraine at senior level.

The talented winger has no less than 20 caps for Ukraine U17 team and it has to be noted that his made his senior debut for Ukraine against Finland in November, 2016. Tsygankov came as a substitute in the 83rd minute of the 2018 World Cup qualifier. Viktor Tsygankov’s main position is right winger, but he is used as a left winger as well.

His preferred foot is left and he has a contract with Dynamo Kiev until June, 2023. The pacey winger made his Dynamo Kiev debut in the Ukrainian Premier League on August 14, 2016 against FC Stal Kamianske. His first coach was Mykola Zahoruyko.

HIGHLIGHTED TEAM (ALBANIA):

The Albanian national football team has represented the country on international stage since 1946, and it is interesting to note that Albania was one of the founding members of UEFA back in 1954. The Eagles have enjoyed very little success in the 20th century, but they managed to show some improvement at the turn of the century and eventually secured their first ever appearance at a major tournament.

Albania qualified for the Euro 2016 finals as they came second in their qualifying group behind Portugal, taking 14 points from 8 matches, with Italian coach Gianni De Biasi at the helm. The Eagles have never qualified for the World Cup finals in 11 attempts, winning mere 14 of 94 World Cup qualifiers.

Former Lazio defender Lorik Cana has worn the captain’s armband over the last few years and he is Albania’s most capped player, while former Chievo forward Erjon Bogdani still holds the record for most goals for the national team, with 18 strikes in 74 appearances.
