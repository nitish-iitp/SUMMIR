Tunisia will be looking to open up a healthy seven-point lead at the top of Group A of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers when they play host to Comoros in the first of their October double-header on Friday.  

This will be the first meeting between the two nations since September 2022 and the visitors will journey to the Stade Olympique Hammadi Agrebi in search of their first win of the qualifying campaign.

Tunisia maintained their 100% start in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers on September 9 when they held on to see out a 2-1 victory over Gambia at the Stade El Abdi.

After falling behind to Ali Abdi's 11th-minute opener, Gambia hit back 180 seconds later through Ali Sowe, but Ferencvaros midfielder Mohamed Ali Ben Romdhane netted in the 75th minute to hand the visitors all three points.

This came just three days after they kicked off the qualifying campaign with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Madagascar in Rades, with Ferjani Sassi scoring in the eighth minute of stoppage time to leave the Barea empty handed.

Following an embarrassing showing in the 2023 AFCON where they suffered a group-stage exit back in January, Tunisia have kicked off their quest for a 17th straight appearance in the tournament on the front foot as they sit top of Group A, four points above Friday's visitors in second place.

Faouzi Benzarti's men head into the weekend unbeaten in each of their last five games across all competitions, claiming one draw and four wins, including a 1-0 victory over Equatorial Guinea in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers on June 5.

The Eagles of Carthage are also on course to secure a place in the World Cup as they have picked up 10 points from a possible 12 in Group H of the qualifiers to sit top of the table, two points above second-placed Namibia.

Comoros, on the other hand, failed to get up and running in the AFCON qualifiers on September 9 when they could only salvage a 1-1 draw against Madagascar at the Stade Olympique Hammadi Agrebi.

In an end-to-end affair, Madagascar drew first blow in the ninth minute through Carolus Andria but Troyes midfielder Youssouf M'Changama netted four minutes shy of the half-time break to draw the visitors level.

This was a second consecutive stalemate for Comoros, who were held to a 1-1 draw by Gambia in their Group A opener on September 4, when Musa Barrow cancelled out M'Changama's 37th-minute opener to force a share of the spoils.

Les Coelacantes have now gone four consecutive games without a win across all competitions, claiming two draws and losing twice, including a penalty-shootout defeat against Mozambique in the COSAFA Cup third-placed playoff on July 7.

Having missed out on a place in Ivory Coast earlier this year, Stefano Cusin's men will head into the weekend looking to find their feet and get up and running in Group A as they eye just their AFCON appearance.

Comoros' only appearance in the continental showpiece came back in 2021, when they finished as one of the best third-placed sides in the group stages before suffering a 2-1 loss against host nation Cameroon in the round of 16.

Tunisia have named a 28-man squad for October's double-header, with Esperance Tunis man Bechir Ben Said, Frankfurt's Ellyes Skhiri and Burnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbri headlining the team.

Houssem Ben Ali, Bilel Ait Malek, Chiheb Jebali and goalkeeper Sabri Ben Hessen are the four new faces in the Eagles of Carthage camp and they could be handed their senior debut at the Stade Olympique Hammadi Agrebi.

Benzarti should stick to the back four of Abdi, Montassar Talbi, Yassine Meriah and Raed Bouchniba that started against Gambia in September while Ali Youssef and Hamza Rafia should form the two-man attack once again.  

Comoros have named a 23-man list for their upcoming qualifying games, with 35-year-old midfielder M'Changama, who has netted 13 goals in 63 caps since his debut in October 2010, dropped from the squad.

Experienced defender Younn Zahary, who made his debut in October 2019, has withdrawn from Les Coelacantes' squad after sustaining an injury, with 21-year-old Yakine Said Mmadi called up to fill the vacant spot.

Amiens defender Remy Vita and Volcan Club midfielder Naimoudine Assane have both been handed their first call-up to the senior squad and will be looking to make their mark against Tunisia.


Tunisia possible starting lineup:
Memmiche; Abdi, Talbi, Meriah, Bouchniba; Romdhane, Laidouni, Sassi, Ouanes; Youssef, Rafia

Comoros possible starting lineup:
Pandor; Abdallah, M'Dahoma, Omari, Bakari; Ahmed, Lutin, Bourhane; Said, Maolida, Selemani


We say: Tunisia 2-0 Comoros

Tunisia will be licking their lips as they take on a floundering Comoros side who have failed to win any of their last four games across all competitions. While we expect Cusin's side to put up a fight, the Eagles of Carthage boast the firepower needed to get this one over the line and we are backing them to secure all three points.
