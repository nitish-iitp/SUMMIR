Why did he leave the national team?

The exclusion from the call-up is due to a matter related to his future, since, according to the same source, there could be offers for the Mexican player to move to Europe after his consolidation with Club América. So far, the possible destinations have not been revealed, and it is expected that the situation will be resolved soon, thus confirming that he is not injured.

Fabio Miretti, the creative man of the interior of the field:

As mentioned in this preview we are putting together for you, Italy has not lost since July last year due to their great way of defending, however, Italy also possesses a great strength in attack and that is with players like Fabio Miretti who know how to distribute possession of the ball and find passes between the lines make this team a team to totally respect.

Yutaka Michiwaki, the Robin Hood of the left lane:

To beat the Italians, Japan will have to exploit one of its best skills such as the speed of play down the lanes of the field and that is why a player like Yutaka Michiwaki who has already had action in Japan's first division and is characterized by not only being a defensive player but also an offensive player, could support his team a lot to try to take the lead on the scoreboard.

What can we expect from Japan U-19?

Let's be clear, the experience of the players is very important in tournaments like this, and if we compare the Japanese with the Italians, the rivals have more experience in international tournaments, so this could mean an advantage factor for the European team. In addition, this Japanese U-19 team has not been known for imposing conditions in the Maurice Revello Tournament, since in the last edition they could only score 5 goals in five defeats and could not score a single point, so now they will have to improve their participation from last year.

What can we expect from Italy U21?

To begin with, we are talking about one of the junior teams with the greatest potential for the future and the fact is that Italy's junior teams always give good participations in international tournaments as they are par excellence experts in the art of defending, also, if we add the factor of the age difference of their rival which is much smaller, there is a greater range of experience for those from the country of the boot. And the fact is that those in charge of representing this team have taken the task seriously, since Italy has not lost since July 2023, and since then, has only allowed a maximum of two goals per game, so Japan will certainly not have an easy time in this commitment.

The tournament that invites us to reflect

Let's think about how exciting is the time of the year when the Tournament of Hope of Toulon, also known as the Maurice Revello Tournament, is played, a tournament where 10 teams from around the world gather to show their youthful talent to the world of soccer. This competition has produced great players such as Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldinho, David Beckham, Henry, and many others who in due time went through this competition of youth teams and became the great legends they are today. So, it is exciting to think that we are facing the revelation of new soccer promises that will surely shine tomorrow in the big teams of the five major leagues.
