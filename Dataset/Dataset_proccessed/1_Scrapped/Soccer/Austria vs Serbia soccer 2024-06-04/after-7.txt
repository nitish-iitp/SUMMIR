What is Euro 2024?

European football organising body UEFA holds a European Championship contested by national teams every four years. The next edition will be held in Germany in summer 2024, and is called Euro 2024.

The competition takes a similar format to the World Cup - six groups of four teams will be contested on a round-robin basis, with the top two in each group and four best third-placed teams progressing to a knockout phase.

Things then get very tense, with the 16 remaining teams playing a series of elimination rounds, with extra-time and penalty shoot-outs required if scores are level. The final two teams will contest a final, with the winners to be crowned European champions - and sure to become heroes of their own nation.

Watch: Berlin's Olympiastadion will host the final

Which countries are competing?

While Germany qualified as hosts, a remaining 53 teams competed throughout the year-long qualification process to determine the remaining 23 spots at the tournament. The final 24 qualified nations were drawn into six groups of four as follows:

Group A
Germany, Scotland, Hungary, Switzerland

Group B

Group C
Slovenia, Denmark, Serbia, England

Group D
Netherlands, Austria, France, Poland

Group E

What will it be like to be in Germany during Euro 2024?

In one word - incredible!

If you are lucky enough to get a ticket - with sales starting in October 2023 - then you can get set for some keenly contested encounters as the continent's biggest stars battle it out for glory.

Many people in Germany will be rekindling memories of 2006, when the country last hosted a major international tournament, the World Cup. That saw the birth of a popular new way of watching football - of fans gathering together in huge numbers to watch matches on giant screens in public spaces.

The phenomenon of 'public viewing' (to use the English phrase that has entered the German language) will be back in force up and down the country again during Euro 2024.

Berlin, for instance, has developed a tradition of hosting a 'fan mile' in the heart of the city. For Euro 2024 it is planning "the mother of all fan miles" in front of the iconic Brandenburg Gate, which will be turned into "the biggest goal in the world".

Euro 2024 has already broken new ground by being the first European Championship to make sustainability a key component of its scheduling. The group stage has been arranged with three regional clusters to ensure fans can easily travel from venue to venue by public transport, and that they and teams are not unnecessarily crisscrossing the country. 

Expect sunshine, face paint, fun and loads of football!

When were the Euros last held in Germany?

The newest generation of football fans in Germany got a taste of hosting a major tournament in 2021 when four games of the pan-Europe Euro 2020 were played at the Allianz Arena in Munich, including a quarter-final.

The only previous time Germany hosted the Euros was in 1988. However, the political partition at the time meant games were only played in West Germany. Those were in Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Cologne, Dusseldorf, Gelsenkirchen, Hanover and Hamburg. There were no matches in Berlin. Germany made it to the semi-finals that year.

They had previously won the first international football tournament hosted on German soil, lifting the World Cup in 1974.

The 2005 Confederations Cup was the first tournament in reunified Germany as a warm-up to the 2006 World Cup.

Who is the Germany coach?

Julian Nagelsmann is set to become only the 12th person to lead Germany's men into a major tournament after he succeeded Hansi Flick in September 2023, and only the fourth to do so on home soil.

The 36-year-old is attempting to follow in the footsteps of Sepp Herberger (1954 World Cup), Helmut Schön (Euro 1972 and 1974 World Cup), Jupp Derwall (Euro 1980), Franz Beckenbauer (1990 World Cup), Berti Vogts (Euro 1996) and Joachim Löw (2014 World Cup) as a title-winning Germany coach.

Who will win Euro 2024?

We'll just have to wait and see which team gets to lift the trophy as European champions in Berlin in July 2024, but you can expect plenty of twists and turns along the way.

Italy were gelled into an impressive team by coach Roberto Mancini in the last Euros, held in 2021 instead of 2020 as planned due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

England, runners-up last time, will be eager to win their first major tournament since 1966 - non more so than their captain and all-time record goalscorer, Harry Kane, now of Bayern.

France will be confident of going far in the tournament after narrowly missing out on lifting the 2022 World Cup, despite a Kylian Mbappé hat-trick in the final.

Spain, featuring Leipzig's Dani Olmo, have a strong recent record in the tournament.

Level with Spain as the most successful side in European Championship history with three tournament wins are Germany. They will be hoping to give their country something to cheer, with massive young talents like Bayern's Jamal Musiala and Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz poised to light up the event.

Whatever happens, Europe is all set for a feast of football in summer 2024 with Germany the place to be!
