The Man Utd captain stole the show as Roberto Martinez's side tuned up for this summer's tournament in Germany

Portugal warmed up for Euro 2024 with a topsy-turvy 4-2 win over Finland. The hosts, who were without Cristiano Ronaldo, cruised into a 3-0 lead after dominating proceedings but threatened to throw it away late on when substitute Teemu Pukki scored twice to set up a nervy finish.

Lively winger Francisco Conceicao played a starring role for the hosts, winning a penalty for Diogo Jota to make it 2-0 and then teeing up Bruno Fernandes for Portugal's third of the night. The Porto winger then helped seal the deal by producing another assist for the Manchester United captain to finally see off Finland late on.

Goalkeeper & Defence

Jose Sa (4/10):

Had nothing to do all match but pick the ball out of the net twice. Looked furious at losing his clean sheet.

Nuno Mendes (6/10):

Solid defensively but simply wasn't tested.

Ruben Dias (8/10):

Headed home the opener and looked rock solid at the back.

Antonio Silva (7/10):

Completely untroubled during his time on the pitch.

Joao Cancelo (6/10):

Caused lots of problems in attack but was let down by his finishing.

Midfield

Vitinha (8/10):

It was his corner that allowed Ruben Dias to score the opener and his delivery and passing was spot on all night.

João Palhinha (7/10):

Another player who enjoyed himself against Finland. There was simply no way past him in the Portugal midfield.

Joao Neves (7/10):

Some bright moments and showed some flashes of what he's capable of and why he's been linked with a big-money move.

Attack

Rafael Leao (5/10):

Looked bright enough but only played the first half.

Diogo Jota (7/10):

Scored an excellent penalty to make it 2-0, also replaced at the break.

Francisco Conceicao (8/10):

Portugal's best player in a very exciting showing. Was an effervescent presence for the hosts and had a hand in three goals.

Subs & Manager

Diogo Dalot (7/10):

Came on and brought more attacking threat down the flank.

Bruno Fernandes (8/10):

Scored within 11 minutes of his arrival with a great effort and then bagged his second late on.

Goncalo Inacio (6/10):

Missed an easy chance to get on the scoresheet.

Goncalo Ramos (5/10):

Another player who should have netted late on.

Roberto Martinez (7/10):

Won't have enjoyed the way his team conceded twice in quick succession in the second half but otherwise saw his players absolutely dominate proceedings and create bags of chances.
