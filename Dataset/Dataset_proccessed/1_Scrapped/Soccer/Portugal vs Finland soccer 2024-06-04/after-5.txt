86 CommentsSHARE

Our Euro 2024 Fantasy team previews continue with this look at Portugal.

The Portuguese are one of the favourites to go all the way in Germany, having won every fixture in qualifying.

In these country-by-country guides, we’ll be looking at the best players from each nation, taking a stab at predicted line-ups, reviewing the road to Germany and more.

To do this, we’ll be calling on the help of correspondents from each country. Here, we enlist the services of Fantasy Football Scout user joaomiranda2211 (aka @acertainjoao on X).

A recent addition to these team previews is a Premium Members section detailing the official Opta data from Euro ’24 qualification. This data has just arrived in our Members Area, so sign up today to gain access to the all-important stats you need for this summer’s Euro Fantasy game.

THE ROAD TO QUALIFICATION
Pos	Team	P	W	D	L	GF	GA	Diff	Pts
1	Portugal	10	10	0	0	36	2	+34	30
2	Slovakia	10	7	1	2	17	8	+9	22
3	Luxembourg	10	5	2	3	13	19	-6	17
4	Iceland	10	3	1	6	17	16	+1	10
5	Bosnia and Herzegovina	10	3	0	7	9	20	-11	9
6	Liechtenstein	10	0	0	10	1	28	-27	0

Portugal finished Euro 2024 qualifying with a perfect record after winning all 10 of their games.

They scored the most (36) and conceded the least (two) overall. They also kept nine clean sheets, with only Slovakia providing much of a test.

Admittedly, they were handed a very favourable draw (21 of their goals came against Luxembourg and Liechtenstein). Still, things couldn’t have gone much better for Roberto Martinez, who replaced Fernando Santos in the dugout following a poor World Cup 2022.

Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo (€10.0m) was the second-highest scorer in qualifying, with only Romelu Lukaku (€9.0m) scoring more than his 10.

The qualifiers were a happy hunting ground for Bruno Fernandes (€9.0m), too, who racked up six goals and seven assists.

Given their wealth of attacking options, plus the fact they were the only nation to finish qualifying with a 100% record, Portugal are clearly one of the teams to beat in Germany and have high hopes of winning the European Championship, just as they did eight years ago.

QUALIFICATION IN NUMBERS
Most starts: Bruno Fernandes (10), Ruben Dias, Bernardo Silva, Cristiano Ronaldo (9)
Most goals: Cristiano Ronaldo (10), Bruno Fernandes (6)
Most assists: Bruno Fernandes (7), Bernardo Silva (4)

RECORD SINCE QUALIFYING
Date	Competition	Opposition	Result	Score	Goalscorers	Assists
21 March	Friendly	Sweden (h)	W	5-2	Leao, Nunes, Fernandes, Bruma, Ramos	Bernardo x2, Semedo x2, Fernandes
26 March	Friendly	Slovenia (a)	L	0-2		
4 June	Friendly	Finland (h)	W	4-2	Dias, Jota, Fernandes x2	Vitinha, Conceicao x3

Portugal thrashed Sweden 5-2 in March, but their 11-game winning streak under Roberto Martinez came to an end just a few days later, after a surprise 2-0 defeat in Slovenia.

Martinez made wholesale changes for the clash – lining up with a back three – and Portugal were unable to impose themselves, leaving Ronaldo and co fuming.

Joao Felix (€8.5m) hit the post but that was as close as the Selecao came to scoring as they ended with just two shots on target.

Ronaldo was rested for Tuesday’s clash against Finland, but that didn’t stop Portugal, who raced into a 3-0 lead inside 56 minutes.

Fernandes was only introduced at half-time but scored twice, following first-half goals from Ruben Dias (€6.0m) and Diogo Jota (€8.5m).

However, a double from Teemu Pukki reduced the deficit to one goal, as the Portuguese backline became complacent.

Portugal's biggest weakness is that Martinez doesn't have the stones to drop Ronaldo. Plain to see his legs were gone at United and at the last World Cup Portugal when they were way better when he wasn't in the XI. Filling his boots in qualifying against Luxembourg, Bosnia and Liechtenstein is meaningless.

Portugal's biggest weakness is Martinez, full stop. How he manages to fail upwards every time is beyond me! Wigan relegated > Everton (poor) > Belgium (poor results with the golden generation) > Portugal (will ruin another golden generation).

Roberto's agent must be the best in the business. The guy can't organise a defence to save his life! The biggest spoofer in football!

Ronaldo and Bruno occupied similar spaces at United. It didn't work.

Ronaldo is a penalty box striker who got very little service at United. He still scored more goals than Rashford or Rasmus did last season.

Portugal played negative football. Their attempts to play with Ronaldo didn't work and he was brought back in.

Ronaldo scoring in qualifiers is now a bad thing lol.

What a bunch of nonsense from someone who clearly doesn't understand basic tactics.

Sigh... should've known i'd get a reply like this form a Cristiano fan

1. Cristiano and Fernandes occupied the same spaces at United so it didn't work for the former.
Eh...no, no they didn't.
2. Scored more than Rashford or Rasmus managed last season. Wowee! In a historically poor Man United season where everything was lacking and they were ruined with injuries.
3. "Their attempts to play without Ronaldo didn't work"
Haha what are you talking about? He had a terrible World Cup in 2022 and was deservedly dropped. Since then he's been a mainstay in the team under Martinez, there literally wasn't any period where they attempted to play without him.
4. "Ronaldo scoring in qualifiers is now a bad thing lol"
Nope, I said bloating his scoring stats in qualifying against rubbish opposition like Liechtenstein, Bosnia and Luxembourg is practically meaningless for the upcoming tournament, no need to put words in mouth.

Albania. Not 100% sure whether it'll be Strakosha / Berisha yet but both 4m. Happy to take a punt on them racking up the saves and maybe a CS against a blunt looking Italy attack, with someone more solid like Verbruggen to sub on if it doesn't work

Not sure who first choice is for Czech. Nita at Romania is an option as I think they'll finish 2nd in their group. Rakjovic of Serbia is another but I'm not sure if he's nailed over Milinkovic-Savic (4.5) and I see them shipping goals to England and Denmark. I had Bushcan of Ukraine in an earlier draft but everyone seems to think Lunin is getting the nod for them. No point in choosing an Albanian either imo. I think I'd lean towards the Romanian but it's a risk. Finding the extra .5 for the Dutch keeper looks like the safer option as he, Verbruggen, is nailed and I only see the France game being a worry for the Netherlands.

I am absolutely not biased as a Blackburn fan but I would start Wharton over Mainoo or Trent in the midfield.

He is a true 6 and Mainoo, while talented, is more of an 8 than a 6. England already have 2 mids that like to push up in Bellingham and Rice, they likely want a more defensive sitter and that's not Mainoo or Trent.

If Rice plays deeper I see the argument for Trent but I'm just not convinced he's ready to play in midfield. I saw Trent play in midfield live for England a few months ago in Malta, and his anticipation with his back to goal (think Rodri receiving the ball to feet under pressure) was a bit suspect and this was against a far weaker team.

I think he's a great sub on when you need creativity or dead balls but I'd start a true mid and if it's Wharton or Mainoo I'd go Wharton. Delighted he made the team.

Luxembourg getting 17 pts in their group tells you everything you need to know about Portugal's qualifying group. Their group in the Euros also looks very favourable with Georgia being probably the weakest team in the tournament on paper. They haven't really been tested yet, and a 2-0 defeat to Slovenia in March with a new 3-4-2-1 formation is reason enough to be concerned.

They should have plenty of time to get up to speed in this tournament though, semis for me just because of the sheer squad depth.

Nah, they will be 4-3-3 as this article predicted, but shows that Martinez is still trying stuff out (which is fine, that's what March friendlies are for). They could really do with a good test though, as Finland game seemed to give Martinez more questions than answers, to be expected with such a strong bench. Croatia next so that will be one I take more interest in (although Croatia play with a slow controlled build-up, the opposite to Czechia, Georgia and Turkey which are all fast-transition counter attacking teams).

I read something somewhere that said they overload the right side to get as much space as possible for Leao. But I don't get the hype with him and consider him a massive overachiever. But I will be picking Cancelo in various formats so hoping for e.g. Dalot RB and Cancelo on the left to exploit this space.

Seen a little of Leao & he looks pretty lazy. Not sure how Ronaldo + Leao not tracking back + Cancelo bombing forward will work from a defensive POV, but will probably go with Cancelo MD1 anyway

Can barely call them a team with so few caps for many in the squad. And it’s top heavy in terms of quality in attack. Factor in a lack of chemistry and the likelihood that only 4 attacking players will be on the pitch at any given time and it’s not as exciting or promising as the media will have you believe.

Gareth talking about 45 days together.

Lots of coming home/not coming home / coming home/ not coming home peaks and troughs to come.

These games are meaningless. Players want to impress but dont want to get injured. No surprise non-euro teams are doing ok against euro qualified teams.

Cant read too much into these games as frustrating as it is re confidence and send off for fans etc.
