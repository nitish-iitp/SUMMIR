WHAT RONALDO SAID

"Recharging," was the single word caption Ronaldo posted, alongside a shining sun emoji.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Ronaldo was last in action last Friday (May 31) as Al-Nassr fell to a dramatic penalty shootout defeat to newly crowned league champions Al-Hilal in the King Cup final, a bad-tempered affair that saw three red cards dished out inside 90 minutes and left the superstar in tears afterwards. The Portugal icon has been granted some time off before reporting for international duty ahead of Euro 2024 later this month.

WHAT NEXT FOR RONALDO?

Given that he is on holiday, Ronaldo will miss Tuesday's warm-up against Finland in Lisbon. He is expected to link up with the Portugal squad for subsequent friendlies against Croatia and Republic of Ireland on June 8 and 11 respectively. Portugal then kick off their European Championship campaign, for which this a sixth for Ronaldo after first going to Euro 2004, against Czech Republic in Group F on June 18. Only England, France and Spain are fancied more than the 2016 champions by bookmakers
