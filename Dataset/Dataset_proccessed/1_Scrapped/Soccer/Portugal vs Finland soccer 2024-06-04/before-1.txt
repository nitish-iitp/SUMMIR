The first of Portugal's three pre-Euro 2024 friendly fixtures will take place in Lisbon on Tuesday evening, with Finland making the trip to Estadio Jose Alvalade.

Portugal will begin their European Championship campaign against the Czech Republic on June 18, while Finland will return to competitive action at the start of September in the UEFA Nations League.

England and France are viewed as the favourites to win Euro 2024, but Portugal are serious contenders, with a squad packed full of talent certainly capable of going all the way in Germany this summer.

Roberto Martinez's side breezed through their qualification group, winning all 10 of their matches in Group J, scoring 36 times and conceding just twice, with Cristiano Ronaldo netting 10 goals, and he is again set to be a vital player for his national side this summer.

Portugal won the European Championship in 2016, but they only reached the round of 16 at Euro 2020, so there is clear room for improvement in the upcoming competition, and it would be fair to say that the European giants are the heavy favourites to top Group F.

A Selecao das Quinas will begin their campaign against the Czech Republic on June 18 before tackling Turkey and Georgia in their final two fixtures in the section.

Portugal, who suffered a 2-0 loss to Slovakia in their last friendly at the end of March, will also face Croatia and the Republic of Ireland during their warm-up fixtures for Euro 2024.

Finland qualified for Euro 2020, with the national side competing in the finals of a major tournament for the first time in their history, but they were knocked out in the group stage.

The Eagle-Owls lost to Wales in the semi-finals of the playoffs for Euro 2024, so they will not be present in Germany, with their next competitive match coming in the UEFA Nations League against Greece at the start of September.

Markku Kanerva's side will also take on Scotland on June 7, and they are in strong form, winning three of their last four matches in all competitions, including a 2-1 success over Estonia last time out.

Finland have one victory over Portugal to their name, triumphing 4-1 in a friendly back in 2002, but they have lost their last two matches against Tuesday's opponents, including a 2-0 defeat when the two teams last locked horns in March 2011.

The Eagle-Owls certainly have the quality to make it a tricky match for Portugal, which is what Martinez will be looking for in preparation for what is shaping up to be a fascinating European Championship.

Ronaldo is set to win his 207th cap for Portugal on Tuesday evening, with the 39-year-old expected to be given the nod in the final third of the field.

Head coach Martinez will be experimenting with his lineup over the next three matches, but a strong XI is set to feature here, with Rafael Leao and Diogo Jota also potentially operating in attacking areas.

Manchester United duo Diogo Dalot and Bruno Fernandes should both start off the back of helping their side win the FA Cup, while 41-year-old Pepe could feature in the middle of the defence.

As for Finland, Teemu Pukki is still going strong at the age of 34, and the forward will be bidding to add to his 40 international goals in this contest.

Joel Pohjanpalo has 15 goals to his name for his country and should also operate in the final third, while Robin Lod provides the experience from midfield, with a 67th cap on offer here.

Aberdeen's Richard Jensen could start at the back for the visitors on Tuesday night, while there will be a spot in goal for the captain Lukas Hradecky, who won the Bundesliga with Bayer Leverkusen this season.


Portugal possible starting lineup:
Costa; Cancelo, Pepe, Dias, Dalot; Fernandes, Palhinha, Bernardo; Leao, Ronaldo, Jota

Finland possible starting lineup:
Hradecky; Alho, Tenho, Ivanov, Jensen; Lod, Peltola, Suhonen, Nissila; Pukki, Pohjanpalo



We say: Portugal 3-0 Finland

Portugal have an embarrassment of riches all over the park, and we are expecting them to have too much for Finland on Tuesday evening, with Ronaldo potentially on the scoresheet in a comfortable success.
