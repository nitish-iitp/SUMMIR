Ruiz double helps 10-man Spain thump Switzerland 4-1
ByReuters
Updated: Sep 8, 2024, 10:48 pm

Spain's Fabian Ruiz scored twice as his 10-man side defeated Switzerland 4-1 in the pouring rain in Geneva to earn their first victory in Nations League A Group Four on Sunday and inflict a second successive defeat on their hosts.

Euro 2024 winners Spain had been held to a dour 0-0 draw by Serbia in their pool opener but found their groove in a quick start at the Stade de Geneve as Joselu and Ruiz had them 2-0 up inside 13 minutes.

A red card for Spain defender Robin Le Normand after 20 minutes was a setback and brought Switzerland into the game as Zeki Amdouni pulled a goal back before half-time.

But as the Swiss pressed for an equaliser late on, Ruiz netted his second and Ferran Torres also got on the scoresheet as Spain hit the hosts with lightning counter-attacks.

"If there's one thing I like to boast about, it's the pride I've always felt for this team," Spain coach Luis de la Fuente said. "When these circumstances happen, one feels more proud.

"With 10 men we have been able to interpret the game in a masterful way. I am very proud of this team and every day we see that we continue to grow and that we can improve."

Switzerland lost 2-0 to Denmark in their group opener on Thursday so are on the back foot already and will rue two disallowed goals and a penalty appeal that was turned down.

Spain led inside four minutes when 17-year-old Lamine Yamal provided trickery on the right and drove towards the byline before lifting a deft cross for Joselu to head home.

Becir Omeragic thought he had equalised minutes later, but the effort was ruled out for a handball by Remo Freuler in the build-up.

Spain doubled their advantage in a lively opening as Nico Williams' initial shot was parried by goalkeeper Gregor Kobel and the ball fell to Ruiz, who lashed his shot into the back of the net.

The visitors were reduced to 10 men midway through the first half when Breel Embolo was held back by Le Normand as the striker threatened to race clear and the Spaniard was handed a straight red card by referee Irfan Peljto.

After Amdouni's free kick crashed back off the crossbar, the forward did find the back of the net five minutes before half-time as he turned the ball home from close range.

Switzerland thought they should have had a penalty late in the first half when the ball struck Lamine Yamal on the arm, but the referee waved play-on.

Amdouni thought he had scored again from another corner but the ball had gone out of play and the effort was ruled out.

Spain made the points safe with a third goal on the break as Torres was set free and his cross was finished by Ruiz into the far corner. Torres then scored a fourth himself to add further gloss to the comfortable victory.

"The goals we conceded were unnecessary," Swiss defender Manuel Akanji said. "There were communication errors, and the goals came too easily. When we were 2-0 down, we did well. They had a lot of trouble defending Breel.

"In the second half, we didn't do all the good things we did in the first half. We ran into counter-attacks and were punished. Overall, we didn't do enough."
