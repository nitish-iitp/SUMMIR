Hi all,
I am planning to buy this Howa 1500 22" heavy bull barrel SA .308 https://www.brownells.com/gun-parts...308-winchester-barreled-action/?sku=430103508

Just curious what you all would recommend for chassis/stock?

Primary use for now will be learning fundamentals of shooting at different distances. So primarily it will be used at the range.
I am considering these:
chassis:

All very solid options.
All of the chassis that you have linked would work very well, you could include the Oryx, I bought one for my son and was very impressed.
The only "issue" with the LSS is, that is just the beginning, the buttstock itself is an additional cost, so be sure to figure on that extra espense.
You have a good build going there, what are you doing for glass?

I am an all around noob when it comes to all of this so I relying heavily on research and recommendations. I haven't even started down the rabbit hole of glass yet lol. I recently bought a Primary Arms SP 1x6-24 (originally purchased for my AR-15 style rifle) that I will probably put on it in the mean time until I figure it out.

I am trying to keep cost down as much as possible without sacrificing quality and functionality as far as the stocks go (So I can put the extra money into quality glass at some point). I'd like to go with the LSS-XL and get a buttstock, but I think you also have to factor in a grip too which all together would have me over $1k just on the chassis/stock. I think for now since I am just learning and starting out I can probably go with the Oryx (although I wish that one had the M-Lock rail) or XRS.

I originally wanted to get the 24" barrel:

22" Heavy Bull Barrel:

but someone on a different site pointed out that the 24" version is a varmit heavy barrel instead of the bull barrel. But looking at their weights the 24" appears to be heavier. I guess I don't see the difference between the bull and varmit. Wouldn't the longer heavier barrel be better?

I just took a look at the first link, that is a standard weight barrel, for your use, you'd be better with a heavier profile.
Bull/Varmint are the same thing as far as I know (in regards to Howa barrels), they are fairly beefy.
With a .308, you're not gaining a whole lot of velocity, but you do gain some.
in all reality, shorter barrels are a bit stiffer, as there is less whip, so they CAN be more accurate.
If you aren't going to run a suppressor or brake, I'd go with the longer barrel as the extra weight helps with recoil.
I'm a sucker for the heavy barrel, especially for a range rifle, I'd choose that over a lighter weight contour.
A 20" HB will probably weigh about the same as a 22 or 24" standard barrel (Howa makes them heavy enough to support threading)
Theses are the two options you should be looking at (pictures don't actually represent the product):

I do plan to use a suppressor. That being the case if I plan to use a suppressor will the 24" be too long then? and the middle ground of 22" will be good?

20" with a can.
You can reach way out there with a 20"

That makes sense. Although I think I might split the difference with the 22" in case I am using my can on my other rifle (I currently only have 1 multi caliber can). Unless there is some obvious advantage of the 20" that I am missing of course.

That will work, except the 22" is not a heavy barrel and it is threaded 1/2x28 instead of the more common 5/8x24

I must be losing my mind because first of all I linked the 20" and didn't even realize it but I have been doing research all day know for a fact there was a 22" heavy bull barrel and I even had it in my cart at one point lol. I am on TGT also someone on there even pointed out to me this morning that the 22" was the heavy bull barrel and the 24" is heavy barrel but varmint. So now I have to decide between the 24" and the 20" keeping in mind that I may shoot it without my can at times.

Brownells can answer your questions. Things are frequently mislabeled on websites. After some looking around, there is supposedly some difference in the varmint and heavy barrel contours. You could call Legacy Sports and see what they can tell you.
Good luck.

I took at look at the Legacy website, they do not catalog any 22" varmint or heavy barrel models.
Looks like 20 or 24 are your choices.

Thanks for that info. The other thing I could do is just buy this: https://www.theshootingwarehouse.co...d=undefined&filter_id_1=true&filter_id_5=true

and be done with it for now. The dealer I talked to said she could get it for me for $819.99. I can still swap out the chassis and everything later on. Although then it wouldn't be as "custom" because I am not putting it together myself. I still think though saving some money on a chassis/stock now and investing in some good quality glass would be the most beneficial. Whether I put it together myself or not I believe it is still the same bolt/barrel. With the option in the link ^^ I would still need the 20MOA rail as well.

That would work just fine, it'll get you shooting and allow you to figure out which way you want to go.
It is a bit homely, but probably works quite well.

Yeah it doesn't look that great. I am also considering this barreled action: https://www.brownells.com/gun-parts...led-receiver-for-remington-700/?sku=430106153

Its certainly a jump up in price, but it is made here in the USA and is Remington 700 compatible which seems like it opens up a whole lot of customization options for chassis and triggers etc vs the HOWA. I need to do some research and figure out what the difference is between M24 and Sendero barrel contour lol.

Hopefully I can make a decision today and I can start posting the build.

Thanks for all your input btw. It is greatly appreciated.

I really like the Howa platforms, but that Solus is definitely a step up.
The M24 contour is quite a bit heavier than the varmin/sendero contour.
It does indeed open up options, there are also prechambered prefits available (shouldered barrels), as well as barrel nut offerings. So there would be no need for a gunsmith to change barrels. (There are Howa barrel nut barrels as well, but not shouldered prefits)
If you have the money, get the Solus, it's a better action and will make your life easier in the long run.

The Solus uses a hanger to install a trigger. Some stocks/chassis may have fit problems with trigger hangers.

I've recently also started to consider this action: https://xtremegunsandammo.com/shop/...amond-like-carbon-black-finish&wccf_qv_conf=1

But I need to find a suitable barrel and stock for it. It looks like I am going to be far exceeding the original budget I set for myself

These are great actions. No trigger hanger. Interchangeable bolt heads. Remington pattern so everybody makes stocks and chassis. Same barrel threads as Savage small shank so barrels are widely available. I deal with Northland Shooters Supply for a "one stop" vendor.

Dude, I don't know who told you the 22" version has a bull barrel. It does not. It has a standard barrel. This means it's got a fairly small diameter and will probably heat up much faster than the heavy barrel offered on the 20" and 24" versions. The 22" also has half inch threads. FUCK NO. I would not get half in threads on a 308 bore.

All this information is posted right on the links you posted. If you just read through them, you'll see.

That said, howa makes a great rifle and I would be going for the 20" or 24" version.

As for stocks or chassis, go to the MDT website and literally pick anything you want that fits your budget. Anything MDT is really good.

Ha yes I am quickly learning these things. I think ultimately I have decided to go with this action: https://xtremegunsandammo.com/shop/...amond-like-carbon-black-finish&wccf_qv_conf=1
and will need to find a good barrel to fit it.

As far as chassis/stocks go I will probably end up getting one from MDT. I do like the KRG Whiskey-3 though.

I'm partial to KRG Bravo stocks. Not real expensive but great overall. For a 308 barrel, It depends on your intended use.
For bench shooting, a bull, heavy Palma or heavy varmint will tend to be accurate. Much over 20-22" will start to be unwieldy with a suppressor, but that's not a big deal on a bench. If you plan on hunting or action type shooting you might look at lighter options.

I've got my heart set on that Origin action but for the life of me can't find a barrel to go with it that's not carbon fiber or isn't 26/28" long. At least not for Bartlein, Hart, Kreiger or Brux brand barrels anyway. Are there any reps on this site that can help me out please?

Where have you looked?

Instead, why don't you call around any of the reputable gunsmith that build badass precision rifles. There's plenty of them. Ask them if they can chamber you a barrel in 308, or whatever you want, at whatever finished length you need, etc.

Call around and see who can do the work for you in whatever time frame you need. Chances are, it's gonna vary a little, go with the one that best suits you.

They may or may not use a blank from those manufacturers you named but who cares. If it's a reputable shop, the barrel will shoot great. Heck, some may even give you a few choices to pick from and one might be what you want.

I'll list a few below but I'm damn sure I'm missing a whole bunch more.

They may or may not use a blank from those manufacturers you named but who cares. If it's a reputable shop, the barrel will shoot great. Heck, some may even give you a few choices to pick from and one might be what you want.

I'll list a few below but I'm damn sure I'm missing a whole bunch more.

Thanks. I will check those out. I am sure it's evident but I am completely new to all this. I have never even owned/shot a bolt action rifle. I have an AR style rifle and some pistols, but no bolt action experience.

Then it probably makes more sense to go this route. This way you can ensure all the work will be done right. And like I said, they probably won't even use a barrel from the manufacturer you want because sometimes they work with a specific brand and have been using them for years. However, how they cut the chamber and do the barrel work is probably more important to accuracy than barrel brand so you know you'll get a great shooting rifle cuz these guys do top notch work.

If for whatever circumatance a barrel they did isn't shooting good or is bad, I see no reason why they won't make it right to you.

Prefits still need chambered and whatnot, so most places you are seeing 26-28" will cut and thread them included in the cost most likely.

Not sure where you are looking and I have no experience with Bartlien, but usually you specify chambering, contour, length, threads, crown, etc...

A couple places with websites that let you "build" it easily.
Lots of other places you have to call, which is cool, but these sites will get you familiar with prices and options.

Hi All,
I appreciate all the great advise and info so far. It won't let me change the name of my thread, but I have changed my mind a bit and have decided to get a setup chambered in 6.5 CM. I am currently doing some additional research as far as that goes and if any of your advice has changed with me moving to 6.5 CM instead of .308 please let me know. Since I am just getting my feet wet I am also open to a rifle barreled action combo or prefab if for the price would excel over my Origin action and separate barrel option. Switching to 6.5 CM has opened the option to get a prefit barrel to match the origin action all from the same dealer and out the door I think it would be around $1600

Thanks again. I greatly appreciate the time, patience and advice I have received by you all since I have joined. I do my own research as well so I am not just here to be lazy and have everyone do it for me lol. This forum is fantastic so far.

HOWA M1500 Superlite 6.5 CM 20" BBL (1)3RD Mag BBL Action Blued SKU: 430110557 | Brownells
Check out the HOWA M1500 Superlite 6.5 CM 20" BBL (1)3RD Mag BBL Action Blued SKU: 430110557 available Online at Brownells Today and many more Rifle Receivers & Parts products are available in our Gun Parts Department.
 www.brownells.com

Looking at the 20" version of the above and will run a F1 Ti suppressor (about 12 oz) on the end. Any concern with that light profile? Hoping to sling 100 ELD VTs at yotes and other things so MOA accuracy is what I'm looking for with this in a Bravo chassis.

Is that a reasonable expectation?

Yes, it is reasonable, it is threaded 1/2x28

After much research and consideration I think I am going to go this route here:


MPA BA PMR Pro Rifle II - MasterPiece Arms, Inc.​
Masterpiece Arms builds World Class Rifles. We start with our industry leading Chassis System, utilize the Best Actions and Triggers produced, and a 416R SS Handlapped Barrels provide some the best shooting, most accurate rifles in existence. Designed, Built and Enhanced by Long Range Shooters...
masterpiecearms.com
It has the equivalent to a CDG action, 26" heavy barrel, Bix N Andy single stage trigger, a nice, foldable chassis. I think it will be the best "bang" for my buck lol. And then probably pair it with a Vortex 5-25x50 FFP Strike Eagle.

Going to 6.5 CM was a good idea. While I shoot 308 fairly often, I find the Creedmoor to be better at longer range, especially if you don't reload. Going to a heavier and longer barrel is also good for your original purpose, as is a chassis. This rifle will put you where you would likely have ended up anyway, without the money gobbling intermediate steps many of us go through. Good on you for making an excellent choice!
