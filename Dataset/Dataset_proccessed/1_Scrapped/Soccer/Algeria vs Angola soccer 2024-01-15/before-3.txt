Angola’s Palancas Negras enter this year’s Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) with a determined focus on achieving significant success. They have their sights on surpassing their historical quarterfinal stage, a feat achieved only twice in AFCON history. Despite facing challenges in progressing beyond the quarterfinals, Angola have consistently showcased resilience.

In 2008, Angola advanced to the quarterfinals after defeating Senegal 3-1 and drawing with South Africa and Tunisia. However, their journey was halted by eventual champions Egypt, who secured a 2-1 victory, eliminating Angola from the tournament.

In 2010, hosting the AFCON, Angola managed to reach the quarterfinals after a thrilling 4-4 draw with Mali and subsequent wins against Malawi and a draw against Algeria. Despite a spirited effort, Ghana’s Asamoah Gyan scored in the 16th minute, ending Angola’s campaign.

As they head into the 2023 tournament, finding themselves in a challenging group alongside former champions Algeria, Burkina Faso, and a promising Mauritanian side, the Palancas Negras will aim to overcome historical quarterfinal hurdles and make a deeper impact in the competition.
