Algeria’s Desert Foxes are gearing up for another shot at glory at this year’s Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). With a great history in the tournament, having won the AFCON trophy twice, Algeria’s journey has been marked by both triumphs and challenges.

Having made an impressive 19 appearances in AFCON, Algeria’s track record reveals a degree of inconsistency. Despite their numerous participations, they have faced eight group stage exits and four quarter-final eliminations. However, they have also shone in the tournament, reaching the semi-finals seven times and emerging victorious in 1990 and 2019.

The historic 1990 triumph came when Algeria hosted the tournament. The Desert Foxes showcased their dominance with convincing victories, including a memorable 5-1 win over Nigeria, a 3-0 triumph against Ivory Coast, and a 2-0 victory over Egypt in the group stage. They continued their impressive form in the knockout stage, securing a 2-1 win over Senegal and ultimately clinching the trophy with a narrow 1-0 victory over Nigeria in the final.

A prolonged wait ensued until 2019 for Algeria’s second AFCON triumph. The team displayed a stellar performance, topping their group by beating every team without conceding a goal. The knockout stage saw them defeat Guinea 3-0 and overcome Ivory Coast in the quarters via penalty shootouts. In a tense semi-final against Nigeria, a last-minute strike from Riyad Mahrez secured a 2-1 victory, setting the stage for a triumphant final against Senegal.

However, their title defense in the subsequent AFCON faced a setback as they exited the group phase, unable to outsmart rivals like Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, and Sierra Leone.
