How to watch Son Heung-min at Asian Cup: TV, live stream & South Korea's schedule

Tottenham have so far made a mockery of their long list of absences, and the inclusion of two major international tournaments midway through the 2023/24 season means their squad has been stretched further.

Ange Postecoglou has been able to welcome back the likes of Rodrigo Bentancur, Cristian Romero, and Micky van de Ven from injuries in the new year, while James Maddison is primed for a return before the end of January.

Ange, however, has so far been without three crucial cogs to kick off 2024. Son Heung-min is aiming to captain South Korea to glory at the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, Pape Matar Sarr is poised to play a more prominent role for holders Senegal at AFCON, while Yves Bissouma's Mali are distinct outsiders to go all the way in the Ivory Coast.

Each Spurs star will be back in N17 by mid-February at the latest, although Lilywhite supporters will selfishly be pleading for a couple of shock early exits.

Here's how you can watch Tottenham's 2023 Asian Cup and AFCON stars in action for their respective nations.

Expectations are high for South Korea heading into the Asian Cup. While Japan are favoured to win the tournament, Son's side are regarded as their fiercest challenger.

Former Tottenham striker Jurgen Klinsmann is hoping to inspire South Korea to their first Asian Cup title since 1960, with their success heavily dependent on Son's form in front of goal. The Korean superstar has inspired his country at recent World Cups, but he's yet to get his hands on a major piece of silverware.

Their campaign started with a 3-1 win over Bahrain on Monday.

The tournament will not be broadcasted live in the UK or Canada, although Paramount+ subscribers in the US can enjoy South Korea's group fixtures and their potential knockout encounters via the streaming service.

How to watch Yves Bissouma & Mali at 2023 AFCON

Mali are not among the leading contenders at AFCON, although their recent history at the tournament is pretty impressive. They reached the knockout stages in 2019 and 2021, finishing third in 2012 and 2013.

Bissouma's side are expected to progress from Group E and secure another knockout berth.

Mali's games are easily accessible via Sky Sports in the UK as well as beIN Sports and Fanatiz in the US and Canada.

How to watch Pape Matar Sarr & Senegal at 2023 AFCON

Sarr hadn't featured for Tottenham when he was included in the Senegal squad that won AFCON for the very first time in 2021. The dogged midfielder, however, earned just one appearance during Senegal's success.

Sarr has enjoyed a stellar 2023/24 campaign in north London and is poised to play a bigger role for the holders in the Ivory Coast compared to two years ago. However, the injury he sustained on New Year's Eve against Bournemouth means Sarr will have to be eased into the tournament. The midfielder didn't feature in Monday's 3-0 win over Gambia.

Senegal have been paired alongside Cameroon in Group C, with that duel set to determine who progresses into the round of 16 as group winners. Once again, all of Senegal's AFCON games can be watched on Sky Sports in the UK, as well as beIN Sports and Fanatiz in the US and Canada.
