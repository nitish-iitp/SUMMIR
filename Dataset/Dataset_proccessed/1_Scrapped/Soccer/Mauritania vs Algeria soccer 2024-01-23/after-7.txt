TELL ME MORE

The Algerians were the more dominant side right from the word go as they looked to pick up an early goal in the must-win clash. Houssem Aouar came close to breaking the deadlock in the 25th minute when he attempted a first-time side volley from Youcef Atal's cross but he failed to keep his shot on target.

Against the run of play, the underdogs took the lead in the 37th minute thanks to a brilliant strike from Mohamed Dellah Yaly. Algerian goalkeeper Anthony Mandrea initially parried away a Mauritanian corner but the ball went as far as Mouhsine Bodda who immediately attempted a long-range shot. The ball took a deflection from Mohamed Amine Tougai inside the box and landed on the foot of Dellah Yaly, who took one touch and found the back of the net.

The Greens threw the kitchen sink at their opposition in the second half as Djamel Belmadi introduced former Manchester City star Riyad Mahrez, but credit must go to the Lions of Chinguetti who defended valiantly and eventually clinched a historic win.

THE MVP

Mohamed Dellahi Yaly's first-half goal proved to be the decisive factor in Mauritania's historic win over the mighty Algerians in their final AFCON group game. Other than scoring the all-important goal, the Al-Nasr defender was rock solid in the backline as the defence managed to keep the opposing attackers at bay throughout the game.

THE BIG LOSER

The Greens boss Djamel Belmadi's bold decision to start Riyad Mahrez on the bench in a must-win clash proved to be a disaster in the end as his team bowed out of the competition from the group stage. Mahrez did come on as a second-half substitute, but the talismanic winger's absence was felt at the start of the match. He's surely facing the sack now.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

The Lions of Chinguetti sealed a historic round of 16 berth after finishing third in their group while The Greens faced a shock group-stage elimination for the second time in a row. They will now be a period of reflection back home.
