The Republic of Ireland will host Belgium at Aviva Stadium this Saturday for an international friendly. Belgium aims to fine-tune their preparations for the upcoming European Championships, while Ireland seeks to secure some positive results as they rebuild following a disappointing qualifying campaign. Although Ireland has no imminent competitions to prepare for, they are focused on strengthening squad cohesion ahead of their pursuit of World Cup qualification.

In their qualifying journey, Ireland struggled, managing only two wins and suffering six losses across eight matches, accumulating a total of six points and falling short of qualification by 12 points. Conversely, Belgium finished top in Group F in the European Qualifiers. Their group included formidable opponents such as Austria, Sweden, Azerbaijan, and Estonia. Belgium remained undefeated, securing six victories and two draws in eight matches, finishing just one point ahead of Austria. This fixture promises to be an enticing clash as both teams seek to achieve their respective objectives.

Form

Ireland Form (All Competitions): D-W-W-L-W

Player to Watch
Adam Idah (Ireland)

Adam Idah is a tall, physically strong player with exceptional finishing abilities. He is known for scoring goals from long distances, showcasing his top-quality skills. His presence on the field poses a significant threat to the opposition, supported by his excellent attitude during gameplay.

Johan Bakayoko (Belgium)

Johan Bakayoko’s direct runs at defenders have the potential to break through the opposition’s defensive line and create pressure on the goalkeeper. The young Belgian exhibits excellent first-touch skills under pressure and displays confidence in manoeuvring past multiple opponents, utilizing his remarkable speed on counter-attacks. His adept ball control and assurance on the ball make him a formidable presence in one-on-one situations against fullbacks, while he is also increasingly effective in aerial duels, owing to his developing physical stature.
