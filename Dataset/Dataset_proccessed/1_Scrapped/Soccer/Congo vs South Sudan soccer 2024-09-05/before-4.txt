Preview: Congo vs. South Sudan - prediction, team news, lineups

Congo and South Sudan get their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign underway when they go head to head at the Stade Alphonse Massemba-Debat on Thursday.  

Since claiming a 2-1 victory when the two nations squared off in the 2023 AFCON qualifiers in March 2023, the Bright Stars have failed to win any of their four competitive matches and will be looking to end this poor run.

Match preview

Congo were outclassed and outplayed by Morocco on June 11 as they suffered a 6-0 thrashing at the hands of the Atlas Lions in their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying clash at the Stade Adrar.

Olympiacos striker Ayoub El Kaabi turned in a performance of the highest quality as he netted a hat-trick, with Azzedine Ounahi, Chadi Riad and Soufiane Rahimi also finding the back of the net to put the home side to the sword.

Following a 4-2 against Zambia in the Group E curtain-raiser of the World Cup qualifiers in November 2023, Congo find themselves rooted to the bottom of the table, having failed to pick up any points from the first six available.

This poor run has been in keeping with their disappointing performance in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, where the Red Devils picked up two wins and lost three of their six games in Group G to finish third in the table and miss out on a place in the continental showpiece for the fourth edition on the spin.

Congo's last AFCON appearance came in Equatorial Guinea back in 2015, when they finished as Group A winners with seven points from three matches before suffering a 4-2 loss at the hands of Congo DR in the quarter-finals.

Isaac Ngata's men, who have failed to win their last six outings, will look to kick off their quest for a place in Morocco on a high as they take on an opposing side whom they met in the 2023 AFCON qualifiers, losing once and claiming one draw in their two clashes.

Like Thursday's hosts, South Sudan failed to get up and running in the World Cup qualifiers as they fell to a 3-0 defeat against Sudan when the two nations met at the Juba Stadium on June 11.

Walieldin Khidir netted right on the stroke of half time to hand Sudan the lead and swing the momentum in their favour before Yasir Mozamil and Mohamed Abdelrahman netted second-half goals to put the result beyond reach.

Following the defeat against Sudan, South Sudan have now failed to win any of their four matches in the World Cup qualifying race, losing twice and claiming two draws to sit fifth in Group B with two points from a possible 12.

Nicolas Dupuis's men will now look to get their AFCON qualifying journey off on a positive note, having edged out Sao Tome and Principe on penalties in the preliminary round following a 1-1 aggregate stalemate with the Falcons and True Parrots Team.

However, South Sudan head into Thursday's clash without a win in nine consecutive matches in normal time, losing five and picking up four draws since beating Congo 2-1 back in March 2023.

Team News

Ngata has named 26 players for the upcoming games against South Sudan and Uganda, with the likes of Prestige Mboungou, veteran goalkeeper Christoffer Mafoumbi and striker Silvere Ganvoula headlining the team.

Ganvoula has netted six goals in 25 senior caps since his debut in June 2014 and we expect the Young Boys striker to spearhead the Congo attack once again, while Christ Makosso and Bryan Passi should team up at the heart of the defence once again.

There are also multiple new faces in the Red Devils' camp, with Kevin Mouanga, Brunallergene Junior Etou, Angers' Melvin Zinga and Strasbourg midfielder Rabby Nzingoula earning their first senior call-ups.

As for South Sudan, Dupuis has called up a 24-man squad for their upcoming qualifying games, including Paul America, Kator midfielder Peter Chol and 38-year-old goalkeeper Juma Genaro.

Geriga Atendele, Rashid Toha, Peter Maker Manyang and Wani Ivan Adebo started the game against Sudan in June and should form the back four once again, shielding Majak Mawith between the sticks.

Jackson Morgan and Chol Daniel should team up in the centre of the park once again; while Makassar striker Tito Okello, who has four goals in 16 appearances in the Bright Stars' colours should lead the attack.


Congo possible starting lineup:
Matimbou; Bidounga, Makosso, Passi, Andzouana; Massanga, Ndockyt, Dembi; Bassouamina, Ganvoula, Makouana

South Sudan possible starting lineup:
Mawith; Atendele, Toha, Manyang, Adebo; Morgan, Daniel; Thiago, Manase, Yuel; Okello


We say: Congo 2-0 South Sudan

Off the back of a humiliating defeat against Egypt, Congo will head into Thursday's clash looking to restore some pride and get their AFCON qualifying journey off on the front foot.

While both nations are on a run of six consecutive games without a win, we are backing Ngata's men to come away with all three points in front of their supporters at the Stade Alphonse Massemba-Debat.
