The ticket prices start from GH₵20

The National Sports Authority has released the ticket prices for Ghana’s upcoming game against Angola at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium on Thursday, September 5, 2024.

The Black Stars take on Angola in their first match in the 2025 African Cup of Nations Qualifiers.

Ahead of the match, the NSA has announced that supporters can buy tickets via a short code or using a designated website.

The tickets are priced as follows:

• GH₵20 for the popular stand

• GH₵50 for the centerline

• GH₵70 for the VIP wing

• GH₵100 for the VIP stand, which is the highest

Fans are expected to fill the Baba Yara Stadium, which has become a norm for Black Stars matches.

The Black Stars beat Angola 1-0 at the Baba Yara Stadium the last time they met in the 2023 AFCON Qualifiers.
