Preview: Malawi vs. Sao Tome & Principe - prediction, team news, lineups

Two teams who could really do with a victory lock horns at the Bingu National Stadium on Thursday as Malawi entertain the challenge of Sao Tome & Principe.

The hosts have won just one of their last seven matches, while the visitors head into this one winless in 11 straight matches across all competitions.

Match preview

Malawi opened their World Cup qualifying journey with a narrow 1-0 victory over Liberia on November 17 but fell to a 1-0 defeat to Malawi in their subsequent outing four days.

Since then, Patrick Mabedi's men have been beaten in friendly encounters by Kenya and most recently Zambia to leave them on a run of three consecutive losses.

Seeking to book their place in football's biggest tournament for the first time ever, the Flames sit fourth in Group H, three points behind Namibia and Tunisia.

They will be looking to get back to winning ways against an opposing outfit currently a whopping 63 places below in the latest FIFA rankings of all national teams.

Winless in front of their fans since June 2022, Thursday's hosts will need to get going on home turf to stand any chance of securing a World Cup berth.

Sao Tome & Principe just about came up short against South Sudan in the first round of the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers as they crashed out on away goals.

Off the back of a 1-1 draw in the first leg on March 22, Adriano Eusebio's men were held to a goalless stalemate in the return leg four days later.

This came off the back of defeats against Tunisia and Namibia, which left Guerreiros do Equador bottom of Group H, one of only two teams still yet to pick up a point.

Aiming to record a first away victory in five years, Thursday's visitors have struggled on their travels and have it all to do as they look to avoid another fruitless outing on enemy territory.

Team News

Fresh from opening his account for Malawi last time out, Lawrence Chaziya will be looking to deliver the goods for his nation once again.

Since breaking into the top ten of the hosts' all-time scorers chart, Gabadinho Mhango is yet to register on the international front but is expected to lead the line.

Sao Tome record goalscorer Luis Leal has grabbed each of his side's last three goals and 10 in total, making him one to keep an eye on here.

Midfielder Jocy is set to record his 37th cap for the away side, which would see him extend his lead at the top of the all-time appearances standings.


Malawi possible starting lineup:
Nyasulu; Sanudi, Okedina, Chaziya, Chembezi; Aaron, Mwaungulu; Njaliwa, Nkhoma, Mpinganjira; Mhango

Sao Tome & Principe possible starting lineup:
Tavinho; Ivonaldo, Soares, Dinho, Mimi; Jocy, Barbeiro, Fernandes, Aldair; Harramiz, Leal



We say: Malawi 1-0 Sao Tome & Principe

Goals have been hard to come by for both teams of late, and we expect a low-scoring affair in this one. Having said that, we can also see Malawi just about doing enough to come away with maximum points in the end.
