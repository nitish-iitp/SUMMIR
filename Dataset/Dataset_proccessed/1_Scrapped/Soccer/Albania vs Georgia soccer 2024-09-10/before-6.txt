NATIONS LEAGUE 2024/25: UKRAINE OPENS TOURNAMENT WITH DEFEAT AGAINST ALBANIA

07.09.2024 23:48

The Ukraine national team began their UEFA Nations League 2024/25 campaign with a match against Albania in Prague.

Serhiy Rebrov's squad gathered for the first time since EURO 2024 to start the new tournament. Ukraine kicked off their League B campaign with a nominal home match against Albania, held in the Czech capital. Dovbyk and Popov were unavailable for this match, and Mudryk was not included in the squad. However, debutant Kabaiev started in the lineup.

Early on, Ukraine pressed Albania deep into their half but struggled to break through the tight defense. Albania had their chance when Laçi fired wide from Mitaj’s pass. Later, Laçi missed another opportunity, along with a few other inaccurate attempts from the Balkan side.

Before the break, Trubin saved a shot from Asllani, and Laçi went close again from a corner. In the 43rd minute, Ukraine finally created a chance, with Yaremchuk’s near-post strike being stopped by the goalkeeper. Brazhko also missed the target after a corner.

The second half began with Kabaiev’s missed attempt. However, in the 49th minute, Ukraine took the lead — Mykolenko's cross from the wing was finished by Konoplya. Albania responded with a long-range shot from Manaj, but Trubin saved it. Moments later, Ismajli equalized with a header following a corner.

In the 56th minute, Tsygankov nearly scored from Shaparenko's pass, but his shot hit Ismajli. Albania replied with another effort from Ismajli on target. Strakosha then parried Brazhko’s long-range attempt, but in the 66th minute, the Balkan side scored again — Manaj delivered a cross from the left, and Asani finished to make it 2:1.

Rebrov’s substitutions aimed to boost the attack, but breaking through Albania's defense proved difficult. In the 83rd minute, Manaj and Malinovskyi exchanged missed shots, and Ukraine's other attempts also fell short. Ultimately, Ukraine could not secure a draw, losing 1:2.
