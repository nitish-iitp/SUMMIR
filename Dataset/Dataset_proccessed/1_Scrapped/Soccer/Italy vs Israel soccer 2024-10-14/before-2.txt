Italy lineup vs. Israel: Predicted XI for Azzurri's UEFA Nations League match

Continuing their quest for a place in the UEFA Nations League's knockout phase, Italy will aim to stay top of League A Group 2 on Monday evening, as they take on last-placed Israel in Udine.

Head coach Luciano Spalletti must make at least one change to the team that were held to a 2-2 draw by Belgium at Stadio Olimpico, as Lorenzo Pellegrini was sent off on his home ground and now faces a one-match suspension.

Having initially been left out of the Azzurri's squad for this month's fixtures, Atalanta BC forward Nicolo Zaniolo was quickly called up as cover and is one of several contenders to replace Pellegrini in support of lone frontman Mateo Retegui.

Perhaps putting his faith in youth again - after handing Roma starlet Niccolo Pisilli a first cap in Rome - Spalletti could turn to Daniel Maldini, son of legendary defender Paolo Maldini; however, Napoli forward Giacomo Raspadori heads the queue for promotion from the bench.

With Federico Chiesa, Gianluca Scamacca and Moise Kean all unavailable, Udinese's Lorenzo Lucca is the only alternative to in-form Retegui, but the towering striker is unlikely to start at his home stadium.

Influential midfielder Nicolo Barella is Italy's other high-profile absentee, so Sandro Tonali, Samuele Ricci, Davide Frattesi and Nicolo Fagioli are vying for three places in the engine room of Spalletti's 3-5-2 formation.

That setup can cater for three specialist centre-backs, but because leading defenders Alessandro Bastoni, Riccardo Calafiori and Alessandro Buongiorno are all left-footed they will not play together. AC Milan's Matteo Gabbia or versatile Napoli captain Giovanni Di Lorenzo should therefore start on the right of the hosts' rearguard.

While Andrea Cambiaso - the Azzurri's opening goalscorer on Thursday - and Federico Dimarco are generally preferred on either flank, Destiny Udogie and Raoul Bellanova are viable alternatives for the left and right wing-back roles respectively.

As captain Gianluigi Donnarumma is set to be rested, Udogie's Tottenham Hotspur teammate Guglielmo Vicario gets a rare chance between the posts.

Italy possible starting lineup: Vicario; Di Lorenzo, Bastoni, Calafiori; Cambiaso, Fagioli, Ricci, Tonali, Dimarco; Raspadori, Retegui
