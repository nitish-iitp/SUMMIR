Latvia have never won this fixture before

Latvia host Faroe Islands at the Daugava Stadium in Liepaja on Tuesday for the third place play-offs of the 2024 Baltic Cup.

Ranked 136th in the world, Latvia were beaten 2-0 by Lithuania at home in the semi-finals of the cup, ending their hopes of reaching a third straight final in the competition.

Armandas Kucys and Artūr Dolžnikov scored in the second half for Lithuania, as the 11 Wolves saw their winless run extended to six games in all competitions.

Paolo Nicolato's side will be looking to make amends here and win the bronze medal against debutants Faroe Islands, who were invited as guests to participate in the cup.
