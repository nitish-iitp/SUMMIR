Mali vs South Africa: AFCON prediction, kick-off time, team news, TV, live stream, h2h results, odds today

Mali and South Africa collide in their respective opening contests at the Africa Cup of Nations tonight.

With a host of top talent which plies its trade in Europe's biggest leagues, Les Aigles certainly have the ability to reach at least the last eight of AFCON for the first time in a decade.

South Africa are back having failed to qualify for two of the last three tournaments.

Mali vs South Africa team news

Tottenham midfielder Yves Bissouma will be key to Mali's set-up in Ivory Coast, while Kamory Doumbia is hoping to break out at the tournament after five goals in just nine caps for his country.

But injuries have taken their toll with Cheick Doucoure of Crystal Palace, Almeria striker Ibrahima Kone, Moussa Djenepo and Massadio Haidara all unavailable.

Bafana Bafana coach Hugo Broos hopes to have captain Ronwen Williams fit to keep goal despite a knee complaint.

Themba Zwane (knee) and Mothobi Mvala (groin) are also doubts.

The vast majority of the South African team is made up of domestic-based players and does not feature Burnley striker Lyle Foster, who declined to play at AFCON for mental health reasons.

Mali vs South Africa prediction

Goals are the big issue for South Africa and a talented Mali team may have too much for them.

Mali to win, 1-0.

Head to head (h2h) history and results

Two first-half goals helped South Africa to victory in their last meeting with Mali, a 2019 friendly in Port Elizabeth.

Mali wins: 2

South Africa wins: 1

Draws: 0
