South Africa’s Bafana Bafana, are poised to reclaim their former glory and make a lasting impact on the 2023 tournament following their return to the Africa Cup of Nations.

Overcoming a dark period of disqualification due to the oppressive apartheid regime, Bafana Bafana’s resurgence in the 1990s saw them clinch their only AFCON trophy on their debut in 1996.

The triumphant journey in 1996, marked by a resounding victory over Cameroon and a remarkable knockout stage run, set the stage for a memorable final against Tunisia, securing the coveted trophy. Despite subsequent years witnessing a dip in performance, Bafana Bafana is determined to rewrite their AFCON narrative and make a mark in the upcoming tournament.

As they prepare for Group E challenges against Mali, Namibia, and Tunisia, South Africa aims to rediscover the winning formula that propelled them to success in 1996.
