UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE
ANTHONY GORDON: ENGLAND MANAGER LEE CARSLEY HAILS NEWCASTLE WINGER AS 'REAL THREAT' AFTER WIN OVER REPUBLIC OF IRELAND
BYRHYS JONES

UPDATED 07/09/2024 AT 22:41 GMT

Anthony Gordon was a key attacking spark for England in their 2-0 UEFA Nations League win over the Republic of Ireland at the Aviva Stadium. The Newcastle player was praised by interim England manager Lee Carsley, who took charge of his first game as the boss in Dublin. Goals from Declan Rice and Jack Grealish, who had both previously represented the Republic of Ireland, gave England the win.

England interim manager Lee Carlsey has praised Anthony Gordon after his strong showing in his side's 2-0 win over the Republic of Ireland, where the Newcastle winger was a menace for the Irish defence.
The routine win, England's first in Dublin since 1964, kicks off Carsley's life as the temporary England manager and notches up an opening win in their UEFA Nations League campaign.

It was thanks to goals from Declan Rice and Jack Grealish, both of whom represented the Republic of Ireland in friendlies before changing allegiances to England. The pair had every touch and involvement booed by the home fans but they dealt with the heat.

Gordon also delivered an impressive performance, serving as a constant threat down the left wing. The 23-year-old opened up earlier this week about his disappointing experience at the Euros in the summer and his lack of playtime, but he was a constant outlet for Carsley's side on Saturday.
"On a really dry, sticky pitch, it's not often ideal for dribbles, but I thought Anthony was really good, a real threat," Carsley said on the Newcastle winger's performance.
"He's carried on his form from last season and he looks a real dangerous player."

'NO BAD BLOOD' TOWARDS IRISH SAYS GREALISH
The goalscorers were unsurprisingly greeted by a hostile atmosphere in Dublin which was only intensified by their goals. Rice decided against celebrating his effort, unlike Grealish, who incurred a showering of boos.
"They both took their goals really well," said Carsley.
"Really well-worked moves and brilliant finishes. I think they can both, moving forward, score a lot more goals and add goals to their game."
Arsenal midfielder Rice handed England the opening goal after 12 minutes, sweeping a right-footed effort into the top corner.
"Really good, obviously the manager's first game, and a win in the Nations League, obviously we're in the league below where we want to be so we know how important it is to win this group," Rice said.
"To come here and win today and to score alongside Jack, it was a really nice feeling."
Grealish doubled the scoring 15 minutes later with his shot after Rice pulled the ball back for him.

"It's what I think me and Dec expected," laughed Grealish. "Me and Dec have nothing bad to say. We both enjoyed our time playing here, I know I certainly did, and I have a lot of Irish in my family so there's no bad blood whatsoever from my side.
"I need to start playing regularly, scoring goals and that's what I did today. I still felt I'm not 100% fit but I'm getting there."
Carsley added that despite missing out on the Euros under Gareth Southgate this summer, Grealish does not have anything to prove to England's coaching staff, who know his talent.
"I don't think he has anything to prove to us, we can see his quality," he said.
"I think that'll have done him the world of good today in terms of getting another goal for England. Hopefully, he can continue that form."
PLAYERS TAKE THE CREDIT - CARSLEY
England's win was comfortable and, in truth, was sown up by half-time. Ireland swelled in the second half and England's dominance diminished slightly, but they spent the latter 45 minutes consolidating and defending the lead.
"I thought it was good in parts," Carsley said post-match. "You've seen some of the things that we've tried to do. I think that the lads have got to take a lot of credit, well all of the credit.
"I think we've shown that we've got some real talent and we can be really pleased with the clean sheet as well.
"I wouldn't call it my style or my way of playing, the players have got to take a lot of credit. The way they took on some of the things we've spoken about, moving the ball forward quickly, running forward and trying to get in pockets, I thought they've done really well.
"I think you've got to give Ireland credit as well, they're very resilient. They close the gaps as space becomes a little bit wider so we found it a little bit more difficult to get through them. But at 2-0, we were quite comfortable."
