1. Fall Protection, Construction

This year, OSHA cited 7,271 fall protection violations, which include scaffolds, ladders, and roofs. Fall protection not only had the highest number of serious violations but also the most willful violations during this period. Fall protection is required when employees are working at a height of six feet or more. Employers can prevent fall-related injuries by:

Ensuring workers have proper fall protection gear.
Inspecting and replacing worn or damaged equipment regularly.
Training workers on how to use and inspect fall protection equipment.
Analyzing job sites for potential fall hazards and taking steps to eliminate or reduce risks.
Implementing a comprehensive fall protection program, including hazard identification, training, and regular program reviews.
2. Hazard Communication, General Industry

OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) requires employers to inform workers about hazardous chemicals in the workplace. This includes labeling, safety data sheets, and employee training. Below are 5 tips employers can use to prevent Hazard Communication Standard violations:

Develop and implement a written hazard communication program that includes a list of hazardous chemicals present in the workplace and procedures for communicating chemical hazards to workers
Label all containers of hazardous chemicals, including secondary containers, with appropriate warning labels
Provide workers with access to safety data sheets (SDS) for all hazardous chemicals they may come into contact with
Train workers on the hazards associated with the chemicals they work with, including the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Use training materials such as a HazCom poster for daily refresher of crucial HazCom symbols and their meaning.
Regularly review and update the hazard communication program to ensure it remains current and effective
3. Ladders, Construction

Ladder violations occur when ladders are not properly secured, placed, or used. According to OSHA, roofing contractors were the top industry cited for these violations. Employers can prevent ladder violations by providing appropriate ladders for the job, ensuring ladders are inspected before use, and training workers on how to use ladders safely.

Ensure that all ladders are in good condition, with no missing or broken rungs, rails, or feet
Train workers on the proper use of ladders, including how to inspect them for defects and how to set them up safely
Use ladders only for their intended purpose and never as a substitute for scaffolding or other types of work platforms
Conduct regular inspections of ladders to identify and address any defects or hazards.
Implement a ladder safety program that includes procedures for identifying and addressing ladder hazards, training workers, and regularly reviewing and updating the program
4. Scaffolding, Construction

Scaffolding safety violations are common in the construction industry, with masonry contractors being the most cited this year for this type of OSHA violation. To promote safety, employers must ensure that scaffolding is properly constructed and that workers are trained to use it safely. Employers can prevent scaffolding violations by:

Ensuring all scaffolds are erected, dismantled, and maintained by qualified and competent workers
Conducting regular inspections of scaffolding to identify and address any defects or hazards. Inspection tags may be used to record and track this safety information
Training workers on the proper use of scaffolding and ensuring they understand how to inspect it for defects
Implementing a scaffold safety program that includes procedures for identifying and addressing scaffold hazards, training workers, and regularly reviewing and updating the program
Using only high-quality materials and components in the construction of the scaffolding
5. Powered Industrial Trucks, General Industry

Powered industrial trucks such as forklifts and pallet jacks are commonly used in warehouses and manufacturing facilities. OSHA requires employers to provide training for workers who operate powered industrial trucks. Employers can prevent powered industrial truck violations by using OSHA standards for workplace safety and ensuring:

All workers operating industrial trucks are properly trained and authorized to do so.
Trucks are regularly inspected
Trucks are used only by trained operators
6. Control of Hazardous Energy (Lockout/Tagout), General Industry

Lockout/tagout violations were the second most willful violations on this list. It occurs when machines or equipment are not properly shut down before maintenance or repair. This can lead to serious physical harm or fatalities if the machine or equipment is accidentally turned on.

Every year, far too many work accidents occur as a result of unintentional machine startups. This preventable tragedy resulted in 50,000 reported incidents and 120 tragic fatalities. These tips could save your employees from improper control of hazardous energy:

Create a lockout tagout safety program
Make sure that all moving parts of the machine have stopped before conducting any repairs
Remove any electrical connection from the machine
Lock and tag each machinery
Use high-quality locks and readable tags for the machines and equipment
7. Respiratory Protection, General Industry

Despite dropping from number 3 to number 7, Respiratory Protection saw an increase in violations in FY 2023. This rise highlights the need for employers to provide proper respiratory protection to workers who are exposed to harmful dust, fumes, or other airborne contaminants. Respiratory protection includes respirators, air-purifying devices, and air-supplying devices. Some tips to alert employers and prevent respiratory protection violations are as follows:

Assess the workplace for potential respiratory hazards
Provide appropriate respiratory protection equipment
Train employees on the proper use and maintenance of equipment
Establish a written respiratory protection program
Regularly monitor workplace conditions for harmful airborne contaminants
8. Fall Protection Training, Construction

Fall protection training violations occur when employers fail to keep fall protection training requirements for workers in the construction industry. Employers can prevent such training violations by:

Conducting a hazard assessment to identify any potential fall hazards in the workplace
Providing appropriate personal protective equipment to employees based on the results of the hazard assessment
Training employees on the proper use, maintenance, and care of fall protection equipment
Establishing written fall protection systems that outline the procedures for selecting and using fall protection equipment, hazard identification, and training
Regularly inspecting fall protection equipment to ensure that it is in good condition and functioning properly
9. Eye and Face Protection, Construction

Every year, 800,000 eye injuries occur in the workplace. Eye and face protection violations occur when employers fail to provide appropriate eye and face protection equipment for workers who are exposed to flying debris, chemicals, or other hazards. Employers can prevent eye and face protection violations by following these tips:

Make sure to have high-grade eye and face protection
Put precautionary and reminder signages on the workplace
Ensure that there is no shortage of eye and face protection for the workers
Create awareness for this particular risk
Engage in educating employees the importance of having eye and face protection
10. Machinery and Machine Guarding, General Industry

Machine guarding violations occur when machines are not properly guarded to prevent worker contact with hazardous parts. According to OSHA, approximately 800 people die and 18,000 workers suffer amputation, laceration, crushing, and abrasion injuries due to a lack of machine guards each year.

When operating machinery, machine guards are the first line of defense against potential accidents caused by machine malfunctions. Here are some tips to prevent these machine guarding violations:

Make sure that machine guards are not faulty
Do not forget to put on guards after machine maintenance
Do a check-up on machine guards from time to time
If necessary, change guards after a period of time
Rely on heavy-duty guard locks for the machines

 

What Employers Can Do After Receiving OSHA Citations

When an employer receives OSHA citations from OSHA, there are several proactive steps they can take to address the citation and ensure compliance with OSHA regulations. According to OSHA, employers have the following options:

Post the Citation

Upon receiving an OSHA citation, employers must post a copy of the citation at or near the place where each violation occurred. This is a critical step in ensuring transparency and in informing employees about the specific hazards identified by OSHA. The citation must remain posted for at least three working days or until the violation is corrected, whichever period is longer.

Correct the Violations

Employers must take immediate steps to address and rectify the cited hazards by the abatement date specified in the OSHA citations. This process involves implementing necessary changes or repairs to eliminate the identified safety or health risks. Employers might need to update safety procedures, repair or replace faulty equipment, provide additional training to employees, or make structural changes to the workplace. This demonstrates compliance and commitment to workplace safety.

Pay Penalties

Employers are required to pay the fines associated with the OSHA citations within 15 working days of receipt. OSHA fines are set within a minimum and maximum range, reflecting the severity and nature of the violation, from serious to willful or repeated violations. Timely payment helps avoid additional fines or legal actions and resolves the financial aspect of the citation.

Submit Abatement Certification

After correcting the violations, employers must submit an abatement certification letter to OSHA. This letter should detail the specific actions taken to correct each violation, along with supporting evidence such as photographs, receipts, or inspection reports. Providing thorough documentation assures OSHA that the recognized hazards have been effectively mitigated. Failure to abate also result to an OSHA fine of $16,131 per day unabated beyond the abatement date (generally limited to 30 days maximum).

Request an Informal Conference

Employers have the right to request an informal conference with OSHA’s Area Director within 15 working days of receiving the OSHA citations. During this conference, employers can:

Seek detailed explanations for the cited violations
Clarify the specific OSHA standards that apply to the violations
Discuss corrective actions and methods to address the violations
Address any concerns related to the proposed abatement dates
Review and improve employee safety practices
Resolve any disputed violations
Ask additional questions to ensure all concerns are addressed
File a Notice of Contest

If the employer disagrees with the OSHA citations, the proposed penalties, or the abatement dates, they can file a notice of contest within 15 working days of receiving the citation. This formal contest will be reviewed by the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC), where both OSHA and the employer will present their cases.

Contesting a citation can be beneficial if the employer believes the citation is unjust, the penalties are excessive, or the abatement period is unreasonable. It allows the employer to challenge OSHA's findings and potentially reduce or eliminate penalties. This process, however, can be time-consuming and may require significant resources, so employers should weigh the potential benefits against the costs.

 

Reasons OSHA May Consider Reducing Citations

OSHA may consider reducing citations and associated penalties based on several mitigating factors, including:

Good Faith Efforts: Employers who show a proactive approach to compliance and safety can indicate to OSHA that the violations were not due to negligence but rather isolated incidents. This includes having a robust safety and health program in place, regular training for employees, and a documented history of safety practices.
History of Compliance: Employers with a clean track record or minimal previous OSHA citations are more likely to receive leniency. A history of compliance shows that the employer generally follows OSHA regulations and that the current citation is an anomaly.
Size of Business: Penalties can be adjusted based on the size of the business, typically measured by the number of employees. This consideration helps ensure that penalties are fair and proportionate, not unduly burdening small businesses.
Immediate Correction: Employers who take swift action to correct recognized hazards immediately upon identification can be viewed favorably by OSHA. This responsiveness can lead to reduced penalties as it shows that the employer is actively working to prevent OSHA violations in the workplace.
Abatement Actions: Employers who show substantial efforts to implement long-term solutions to prevent future occurrences can receive consideration for penalty reductions. This includes investing in new safety equipment, redesigning processes to enhance safety, and continuous improvement initiatives.
