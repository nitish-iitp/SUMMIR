Artificial intelligence has entered the soccer arena, making predictions for the Copa America 2024. While AI favors Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia, its accuracy will be tested as the tournament unfolds. Will AI’s forecasts match reality?

Gone are the days when octopuses, armadillos, cats, and mystics held the mantle of soccer predictions. The digital age has brought a new celebrity to the forefront: artificial intelligence (AI). Even in soccer, AI now has its favorite teams and has already shown the ‘red card’ for the upcoming Copa America 2024. The tournament, set to take place in the United States, will reveal whether AI’s predictions are accurate when it concludes on July 14.

The Copa America 2024 is not immune to the influence of technology. AI now takes center stage in a shift from the days when predictions were the domain of mystics like the Mexican Brujo Mayor or animals like Norman the armadillo, Fedor, the tiger, Achilles the cat, or the unforgettable Paul, the octopus. ChatGPT, one of the most popular AI tools, has assessed the tournament’s likely outcomes and identified Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia as the top contenders for the title.

ChatGPT’s conclusions are based on the teams’ performances in recent tournament editions and their matches in the qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup. For Concacaf teams, the AI considered results from the Gold Cup and the Nations League.

Advancing to the Quarterfinals According to ChatGPT

ChatGPT predicts that Argentina, Canada, Ecuador, Mexico, Uruguay, the United States, Colombia, and Brazil will advance to the quarterfinals in the group stage of Copa America 2024. The AI goes a step further, forecasting the semifinalists and even the tournament winner. For instance, it predicts that Argentina will defeat Mexico in the quarterfinals with a score of [2-1], and Brazil will triumph over Uruguay with a score of [3-0].

According to ChatGPT, Argentina, led by Lionel Messi, will eliminate Mexico in the quarterfinals. Ecuador will triumph over Canada, Brazil will defeat Uruguay, and Colombia will oust the United States. This sets up a semifinal lineup of Argentina, Ecuador, Colombia, and Brazil, with the final being a replay of the 2021 final between Argentina and Brazil.

“Both teams have a rich history in Copa America and international competitions. On a good day, Brazil is capable of anything,” ChatGPT states. The AI gives Argentina the edge over Brazil, citing Lionel Messi and Argentina’s status as the reigning champions. “Given the talent level and recent history, my prediction would be a narrow victory for Argentina. The possible presence of players like Messi could give Argentina the emotional and technical advantage needed,” ChatGPT predicts. However, the AI cautions that “this prediction represents a challenge due to the unpredictability of soccer.”

Identifying the Weaker Teams

Another popular AI, Gemini, has also made predictions, focusing on the teams likely to perform poorly. “While Venezuela has the least favorable statistics and history, Bolivia and Peru could also underperform in Copa America. Similarly, Jamaica and Panama from the Concacaf side may struggle,” Gemini forecasts.

However, Gemini also acknowledges the complexities of making such predictions. “Although historical data can provide clues, it is complex and imprecise to predict with accuracy which will be the worst team in Copa America 2024,” it notes. The AI wisely advises, “Soccer is a dynamic sport with constantly changing variables. It is best to analyze the matches and enjoy the tournament.”

Given that Uruguay is currently second and Venezuela fourth in the standings for the 2026 World Cup South American qualifiers, even ahead of Brazil in sixth, these AI predictions could be called into question. This underscores the unpredictable nature of soccer, where statistics can sometimes fail to capture the true potential of teams.

Will AI Be Right?

The ultimate truth lies with the players on the field. From June 20 in Atlanta, Messi and his team will begin their campaign to clear the path for Argentina in the opening match against Canada. As the tournament progresses, the accuracy of AI predictions will be put to the test.

In Latin America, soccer is more than just a sport; it is a cultural phenomenon that unites nations and ignites passions. The foray of AI into soccer predictions reflects the region’s growing embrace of technology, but it also underscores the inherent unpredictability of the beautiful game. While AI can analyze past performances and statistical trends, it cannot account for the human spirit, a single player’s unexpected brilliance, or a match’s shifting dynamics. This celebration of soccer’s cultural significance in Latin America is what truly connects us all.

The use of AI in sports analytics is not new, but its application in predicting outcomes for major tournaments like Copa America marks a significant step forward. AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini can process vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and make informed predictions, offering valuable insights. However, it’s important to remember that these predictions are just one part of the puzzle. Human judgment and the unpredictable nature of live sports still play a crucial role, providing a sense of reassurance amidst the AI revolution.

In Colombia, for example, AI predictions might provide valuable insights for coaching strategies and player selection, but the emotional and psychological aspects of the game remain crucial. Colombia’s national team, known for its passionate play and skilled players, often defies statistical expectations, making it a perennial contender in international tournaments.

Similarly, AI predictions can inform strategies in Mexico, where soccer is deeply ingrained in the national identity. Still, they cannot capture the enthusiasm and unpredictability of matches played in front of passionate home crowds. The Mexican national team’s tournament performance often reflects a blend of tactical understanding and emotional intensity, elements AI can analyze but needs to predict fully.

Enjoying the Unpredictability of Soccer

Ultimately, soccer’s beauty lies in its unpredictability. While AI can offer educated guesses and highlight likely outcomes, the game itself is decided by the skill, strategy, and sometimes sheer luck of the players on the pitch. Fans across Latin America and beyond will watch eagerly to see if the AI predictions hold true or if the tournament will unfold unexpectedly. It’s important to remember that AI predictions are not foolproof and that the human element in soccer can often defy statistical expectations.

As AI continues to evolve and integrate into various aspects of sports, its role in soccer will likely expand. However, the essence of the game—its ability to surprise, inspire, and unite—will always remain beyond the full grasp of any algorithm. The Copa America 2024 will testify to this enduring truth, showcasing the dynamic interplay between technology and human talent in sports.
