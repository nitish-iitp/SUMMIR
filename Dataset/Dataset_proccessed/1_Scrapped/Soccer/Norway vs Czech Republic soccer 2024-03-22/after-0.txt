Pep Guardiola's warning might not have been heard at Manchester City with Erling Haaland starting for Norway in their friendly game against Czechia on Friday evening.

City fans were worried this week about Haaland's fitness. He was taken off the pitch last weekend and replaced by Julian Alvarez, which made people start to worry.

Haaland was then seen looking in pain during training with Norway. He finished training, but it gave Arsenal's title rivals more cause for concern.

Norway's doctors said after training that Haaland had 'no problems', and his national team allayed those fears further by naming him in their starting eleven - although he didn't see out 90 minutes.

His club have clearly taken a different approach to the one adopted by Mikel Arteta and Arsenal, with Bukayo Saka having withdrawn from international duty completely in order to avoid aggravating an injury while with the England squad.

And Pep Guardiola, the manager of City, might not be too happy. Before the players went to play for their countries, he told them to be careful in friendly games in the hope they would stay in top condition to face the Gunners, reports the Manchester Evening News.

He said: "They know that they fought a lot and train a lot, a lot of adrenaline and concentration to arrive in this position. They know they are friendly games and they have to handle it wisely. Hopefully they can do it."

Guardiola has reason to be concerned, with City still competing for a treble this season. The Blues have made it to the semi-finals of the FA Cup and the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Plus, they're just one point behind Premier League leaders Arsenal, who they'll be playing at the Etihad Stadium after the international break.
