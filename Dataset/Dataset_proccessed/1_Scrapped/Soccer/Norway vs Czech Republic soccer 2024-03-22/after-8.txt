Bay FC, supporters 'stand on the shoulders' of squads that came before

Officials with and supporters of Bay Football Club, the professional women’s soccer team that kicked off its inaugural season earlier this month, say they’re hopeful the third time’s the charm for the sport in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Bay FC’s debut in the National Women’s Soccer League, they said, already feels strikingly different from its predecessors, the now-defunct San Jose CyberRays and FC Gold Pride. Those clubs folded in 2003 and 2010, respectively, as did the leagues in which they played.

“We have this broad spectrum of people who are plugged in and know everything that we’re doing, and people who are just hearing about us for the first time,” said Danielle Slaton, one of Bay FC’s four founders and an alumnus of the United States Women’s National Team.

“There are times when I want to say it’s unbelievable the way that we have been embraced by the Bay,” she said. “But I’m seeing it, so it is believable.”

Bay FC will play in front of its home fans for the first time March 30 at San Jose’s PayPal Park, five days shy of the anniversary of the league announcing it had awarded an expansion team to an ownership group featuring Slaton, three other former USWNT players with Bay Area ties and the investment firm Sixth Street Partners.

Although the club will call San Jose home for at least five seasons, it has aggressively courted fans throughout the Bay Area. The club’s “Be Legendary” advertising campaign specifically names all nine Bay Area counties, including shots of landmarks throughout the region. Supporters in San Francisco and beyond have taken notice, tapping into a longstanding women’s soccer community and drumming up interest.

Christine Gayoso has been a staple in The City’s soccer scene for more than 10 years. As a co-founder of Kickit365, she primarily organizes adult soccer leagues and training sessions in San Francisco with her husband and co-founder, Paul.

Gayoso told The Examiner that she introduced herself to Slaton and Leslie Osborne, another one of the club’s founders, at Bay FC’s launch event in the Presidio last June. Slaton and Osborne helped Gayoso make contact with the club’s street team, which in turn assisted Kickit365 in coming up with events in San Francisco that would help spread the word about Bay FC.

Kickit365 hosted the club’s official watch party for the 2024 NWSL Draft in January at Richmond Republic Draught House on Clement Street with Bay FC’s Bridge Brigade Supporter Group, to give fans a space where they could watch the team’s roster take shape and be in community with others. The restaurant also hosted official San Francisco viewings of the team’s first two road matches.

The group will return to Richmond Republic at the end of the month to host its first bus trip to the Bay FC home opener against the Houston Dash. Gayoso told The Examiner that the trip is currently sold out, but Kickit365 is creating a waitlist and looking into reserving buses for future home games.

“Bay FC is developing at a historical time when all women’s sports are getting the attention they deserve,” Gayoso said of the club, which precedes the expected 2025 debut of a currently unnamed WNBA team owned by the NBA’s Golden State Warriors.

Gayoso recalled trying to cultivate a fan base for the CyberRays and FC Gold Pride, which played in the Women’s United Soccer Association and Women’s Professional Soccer, respectively. Both of those leagues dissolved, but the NWSL is on much firmer financial footing: Its new TV deals are reportedly worth $60 million per season, and Bay FC’s ownership group reportedly paid the league a record $53 million expansion fee.

But Gayoso said the NWSL side owes a lot to its predecessors.

“Every team that has come before has an important place in developing where Bay FC is now,” she said.

Slaton, who played in the Women’s United Soccer Association, echoed Gayoso when she told The Examiner that “I recognize very much that we stand on the shoulders of people who have come before us.”

The 43-year-old said that the Presidio launch event last June surpassed her expectations, to the point that she was almost moved to tears by the thousands of attendees who showed up to get a glimpse of their endeavor. Slaton said Bay FC’s season-ticket-holder event at PayPal Park conjured similar feelings: More fans than the club anticipated showed up to finally look at their seats and pick up a scarf as part of an inaugural gift.

The outpouring of support, Slaton said, has been “humbling, quite frankly.”

“We’ll just continue to move the sport forward where we have always wanted, and we’ve always expected and hoped that it will go,” Slaton said of building on the clubs that preceded Bay FC.

Slaton said it is not just critical for the club to recruit more fans, but to establish real connections with communities in the Bay Area. Earlier this month, the club traveled to the Tenderloin and attended the opening of the GLIDE Foundation women’s center. Bay FC players packed hygiene kits and handwritten notes that were distributed to the foundation’s clients.

Saundra Haggerty, a GLIDE program manager, said that the team reached out a few months ago to foster the relationship.

“We talked a couple of times before everything just came into place,” she said. “Once I found out that we had a women’s soccer team, I was very excited.”

Haggerty, who played soccer from junior high school until college, said she had been taking notice of the sport’s rising popularity in the country, particularly that of the women’s game. She said she identified with the club’s values of access and leadership.

“They’re a team and they’re working together to build something not just for themselves, but for future generations,” she told The Examiner. “When I got the chance to work with them and invite them and have them here, I jumped on it quick. I mean, why wouldn’t I?”

Haggerty said that the club was quick to dig into the organization’s work, and the volunteering players passed out 100 hygiene kits across eight blocks surrounding the GLIDE Foundation’s building. Some players were moved by the experience to the point that they came back the following day, she said.

Haggerty said the attention generated from Bay FC’s visit has led to increased volunteer requests, as well as more people coming to the foundation with their own ideas on how they can support GLIDE’s work.

“I’m forever grateful,” Haggerty said of the club’s contributions. Now, the GLIDE team is finding time in its schedule to attend a game in San Jose.

“A lot of us are gonna go down there,” she said. “We’re gonna support them now.”
