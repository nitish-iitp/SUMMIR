Ferdinand Rüesch, Member of the Supervisory Board of HEIDELBERG.

There will be changes on the shareholder side of the Supervisory Board of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG (HEIDELBERG) in the coming financial year 2024/2025. Dr. Fritz Oesterle will not stand for another term due to reaching the age limit. His appointment will end at the end of the Annual General Meeting on July 25, 2024. Ferdinand Rüesch will also leave the Supervisory Board at this time. He has informed the Supervisory Board that he wishes to retire and successively step down from all offices. He will hand over his position in sales at the Gallus Group at the end of the calendar year. "After more than 40 years of service in the printing industry, I would like to devote more time to my family at the age of 65," says Ferdinand Rüesch. "HEIDELBERG has developed well in recent years despite major challenges. The Management Board has introduced the right strategic measures to successfully face the changes in the printing industry and also to achieve financial progress," adds Rüesch. The succession for the positions of Mr. Rüesch and Dr. Oesterle will be decided by the Annual General Meeting of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG in July 2024.

"Mr. Rüesch and Dr. Oesterle have always played a valuable role on the Supervisory Board of HEIDELBERG. Their expertise, experience and tireless commitment have made an important contribution to the strategic direction of the company," says Dr. Martin Sonnenschein, Chairman of the Supervisory Board. "The search for a qualified successor for both of them has already begun. This will ensure a smooth handover and guarantee continuity on the Supervisory Board," he adds.
