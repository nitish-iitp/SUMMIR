LISBON FASHION WEEK
After a brief hiatus, Ambitious returned to Moda Lisboa, one of Portugal's leading fashion events.



In collaboration with APICCAPS' Portuguese Shoes project, we presented a selection of our FW24 collection as part of their runway show.




The Portuguese Shoes shows are always a highlight of Portuguese Fashion Weeks, showcasing the importance of the footwear industry for the national fashion scene and economy in general.




Here's a sneak peek of some of the styles you'll be able to find in our FW24 Collection.
