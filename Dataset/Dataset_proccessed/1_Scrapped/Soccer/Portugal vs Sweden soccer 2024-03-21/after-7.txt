FERNANDES SCORES AND ASSISTS AS PORTUGAL DEFEAT SWEDEN

Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes starred for Portugal on Thursday night, as he both scored and assisted in the Selecao's comfortable 5-2 win over Sweden at the Estadio D. Afonso Henriques.

Our skipper added a composed finish to Nelson Semedo's centre on the stroke of half-time, and then laid Bruma off for the substitute's second-half goal.

Bruno has now scored six and assisted eight in his last nine matches for Portugal.

United's Victor Lindelof captained Sweden in the match, but AC Milan forward Rafael Leao opened the scoring on 24 minutes, turning home coolly after Bernardo Silva's curled effort bounced back off the post.

Portugal's lead was doubled by Matheus Nunes with 33 minutes on the clock, as the Manchester City midfielder finished superbly following smart link-up in the Selecao engine room.

And then Bruno was in the right place at the right time to finish Semedo's low cross after the full-back got in down the Sweden left-hand side.

Twelve minutes after the restart, Bruno broke through on goal and squared the ball for recently-introduced winger to Bruma finish, but Sweden striker Viktor Gyokeres got one back just a minute later.

Goncalo Ramos then netted from Semedo's low cross to reinstate Portugal's four-goal lead, and Gutsaf Nilsson pulled another back for the visitors at the death.

Elsewhere, United Academy player James Scanlon became the first-ever Red to represent Gibraltar, coming on in the 74th minute as they fell to a narrow 1-0 loss against Lithuania in the first leg of their UEFA Nations League play-off leg at Estadio Algarve.

Julio Ribas's side will hope to overturn the deficit in the second leg at LFF Stadionas on Tuesday. On the same night, Portugal play a friendly in Slovenia and United's Diogo Dalot is expected to be available to play a part for the Selecao, as well as Fernandes.

Lindelof and Sweden will be looking to bounce back from Thursday's defeat in Monday's friendly against Albania in Stockholm.
