Manchester City’s Ruben Dias has shown off his latest radical hair transformation while on international duty with Portugal this week.

16 members of Pep Guardiola’s first-team squad have jetted off with their respective nations for the final time this season, as they look to stake claims to make their European Championship squads for this summer.

The final international break of the 2023/24 campaign comes at arguably the ideal time for Manchester City, offering the players, staff and the club as a whole the chance to mentally reset ahead of a hectic April fixture list.

But it isn’t just mentally that players have been resetting this week, with one of Pep Guardiola’s rearguard options taking the term ‘reset’ and utilising it in the hair department as he sported a new look in training this week.

Having switched between a sharp skin fade and more of a messy look during various times this season, Ruben Dias has now turned to the buzzcut as he looks to partake in Portugal’s international contests without injury this week.

Portugal are scheduled to take on two international friendlies in the space of a week as they host Sweden in the first of those matches, before travelling to take on Slovenia away from home early next week.

Pep Guardiola has three representatives of Manchester City in Portugal’s international set-up at present, with Ruben Dias and Bernardo Silva remaining mainstays, while Matheus Nunes looks to establish himself as a regular fixture in starting line-ups.

Manchester City’s players will then return to the City Football Academy towards the end of next week to finalise preparations for the Premier League showdown with Arsenal at the end of the month.
