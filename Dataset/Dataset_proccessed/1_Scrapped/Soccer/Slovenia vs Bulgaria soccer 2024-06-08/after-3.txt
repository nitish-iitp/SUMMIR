Josip Ilicic has been included in Slovenia’s final 26-man squad for the European Championship.

The 36-year-old had not played for his country since November 2021, as he has struggled with mental health problems.

He went home to play in the Slovenian league in October 2022 after his contract with Atalanta was terminated and he was in great form for Maribor last season, with eight goals and 11 assists in 31 league appearances.

Having initially been called up to their preliminary squad, Ilicic came off the bench to score the winner in Slovenia’s 2-1 win against Armenia on Tuesday.

Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig, Slovenia’s top scorer in qualification with five goals, is included in the squad, along with 31-year-old Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak.

Slovenia drew 1-1 against Bulgaria in their final warm-up match on Saturday. At the Euros, they will face Denmark, Serbia, and England in Group C.
