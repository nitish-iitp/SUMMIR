Thomas & Kaltak: Erakor village pair commands Vanuatu famous win over Solomon Islands

In a momentous match at Freshwater Stadium in Port Vila, Vanuatu, the national football team secured a historic 1-0 win against Solomon Islands. Central to this remarkable achievement were two defenders from Erakor Village: Brian Kaltak and Jason Thomas. Their outstanding performance not only fortified Vanuatu’s defense but also brought them closer to securing a spot in the semifinals of the OFC Nations Cup.

Brian Kaltak, the national team captain, was named Man of the Match for his stellar performance. He holds the distinction of being the only professional footballer from Vanuatu, having won the A-League twice in Australia. Kaltak’s professional experience and leadership on the field were evident throughout the match. His defensive prowess and ability to organize the backline played a crucial role in keeping the Solomon Islands’ attackers at bay. Kaltak’s journey from Erakor Village to international stardom has been inspirational, bringing immense pride to Vanuatu and serving as a role model for his teammates, particularly those like Jason Thomas who are looking to make their mark in international football.

Jason Thomas, who has played in various countries across the South Pacific, including Fiji and Papua New Guinea, recently returned to his roots at Erakor Golden Star in the PVFA Premier League. His experience and versatility were on full display as he partnered with Kaltak in defense.

The match against Solomon Islands was a tightly contested affair. Vanuatu’s defensive strategy, marshaled by Kaltak and Thomas, proved to be the cornerstone of their success. The pair’s communication and coordination were impeccable, thwarting numerous attacks and maintaining a clean sheet. The decisive moment came in the second half when Kensi Tangis capitalized on a set-piece opportunity, scoring the solitary goal that sent the home crowd into raptures and ensured a memorable win for the hosts. However, it was the relentless and disciplined defending by Kaltak and Thomas that laid the foundation for this triumph.

With this crucial victory, Vanuatu is now on the brink of securing a spot in the semifinals of the OFC Nations Cup. The win not only boosts their chances but also highlights the potential of Vanuatu football on the regional stage. Kaltak and Thomas’s performances have undoubtedly been instrumental in this journey, showcasing the talent and determination that exist within Erakor Village and beyond.
