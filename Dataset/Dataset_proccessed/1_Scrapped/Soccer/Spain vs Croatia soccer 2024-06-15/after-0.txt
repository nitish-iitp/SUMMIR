For the first time in 137 games, Spain did not complete as many passes as their opponents, and they could not be happier. The last time they “lost” possession was the final of Euro 2008 when they beat Germany to begin their most successful era at the feet of their greatest generation. This time – with no one left from Vienna and winger Lamine Yamal becoming the youngest footballer this competition has seen, a kid of 16 years and 338 days who was not even a year old back then – they defeated Croatia 3-0, bringing hope that maybe they can go back.

This was a new beginning, a new generation. And while it would be wise not to rule out another false dawn, the coach, Luis de la Fuente, insisting they would apply a “long view” their “feet on the ground”, it was quite something. Something different, for a start: fast, incisive and effective. Lamine Yamal on one wing, the 21-year-old Nico Williams on the other, Rodri and Fabián Ruiz impressing in the middle, Spain opened the group of death with a flash of life. Goals from Álvaro Morata, Ruiz and Dani Carvajal completed victory before the first half was out to reinforce suggestions that there might be a different direction they can take.

For Croatia, whose three midfielders, Luka Modric, Marcelo Brozovic and Mateo Kovacic have racked up 99 years and 375 games between them, it was a huge blow. It was not that they played badly – mostly they did not, and still less in the moments when they conceded – but ultimately this was a serious beating, and one that makes progress look a significant task. For the third Euros in a row they faced Spain, but it was not the same.

The talk had been of a twist on tiki-taka, the evolution of an identity. Even Rodri, defender of a philosophy, had insisted there was no such thing as style. That was an exaggeration, a message of concentration and competitiveness for internal and external consumption, but it was true that Spain sought something more direct. Vertical was the word he used. They wanted possession not for possession’s sake but with a purpose, a desire to do damage. That at least was the theory, a line De la Fuente insisted on repeatedly upon taking over from Luis Enrique. Few though truly saw it as a reality until it came into focus here.

Which didn’t mean not being Spain and it took a little while, underlining that this is a team of versatility, of “different qualities” as the coach put it. To begin with while the smoke and the song belonged to Croatia, the Olympic stadium decked in red and white checks and smelling of sulphur, the ball belonged to the selección. For a quarter of an hour they dominated, not allowing Croatia out, Rodri a model of recovery and recycling. As the 10th minute arrived, they were running at 70% of the ball.

And yet Croatia, football’s great resisters, might not have minded that, and would wrest a little control back. What was less predictable perhaps, and this was the key conclusion here, was that Spain would not mind that shift. The selección is now a team with the speed to run and the players to release those that can. It was when Croatia started to play, even to dominate, that Spain were most effective, the goal coming immediately after Ante Budimir had headed wide.

A single loose ball was enough. Marc Cucurella dashed to it, Rodri dropped it off and, first time, Ruiz set Morata away. One on one with Dominik Livakovic, he finished neatly. “A cheap goal,” the Croatia coach, Zlatko Dalic, called it.

It had all happened so fast. An equaliser almost came just as quick, Unai Simón saving from Kovacic. Instead, Spain got a second with similar speed. Another diagonal started it. Lamine turned into the area, drew players towards him and eventually found Pedri. He, in turn, found Ruiz and he cut right then left, evading two men, before guiding a superb shot into the corner.

Again, Croatia almost responded immediately. Again, Simón saved. This time from Brozovic, Lovro Majer hitting the side-netting with the rebound. Another great chance followed when Josko Gvardiol’s delivery went through Simón’s hands and somehow evaded Budimir. Dalic’s side had had more possession and more shots; Spain though had the lead and it would be widened when Lamine Yamal’s lovely delivery was volleyed in by Carvajal, sliding in like a striker. The teenager could have made it four, denied by an excellent Livakovic save.

At the other end, Cucurella made an exceptional block on Josip Stanisic. Croatia might have wondered how Spain had scored three and certainly how they had not scored any. The answer to the first part was offered up by a couple more outstanding runs from Lamine Yamal. An hour in and it was virtually done, even if there was time for a reminder of what can happen when the tension drops and concentration is incomplete. With 10 minutes left Simón lost the ball to leave Bruno Petkovic tumbling before an open goal, Rodri judged, perhaps harshly, to have brought him down.

Simón saved from Petkovic’s penalty but Ivan Perisic reached the rebound and gave it back to him to score. Or so he thought, until the VAR revealed that Perisic had encroached. He had moved too fast. Ultimately, so had Spain. And that was a start, something a little different.
