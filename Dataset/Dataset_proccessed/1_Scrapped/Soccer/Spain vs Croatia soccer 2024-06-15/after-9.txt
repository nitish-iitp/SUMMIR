Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

Measure advertising performance
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Measure content performance
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.
Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

Spain vs Croatia as it happened

Spain 3-0 Croatia: match summary

Let's get it right. Croatia were not completely outclassed by Spain in this opening Group B game as the scoreline may suggest to those who weren't watching.

That said, the Spanish side – one that included the exciting young Lamine Yamal – looked to have something special, and will give those that saw them as potential tournament winners extra confidence in their view. Attacking weapons across the pitch will no doubt keep opponents guessing where the next threat will come from, and perennial winner Rodri holding everything together in the midfield. The signs are positive, but we need to see how this performance evolves in the following games.

The Morata goal didn't come at a period of Spanish dominance, but when it was quickly accompanied by a delightful Fabián strike, things started to fall into place. Carvajal latching onto a dare-you-to-miss-this cross on the first-half whistle effectively finished this as a contest and no goals were seen in the second 45. Well...

A penalty to Croatia with just over 10 minutes remaining offered a chance to make things more interesting and when Petkovic finished off the follow-up pass after an excellent Simon save, that appeared to be where we were. A goal for the hard-working Croats felt fair too. But encroachment meant it couldn't stand.

Both teams showed enough to suggest they can make it out of this group, arguably the toughest of the lot, but Spain clearly now have the three points to set them up to take top spot and an expected easier route. Much will depend on what levels are shown when Italy meet a Serie A-filled Albania in the next game. Plenty of interest remains, but De La Fuente and his boys will be getting the plaudits for the time being.

An extended period of the aforementioned Spanish keep-ball ends with a Dani Olmo effort. The pitch seemed to open up for him as runners dragged out some of the central defence,

Spain doing what Spain do best

With 20 or so minutes remaining, Spain look to be aiming to take the sting out of this game. While Croatia are still pushing hard to make something happen, the passing around the middle of the park is becoming more of a temptation from the men in red.

Keep ball is something the Spaniards are well known for, and there are few that can do it better.

Half-time reflections

Let's take a quick look back over the main aspects of that first half.

The first thing to note is that although Spain had been tidy enough for the opening 10 minutes or so, dominating possession and territory, they hadn't really troubled Croatia, who came back into the game. When the opening goal arrived, there was little to choose between the two teams.

But when Morata showed the composure he did to slide the ball past Livakovic, it seemed to lift the whole group, and gaps began to appear.

Spain's front three were always on their toes as soon as possession was won back in the midfield and the direct forward passes proved fruitful.

Fabián's skill and finish will be on repeat for many. It was a delight. Then what feels like a killer blow came from Carvajal's toe on the whistle. A toe was all that was needed given the quality of the ball in from Yamal.

It didn't necessarily feel like a 3-0 half, but there's a sense that this Spain side has so many weapons with which they can hurt opponents. Can they also keep it tight at the back?

What did others think?

With likely the last kick of the first half, the veteran full back meets Yamal's deliciously swung in cross to nudge it past a helpless Livakovic.

The whole move should also get credited to Williams who had previously done tremendously well to win the corner, which was taken short to the Barça teenager.

The early push from Spain has levelled off in the last 10 minutes and Croatia now giving as good as they're getting, which, to be fair, isn't that much.

Words not noise

If you were just listening to the crowd noise and basing your understanding of what was happening on that, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Croatia had just carved their opponents apart and missed opening the scoring by millimeters.

What actually raised the volume was a simple long ball forwards which encouraged Simon to leave his goal area and head out for a throw in. Excited, them Croats are.

Morata tests Livakovic

That's the first shot! The Spanish frontman controls and fires goalwards with his left foot but the big keeper was quickly down to catch without too much bother.

As the move developed, it actually looked a whole lot more promising before it reached Morata. These decisions are going to be key.

The first proper threat, albeit not leading to an actual shot at goal, is created by Pedri, taking over from Carvajal in the inside right channel. The young Barça man finds Fabián at the edge of the area who tries to return it but the space quickly disappeared. Neat enough.

Spain maintain the ball for the first couple of minutes, teasing down the right, then back and trying on the left. Some neat footwork from Williams created a little buzz of excitement but the checked shirts of Croatia were quick to smother the threat.

EURO 2024

Euro 2024: what happens if there is a tie in the group stage? Tie-breaking criteria

As per the normal rules, a win in the group stage is worth three points, a tie gets a single point and there is nothing for a loss. 

Once all the games have been competed, the places in the table are known, but clearly there is a very good chance that teams could have the same number of points.

I thought you may want to know how UEFA determines the order so knocked out this quick summary for you.

"Since our first day here, it has been magical, seeing so many young people, young fans, and Croatia jerseys," said Ante Budimir ahead of this game. 

"I don't even want to think how it will be when we kick off in Berlin. Bring it on. We know the support we have from our people and we are truly grateful. We cannot wait for the Euros to start and to enjoy it."

Our man in Germany today couldn't agree more.

Yamal makes history

Are you sitting there, mulling over the line-ups and thinking to yourself that the youngster that has shone for Barcelona in the last year must be pretty close to being the youngest player ever to debut in a European Championship for Spain?

Well, you'd be right. Lamine Yamal rewrites the record books at just 16 years and 338 days. Thoughts already turning to him potentially scoring too and adding to the history making.

Modric: Madrid's champion

Obviously many eyes – including those of Spain's defenders – will be on Real Madrid's Luka Modric. Croatia’s captain was highlighted by La Roja's Rodrigo.

“Everything runs through him, you have to keep a close eye on him.”

The good news for the Man City midfielder is that despite success with Madrid, Modric hasn't done so well in this fixture.

EURO 2024

Who won the last European Championship and which country has the most titles?

Italy, as you may know, start off as the defending champions. The Azzurri lifted the Henri Delaunay Trophy at Euro 2020 which was delayed by a year due to the coronavirus pandemic. At Wembley of all places, Italy claimed their second title, denying England their first.

But did you know that there are two teams that share the most Euro titles in history? We took a trip down memory lane to reflect on the glories of Germany and, today's participants, Spain.

Has Spain or Croatia ever won the Euros?

Coming into this tournament, the furthest Croatia has ever reached has been the quarter-finals. They did this both in 1996 and 2008.

Spain, on the other hand, have been crowned Kings of Europe on three occasions. The first came back in 1964, and the other two (2008 and 2012) were part of an incredible few years for the nation as they also won the 2010 World Cup in between.

Croatia form guide

For their part, the Croatian team hasn't tasted defeat since the 2-1 loss to Wales in qualifying, last October.

In recent games they've beaten the likes of Portugal and Egypt in friendlies and although some of their bigger stars are coming to the end of their careers, they will hope to go out with a bang.

Spain form guide

Spain have won three of their last five (drawing with Brazil and losing to Colombia in recent friendlies) although we can go back further and say they've not lost competitively since the 2-0 defeat in Scotland during qualification for the Euros.

That was back in March 2023 and they've knocked in barrage of goals against many teams since.

Croatia's familiar face for Spain

As happens in international tournaments, players that are seen week-in-week out in domestic action swap shirts for their country. Croatian striker Ante Budimir has netted 16 goals this past season in LaLiga for Osasuna, and he could prove to be real danger to Spain’s defence. He did in fact score in Croatia's most recent friendly against Portugal.

How much of the ball he'll get to feed on, however, is a bigger question.

How do Spain usually start the Euros?

La Roja, as the Spanish national team is known, has proven itself nearly unbeatable in their European Championship openers.

Spain has lost only once in their initial game of this continental tournament and that occurred at Euro 2000 when Norway surprised José Antonio Camacho’s team in Rotterdam.

A goal by Iversen in the 65th minute, following a minor error by goalkeeper Molina, secured the victory for the Scandinavians. That year, the Spaniards went on to top the group (beating both Yugoslavia and Slovenia) and reached the quarter finals, going out to France with goals from Zidane and Djorkaeff cancelling Mendieta's penalty.

Euro 2024: Spain vs Croatia welcome

Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Spain vs Croatia as Group B gets into action. The tournament got going on Friday with top seeds, and hosts, picking up an impressive 5-1 win over a rather hapless Scotland, and Spain will be hoping to get off to an equally dominant start... although the Croatian team is likely to put up a more testing challenge.

Stay with me as I build up to kick off and then throughout the game until we hear the final whistle. Let's go...
