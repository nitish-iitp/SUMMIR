Group Review

Group B of EURO 2024, often termed the “Group of Death,” features a mix of former champions and rising contenders. Spain, a three-time EURO winner, enters the tournament with a new generation of talent led by players like Dani Olmo and Lamine Yamal. Despite the absence of key figures like Gavi, Spain’s possession-based style, complemented by dynamic wingers and a solid defense, makes them a formidable opponent. Italy, the defending champions, have undergone significant changes under new coach Luciano Spalletti, who has injected fresh talent into the squad. While their defense remains strong, Italy’s attack will heavily rely on the resurgence of players like Gianluca Scamacca and Federico Chiesa to overcome offensive challenges​.

Croatia, known for their resilience, are spearheaded by the evergreen Luka Modric and a mix of experienced and emerging talents like Josko Gvardiol and Martin Baturina. Despite a shaky qualification, their World Cup semi-final run underscores their competitive edge. Albania, the group’s underdog, surprised many by topping their qualification group, boasting a robust defense led by Berat Djimsiti. With Sylvinho at the helm and key players like Armando Broja, Albania aims to make a significant impact despite facing tough competition

Predictions

Spain and Italy are likely to vie for the top spot in Group B, given their depth and recent performances. Croatia, though aging, remains competitive and is expected to challenge for at least the second spot. Albania, despite their defensive solidity, will likely struggle against the more established teams but could spring a surprise if they maintain their qualification form.

Spain vs Croatia (June 15, Berlin): Spain to win due to their attacking prowess and depth.

Italy vs Albania (June 15, Dortmund): Italy to secure a comfortable win.

Croatia vs Albania (June 19, Hamburg): Croatia to win, leveraging their experience.

Spain vs Italy (June 20, Gelsenkirchen): A tightly contested match, likely ending in a draw.

Albania vs Spain (June 24): Spain to win, given their superior squad depth.
