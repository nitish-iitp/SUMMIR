Qatar are heavy favourites to win this AFC Asian Cup tie.

Tajikistan will take on reigning Asian champions and host Qatar in the upcoming Group A clash at the 2023 AFC Asian Cup on 17 January 2024 at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor, Qatar. The Maroons enter the fixture as favourites to win and secure their place in the Round of 16 as group winners. 

Tajikistan played a gritty goalless draw in their opening game of the tournament against China. However, the level of competition against the mighty Qatar will be at a much higher level. While the game plan would be to catch the Maroons by surprise and cause an upset, it’s going to be difficult to halt the juggernaut that is the Qatar men’s football team which is determined to achieve success in their quest to defend their crown.
