Mali play host to Mozambique in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers on Friday

Mali kick off their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign on Friday when they play host to Mozambique at the Stade du 26 Mars. This will be the first meeting between the two nations since January 2014, when Tom Saintfiet’s men picked up a 2-1 victory in their African Nations Championship clash.

Mali continued to struggle in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers as they were held to a goalless draw by Madagascar at the First National Bank Stadium in June.

Saintfiet’s side have now failed to win three of their four matches in the World Cup qualifiers to sit fourth in Group I with five points from a possible 12.

Having suffered a quarter-final exit from the 2023 AFCON, Mali will look to begin their quest for an eighth straight appearance at the continental showpiece on a positive note.

Mozambique, meanwhile, are eyeing a second straight AFCON appearance and just their second outing at the tournament since 2010.

Chiquinho Conde’s men endured a forgettable run in the 2023 AFCON as they picked up just two points from three matches in Group B to finish rock-bottom in the table.

Mozambique head into Friday’s group opener off the back of clinching third place in the 2024 COSAFA Cup in July and will look to keep the juggernaut rolling.

Mali vs Mozambique Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
This will be the fourth meeting between the two nations, with Mali claiming two wins in their previous three encounters.
Mozambique have picked up one win in that time, which came in April 1995, when they beat Mali 1-0 thanks to a 44th-minute strike from now-coach Conde.
Mali have failed to win five of their last six competitive games, losing twice and claiming three draws since beating South Africa 2-0 in their first outing of the year.
Mozambique have lost just one of their last eight games across all competitions while picking up four wins and three draws since January 19.
Mali vs Mozambique Prediction

While Mozambique head into the group opener as the more in-form side, home advantage gives Mali a slight upper hand here. That said, we anticipate a thrilling affair at the Stade du 26 Mars, with the hosts claiming all three points.

Prediction: Mali 2-1 Mozambique
