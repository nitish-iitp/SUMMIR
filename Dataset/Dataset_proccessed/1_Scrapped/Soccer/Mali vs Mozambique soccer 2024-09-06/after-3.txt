Mali had to battle back from behind to earn a 1-1 draw with Mozambique in their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying opener at the Stade du 26 Mars on Friday, September 6.

The Eagles were trailing at the break after Geny Catamo opened the scoring in the 37th minute, but they hit back through Yves Bissouma early in the second half to secure a point on home soil.

Tom Saintfiet was taking charge of his first match after being appointed head coach by the Malian Football Federation last week and his team made a bright start, getting off a couple of shots but neither one troubled Ernan Siluane in the opposition goal.

Instead it was the visitors that drew first blood in the 37th minute when Catamo timed his run into the box perfectly to latch onto Bruno Langa's cross to tuck his shot into the back of the net.

Saintfiet's side looked to respond and they went close twice in the final five minutes of the first half, testing Siluane with a shot and a header.

However, Siluane was nothing but a spectator early in the second half as Bissouma gathered the ball from Fode Doucoure and buried his shot into the corner of the net on 52 minutes.

Mali pushed for the winner and Siluane was required to make a save in the 80th minute, while he was relieved to see a wayward shot sail past his goal two minutes from time as the Mambas held on for a crucial point on the road.
