Already-qualified England got the point they needed to secure a top seeding at Euro 2024 with an unconvincing draw away to North Macedonia in their final qualifying match.

The hosts were awarded a controversial penalty at the end of the first half when England debutant Rico Lewis caught striker Bojan Miovski with his hand as he jumped up for a header.

North Macedonia captain Enis Bardhi put his side ahead from the rebound after his spot-kick was saved by England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.

England equalised in the 59th minute when Phil Foden's corner deflected in off Macedonian Jani Atanasov under pressure from Harry Kane.

The draw sealed England's place in pot one for the draw for next summer's European Championship in Germany as one of the top five group winners, with 20 points from eight qualifying matches.

Italy draw with Ukraine to clinch Euro 2024 place

FT: Ukraine 0-0 Italy

Reigning European champions Italy secured the point they required against Ukraine to qualify for Euro 2024 as Group C runners-up behind England.

A 2-1 win in the reverse fixture meant Italy only had to avoid defeat against Ukraine, with whom they began this crucial encounter level on points.

A frantic match in Leverkusen, Germany ended goalless to confirm the Azzurri's place in next summer's finals.

Third-placed Ukraine's qualification hopes rest on the play-offs in March.

Spurred on by passionate support at their 'home' venue amid Russia's ongoing invasion of their country, Ukraine had appeals for a stoppage-time penalty dismissed after Mykhailo Mudryk went down under a challenge from Bryan Cristante.

But Luciano Spalletti's side survived that late scare to ensure they will be present in Germany to defend their crown, qualifying for their eighth consecutive European Championship.

Wales' potential route to Germany
published at 22:21 Greenwich Mean Time 20 November 2023
22:21 GMT 20 November 2023

Wales

Wales would face either Finland, Ukraine or Iceland in a home play-off semi-final for Euro 2024 should they fail to qualify automatically.

And they would need to beat either Poland or Estonia in a one-off final to reach next summer’s finals.

Rob Page’s side can still reach Germany directly if they beat Turkey in Cardiff on Tuesday and Croatia drop points at home against Armenia.

But their Nations League status has guaranteed them a place in the play-offs regardless – with Monday night’s results confirming their semi-final options.

If Wales do enter the play-offs, a Uefa draw on Thursday will decide which of the three they would face in a single-leg semi-final in Cardiff on Thursday 21 March. The final would be five days later, Tuesday 26 March, with the hosts also decided by a draw.

Italy’s goalless draw with Ukraine and the Czech Republic’s 3-0 win against Moldova saw them both seal qualification on Monday night - meaning Poland and either Wales or Croatia would be the only sides from the top group of Nations League sides not to qualify automatically.

More from England manager Gareth Southgate, speaking to Channel 4: "The next exciting bit is the draw at the beginning of December and we will see what the path looks like and there are a lot of players to keep a track on.

"Trent [Alexander-Arnold] again did an excellent job in midfield, Rico [Lewis], Cole Palmer, there's plenty for me to think about."

England manager Gareth Southgate, speaking on Channel 4: "The really big results were in March, winning in Italy and the result against Ukraine. It meant coming here tonight was a different test, given we've qualified and everything was achieved.

"The mentality of the players was excellent, the quality with the ball was good on a very difficult pitch and a lot of positive performances."

On debutant left-back Rico Lewis: "He was excellent, his composure with the ball, the fact that he did respond to that set-back [the penalty], which was really, really harsh. He is a super footballer, he was excellent I thought and we're really pleased with him."

On centre-half Marc Guehi: "He has been excellent in every game and showed great composure and his defending has been good, taking what I've seen from him at his club to international football and that's not straightforward. He really looks a good player."

I think it’s OK to be disappointed. With the players they have and the last final under their belt, you want to see that next level of confidence in games, beating teams with passion and desire like you are the best team for a long time. Euros will make or break this era.

Graham, Canada

It amazes me the amount of criticism Southgate gets. When was the last time we had so much to be hopeful for with this England team. Be careful what you wish for!

Jay, Sussex

Chris: Southgate has used the last two games to give some players meaningful football and collectively they didn't press their claims. So being honest, of tonight's starting XI how many are nailed on starters if everyone is fit? Probably four or five.

There is no way that if it was the first game of the campaign Ollie Watkins would have started over Harry Kane.

It is interesting now that qualification is seemingly straightforward, we do qualify with games to spare, and regularly so now, that we have the chance to rotate and try out players.

Nations League games are growing in importance because of the ramifications of the options you have from gaining points in that competition. So it is a luxurious position to be in but these are the nights where you can experiment with the team.

'We can be really proud of how the qualifying campaign has gone'

North Macedonia 1-1 England

England

England forward Harry Kane, speaking to Channel 4, said: "Difficult game, we knew it would be and it was tough against a decent side playing on a pitch that's difficult to play our style of football.

"We went 1-0 behind against the run of play with a soft penalty. It was good to get on the pitch, I'm always trying to help the team whether it is 90 minutes or 10 minutes. It was important for us to get a goal back and a shame we couldn't get a second.

"I think it was an own goal, pretty sure. If anyone was going to get a second it was us.

"Against Malta we were sloppy on the ball, today we got a bit of a sucker-punch with the counter-attack and a soft penalty. We were playing against a team that people expected us to beat five or six nil, but they did a job on Italy in the World Cup qualifiers to knock them out.

"We can be really proud of how the qualifying campaign has gone."

On debutant Rico Lewis: "I thought he was really good with and without the ball. A shame for the penalty but he can be proud, I thought he was fantastic. He just needs to keep working hard and I'm sure he will be back with us."

75% possession, three times as many shots, and still N Macedonia had more shots on target. That's an issue with execution more than it is with tactics.

Matt

I dare say the same boo boys will jump on the bandwagon next summer when England are doing well.

John, Leicester

Have football fans always been like this? 7-0 seems to be the minimum requirement. It's a dead rubber involving a 3000 mile round trip, I think most were happy not to get injured - come on, we're going to the euros!

'Southgate had little option but to bring on Kane'

Matthew Upson

Gareth Southgate would have been looking at the game at 1-0 down and thinking 'I don't want a loss on our qualifying record', certainly not in this game.

The one obvious switch is Harry Kane. Can you bring him on in another role to accomodate others such as Ollie Watkins for him to have more game time? Well then you would be watering down the effectiveness of the best striker in the world.

I don't think he had much of an option.

FT: North Macedonia 1-1 England

England failed to beat a side ranked as low as 66th in the Fifa rankings for the first time since October 2016 in a goalless draw with Slovenia (67th at the time), in what was Gareth Southgate's second game in charge.
This was only the third time in their last 26 European Championship qualifiers that England have failed to win (won 23, drawn two, lost one). They've gone two consecutive away Euro qualifiers without a win for the first time since March 2007 under Steve McClaren.
England have benefitted from an own goal in consecutive games (Enrico Pepe for Malta on Friday, Jani Atanasov tonight) for the first time since June 2006 vs Jamaica and Paraguay.

It can be very difficult to break teams down away from home. It is a challenge, a very different challenge.

I wouldn't say that England have more trouble than what other teams would in situations against those low block defences.

I think we sometimes get carried away with showcasing our individual skills, we have some very talented players, and it is not direct or decisive enough.

You're looking at a performance that started brightly, positive, plenty of options and movement. They had control.

From there it went downhill really with the penalty and causing their own problems at times.

They got the equaliser in the second half and then there was very little in terms of positives. North Macedonia caused problems and England caused more of their own.

It was rushed, it became hurried, the quality went and the final product just wasn't there.

In the end, two flat games to finish the campaign with.

Italy, the Czech Republic and Slovenia have qualified.

Italy, the reigning European champions, held on for a 0-0 draw against Ukraine in Germany to scrape through thanks to a better head-to-head record over Ukraine.

England finish six points clear of Italy. Every Three Lions fan would've been delighted with that when the draw was made.

Czech Republic go through with a 3-0 win over Moldova, while Slovenia's 2-1 victory over Kazakhstan takes them to Germany.

You thought in the first half it was a matter of time before England scored one, two and three goals.

After the goal for England things have been rather disappointing and quite flat.

Clearly I'm in the minority but I think Southgate is a good manager. He has built a great unity and spirit in the group and got us far in tournaments. He does cause a lot of his own problems though.
