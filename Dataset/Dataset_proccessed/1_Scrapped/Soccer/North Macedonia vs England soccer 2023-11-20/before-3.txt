Everything you need to know about the Three Lions' European Championship qualification campaign.

Having reached the final of Euro 2020, England will hope to go one better at Euro 2024 and get their hands on the European Championship trophy.

And the Three Lions are well on their way to doing just that as they have secured qualification for next summer's tournament finals with two games still left to play thanks to their comprehensive 3-1 win over Italy at Wembley on October 17.

Currently at the top of Group C, Gareth Southgate's side haven't lost a match yet so far during the qualifiers, with five wins, one draw and a sizeable goal difference of +16.

Euro 2024 qualifying started in March 2023 with the group stage running until late November 2023.

England opened up their campaign with a 2-1 win over Italy on March 23. Declan Rice opened the scoring for the visitors before Harry Kane doubled the visitors' lead from the penalty spot. The goal was a landmark strike for Kane as he became England's all-time record goalscorer and overtook Wayne Rooney in the standings.

The Three Lions then defeated Ukraine on March 26 at Wembley, winning 2-0 thanks to goals from Kane and Bukayo Saka. On June 16, goals from Trent Alexander-Arnold, Kane, Callum Wilson, and an own goal gave England a 4-0 win over Malta. Saka, Kane and Marcus Rashford were among the goals as England routed North Macedonia 7-0 at Old Trafford on June 19. Southgate made a statement ahead of the double-header by dropping experienced campaigner Raheem Sterling, while Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze earned his first call-up.

Gareth Southgate's team shared the spoils with Ukraine in their second clash against each other on September 9, with Kyle Walker getting his first senior goal for the national team to rescue a draw.

The Three Lions then confirmed their qualification for Euro 2024 in Germany next summer after coming from behind to beat Italy 3-1 at Wembley inspired by a well-taken brace from captain Kane, while Rashford also got on the scoresheet.

England then eased past Malta in a 2-0 victory at Wembley with Harry Kane scoring his 62nd goal for his nation. Southgate's side now lock horns with North Macedonia on the 20th of November to round off their set of qualifying matches for Euro 2024.
