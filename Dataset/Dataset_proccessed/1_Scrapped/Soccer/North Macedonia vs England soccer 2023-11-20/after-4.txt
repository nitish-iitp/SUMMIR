HARRY KANE ON FRUSTRATION, A FINE 2023 AND LEWIS BOW
"It was a difficult game. We knew it was going to be tough, coming away from home against a decent side, playing on a pitch where it was tough to play our style of football. We went 1-0 down to a soft penalty, but then came out with a good energy in the second half.We got the goal and we were unfortunate not to get another goal to finish off the year with a win."
Asked about Rico Lewis' debut, he added: "(It was) really, really good; without the ball, with the ball. It was a shame about the penalty, but he can be proud of his debut."

ENGLAND CAN TAKE POSITIVES DESPITE UNDERWHELMING ONCE AGAIN
Lewis enjoyed a solid debut and was unfortunate to give away the spot kick that led to the opening goal.
Watkins failed to shine and Foden, TAA and Grealish didn't quite ignite but Guehi was once again very good at the back.
It's an unbeaten 2023, an unbeaten Group C campaign and the Three Lions will be in Pot 1 to avoid the strongest sides in the group stage next summer.
Job done.
LACKLUSTRE ENGLAND STAY UNBEATEN AND CLAIM SPOT IN POT 1 FOR EURO 2024 DRAW
England concluded their Euro 2024 Group C qualifying campaign unbeaten following a low-key 1-1 draw in North Macedonia.
The Three Lions, who secured their spot in the finals in Germany with two games to spare, could not sign off the year and the pool with the win they craved as the visitors produced a lukewarm showing for long spells in Skopje.
Gareth Southgate had called for a big performance after failing to impress at home to Malta on Friday, but England lacked tempo throughout the first period and fell behind in controversial circumstances four minutes prior to the interval.
Harry Maguire was fortunate not to concede a penalty for a clumsy challenge just moments earlier, but debutant Rico Lewis’ inadvertent arm in the face of Bojan Miovski did see the hosts awarded a spot kick following a VAR intervention.
Jordan Pickford saved Enis Bardhi’s penalty but the Macedonia No.10 was on hand to convert the rebound.
England stepped up a gear following the restart and after Jack Grealish had a goal chalked off by VAR for offside, the visitors levelled when Jani Atanasov diverted a right-wing corner into his own net.
The away side continued to push but never looked like nicking the winner on what proved to be a frustrating night overall.
The result sees England finish six points clear of second-placed Italy at the summit of the pool after the reigning champions secured the point they needed to qualify against Ukraine.
England will now look forward to friendlies with Brazil and Belgium in March as part of their preparations for next summer’s Euros.
