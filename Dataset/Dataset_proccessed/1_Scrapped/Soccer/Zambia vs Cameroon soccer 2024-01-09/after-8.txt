Zambia Statements

Avram Grant, Zambia coach, spoke to the media: “We have to be reasonable. We are in the third pot in Africa, which means there are two teams [in the group] better than us and they are better on paper, but of course Ivory Coast were also better than us [but we beat them in the qualifiers ].

“We need to be very realistic; We need to see what we have, what team we have and then we can get the best out of our team... And even if we are not at the top right now, this is our goal [to be at the top]. "
