Both looking to sharpen their tools ahead of ASEAN Championship action in December, Malaysia and the Philippines will clash at Bukit Jalil National Stadium for a friendly match on Wednesday night.

The Harimau Malaya suffered the disappointment of missing out on the next stage of World Cup qualification this year, and the same can be said for the Azkals.

Despite winning just one of their seven competitive matches in the 2024 international schedule to date, Malaysia have not embarrassed themselves on the international stage during this calendar year, earning draws against Asian powerhouses South Korea and Kyrgyzstan along the way also.

Harimau Malaya managed to qualify for the Asian Cup in January but did not achieve their primary goal of escaping the group stages of the competition in Qatar, where Wednesday's hosts collected just one point from three section matches, finishing behind Bahrain, South Korea and Jordan in Group E.

Following a sobering spell on the tournament stage at the beginning of 2024, Malaysia concluded their quest for progression to the third round of World Cup qualifying with four matches spread across March and June, although even a final-day win over Chinese Taipei was not enough to beat Kyrgyzstan to a top-two spot.

With their chances of competing at the revamped World Cup in the United States over, all focus for the Harimau Malaya will be on preparing for the ASEAN Championship in December, when they will pit their wits against Cambodia, Thailand and Singapore in a competitive-looking Group A.

Currently placed 147th in the FIFA World rankings - their lowest standing by that metric since 2012 - Philippines are going through a difficult spell on the international stage at the moment, as showcased by their inability to win a fixture since a 1-0 success over Kyrgyzstan in October 2023.

The Azkals failed to qualifying for the Asian Cup in Qatar, meaning that they were left twiddling their thumbs in January whilst the majority of the continent enjoyed a festival of football in the Middle East, before Wednesday's visitors endured a woeful end to terrible World Cup qualification campaign.

Two fixtures against Iraq followed by away trips to Vietnam and Indonesia all passed with the collection of any points for the Philippines, who finished bottom of their second-round section, earning one point from six matches, missing out on progression to the next stage by nine points.

Despite taking part in a wide range of international tournaments since the 1910s, the Azkals are yet to win a competition of note, although they did finish as the 2014 runners-up in the now-defunct AFC Challenge Cup, a tournament that looked to provide Asian's emerging football nations with a chance of picking up silverware.

Team News

Malaysia have an exciting new addition to their international ranks this September in the form of United States-born Wan Kuzain, who currently plays for St Louis City 2 in MLS NEXT Pro.

There has also been a maiden call-up to the Harimau Malaya for Mats Deijl, with the 27-year-old featuring four times in the Eredivisie for Go Ahead Eagles so far this campaign.

Philippines also have a player plying their trade in the United States, with attacking midfielder Zico Bailey employed by USL Championship side New Mexico United.

There is also a member of the Azkals squad who plays in the Netherlands, with Dylan Demuynck a fringe player for second-tier outfit Zulte Waregem.


Malaysia possible starting lineup:
Ghani; Davies, Mazlan, Tan, Corbin-Ong; Rasid, Laine, Rashid; Cools, Endrick, Josue

Philippines possible starting lineup:
Hansen; Rublico, Nyholm, Ugelvik, Woods; Ingreso, Baldisimo, Monis, Bailey, Demuynck; Reichelt



We say: Malaysia 2-0 Philippines

Boasting a better record in 2024 and home advantage, Malaysia should be confident of recording a friendly success over the Philippines on Wednesday night.

As was the case with their most recent victory over Chinese Taipei in June, we are expecting Harimau Malaya to win this contest by two clear goals.
