It polled 8,000 respondents in 11 countries and markets- Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.

"We see an underlying positivity around entrepreneurship in the region. In the survey, many small business owners in APAC expect 2024 to be a better year for business than the last, but starting a new business can be daunting.
