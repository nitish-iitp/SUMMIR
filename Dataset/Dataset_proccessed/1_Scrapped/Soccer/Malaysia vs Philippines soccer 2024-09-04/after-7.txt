THE Philippines was nipped by host Malaysia, 2-1, despite scoring the opening goal to be relegated to the battle-for-third of the Merdeka Cup at the Bukit Jalil Stadium in Kuala Lumpur.

Jefferson Tabinas scored a goal in the 27th minute, a cross that was deflected by a Malaysia defender and into the back of the net, but the Philippines still lost even as the match was not without a couple of contentious moments in the final minutes.

PMNT took exception to two non-calls that the team felt should have been awarded with a penalty, including one in the 85th minute where Sandro Reyes was brought down inside the box.

Reyes was given a yellow card for unsporting behavior after complaining to the referee.

Malaysia equalized on a straight-away shot by Mohammad Syamer Bin Kutty Abba just outside the box in the 43rd, then took the lead on a penalty kick by substitute Muhammad Safawi Bin Rasid in the 73rd minute after a challenge by Matthew Baldisimo on Mohd Afiq Bin Fazail.

The Philippines will face Tajikistan in the third place match on Sunday. Tajikistan lost to Lebanon, 1-0, earlier in the day.

The gallant fight came after a late change in the coaching staff after head coach Tom Saintfiet left to accept a similar role with Mali.

Assistant coach Norman Fegidero took over on an interim basis, with the women’s football team coaching staff led by Mark Torcaso also joining the camp in Malaysia.
