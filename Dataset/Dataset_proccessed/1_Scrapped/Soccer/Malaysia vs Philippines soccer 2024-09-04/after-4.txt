Safawi's penalty seals Malaysia's hard-fought win over Philippines [WATCH]
By K. Rajan - September 4, 2024 @ 3:21pm

KUALA LUMPUR: Safawi Rasid's penalty sealed a 2-1 victory for jaded Malaysia over the Philippines to reach the Merdeka Tournament final at the National Stadium in Bukit Jalil today.

World No. 134 Malaysia were expected to steamroll past the ill-prepared No. 147 Azkals, but interim coach Pau Marti Vicente was made to sweat before starting his reign with a win.

With the victory, Malaysia will face world No. 113 Lebanon, who edged Tajikistan 1-0 earlier, in Sunday's final.

Both teams were sluggish in the opening 20 minutes before the Azkals broke the deadlock.

Right-back Jefferson Tabinas' speculative attempt was turned into an own goal by Feroz Baharuddin in the 27th minute.

The goal jolted Malaysia into action, but they lacked bite up front and struggled to breach the stubborn Filipino defence.

Harimau Malaya finally got their equaliser through Syamer Kutty Abba, whose powerful drive hit the back of the net in the 42nd minute.

The second half was another cagey affair as both teams played cautiously, focusing on tight defence.

Malaysia took the lead through a spot-kick after defender Matthew Baldisimo brought down Arif Aiman Hanapi inside the box, prompting Indonesian referee Yudi Nurchaya to point to the spot.

Safawi calmly slotted the penalty past Filipino custodian Neil Etheridge in the 72nd minute.

The final 10 minutes saw the Philippines pushing hard for an equaliser, but Malaysian goalkeeper Ahmad Syihan Hazmi managed to hold firm for the win.

Syamer said: "I dedicate my goal to my father, who is celebrating his birthday soon.

"Despite the win, we must work on our game before we face Lebanon in the final."
