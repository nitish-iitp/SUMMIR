Ukraine meet Iceland in UEFA Euro 2024 qulifying on Tuesday.

Ukraine entertain Iceland at the Tarczyński Arena in Wroclaw, Poland, in UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying on Tuesday.

Ukraine narrowly missed a direct qualification in the group stage, as they finished third, level on 14 points with second-placed Italy. The Azzurri snatched Group C’s second ticket based on superior head-to-head points (4-1). Ukraine, though, advanced to the playoffs, beating Bosnia and Herzegovina 2-1 in Path B semi-finals.

The Blue and Yellow are eying a fourth back-to-back participation in the UEFA European Championship since 2012. Ukraine are on a fine run of form and will hope to stretch their unbeaten streak to six games when they take on Iceland. The two sides last met in September 2017, with Iceland prevailing 2-0 at home.
