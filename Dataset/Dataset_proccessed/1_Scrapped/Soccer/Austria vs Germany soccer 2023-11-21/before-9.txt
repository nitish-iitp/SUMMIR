SPREADING WARMTH IN SO MANY WAYS

Whether it is bedtime stories to take away, touching hotline announcements or the longest smile in the world: the Vaillant Group supports SOS Children’s Villages with social projects that go beyond heating technology. An overview of our campaigns shows the diversity of the ideas and how motivated our employees are in supporting a good cause.



Vaillant Group

Health insurance for Ukraine

To ensure that children can get the help they need, the Ukrainian Vaillant sales company has been financing health insurance for 75 orphans for several years. Among other things, they now receive professional support that helps them process traumatic experiences.

When it’s worth the wait

No one likes waiting on hold on the phone – but what if the whole thing was for a good cause? That was the idea our colleagues in Austria had, and in the summer of 2018 they paid 50 cents for every minute callers spent on the Vaillant service hotline. In this way, a total of 10,000 euros was collected for SOS Children’s Villages. A clip with the voice of a child from an SOS Children’s Village informed the callers about the donation mechanism.

A skate park for Syria

Skating is a sport loved by children and young people around the world. That’s why the skate-aid initiative and SOS Children’s Villages joined forces to build a skate park in the Children’s Village in Damascus, Syria. The Vaillant Group supported the crowdfunding with communications work.

Hare contest for the Vaillant Advent calendar

Christmas starts early in the workshop of the SOS Children’s Village in Lüdenscheid: even at Easter, the children put their creativity to work for the Vaillant Advent calendar. The only condition is that the Vaillant hare must be visible in the pictures. A jury then selects the motif that will adorn the next calendar as the cover picture from among all the works of art. As a thank you, the winner gets a trip to an amusement park together with the other children in the small artists’ collective.

Vaillant Group

Double the joy for every goal

We have organised our own “Vaillant World Cup” with mixed teams from over 20 sales companies competing against each other. This campaign is fun, strengthens the sense of community and benefits the SOS Children’s Villages: for every goal scored, 10 euros are donated to the charity. In 2014, 240 goals were scored during the tournament, and in 2018 it was as many as 345. In both years, we rounded up the donation amount to 5,000 euros.

Vaillant Group

Bedtime stories to take away

Reading a story to children in the evening is an established ritual in many families. The children who go to other institutions after a stopover in the so-called clarification group at the SOS Children’s Village Lüdenscheid might have to do without this important ritual. We give them a Toniebox as a farewell gift so they can take a bedtime story with them to their new home.

Vaillant Group

Recycled, auctioned and donated

In 2014, we went on a roadshow with our trucks to mark our 140th anniversary. The tarpaulins of the trucks were processed into high-quality bags in the workshops of Lebenshilfe and auctioned off among employees. The proceeds went to SOS Children’s Villages.

Vaillant Group

A small amount with a big impact: cent remainder donation

Tick a box once and do good in the long term – that is the core idea of the cent remainder donation. The idea is simple: Vaillant employees in Germany can automatically donate the amount after the decimal point of their monthly salary to SOS Children’s Villages. For the individual employees, this is a maximum of 99 cents – but since around 1,000 colleagues are taking part, large sums are raised every year.

Vaillant Group

1,000 books in the Himalayas

The SOS Children’s Village Lhasa is not easy to reach. It is located high in the Himalayas at an altitude of over 3,500 metres. Nevertheless, in 2014 our Chinese colleagues set out to deliver more than 1,000 books, sports equipment and school stationery to the children and young people of the SOS Children’s Village.

Vaillant Group

Red nose, good cause

Laughter is the best medicine: in 2016, artists from Clowns Without Borders travelled to the SOS Children’s Village Cochabamba in Bolivia. In a workshop, they taught the children living there how to express their feelings and process traumatic experiences. The Vaillant Group supported this project.

Vaillant Group

The longest smile in the world

Quite literally supporting social projects with a smile: in the international #vaillantsmile campaign, we collected selfies of smiling people around the world. For each photo, a donation was made to an important SOS Children’s Villages project. In this way, a chain of smiles was created that connects people and supports children and families.

Vaillant Group

Sport that pays off

Employees at Saunier Duval, the French brand of the Vaillant Group, provide support through sport. Every year, our colleagues there take part in charity runs and a sailing regatta to collect money for SOS Children’s Villages. In addition to the financial aspect, the concept of a sporting community is also important: children from the SOS Children’s Villages are invited to participate, too.

Heroes for a warm home – Coenraad de Beer

The South African has been working for SOS Children’s Villages for over 20 years. The reason he feels so passionate about his work is the fact that children and young people who have experienced trauma are often left on the margins of society without adequate support.
