Marcel Sabitzer set Austria on the way to a friendly win over Germany. - © IMAGO
BUNDESLIGA
Bundesliga-heavy Austria beat Julian Nagelsmann's Germany in friendly
22.11.2023

Bundesliga duo Marcel Sabitzer and Christoph Baumgartner were on target as Austria inflicted a second straight loss on Julian Nagelsmann's Germany.

Austria 2-0 Germany
Goals: 1-0 Sabitzer 29' (assist: Baumgartner), 2-0 Baumgartner 73' (assist: Gregoritsch)
Sent off: Sané 49'


Beaten 3-2 by Turkey at the weekend, Germany were on the backfoot for much of the first half in Vienna. RB Leipzig's Baumgartner hit a deflected shot wide, before Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp denied Freiburg striker Michael Gregoritsch in a promising one-on-one. Ralf Rangnick's team were eventually rewarded for their bright start just shy of the half-hour mark when Borussia Dortmund midfielder Sabitzer capped a quick counter with an unerring finish past Trapp. Sané - flying domestically for Bayern Munich - warmed the palms of Alexander Schlager in response, but Austria ended the half in the ascendancy as Baumgartner zipped an effort wide.

Germany's task was made a whole lot harder early in the second half when Sané was shown a straight red card following an altercation with ex-Mainz man Phillipp Mwene. Substitute Benjamin Henrichs sent a free-kick wide in a rare moment of promise for the visitors, who were indebted to Trapp for thwarting Gregoritsch soon after. Trapp could do nothing to prevent Baumgartner calmly slotting in a second Austria goal, though, after smart hold-up play from Gregoritsch. Germany substitutes Florian Wirtz and Marvin Ducksch threatened a response, but Austria were otherwise untroubled and might have added to their lead but for Trapp's late save from substitute Matthias Seidl.
