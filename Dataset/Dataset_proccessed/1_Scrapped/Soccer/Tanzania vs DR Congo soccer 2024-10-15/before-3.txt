The top two teams in Group H of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers will do battle at the Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium as Tanzania entertain the challenge of Congo DR on Tuesday.
 
The hosts will be aiming to bounce from a narrow defeat at the hands of their visitors, who are currently one win away from guaranteeing themselves a place in Morocco.

Congo DR just about did enough to edge out Tanzania 1-0 and come away with maximum points from Thursday's meeting between the teams at Stade des Martyrs.
 
In a game where clear-cut chances were few and far between, Sebastien Desabre's men needed a stroke of luck to get the job done as Clement Mzize turned the ball past his own goalkeeper in the early exchanges of the second period to settle matters.
 
One of six teams still with a perfect record in the AFCON qualifiers, Les Leopards currently lead the way in Group J, five points clear of nearest challengers and next opponents Tanzania in second place.
 
Following their most recent triumph, Congo DR have now won four games on the spin and are also unbeaten in five since losing their AFCON third-place encounter against South Africa in February.
 
All four wins for Tuesday's visitors have come without letting in a goal, and that kind of defensive solidity bodes well for their chances of securing a clinching victory on enemy territory.
 
On another day, Tanzania could have headed into Tuesday's clash against Congo DR sitting top of the group but were unable to make their dominance count in Kinshasa last time out.
 
That was only a first defeat in six games across all competitions for Hemed Suleiman's men, dating back to a friendly 2-1 defeat to Sudan back in May, after which they had picked up three wins and two draws.
 
Tanzania have not lost consecutive games in competitive outings since 2022, and it is imperative the Taifa Stars keep that record intact heading into their final three qualifying matches.
 
Sitting one and three points clear of Guinea and Ethiopia respectively, Tanzania will now have to navigate a three-way battle in the race to qualify alongside Congo DR, who already have one foot in the 2025 AFCON.
 
Tuesday's hosts have games against Guinea and Ethiopia to come next month, and a victory in their next outing would leave them in the driving seat ahead of November's concluding fixtures.

Meschack Elia had to be hauled off with an injury scare just past the hour mark last time out, and the winger is a major doubt for Congo DR here.
 
Should Elia fail to recover in time to feature for the away side, Silas Katompa Mvumpa is most likely to earn a recall to the lineup to feature on the left-hand side of the attacking trio.
 
With no fresh injury or suspension concerns for Tanzania, head coach Hemed Suleiman might be tempted to name an unchanged XI, although the short turnover between both games against Congo DR could influence his thinking otherwise.
 
Still awaiting his first international goal after six outings, 20-year-old Clement Mzize is at risk of dropping to the bench for this one, with Cyprian Kachwele poised to take his place.


Tanzania possible starting lineup:
Juma; Husseini, Bacca, Job, Mwaikenda; Yahya, Salum, Bitegeko; Kibu, Samatta, Mzize

Congo DR possible starting lineup:
Bertaud; Masuaku, Inonga, Mbemba, Kalulu; Moutoussamy, Kayembe, Pickel; Bongonda, Mvumpa, Essende




We say: Tanzania 0-1 Congo DR

Congo DR are looking unbeatable at the moment, and with AFCON qualification now within touching distance, we expect them to be fully up for Tuesday's affair.
 
We are tipping the away side to narrowly see off their hosts and come out on top when all is said and done.
