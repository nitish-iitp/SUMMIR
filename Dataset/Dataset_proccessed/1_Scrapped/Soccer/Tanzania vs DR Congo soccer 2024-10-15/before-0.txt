Ethiopia will be looking to secure their first win of the 2025 African Cup of Nations qualifiers when they go head to head with Guinea in the second of their October double-header on Monday.

The Syli National return to the Alassane Ouattara Ebimpe Olympic Stadium off the back of securing a resounding victory when the two nations met on Saturday and will set out in search of a sixth consecutive victory over the home side.

Ethiopia failed to get up and running in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers as they suffered a humbling 4-1 loss against Guinea in the first of their Group H double-header on Saturday.

Borussia Dortmund striker Serhou Guirassy turned in a superb individual display at the Ouattara Ebimpe Olympic Stadium as he netted a first-half hat-trick to inspire Guinea to a commanding victory, with Canaan Markneh grabbing a consolation goal for the visitors in the 53rd Morte.

Before that, Ethiopia kicked off their quest for an 11th AFCON appearance on September 4, when they played out a goalless draw with Tanzania at the Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium, five days before losing 2-0 against Congo DR.

Gebremedhin Haile's men have now failed to taste victory in any of their most recent eight competitive matches, claiming four draws and losing four, including a 3-0 defeat at the hands of Burkina Faso in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier.

As for Guinea, head coach Charly Paquille will breathe a huge sigh of relief following Saturday's emphatic victory, having suffered defeat in each of their opening two games to start the qualifying campaign.

The Syli National were beaten 1-0 by Congo DR in the Group H curtain-raiser on September 6, when Edo Kayembe netted the only goal of the game to hand the Leopards all three points, four days before losing 2-1 against Tanzania at the Charles Konan Banny Stadium.

With three points from the first nine available, the 1976 AFCON runners-up currently sit third in the Group H standings, one point behind second-placed Tanzania in the second qualifying spot and two above Monday's hosts at the bottom of the pile.

Guinea will be backing themselves to secure back-to-back competitive wins for the first time since March 2023 on Monday as they take on an opposing side who have lost each of their last five encounters, conceding 13 goals and scoring four since a 1-0 victory in October 2002.

Following their disappointing defeat on Saturday, Haile could ring a few changes at the defensive end of the pitch, with Ramkel James coming into the fold, having replaced Yared Baye at half time.

However, we expect an unchanged front three of Chernet Gugsa, Markneh and 28-year-old forward Abel Yalew, while Surafel Dagnachew, Gatoch Panom and Abinet Demissie should start in midfield.

With his hat-trick in Saturday's reverse fixture, Guirassy now has nine goals in seven games for club and country this season and we expect the Dortmund striker to spearhead Guinea's attack once again.

Mady Camara was forced off injured deep into the second half on Saturday and the PAOK midfielder, who made his debut in September 2018, is a doubt for Monday's clash.

Should he fail to shake off the injury, 24-year-old Cheick Oumar Conde will push for a place in the XI, teaming up with Seydoubah Cisse and Le Havre midfielder Abdoulaye Toure in the centre of the park.


Ethiopia possible starting lineup:
Habtamu; Hamid, James, Kasa, Berhane; Panom, Demissiex Dagnachew; Gugsa, Markneh, Yalew

Guinea possible starting lineup:
Camara; Diakite, Sow, Conte, I Sylla; Conde, Cisse, Toure; M Sylla, Guirassy, Kamano


We say: Ethiopia 1-3 Guinea

Buoyed by their dominant display on Friday, Guinea will return to the Ouattara Ebimpe Olympic Stadium with sky-high confidence as they look to move into the qualifying places.

While we expect Ethiopia to go all out as they seek to restore their pride and kick-start their qualifying journey, Paquille's men boast the firepower needed to get the job done and we are backing them to extend their dominance in this fixture.
