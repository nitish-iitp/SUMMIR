Preview: Azerbaijan vs. Bulgaria - prediction, team news, lineups

Azerbaijan welcome Bulgaria to the capital city of Baku in the next instalment of the brand-new FIFA Series on Monday.

Both nations beat non-UEFA minnows on Friday and will now battle to see who will come out on top from this four-team section.

Azerbaijan flattered to deceive in their opening game of this international break, only edging past 66-1 outsiders Mongolia by a solitary goal to nil.

The Asian outfit are one of the poorest in the AFC confederation, having already been knocked out of World Cup qualifying by Afghanistan and recently suffering a 14-0 defeat to Japan.

However, Azerbaijan needed a stoppage-time goal from Bahlul Mustafazada to overcome Mongolia, avoiding a rather embarrassing result for the Milli Komanda.

Caretaker manager Arif Asadov did at least see his side dominate proceedings, with 30 shots, 10 on target, and 73% possession, but the lack of a cutting edge was worrying.

That comes as something of a surprise considering it has been just four months since the Azeris beat Sweden 3-0 in Euro 2024 qualifying.

However, starting 2024 with a win is a positive nonetheless, as Azerbaijan will look to replicate the sort of form they showed at the end of 2022, when they won five in a row before coming up against much superior opposition for most of last year.

They will need to earn a first-ever win over Bulgaria if they are to continue on the right path heading into the UEFA Nations League in the autumn, though.

Bulgaria won both meetings when the two met in Euro 2016 qualifying, but they bring very little form into 2024.

A win over Tanzania on Friday was a good start, but that was expected of Ilian Iliev's side, as the victory over the African side was their first in 18 months.

Kiril Despodov got the only goal for the Lavovete, but it was still a hugely underwhelming performance from Bulgaria, who had just 35% possession on the evening and created few clear opportunities.

After finishing bottom of their Euro 2024 qualifying group below Lithuania, vast improvement is needed.

Drawing 2-2 in their final two qualifiers against Hungary and Serbia, only missing out on victory by late equalisers in both, seemed to be a step in the right direction, but after Friday's performance, this game will take on even more importance.

After handing a debut to 20-year-old stopper Rza Cafarli against Mongolia, Asadov may reinstate Shahruddin Mahammadaliyev in the Azerbaijan goal for this encounter.

Mahammadaliyev is set to feature behind three of his former Qarabag teammates too, with Elvin Cafarquliyev likely to keep current club mate Toral Bayramov out at left-back.

On the injury front, Mahir Emreli and Anton Kryvotsyuk have both missed out on this camp after featuring for the side in November.

Bulgaria saw Todor Nedelev and Ivan Turitsov pull out of the squad late with injury before the clash with Tanzania on Friday, while Anton Nedyalkov also remains out with a longer-term issue that has seen him sidelined for a number of months.

St Johnstone's Dimitar Mitov looks set to make the number one jersey his own and could make his fifth cap with another start here.

Azerbaijan possible starting lineup:
Mahammadaliyev; Seydiyev, Mustafazada, Huseynov, Cafarquliyev; Kokcu, Diniyev, Mahmudov, Ozobic; Dadashov, Sheydayev

Bulgaria possible starting lineup:
Mitov; Popov, A Petkov, Antov, Stoyanov; Chochev, Gruev, Krastev; M Minchev, Despodov, Rusev



We say: Azerbaijan 1-1 Bulgaria

Despite a narrow win against huge minnows on Friday, Azerbaijan were still dominant and will fancy their chances against out-of-form opponents here, especially after a respectable Euro qualifying campaign.

A first win in 18 months against Tanzania will hardly raise spirits too much for a nation stagnating and struggling greatly for form, and a draw here would likely be perceived as a very good result for Bulgaria.
