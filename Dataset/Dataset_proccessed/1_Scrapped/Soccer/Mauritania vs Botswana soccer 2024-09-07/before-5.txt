Preview: Mauritania vs. Botswana - prediction, team news, lineups

Mauritania and Botswana raise the curtain on their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign with a meeting at Stade Cheikha Ould Boidiya on Saturday evening.
 
Both teams boast just one win apiece since the turn of the year heading into this weekend's encounter, and neither of them will want to come away empty-handed.

Mauritania failed to win any of their final three matches in 2023 and have carried over their dry patch to the new year, claiming just one victory from nine outings across all competitions.
 
That solitary triumph came in the final AFCON Group D clash against Algeria, where Mohamed Dellahi Yali struck in the 17th minute to send Amir Abdou's men into the knockout stages for the first time ever off the back of consecutive group-stage exits.
 
The Lions of Chinguetti subsequently went on to suffer a round-of-16 defeat at the hands of Cape Verde, and their four involvements since then have yielded three losses and a share of the spoils.
 
More worryingly for Mauritania, they have failed to find the back of the net in each of their last five and seven of their nine matches in 2024, while also managing just two clean sheets in that time.
 
Nonetheless, Saturday's hosts will be feeling confident about their chances of securing a positive outcome against their visitors, who have been beaten in both of the previous two meetings.

Botswana saw their wait for a first AFCON appearance since 2012 go on following a disappointing qualifying campaign last time out, finishing a whopping nine points adrift of Tunisia and Equatorial Guinea.
 
Didier Gomes Da Rosa's men have since enjoyed a mixed start to their World Cup qualifying journey, picking up two wins and two defeats from four matches, after which they put on an underwhelming COSAFA Cup display, crashing out in the group stages.
 
Like their upcoming opponents, the Zebras have also had issues in front of goal recently, having drawn blanks in all but three of their eight outings in 2024, scoring just five times that span.
 
Three of the five goals came in Botswana's only victory of the year against Somalia back in June, and Saturday's visitors now seek to get themselves back on track this weekend before playing host to Egypt in matchday two of the qualifiers.

Team News

Formerly playing second fiddle to Namori Diaw, Babacar Niasse has nailed down a starting spot for Mauritania over the last couple of months and is expected to feature between the sticks here.
 
Mohamed Dellahi Yali will have the chance to add to his 73 international caps as he closes in on Souleymane Diallo's all-time record of 76 for the home side.
 
Skipper Aboubakar Kamara has not been in action since June, and it was no surprise that he was left out of Amir Abdou's plans for the AFCON qualifiers.
 
American-based Ronaldo Fortune will be pushing to make his Botswana debut after the 26-year-old recently received his maiden call-up to the senior team.
 
Defender Thatayaone Ditlhokwe is one of only four foreign players in contention for the away side, with Gomes da Rosa opting for a largely home-based squad.


Mauritania possible starting lineup:
Niasse; Diaw, El Abd, L Ba, Houeibib; Mahmoud, Ngom; Thiam, Fofana, Koita; P Ba

Botswana possible starting lineup:
Phoko; Mangolo, Ditlhokwe, Kopelang, Velaphi; Ramotse, Mohutsiwa, Baruti; Sekwai, Sesinyi, Seakanyeng




We say: Mauritania 1-0 Botswana

With goals at a premium for both Mauritania and Botswana of late, we are anticipating a nervy and cagey affair in this one.

That said, we can see the home side coming out on top at the end of the 90 minutes to continue their already established dominance in this fixture.
