Mauritania edged out Botswana 1-0 in their opening 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualification Group C match at the Cheikha Ould Boïdiya Stadium on Saturday evening.

The hard-fought victory saw the Lions of Chinguetti get off to a good start in their qualifying campaign and they will now travel to Cape Verde where they will face the Blue Sharks on Tuesday in another Group C match.

The Zebras, on the other hand, will be left to rue conceding late in Nouakchott and they will have a chance to record their first win in Group C when they play host to seven-time African champions Egypt on Tuesday.

The Lions of Chinguetti dominated possession with the Zebras happy to sit back and launch counter-attacks.

Tebogo Kopelang and Gape Mohutsiwa were both booked in the opening 21 minutes as pressure mounted on the visitors.

Goalkeeper Goitseone Phoko was called into action towards the halftime break and he made two saves to keep Mauritania at bay.

The score was 0-0 at halftime after a first half which was dominated by the Lions of Chinguetti without scoring.

Mauritania continued to control the match after the restart, but the likes of Aboubakary Koita, Idrissa Thiam and Anne Souleymane were wasteful in front of goal, failing to keep their attempts on target.

However, the Lions of Chinguetti's pressure finally paid off in the 84th minute when two substitutes combined to hand the hosts the lead.

Sidi Bouna Amar netted late to seal Mauritania's 1-0 win having been set up by Beyatt Lekoueiry.
