Mauritania are to reach the AFCON finals again (PC: Getty Images)

Mauritania host Botswana at the Cheikha Ould Boidiya Stadium in Nouakchott on Saturday for their opening clash of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers in Group C. Ranked 112th in the world, Mauritania are looking for their fourth consecutive appearance in the AFCON finals.

The West African nation made their tournament debut in 2019, qualified again two years later, and made the cut for the Ivory Coast showpiece this year too.

But in the recent edition, the Lions of Chinguetti created a slice of history - they reached the knockout stages for the first time, qualifying for the round of 16 where they lost 1-0 to Cape Verde.

Since then, their fortunes have barely improved, with Mauritania failing to win either of their two friendlies and losing both their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches at home.

Botswana are looking to end a 12-year wait for a second AFCON qualification but will have to up the ante for that. The Zebras have blown hot and cold in 2024, winning just one of their nine official games.
