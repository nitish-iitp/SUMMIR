Many schools, universities, and colleges focus on the importance of 2-minute speeches as they play a significant role in improving many ley skills. However, some students ignore these speeches and focus on external sources when required to provide a speech. Therefore it is important to learn the skill set of delivering a 2-minute speech and keep you ahead of others. 

When preparing a 2-minute speech topic it is important to identify your interest and shortlist the topics you are most comfortable with.  Selecting the right topic can play an important role in delivering the perfect 2-minute speech. However, in case you don't have the right list of topics, identifying the right topic would be next to impossible. 

However, don't worry we have got you covered. The following blog will provide you will all the information regarding the structure, do’s and don’ts, strategies, and topics to help you face the difficulty and give a convincing speech to the audience. 

Therefore let's move. 

 

 

Structure of 2-minute speech 

For instance, let's assume that you are required to deliver a speech or college. So where to start? First of all, you will need a topic, that can gain your interest and also your audience. The next step is putting the words into action and delivering a speech that keeps your audience glued to their seats. 

Therefore to deliver an interesting speech, it is important to know how to start your speech and end it and grab the attention of the audience.  You can make use of these steps to deliver an interesting 2-minute speech:

Start with a quote: Generally, people relate to things from which they are aware. Therefore it is advisable to use a quote from any popular movie, sitcom, or a well-known personality. This will make the audience eager to listen more. 
Introduce your topic: Connect the topic of the speech with the quote you spoke. It is important not to make the listeners take back when you start a topic different from the quote you spoke about earlier. Moreover, it is also important not to spend too much time on the introduction and use the right phrases to complete the job quickly. 
Identify the problems: For instance, you are preparing a speech on  ‘Books are better than movies.’ Therefore in this topic, you cannot talk about your own experiences but rather provide examples to describe the problem. It is important to make the audiences understand that the movies are not adding value nor they are helping in learning anything new. Come straight to the point without wasting too much time. 
Discuss the solutions: Think for a moment. Would you like to stay in a place where people are always talking about problems? Surely not?  So when delivering a speech, whether it is two minutes or more, talk about the solutions. If you feel that books provide many benefits by reading them, then explain how. This will help in grabbing the attention of the listeners.
Don't get Diverted: There are many chances of getting diverted from the topic as you start sharing your experiences. Therefore deviating from the topic will result in losing the essence of the essay. Therefore when preparing the topic it is important to make sure that you don't deviate and start discussing irrelevant topics.
Concussion: When concluding the speech, revisit the main arguments made in the speech, and also provide room for discussion. Your speech must have a long-lasting impression in the minds of the audience. Therefore, before leaving the podium you provide them with the right points to make them keep thinking. 

In case you are thinking that a 2-minute speech does not require too much preparation, then remember even in getting a good taste in 2-minute noodles, it requires proper preparation.  Therefore before visiting the list of trending 2-minute speech topics, let's learn about some strategies to make them very effective.

Logical Flow

Before delivering the speech, keep yourself in the place of the audience, and think about whether are you ready to listen to a speech that does not have a logical flow.

Share facts

In case you want your audience to pay full attention to your speech, you will be required to go the extra mile and conduct extensive research regarding the speech topic.
