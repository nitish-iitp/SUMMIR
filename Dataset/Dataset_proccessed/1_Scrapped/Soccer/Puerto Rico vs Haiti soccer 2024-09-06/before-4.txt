Key Stats
Green Bay Packers

The Green Bay Packers finished the 2023 season 9-8 and made the playoffs by wild card. They won the wild card game against the Dallas Cowboys but lost in the Divisional round against the San Francisco 49ers. Jordan Love played his first full season with the Packers last season and threw for 4,159 yards, 32 touchdowns, 11 interceptions, and a QBR rating of 62.1%. In the 2024 preseason, he played a few series in one game and threw for 63 yards and one touchdown.  Love and the Packers will play the Philadelphia Eagles in the first game of the season. Love will be looking to improve even more this season.

The Philadelphia Eagles will be led by quarterback Jalen Hurts in this first game of the season. Hurts ended the 2023 season strong with over 3,858 yards, 23 touchdowns, 15 interceptions, and a QBR rating of 60.1. He finished 12th ranked quarterback in the NFL.  The Eagles were one of the best NFC teams last season, finishing with an 11-6 record, but they had a horrible playoff performance and ended up losing in the wild-card round to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Prediction

The Philadelphia Eagles are favored to win this matchup against the Green Bay Packers. The Eagles are -140 favorites, but this will still be a close matchup between the two teams. Jordan Love can put up some points with his weapons around him at wide receiver Romeo Doubs, Jayden Reed, and now newly added running back Josh Jacobs. The Eagles have weapons of their own this season with new faces in Saquon Barkley (RB), A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith to lead the way this season again.

Final Pick
Philadelphia Eagles (-140)
