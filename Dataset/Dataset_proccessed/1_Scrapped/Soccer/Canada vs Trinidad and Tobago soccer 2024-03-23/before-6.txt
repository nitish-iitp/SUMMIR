Red Bull "Four 2 Score" 4v4 tournament set to kick off in Qatar on 22 March 2024

Red Bull Four 2 Score is landing in Qatar, challenging soccer enthusiasts to demonstrate their finest moves on the small field. Audiences will witness talented teams battle it out to secure a well-deserved spot on the list of international teams that will go on an all-expense-paid trip to RB Leipzig in Germany.

In partnership with Expo 2023 Doha, Duhail Sports Club, I Love Qatar, Al Meera. The tournament is set to kick off with qualifiers on 22 & 23 March 2024 at the Expo Doha 2023 at 8 pm, followed by further rounds on 29 and 30 March at the Maidan Sports Center at 8 pm.

The heat intensifies as teams vie for victory at the National Final on 6 April 2024, hosted at the Abdullah Bin Nasser Bin Khalifa stadium complex - the host of Al Duhail FC.

The football tournament-with players aged between 16 to 35 years old, is played in 10-minute rounds, with no breaks, no goalie, with 4 players on each team, along with one substitute player. The special twist is to score when it matters: goals scored in the first and last 60 seconds of a game count double.

Each tournament is played out in 3 stages: Group stage, Knockout stage, and Final. In the group stage, the winning teams are awarded three points, and the losing teams zero points. If the score is tied after 10 minutes, both teams are awarded one point each. There's no penalty shootout or golden goal in the group stage. In the knockout stage, if the score is tied after 10 minutes, a golden goal decides who's going to proceed to the next round.

More than 25 countries are participating globally in the fight to win a ticket to compete at the world finals at RB Leipzig in Germany. The Qatari teams will be looking forward to not only playing against other international winning teams but to representing the country and raising its flag high.

For those ready to showcase their skills and make their mark on the international stage, sign up now for Red Bull Four 2 Score Qatar qualifiers here (Red Bull Four 2 Score | Red Bull).
