As the 34th edition of AFCON kicks off on Saturday, January 13, 2024, with the host nation, Côte d’Ivoire facing Guinea-Bissau in the tournament’s opening match, numerous teams have already arrived to prepare for the competition. Among the notable highlights are the top stars poised to make their debut in AFCON 2023.

Mohammed Kudus – Ghana

The Black Stars will heavily depend on West Ham United star Mohammed Kudus, who has excelled in England with nine goals across all competitions since joining from Ajax. Despite missing the previous tournament due to injury, Kudus is expected to make his AFCON debut in Ivory Coast.

Lamine Camara – Senegal

Considered one of the best young players on the continent, Camara, now with French side FC Metz, will make his AFCON debut in Ivory Coast. Having contributed to Senegal’s Africa Nations Championship victory, he boasts 16 appearances, a goal, and an assist in Ligue 1.

Abdessamad ‘Abde’ Ezzalzouli – Morocco

Former Barcelona player Ezzalzouli, who missed AFCON 2022 due to club commitments, is now set for his debut with Real Betis in La Liga. A key player in Morocco’s U23 success, he also featured in the 2022 World Cup, making him a valuable addition to the AFCON 2023 squad.

Patson Daka – Zambia

Leicester City forward Patson Daka, the most experienced debutant, with 40 appearances and 18 goals for Chipolopolo, will finally make his AFCON debut after Zambia’s absence since 2015.

Serhou Guirassy – Guinea

VfB Stuttgart striker Guirassy, who chose to represent Guinea in 2022, has been prolific in the Bundesliga with 16 goals in 13 games. His 12 appearances and three goals contributed to Guinea’s qualification for AFCON 2023.

Carlos Beleba – Cameroon

Brighton and Hove Albion’s Carlos Beleba, yet to play for the Indomitable Lions, earns his AFCON debut based on stellar performances in the English club. Rigobert Song’s inclusion recognizes the defender’s potential impact for the five-time African champions.

Simon Adingra – Ivory Coast

Teammate of Beleba at Brighton, Adingra, enjoying his debut season in England, may debut in AFCON for Ivory Coast.

The talented forward, with four goals in 16 Premier League matches, has already made four appearances for the host nation, potentially adding to his AFCON debut on home soil.
