05-02-2024 12:26 PM



Ammon News -
The Jordan national football team coach, Hussein Ammouta, confirmed that the team players are ready to take on the new challenge against South Korea on Tuesday, in the Asian Cup semi-finals.

Mousa Tamari did not train in the past two days, but he underwent special training, so he will be present in Monday’s training and ready to participate in Tuesday’s match, Ammouta said in a press conference on Monday.

The South Korean team is one of the physically strong teams, Ammouta added, noting that: "I do not think the South Korean team will be affected by the fatigue factor after facing Saudi Arabia and Australia. It also has high technical and mental capabilities, and the physical aspect is very important."
