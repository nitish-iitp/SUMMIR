AFCON Qualifiers: Morocco Secures Dramatic 1-0 Win Over Lesotho

Rabat - Morocco’s national football team, the Atlas Lions, narrowly escaped a frustrating draw against Lesotho with a 1-0 victory, thanks to a last-gasp goal by Brahim Diaz in the 93rd minute.

The match, part of the African Cup of Nations (CAN 2025) Group B qualifiers, took place at the Stade Adrar in Agadir and kept fans on the edge of their seats until the very last second.

The Atlas Lions, who had previously cruised through their qualifiers with dominant wins — 6-0 against Congo and 4-1 over Gabon — struggled throughout the match to break through Lesotho’s resolute defense.

For much of the game, it seemed like Morocco was heading for a goalless draw despite their overwhelming possession and multiple attempts on goal. 

While the Atlas Lions ultimately claimed victory, head coach Walid Regragui acknowledged that his team’s performance fell short of expectations.

During the pre-match press conference, Regragui had emphasized the importance of finding the right balance between offensive firepower and defensive discipline.

As Morocco has already secured its place in AFCON 2025 as the host nation, Regragui has used these qualifiers to experiment with different lineups and formations, aiming to build depth and give younger players valuable international experience.

Ahead of the match, he had stressed that this was the time to “make mistakes and learn from them” in preparation for the tournament and World Cup qualifiers.

Despite the tough match, Morocco remains in control of their fate in the CAN 2025 qualifiers, and with a 100% record thus far, they are still considered one of the top contenders for the tournament.

The team will look to build on this victory and refine their tactics in the matches to come.
