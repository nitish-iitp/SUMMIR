Football. After Their Resounding Victory Against Gabon, Morocco Aims to Do Even Better Against Lesotho
Les Lions de l'Atlas ne jurent plus que par les victoires

The Atlas Lions are looking to strengthen their status as favorites for AFCON 2025. After their crushing win against Gabon, Regragui’s men are eager to widen the scoreline even further against Lesotho.

As hosts of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON 2025), Morocco is more determined than ever to claim the coveted trophy that has eluded them since 1976. The Atlas Lions will face Lesotho on Monday, September 9. This match holds no stakes for the Moroccans, who have already officially qualified for the final phase of this continental competition, except for the desire of Ziyech’s teammates to confirm they are in peak form.

Matching the level reached by the players at the Qatar 2022 World Cup is the great challenge Moroccan coach Hoalid Regragui must overcome.

Even though the Atlas Lions had defeated the Gabonese Panthers 4-1 in the same AFCON 2025 qualifying round, Moroccan fans were left wanting more. Tonight's match at Agadir's Grand Stadium will be closely watched, not just for the score but also for the quality of play. Diaz scored a goal against Gabon that might be a turning point for him.

The Moroccans will move on to Oujda for the next phase of the competition, with two encounters against the Central African Republic, counting for the 3rd and 4th rounds of AFCON Morocco 2025 qualifiers. The local Stade d'Honneur will provide a new stage for the Atlas Lions to showcase their talent. These matches will take place between October 7 and 15.

Morocco leads Group B with 3 points. The final phase of AFCON Morocco 2025 will take place from December 21, 2025, to January 18, 2026.
