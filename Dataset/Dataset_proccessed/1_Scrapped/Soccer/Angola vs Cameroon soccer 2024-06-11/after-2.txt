Jonny Evans flew home from Northern Ireland's training camp in Mallorca yesterday, and will play no part in his country's international against Andorra today (11 June).

Manager Michael O'Neill said that Evans had endured a few small injury issues during the domestic season, and noted that the 36-year-old had played all 90 minutes of the defeat to Spain on Saturday.

Evans played 30 times for United across all competitions last season, taking his all-time tally to 228 and moving him into our top 100 appearance-makers.

Discussions remain open with Jonny over a potential new contract.

WHO ELSE WAS IN ACTION?

Just one Red was on international duty yesterday (Monday 10 June), but Altay Bayindir remained an unused substitute in Turkey's 2-1 defeat to Poland in Warsaw.

A 77th-minute equaliser seemed to have earned the Turks a draw, but Nicola Zalewski struck in the final minutes to earn victory for the hosts.

The friendly was Turkey's final warm-up for Euro 2024 – Altay and his colleagues begin their group-stage programme next Tuesday (18 June) when they take on Georgia in Dortmund (17:00 BST).

WHAT'S COMING UP NEXT?

While Evans will not play on Tuesday, there are four other United first-teamers who in line for some competitive football.

Diogo Dalot and Bruno Fernandes could post minutes in Portugal's friendly with the Republic of Ireland in Aveiro (19:45 BST) – the last opportunity for Roberto Martinez's side to prepare for their Euro 2024 opener against the Czech Republic a week today.

In Africa, there are two World Cup qualifiers with United interest: Sofyan Amrabat and Morocco will take on Congo (20:00 BST), while Andre Onana and Cameroon will travel to Angola (20:00 BST).
