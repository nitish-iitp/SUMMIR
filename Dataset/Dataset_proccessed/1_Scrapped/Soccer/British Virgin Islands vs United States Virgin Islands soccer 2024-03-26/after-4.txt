'Come out & give that energy'- Captain K. Troy Caesar

Skipper Kavon Troy Caesar told Virgin Islands News Online (VINO) that the team was disappointed in not coming out with a win in the first leg but still grateful to get the draw going into the 2nd leg of the match, "where we have now played them and have a better understanding of the team. The coaching staff have made their adjustments so that we can come out with the win."

Caesar said the team is still cognisant that anything can happen it is going into the game with a positive attitude to win and make the country proud.

He also called on residents of the VI to come out in their numbers to give strong home support.

"As for the support of the community and the BVI at large, we would like the people to come out and give that energy so we can get that extra push to come out with the win today. With everyone's help, it makes the BVI stronger," Caesar said.

I came here to post what a great experience the game was yesterday, a large crowd of locals and expats coming together to support the BVI team. It was a truly great feeling of everyone together regardless of colour or background and made me proud of the BVI. Immediately after the last penalty the team came to the stands and it was great to see them interacting with all the kids, both local and expat. This is the future of the BVI and not your racist hate. These men have done incredibly well and you try and try to turn our moment of triumph into a racist battle.

Go away with your racist sh!t. Go back into your hole as the modern day BVI doesn't need your type. Beyond disgusting.
