I have noticed that the price of these two scopes on the used market is about the same at $1600-$1700 if you shop. For those who have used both which one has the better glass or other features that would sway your vote.

The kahles parallax adjustment location is awesome. I miss my Kahles so much. I live my zco's, for the better glass but man I miss the way I could focus my kahles on the fly. I know zeiss is great and the new one I looked through at PRE a few years ago had excellent glass, but man that Kahles design is so user friendly.

I have both scopes in question... I voted for Kahles. Only for a couple reasons. The Zeiss LRP S3 is a hell of a lot of scope for the money, and had you just simply asked about the Zeiss, I would have told you to buy it, and it's a great scope...Because it is.

That said, I prefer the Kahles SKMR4 reticle over the Zeiss ZF-MRi reticle. The Kahles reticle is slightly thinner, the Kahles has some of the best turrets on the market (it also has a red post that pops up when you move into your second rev for an indicator), the Kahles has Austrian SCHOTT glass, and the parallax location on the base of the elevation turret is phenomenal. Once you get used to it, there's really no going back. Because it's on the elevation turret, it also makes the scope very thin in width from left to right.

The kahles center dot is the perfect size too. That's my only complaint with zco, the center dot is just slightly too small. Its a very small difference but it matters

I've owned most of the alpha scopes and have trimmed off the outliers because in spite of being a decent scopes, the overall experience is underwhelming. I have to put the Kahles 6-24 in this category. The Kahles is a good scope but underperforms when compared to better scopes. Glass is good enough, turrets are good enough, reticles options work, and they are fairly light weight in comparison. So when I say the scope is underwhelming, its not that it performs badly- it's that the overall experience feels lacking when comparing to others. If I avoid taking a rifle to the range because of the scope, it's time to trim it and get another option, and this was my experience with the Kahles. It absolutely is a quality optic and will get the job done, it just wasn't for me.

The Zeiss is on par with the Kahles and in my mind it outperforms it. Turrets are nice, glass is great, reticle is useable if not one of my favorites. 40 MILS of internal adjustment is ridiculous! If there is a downside to the Zeiss, it is the size of the turrets, they are massive.

The Zeiss is a better buy currently IMO and it boils down to personal preferences and the fact it is a new design vs a fairly dated design in the Kahles. If the Zeiss was the same price as the new Kahles, my decision might be different, but probably not due to my dislike of the parallax adjustment - but that's another story.

Not sure why everyone says the Zeiss turrets are massive. They are no bigger than any other. Below is a pic of it near a Burris Pro turret as well as my fingers to see size comparison. The S5 is taller but the S3 is not overly large at all.

Also it has 46.5 mils of elevation which is great. 



A 6-36 pic but they are the same size turrets on it and the 4-25. Just for size reference.

For some reason the top part of the S3 turret reminds me of a pumpkin. LOL

You nailed it! The center dot on the SKMR1 makes it my absolute favorite. I really had to dig deep to find any flaws. It's such a comfortable scope to use.

The Zeiss and the Kahles are not that far off in price these days. EuroOptic has the Kahles for $2,699, and the Zeiss 4-25 is around $2,300, if I remember correctly. I’m sure @Euro.Connor cohld probably make those prices much closer.

Also, Kahles updated the internals and glass of the current gen K624i when they released the K525i, according to a rep I talked to.

For the life of me I can't understand how Swarovski makes such amazing glass and it can't seem to get it into the Kahles optics...

Same could be said about how Swaro makes such amazing glass, but can't seem to make a decent turret for a scope, or a legit long range scope with real target turrets.

I was gonna say upside down muffin..
Honestly though I got to fondle one at a match a few weeks ago and I love the turrets, it's like grabbing a meaty set of love handles

It does get glowing reviews. Putting together another bolt gun might get one of these or just get another G3 or try a Theos.

G3 buddy. Everytime I take them out I'm amazed they can make an optic of this quality, clarity and features for what it sells for. I don't even touch the parralax at matches its so forgiving.

Not sure what Connor could do but there are some like-new demo Zeiss S3 6-36x56 selling for $1700 at EO currently. I'm unfamiliar with the market but I don't know of anything that's even competing with the S3 at that price point.

Couldn’t vote, because why not boff? The elevation travel of the 4-25 S3 makes it a lot of fun. I can dial my 22LR to nearly 700 yards depending on conditions. Groups are quite large at that distance lol. But excellent practice holding wind at 300-400 with the 22.
