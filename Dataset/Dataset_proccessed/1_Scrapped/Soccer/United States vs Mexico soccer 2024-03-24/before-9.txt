Watch out for this Costa Rican player:

For this match, the player to watch will be the Tico goalkeeper and historic goalkeeper of the CONCACAF area: Keylor Navas. The powerful goalkeeper may not be the player in charge of scoring the goals, but he will be the one in charge of saving them and making his name on the scoreboard, so it will depend on him to keep Costa Rica's hopes alive throughout the 90 minutes.

Watch out for this Honduras player:

For this match, the player to watch will be the right midfielder: "Choco" Lozano, who is one of the most fundamental pieces of his lesson and was of great help to try to get the qualifying ticket to the Copa America in the last phase for his national team, now, he has the opportunity to weigh more and show why he is one of the most unbalanced players in the CONCACAF area.

The last chance to vindicate themselves

Originally, Costa Rica should have played the final four against Mexico to reach its first CONCACAF Nations League final, however, to the surprise of the "ticos", Costa Rica was eliminated by Panama by a 6-1 aggregate score after conceding 3 Panamanian goals in the first and second leg. Now, after having really screwed up, they have one last chance to reach the Great Party of our continent, the Copa America 2024, however, they will have to face Honduras, a team that has already shown it is ready to fight for great things and that is undoubtedly living a better moment than the Ticos. After playing this playoff, they will face Argentina in a friendly match to wait until June and begin their journey to the 2026 World Cup with the CONCACAF qualifiers.

A debt with destiny

The Costa Rican national team will be looking to secure their ticket to the Copa América 2024 after they came close to achieving the feat in the last phase of the CONCACAF Nations League, as they were unable to maintain the advantage on aggregate and Mexico managed to take them to extra time to later define the ticket to the soccer festival on this side of the world in penalties. Now, in this playoff to define the last two teams that will be present at the Copa América, they will have to face Costa Rica, a team that also dreams of being part of this great tournament. It should be noted that regardless of the result, the Honduran national team will face El Salvador and then in June will play the first elimination stages for the 2026 World Cup against Cuba and Bermuda.
