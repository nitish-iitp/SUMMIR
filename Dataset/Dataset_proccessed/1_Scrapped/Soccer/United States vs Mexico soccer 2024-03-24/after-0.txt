U.S. MEN’S NATIONAL TEAM CLAIMS THIRD STRAIGHT CONCACAF NATIONS LEAGUE TITLE WITH 2-0 VICTORY OVER MEXICO
TYLER ADAMS AND GIO REYNA PROVIDE GOALS AS FAMILIAR “DOS A CERO” SCORELINE SEES USMNT EXTEND UNBEATEN RUN AGAINST MEXICO TO RECORD SEVEN MATCHES; REYNA SELECTED AS TOURNAMENT’S BEST PLAYER, MATT TURNER CLAIMS BEST GOALKEEPER
MARCH 24, 2024

ARLINGTON, Texas (March 24, 2024) – The United States Men’s National Team hoisted the Concacaf Nations League trophy for the third time following a 2-0 victory over Mexico at AT&T Stadium. Midfielders Tyler Adams and Gio Reyna provided the goals on either side of halftime, as the U.S. added another Dos A Cero scoreline to the history of the rivalry. With the victory, the U.S. remains the only team to win the tournament since its inception, also taking the title in 2021 and 2023.


The U.S. nearly opened the scoring inside the first six minutes through captain Christian Pulisic. From wide left, defender Antonee Robinson played a looping pass to Reyna, who headed the ball on. In one smooth motion, Pulisic settled the ball inside the six-yard box and tried to lift it over Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa with the outside of his right foot, but Ochoa reacted quickly to parry the ball away.

In the 38th minute, right back Sergiño Dest – who earned the start after serving a one-match suspension in the USMNT’s semifinal against Jamaica – nearly pulled off a memorable individual finish off a slaloming run cutting in to his left, but his attempt from distance went just high over the crossbar.

The U.S. broke through just seconds before halftime in spectacular fashion courtesy of Adams. After a Christian Pulisic corner kick attempt was cleared, the ball fell to Tim Weah out wide on the left. Weah played the ball to Weston McKennie, who then played to Adams in the center of the pitch. Finding a bit of time and space, Adams took a touch to his right, and from 35 yards, unleashed a rising blast that flew into the top left corner of the Mexico net.

The goal, spectacular by any measure, was the second of Adams’ career. His first also came against Mexico, that on Sept. 11, 2018, in Nashville, Tenn. Adams was making his first start in 478 days, having last appeared for the USA against Netherlands in the Round of 16 at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

The U.S. doubled the lead in the 63rd minute on a classy finish from Reyna. From a restart near the left touchline, Reyna played Pulisic through toward the endline. Pulisic hurdled his defender as he entered the penalty box, deftly lifting the ball over his sliding defender, but his cross was deflected and then headed out of the six-yard box. The ball fell to Reyna, who reacted with a quick right-footed shot that bounced past Ochoa and inside the near post to complete the “Dos a Cero” scoreline.

The USA avoided any late drama after a penalty kick called on Robinson was correctly waved off by referee Drew Fischer after a VAR review. Fischer instead gave Mexico forward Santiago Gimenez a yellow card for simulation.

GOAL SCORING RUNDOWN:

USA – Tyler Adams (Weston McKennie) 45th minute: After a U.S. corner kick was cleared to the foot of Tim Weah, Weah played to Weston McKennie wide left, who played the ball back to Adams in the middle. Finding space in the center of the pitch, Adams unleashed a right-footed blast from 35 yards that beat Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa into the top left corner. USA 1, MEX 0

USA – Gio Reyna, 53rd minute: After a nifty move to hurdle his defender along the touchline, Christian Pulisic had a cross attempt deflected and cleared out, but the ball fell to waiting Reyna who caught a right-footed shot on the bounce to beat Guillermo Ochoa low just inside the left post. USA 2, MEX 0 FINAL.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
Gregg Berhalter moves to 43-14-12 in 69 matches as USMNT head coach, tying him with Bob Bradley for third in victories among USMNT head coaches. Berhalter also moves to 28-7-7 in competitive matches, tying him with Jurgen Klinsmann (28-13-6) for third most wins in official competition. Berhalter’s .750 winning percentage in official competition is the highest among USMNT head coaches with a minimum of eight matches in official competition.
The USMNT moves 24-36-17 all-time against Mexico and sets a new team record with seven-straight matches unbeaten against El Trí, dating back to the 3-2 extra time win in the 2021 Concacaf Nations League Final. It is also the 11th time the USMNT has won by a 2-0 “Dos a Cero” scoreline.
The USMNT has now won 10 championship finals, winning eight of the matches outright, and twice coming away victorious on penalty kicks.  The team has won each of its last four finals: 2021 CNL, 2021 Gold Cup, 2023 CNL, 2024 CNL.
Gio Reyna’s 63rd minute strike was the eighth of his international career. Reyna, who was selected as Best Player in the 2023-24 Concacaf Nations League, now has eight career goal contributions in the Concacaf Nations League, with seven of those coming during the Final Four in 2021, 2023 and 2024.
Weston McKennie registered his sixth career assist on Adams’ goal and fourth all-time in the Concacaf Nations League. Overall, McKennie has a USMNT-leading 10 goal contributions in CNL play.
Matt Turner, who was selected as Best Goalkeeper in the 2023-24 Concacaf Nations League, made two saves to earn his 24th clean sheet, tying him with Brad Friedel for fourth all-time among USMNT goalkeepers. Turner also made his third appearance in a final, tying him with Kasey Keller for second most among USMNT goalkeepers and placing him behind only Tim Howard (four).
Gregg Berhalter made five changes from the lineup that started Thursday’s semifinal against Jamaica, marking the most changes between a semifinal and final in team history. Berhalter inserted defenders Sergiño Dest and Tim Ream, midfielders Tyler Adams and Gio Reyna, and forward Haji Wright.
The only U.S. player to start all three CNL Finals, Christian Pulisic captained the team for the 21st time tonight, and the third time in a Final, tying him with Carlos Bocanegra for most U.S. captaincies in a championship match. The USA is 16-2-3 when Pulisic wears the armband.
Pulisic earned his fourth overall cap in a final tonight, tying him for second most championship appearances among USMNT players with Jozy Altidore, DaMarcus Beasley, Carlos Bocanegra, Michael Bradley, Tim Howard, and Gyasi Zardes. The group trails Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan, who each appeared in six finals during their international careers.
Forward Haji Wright made his third career start and first since the 0-0 draw with England at the 2022 FIFA World Cup on Nov. 26, 2022.
The Starting XI had an average age of 26 years, 63 days, making it the second oldest USMNT lineup fielded under Gregg Berhalter ahead of only the Starting XI that began the 4-1 win against Canada in the CNL group stage on Nov. 15, 2019, in Orlando (26, years, 159 days).
The lineup averaged 37 caps, marking the third-most experienced lineup deployed under Berhalter. It comes in behind only the 2019 Concacaf Gold Cup Semifinal vs. Jamaica (39 caps) and Final vs. Mexico (40 caps).
The USA is 10-3-0 in knockout round matches under Berhalter, tying him with Bob Bradley (10-4-0) for second-most wins in knockout matches among USMNT head coaches.
The USA won its third final in four championship appearances under Berhalter (2021 and 2023 Nations League, 2021 Gold Cup). The current USMNT boss ties Bruce Arena (2002, 2005, 2017 Gold Cups) for most championship final victories among U.S. managers.
