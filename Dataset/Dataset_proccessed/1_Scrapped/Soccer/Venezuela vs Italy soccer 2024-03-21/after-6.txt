Inter Milan trio Nicolo Barella, Davide Frattesi and Matteo Darmian should be in the Italy starting lineup this evening.

The Azzurri will play two friendlies in the United States as they prepare to defend their throne in Euro 2024 in the summer.

Luciano Spalletti’s men will take on Venezuela in Miami this evening before testing their strength against Ecuador in New Jersey on Sunday.

The Italy coach is heavily relying on Inter stars. The Nerazzurri contingent is the largest, with six players initially receiving a call-up.

However, they were eventually reduced to five following Francesco Acerbi’s departure amidst the alleged racial abuse case.

Yet, the Nerazzurri stars still have a major role to play for Italy. Three of them should start this evening in Florida.

According to FcInterNews, Spalletti will test a 3-4-2-1 formation with Gianluigi Donnarumma in goal. Matteo Darmian will start at the back alongside Alessandro Buongiorno and Giorgio Scalvini.

In the middle of the park, Barella should operate in the double-pivot alongside experienced Arsenal Regista Jorginho. The two stars played side-by-side during the triumphant Euro 2020 campaign.

The source also expects Juventus wingback Andrea Cambiaso to start on the right flank while Spurs’ Destiny Udogie takes the opposite flank.

The third Inter player tipped to start is Davide Frattesi who could feature in a more advanced role as an attacking midfielder alongside Federico Chiesa.

Finally, Genoa’s Mateo Retegui will spearhead the formation.

For their part, Inter stars Federico Dimarco and Alessandro Bastoni will start on the bench. But perhaps they’ll be part of the starting lineup in the upcoming fixture against Ecuador.

Italy Probable XI (3-4-2-1): Donnarumma; Scalvini, Buongiorno, Darmian; Cambiaso, Jorginho, Barella, Udogie; Frattesi, Chiesa; Retegui.
