A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.
Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.
Measure advertising performance
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Measure content performance
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.
Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.
Develop and improve services
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections.

USMNT - Jamaica summary: score, goals and highlights | CONCACAF Nations League

United States - Jamaica: As it happened

USMNT are through to the final of the CONCACAF Nations League after a dramatic victory against a resolute Jamaica.

Few gave the Reggae Boyz much chance ahead of the game, owing to their long list of big-name absentees. But it took just 30 seconds for Jamaica to take the lead at AT&T Stadium, Greg Leigh taking advantage after the US failed to clear a long throw. 

USMNT needed to get control of the game and they did, although they failed to do much with it. There were openings for Christian Pulisic and Malik Tilman but very little of substance to show from their 78% share of possession. 

The breakthough finally came in the dying seconds of second half injury time, the 95th minute, when a Pulisic corner kick was deflected into his own net by Cory Burke. The US were finally level and the game went into extra time. 

An exhausted Jamaica team had little left to give in the additional period and Haji Wright, an impressive second half substitute for USMNT, took advantage of their tiring legs to score a clinical brace. Gregg Berhalter's side ran out 3-1 winners at the end of extra time and booked their place in Sunday's CONCACAF Nations League final.

Big chance! Jamaica

Incredible miss from Kasey Palmer, who manages the sky the ball over an open goal from just six yards out. 

He looks across at the assistant and must be relieved to see the offside flag go up, meaning that it would not have counted anyway. Nevertheless, that was an astonishing miss from such close range.

Will Gregg Berhalter make changes at the break?

They may not have shown it so far, but this is a very talented USMNT roster at Gregg Berhalter's disposal. They look particularly strong in the attacking areas and boast a number of potential game-changers on the bench, including Ricardo Pepi, Brenden Aaronsen and Gio Reyna.

Will Berhalter look to change anything at half time? Unlikely, given the strength of the team already on the field, but don't be surprise if he has made substitutions by the hour-mark if the scoreline does not improve.

Can USMNT find a way back?

That was, all things considered, a fairly poor opening 45 minutes from Gregg Berhalter's side. They looked susceptible to long throws, struggled to create chances and, when those opportunities did come, failed to take advantage. 

However, it should also be said the the US have come up against Jamaica side that is most comfortable sitting deep and playing reactively. USMNT did looked more dangerous as the first half wore on and they will take some comfort from the chances that they did create. Malik Tilman, however, will be ruing an opportunity squandered in the final minutes of the first half.

Christian Pulisic looks to continue red-hot form

He's been feted as the future of soccer in the United States since making the move to Borussia Dortmund as a teenager, but Christian Pulisic's career has not been without difficulties. His huge early promise in Dortmund saw him attract the attention of Premier League side Chelsea, who spent close to $70 million to secure his services. 

He impressed in patches in England but failed to nail down a regular spot in the starting XI and last summer was sold to AC Milan. He has taken to life in Italy and put up some deeply impressive numbers for the Serie A giant, bettering his previous career-best goal tally after scoring in a win over Hellas Verona last weekend. 

Now, with USMNT preparing for a big year of action, he has the chance to bring that form into the international arena.
