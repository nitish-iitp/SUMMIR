Canada overcoming the odds

I can’t emphasize enough how difficult it is to play without significant support. The lads managed the game and battled. So many good performances and everyone played a role. #CopaAmerica #CANCHI @Footy_prime

Canada, are you all the way in?

Do Canada have to figure out how to score? Yes. Do I care right now? No. Canada’s moving on the knockouts of Copa America. Get all the way in.
