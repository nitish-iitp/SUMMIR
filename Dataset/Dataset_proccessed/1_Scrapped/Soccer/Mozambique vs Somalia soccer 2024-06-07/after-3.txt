It was an eventful day in Friday’s fixtures of the CAF 2026 World Cup qualifiers, as Lesotho’s unexpected 2-0 victory over Zimbabwe at the Orlando Stadium sees the team top Group C.

Bafana Bafana put up a decent performance against Nigeria away from home as Themba Zwane opened the scoring, but could not follow through as the hosts found an equaliser in the second half for the match to end 1-1. South Africa remain fourth in the standings and Nigeria fifth in the group.

Elsewhere, Mozambique recorded a 2-1 victory over Somalia in their game and Angola scored an early goal to grab all three points against Eswatini in Talatona, the victory sees the Black Sable Antelopes in second place of Group D two points behind Libya who have seven in total.

Uganda defeated Botswana 1-0 to retain third place in Group G, and Morocco had to fight back for a victory against Zambia to remain at the top of Group E. Ivory Coast’s victory over Gabon granted them three points courtesy of a Seko Fofana goal in the first half.

The Africa Cup of Nations holders are in first place with an impressive nine points, however, their opponents Gabon are not too far behind in second, with six points to their name.

Kenya fell short against Burundi and surrendered the lead at the death when the nation equalised in the 85th minute as the match ended 1-1, leading to a share of the spoils in Group F.
