Uganda have never lost to Botswana in their history

Uganda host Botswana at the Mandela National Stadium in Kampala on Friday for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, looking to pick up their second win in a row. The Cranes were beaten 2-1 by Guinea in their opening qualifier but defeated Somalia 1-0 on matchday two to get their campaign up and running.

With three points in the bag, Uganda are in fourth position in Group G, locked in a tight race with Botswana, Guinea and Mozambique.

In the 2024 calendar year, the East African side have played three friendlies and seen mixed results. They beat a talented Kuwait side in their first game, but were crushed 4-0 by minnows Comoros in their next. Against Ghana, Uganda fought back from being two goals down to draw 2-2.

Uganda vs Botswana Prediction

Uganda and Botswana have both struggled for form lately. The Cranes have a good record in the fixture and that will give them the psychological edge this week, but the Zebras have been a tough side to crack in 2024.

This match could therefore end in a draw, but a low-scoring one.
