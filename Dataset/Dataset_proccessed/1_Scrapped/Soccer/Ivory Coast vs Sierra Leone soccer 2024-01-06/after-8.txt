The Leone Stars of Sierra Leone suffered a heavy defeat against The Elephants of Côte d’Ivoire in a friendly match at the Laurent Pokou Stadium in San-Pedro today, January 6, 2024.

The hosts showcased their dominance with goals from Diomande, Franck Kessie, Jeremy Boga, Jonathan Bamba, and Lazara Amani, securing a commanding five-goal lead. Sierra Leone’s only consolation came from a goal by forward Rodney Michael.

This marks the second meeting between the two teams recently, with their last encounter resulting in a 2-2 draw during the previous Cup of Nations in Cameroon Douala on January 16, 2022. Notably, the Ivorians had previously dominated Sierra Leone with a 5-1 victory during the Africa Cup of Nations Qualifying Group D at the Stade Félix Houphouët-Boigny, Abidjan in 2014.

Today’s encounter serves as a strategic move to bolster the Elephants’ preparation for the upcoming African Cup of Nations, where they will act as the hosts.

Looking ahead, the 34th edition of AFCON is scheduled to take place from January 13 to February 11, 2024, in Abidjan, Yamoussoukro, Bouake, San Pedro, and Korhogo. In Group A, the Ivorians are set to kick off their AFCON campaign against Guinea-Bissau at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium, Abidjan, on January 13, followed by a match against the Super Eagles of Nigeria.

Meanwhile, the Sierra Leone side, primarily composed of local stars, will face Morocco in their next match on Wednesday as they continue their preparations for the upcoming World Cup Qualifiers.
