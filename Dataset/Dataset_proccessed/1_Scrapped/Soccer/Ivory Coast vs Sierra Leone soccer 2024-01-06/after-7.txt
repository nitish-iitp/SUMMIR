“We wanted to suffer from work, from the heat. Everything has been extremely positive. The goal of this internship is to try to balance the level of everyone. It took some very precise work. There will be a lot of changes to give away game time. Tomorrow’s team will be consistent so that everyone is close to their physical best level,” he said.

The Elephant gaffer further expressed optimism to finish his preparations on the best conditions without injuries. He confirmed they have had an amazing week. As and the AFCON is going to be long competition, he anticipated his players to be one hundred percent fit and the whole team to be at their highest level.

Captain of the Elephants, Max Gradel stepped in to call for a total mobilization of the Ivorians. “We need the Ivorians to be 100% with us. We will fight for you. We need to feel that you are with us. Supporters have an important role to play. Even in difficult times, if we miss a goal, you must be there even if we are dominated. We will play this game against Sierra Leone to win,” Max-Alain concluded.
