The Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA) has confirmed that the Sierra Leone National Senior male team (Leone Stars) will play two friendlies against The Elephants of Ivory Coast and The Atlas Lions of Morocco on the 6th and 11th January 2024 respectively.

Football enthusiasts eagerly anticipate these encounters, as the Leone Stars gear up to face two challenging opponents in their quest for international excellence.

These matches present a thrilling opportunity for the Leone Stars to test their mettle against seasoned opponents. Ivory Coast boasts a rich footballing history, having lifted the Africa Cup of Nations twice, while Morocco, currently ranked 42nd in the world, will offer a stern test of their tactical prowess.

For Sierra Leone, these friendlies are not just about bragging rights. Head Coach Amidu Karim will be keen to use these matches to fine-tune his squad ahead of upcoming World Cup qualifiers and potentially blood in new talent.

The Leone Stars, having lost out in the 2023 AFCON, will be eager to prove their doubters wrong and showcase their ever-growing potential on the international stage.
