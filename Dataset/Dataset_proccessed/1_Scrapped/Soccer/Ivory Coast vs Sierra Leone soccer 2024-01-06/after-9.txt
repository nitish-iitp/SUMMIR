Sierra Leone na politics and bribery even inside football it has taken some time now I believe the Leone star team should have been set up properly. Since you don’t want to give respect to Mohamed Kallon salon nor go stop for experience shame. If salon wan get blessing una first respect the man way get the anointing so una go able get share pa the anointed man e anointing
