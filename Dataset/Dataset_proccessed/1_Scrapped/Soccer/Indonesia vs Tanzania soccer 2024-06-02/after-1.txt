WHAT THE FANS ARE SAYING

@KopitesForever joked on X: "That pitch invader has so much time in the middle of the park. Wembley's security has the same midfield as United's."

@JoeHarakis also questioned the security team at Wembley, writing: "Doesn't say much for the Wembley security team that 30 seconds into the Champions League final there's a pitch invader, followed by a period of 2 mins where another 2 people invaded the pitch."

Meanwhile, @AdamsEdema added: "You get a ticket to enter Wembley to watch a #UCLfinaljust to become a pitch invader??? Nah you have serious problems for real."

@JacobsBen said: "Marcel Sabitzer making the first tackle of the #UCLFinal... on a pitch invader, just 30 seconds in."

@peds9421 wasn't happy with the disruptors, writing: "They gotta rough up the pitch invader rn. This is some bullsh*t".

THE BIGGER PICTURE

The pitch invaders made sure to make their presence known. One was seen imitating Cristiano Ronaldo's 'SIUUU' celebration, while another tried to snap a selfie with Real's Vinicius Jr.

DID YOU KNOW?

The stunt appears to be the work of a Russian streamer called Mellstroy, who allegedly offered £300,000 to anyone who ran onto the pitch with his name on their back.

WHAT NEXT FOR UEFA?

This isn't the first time a Champions League final has been disrupted by pitch invaders. In 2019, the all-English contest between Liverpool and Tottenham was paused when American influencer Kinsey Wolanksi entered the field. Clearly, UEFA has a problem with stopping these stunts from taking place.
