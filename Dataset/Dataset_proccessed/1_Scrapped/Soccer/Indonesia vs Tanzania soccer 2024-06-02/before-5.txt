Preview: Indonesia vs. Tanzania - prediction, team news, lineups

Indonesia host Tanzania in an international friendly match on Sunday at the Madya Stadium.

Both nations have World Cup qualifying games in the offing, meaning this weekend's fixture allows the managers to assess their sides before competitive action in June.

Shin Tae-yong's team host Tanzania in Jakarta in preparation for the nation's World Cup qualifying match against Iraq and the Philippines seeking to build momentum before the June 6 and 11 fixtures.

Team Garuda's last international games saw them claim wins in a double-header against Vietnam, and the long-serving manager seeks more of the same despite little riding on Sunday's game.

Indonesia, ranked 134th in the FIFA rankings, were the biggest climber after the March international break, and they hope to continue that momentum after rising eight places.

However, their form in friendly games leaves much to be desired, with one win secured in seven non-competitive fixtures — a 2-0 triumph over Turkmenistan in September 2023.

Particularly worrisome is the absence of goals in four of those seven matches (three defeats), having fired blanks in the draw with Palestine, and losses to Argentina (2-0), Libya (4-0) and Iran (5-0).

It remains to be seen if Tanzania will give Shin's men added reason to worry after Sunday's match, with the Taifa Stars possibly suffering from jet lag against their Asian hosts.

Hemed Morocco has only been in charge for four recognised games (two unacknowledged matches with Sudan have been played this month) since taking charge after Adel Amrouche's suspension for insulting comments made about Morocco at AFCON 2023, and he seeks to avoid a second loss as coach of the East African nation.

That defeat came in a March friendly match with Bulgaria, a 1-0 loss, followed by a 3-0 win over Mongolia three days later

While the Taifa Stars are ranked 119th, their superior standing guarantees little in Jakarta, especially as they will be without Young Africans and Azam FC players.

That and possible tiredness from the long flight across different time zones could count against the East African nation before their World Cup qualifying clash against Zambia on June 11.

Shin has called up Asnawi Mangkualam, Rizky Ridho, Pratama Arhan, Marselino Ferdinan, Justin Hubner, Nathan Tjoe-A-On and Ivar Jenner.

However, the long-time Indonesian boss left out Elkan Baggott, Marc Klok, Edo Febriansah, Wahyu Prasetyo, Witan Sulaeman, Rachmat Irianto, and Hokky Caraka.

With Young Africans and Azam FC facing off in Sunday's CRDB Federation Cup final, Tanzania have several players absent for this weekend's friendly.

The Yanga players missing are Aboutwaleeb Mshery, Bakari Mwamnyeto, Ibrahim Bacca, Nickson Kibabage, Mudathir Yahya and Clement Mzize, in addition to Azam FC's Lusajo Mwaikenda, Pascal Msindo, Nathaniel Chilambo, Feisal Salum, Yahya Zayd and Suleiman Sopu.


Indonesia possible starting lineup:
Ari; Mangkualam, Amat, Izdes, Tjoe-A-On; Hubner, Haye, Ferdinan; Oratmangoen, Struick, Maulana

Tanzania possible starting lineup:
Salim; Mwenda, Mnoga, Bacca, Hussein; Kagoma, Mao, Michael; Kibu, Kachwele, John



We say: Indonesia 1-0 Tanzania

With Tanzania weakened due to the absence of several internationals and potentially suffering from jet lag, earning a positive result in Jakarta is an uphill task for the Taifa Stars in the lead-up to their World Cup qualifying match with Zambia.
