Lionel Messi has another record for his ever-growing collection, with the Inter Miami superstar making MLS history with 25 goal contributions.

Argentine starring in the United States
Continues to enhance his legacy
Found his way to the top of another chart
WHAT HAPPENED?

The mercurial Argentine hit that mark for 2024 during his latest outing against St Louis City. The Herons were involved in a dramatic contest at Chase Stadium that saw them snatch a point late on in a thrilling 3-3 draw – with Jordi Alba grabbing an 85th-minute leveller.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Messi had been on target prior to that, as he cancelled out Chris Durkin’s opener for the visitors. The eight-time Ballon d’Or winner now has 12 goals for the season – the same number as club colleague Luis Suarez – while also boasting a MLS-leading 13 assists.

DID YOU KNOW?

Messi has become the fastest player to reach 25 goal contributions in a single season, with just 12 games required to hit a quarter-century. A standing at the top of that chart has been wrestled away from ex-Arsenal forward Carlos Vela – with the former Mexico international requiring 16 games for LAFC in 2019.

WHAT NEXT FOR MESSI?

While the history books continue to be rewritten by Messi, it remains to be seen when he will next be in action for Inter Miami – as they continue to chase down a playoff berth in the Eastern Conference. The all-time great is about to head off on Copa America duty with his country.
