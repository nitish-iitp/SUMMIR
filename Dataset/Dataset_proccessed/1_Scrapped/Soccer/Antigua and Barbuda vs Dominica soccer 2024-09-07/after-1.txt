Antigua and Barbuda face Dominica on Saturday

Dominica and Antigua and Barbuda will battle for three points in a CONCACAF Nations League clash on Saturday. Antigua have not been in action since falling to a 1-0 defeat away to the Cayman Islands in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier in June 2024.

Joshwa Campbell stepped off the bench to score the match-winner in the first minute of injury time.

Dominica, meanwhile, were last in action when they fell to a 3-2 defeat to Jamaica at home in a World Cup qualifier. Shamar Nicholson scored a brace for the Reggae Boyz, with his goals coming either side of Kaheim Dixon's 42nd-minute goal. Dominica were three goals down by the 79th minute but Javid George and Troy Jules scored to make the scoreline more respectable.

Dominica vs Antigua Prediction

Dominica come into this match on a three-game losing streak, having not lost any of the prior five (four wins). Ellington Sabin's side gained promotion from League C last season after finishing unbeaten in Group C but will face much stiffer opposition this time around.

Antigua, for their part, have not kept a clean sheet in their last 10 games and have conceded at least two goals in seven of their last 10 games. However, they are still the favorites.

We are backing Antigua to claim a narrow victory with goals at both ends.

Prediction: Dominica 1-2 Antigua
