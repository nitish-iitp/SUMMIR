BFA: Men’s Football Team Named For CNL
September 2, 2024 | 0 Comments

The Bermuda Football Association [BFA] announced the Bermuda Senior Men’s National Team selected for the Concacaf Nations League 4.0 September window.

A spokesperson said, “The team departed the island on Sunday, September 1, to travel to Antigua and Barbuda for their upcoming matches. Bermuda will face the Dominican Republic on Saturday, September 7, 2024, and Antigua and Barbuda on Tuesday, September 10, 2024. The team competes in League B Group D alongside the Dominican Republic, Antigua and Barbuda, and Dominica.”

Head Coach Michael Findlay had this to say of the draw results, “We are pleased with our draw, which has provided us with some benefits both from a competition familiarity in the form of Antigua Barbuda, who we also play in WCQ but also logistically with having us already been in Antigua Barbuda and the overall new format Concacaf has introduced. It has centralized each CNL window to eliminate some of the recent travel challenges that we have experienced and will benefit the players’ overall ability to perform, which should always be our priority.”
