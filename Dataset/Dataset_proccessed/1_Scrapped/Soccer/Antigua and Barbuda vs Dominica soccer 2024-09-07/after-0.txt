How will the B League be played?

The fourth edition of the Concacaf Nations League is underway, in which 16 teams will seek promotion to the A League. 
These 16 teams have been divided into four groups where they will play each other twice. The difference with past editions is that now, the matches will be played in one centralized venue per group to help make some travel lighter. 

The group winners will be promoted to the A League, while the fourth place finishers will be relegated to the C League. From here will come the qualifiers for the 2025 Gold Cup.
