Speak, Hajime Moriyasu! - Coach of Japan

"Their experience in Europe will give us impetus in many ways as we move forward. The reason why the Japan football team is competing with the best in the world is also because of the commitment and accumulated efforts of many people in the past." "I believe it will be an extremely difficult challenge. Last time, we thought we were all prepared going into the first game. We have to work harder on the details. August 9 was a designated school day in the middle of the summer vacation for the city of Nagasaki. When I was a child, our teachers would show us slides to tell us what happened in 1945."

Speak, Branko Ivankovic! - Coach of China

"We will do our utmost to secure points in the match against Japan and perhaps we can achieve an unexpected result, which would be the best reward for our fans. The crucial thing is to avoid injuries and help the players adapt quickly to the pace of the competition." "Our real test comes on September 10, when we host Saudi Arabia. In this match, we need to secure points and strive for an ideal result."
