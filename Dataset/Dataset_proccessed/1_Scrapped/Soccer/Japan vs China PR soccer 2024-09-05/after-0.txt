Japan host China PR on Thursday

Japan welcome China PR to Saitama Stadium for a 2026 FIFA World Cup third round qualifier on Thursday. The two sides have been drawn alongside Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Indonesia in Group C.

The hosts are getting back to action for the first time since claiming a 5-0 victory over Syria in the last stage of the qualifiers in June. They were two goals up by the 19th minute courtesy of goals from Ayase Ueda and Ritsu Doan while Thaer Krouma's own goal put them three up. Yuki Soma and Takumi Minamino scored second-half goals to complete the rout. The victory saw the Blue Samurai advance with maximum points from six games.

China, meanwhile, fell to a 1-0 defeat away to South Korea in a World Cup qualifier in June. Lee Kang-In's 61st-minute strike proved to be the difference between the two sides, but the Chinese still progressed as runners-up in the group.

Japan vs China PR Prediction

Japan (ranked 18th) are aiming to qualify for an eighth successive FIFA World Cup and will want to start the group with a victory. They breezed through the last round of the qualifiers but will face stiffer competition this time around.

China PR (ranked 87th), for their part, have qualified for the World Cup just once in their history and are the heavy underdogs here. They have not won a game against Japan since 1998, losing nine of 14 games played since then.

We are backing the home side to claim a comfortable victory in addition to a clean sheet.

Prediction: Japan 3-0 China PR
