Japan and China square off on Thursday as they commence the third round of their respective World Cup qualifying campaigns.

While Japan powered through the second phase with a 100% record, the visitors somehow scraped through with just two victories in six games.

Although Japan are currently on a sensational run of 16 wins from their last 18 matches, it has not all been plain sailing for Hajime Moriyasu and his side.

Their two defeats during that run came at the Asian Cup where they were favourites to win, a 2-1 reverse to Iran sending them out of the competition.

With regards to World Cup qualifying, though, the Samurai Blue made light work of North Korea, Syria and Myanmar, scoring 24 goals without reply.

Naturally, the level of opposition should be taken into consideration, and it perhaps came to their detriment when they made the step up at the Asian Cup either side of those six wins.

Nevertheless, lessons should be learned from them, complacency now a thing of the past as they challenge the likes of Australia and Saudi Arabia in this group.

From China's perspective, there will be an acceptance that they are very much outsiders to earn a spot at the 2026 World Cup due to the presence of three of Asia's powerhouses.

China also have just three wins to their name from their last 14 outings in all competitions, the most notable coming away in Thailand in a game that ultimately proved decisive in the second phase.

However, Branko Ivankovic's side failed to score a single goal at the Asian Cup, as well as posting just one win - versus Singapore - in their most recent nine matches.

On a positive note, they only went down 1-0 in South Korea last time out, highlighting that they have the capabilities of stifling their hosts should they perform to their best.

Team News

With Takehiro Tomiyasu missing for Japan, Shogo Taniguchi could be drafted into the back three.

The remainder of the side that cruised past Syria last time out could plausibly stay the same, leaving the likes of Reo Hatate, Daichi Kamada and Daizen Maeda on the substitutes' bench.

China could also line up similar to how they did versus South Korea, although star man Wu Lei is an obvious contender to be recalled on the right flank or in the final third.

Zhang Yuning may also get the nod down the middle of the attack courtesy of his greater international experience compared to Fernandinho and Behram Abduweli.


Japan possible starting lineup:
Osako; Taniguchi, Ikatura, Machida; Doan, Endo, Tanaka, Nakamura; Kubo, Minamino; Ueda

China possible starting lineup:
Wang. D; Yang, Zhu, Browning, Liu; Wu, Jiang, Wang. S, Xie; Fernandinho, Yuning



We say: Japan 3-0 China

Given their rivalry, China will hope to pose some sort of a threat to their more illustrious hosts. However, this should be one-way traffic for the regular World Cup participants, who will expect to record another clean sheet.
