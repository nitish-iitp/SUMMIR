Jordan face Kuwait on Thursday

Jordan and Kuwait will battle for three points in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier on Thursday. The hosts are coming into the game on the back of a 2-1 victory over North Korea in an international friendly.

Their last competitive game saw them claim a shock 2-1 comeback away win over Saudi Arabia in the last round of the qualifiers in June. They went behind to Ali Lajami's 16th-minute goal but Ali Olwan and Noor Al Rawabdeh scored first-half goals to help the visitors leave with all three points.

Kuwait, meanwhile, saw off Afghanistan with a narrow 1-0 home win. Eid Naser Al Rashedi scored the match-winner in the 81st minute.
