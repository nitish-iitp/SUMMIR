Basra:  Despite a spirited performance, Oman lost to hosts Iraq 1-0 in FIFA World Cup AFC Asian Qualifiers - Road to 2026 Group B campaign at the Basra International Stadium in Basra, Iraq, on Thursday. 

The all-important goal was scored early in the match when Aymen Hussein found the target in the 13th minute of the match. 

The goal came off a corner kick with Hussein nodding in a powerful header to beat Oman custodian Ibrahim Al Mukhaini.

Oman, coached by Czech Jaroslav Silhavy, tried hard to get the equaliser, but a sturdy Iraqi defence thwarted a series of raids to pick up crucial three points.

Oman's Arshad Al Alawi was shown the red card in the injury time (95th min) of the match.

Oman now hosts South Korea on 10 September at Sultan Qaboos Sport Complex in Muscat. The match begins at 7.30pm.
