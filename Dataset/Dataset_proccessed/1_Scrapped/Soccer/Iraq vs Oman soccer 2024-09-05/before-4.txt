The AGO’s retrospective of Pacita Abad — a standout show of the fall art season in Toronto — is the first major retrospective dedicated to the Filipino-American artist’s singular 32-year career. 

Abad, who died in 2004 at age 58, had a practice that spanned a variety of media. She’s best known for “trapunto paintings,” named for a 14th-century Italian quilting technique. She explained her innovative method in a 1991 interview: “I paint, using either oil or acrylic, on canvas and then collage. This top layer carries the design. To this I add a backing cloth and stuff polyester filling in between. These two layers are then joined with running stitches.”
