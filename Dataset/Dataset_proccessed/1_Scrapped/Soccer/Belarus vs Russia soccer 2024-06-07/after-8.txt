Belarus

The Belarusian national team has never made it to the finals of major international tournaments. Euro 2024 is no exception. The qualifiers started extremely badly for the Green and White, they lost three games in a row and lost any real chance of final success. Another thing is that then things went sharply uphill for them. In the next seven rounds, they lost only to the Israelis in a hard-fought 0:1, three more times played in a draw, while they got victories over the Andorrans - 1:0, and twice over the Kosovars - 2:1 and 1:0. With 12 points, the Belarusians finished fourth in the Group I standings - not such a bad result for them. In 2024, they have already played two games: they lost to Montenegrins - 0:2, and had a draw with the Maltese - 0:0.

Russia

The Russian national team is still suspended from international tournaments, and therefore has to be content with playing only friendlies. At first they fought only against Asian national teams, but then other options appeared. For example, last autumn success was achieved in confrontations with the national teams of Cameroon and Cuba - 1:0 and 8:0, respectively, while there was a draw with Kenya - 2:2. The only control meeting in 2024 also managed to win against Serbia - 4:0. Next was supposed to be a game with Paraguay, but it was cancelled. In June, the Russians will be limited to only one control battle against Belarus.

Expert Betting Tips

The Russian national team under Valeri Karpin traditionally has a hard time playing away matches. After being suspended from international tournaments, they played seven away friendlies, in which they won only once, and in the very first game against Kyrgyzstan - 2:1. Obviously, it's time for the Russians to break their six-match winless streak, and facing Belarus in Minsk is the best opportunity to do so. The Red-Green have a much more modest level of skill, and therefore it will be problematic for them to provide their opponent with a worthy resistance. As a result, we can bet on the victory of the Russian national team.
