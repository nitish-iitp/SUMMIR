JAKARTA, NETRALNEWS.COM - The Indonesian men's national football team is set to begin their journey in the Third Round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers for the Asian Zone on September 5, 2024.

Following the draw held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Thursday, June 27, Indonesia has been placed in Group C alongside Japan, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and China.

Yesayas Oktovianus, a respected Indonesian football observer and former Senior Journalist for the Sports Desk at KOMPAS Daily from 1983 to 2016, shared his insights on the matter.

"Yes, I am also a football player, so when I look at the results, I look more at the facts of the two competing teams. From the football side, I see Saudi Arabia will win by 1 digit or 2 digits. But from the nationalism side, I hope we can hold on if the match ends in a draw, in terms of the score, the difference will probably be very small. Even if we can make a surprise by winning with a score of 1-0 or 2-1, but if Saudi Arabia wins, it will probably be a difference of 2 digits later," Yesayas said.

Each of these nations boasts a rich football history and a high level of skill, making Group C one of the toughest in the competition.

The realism of facing a stronger opponent and the unwavering hope and determination that drives the Indonesian team and its supporters to win with high nationalism to reach the third round final in Jeddah is the key to the success of indonesian men's national football team.

His insights remind us that while the odds may seem daunting, football is a game where passion, strategy, and the unexpected can turn the tide in favor of the underdog. As Indonesia steps onto the field, they carry with them the aspirations of a nation eager to make their mark on the world stage and potentially deliver a performance that will be remembered for years to come.
