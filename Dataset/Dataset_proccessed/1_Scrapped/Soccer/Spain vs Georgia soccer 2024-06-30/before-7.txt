Spain to Win	1.21	1.22
Under 3,5 Goals	1.44	1.47

*Odds are subject to change

Georgia has never made it to the finals of the European Championship before, but they’ve done it this time. Reaching the last 16 is something star winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia called ‘the best day of Georgia’s life’. A bold statement, but you only have to look at the jubilant scenes in Tbilisi on Wednesday night to see what it means to people back home.

There was no such jubilation in the streets of Spain as they had only failed to make it past the group stages in one of the last seven European Championships. Getting this far is a bare minimum, and Spain supporters expect their Euro 2024 journey to continue beyond this point. Not only is La Roja the only team with a perfect record, but they are also 66 places above Georgia in the world rankings.

With Spain already guaranteed top spot in Group B ahead of their final group stage match with Albania, Luis de la Fuente made the luxury of making 10 changes to his starting eleven. This means his first-choice lineup will be well-rested coming into this clash, having enjoyed nine consecutive days without a match.

Naming his preferred eleven is certainly an option too as La Roja have no injury problems nor any suspensions. Rodri did miss the Albania match after collecting yellow cards in Spain’s opening two matches but having served this ban, he is available for selection again.

When facing challenging foes Portugal, Georgia manager Willy Sagnol opted for a five-at-the-back approach. There is a good chance he will stick with that system, given the result achieved that night and Spain’s attacking talents. There will be plenty of big decisions for Sagnol to make, especially with a near-full squad from which to select. The only player definitely missing out is Anzor Mekvabishvili, as the midfielder collected his second yellow card of the tournament during his brief cameo against Portugal.

Georgia vs Spain H2H Record and Key Numbers

Based on the two most recent meetings between these two nations, you would not give Georgia much of a chance here. The pair were in the same Euro 2024 qualification group, and Spain won both clashes with an aggregate scoreline of 10-2. La Roja has tasted defeat to Georgia once before, though, and this came in a friendly eight years ago.

Date	Result	Competition
19 Nov 2023	Spain 3-1 Georgia	UEFA European Championship – Qualifying
08 Sep 2023	Georgia 1-7 Spain	UEFA European Championship – Qualifying
05 Sep 2021	Spain 4-0 Georgia	FIFA World Cup – Qualifying
28 Mar 2021	Georgia 1-2 Spain	FIFA World Cup – Qualifying
07 Jun 2016	Spain 0-1 Georgia	International Friendly

Spain comes into this match having won their last five matches, conceding just one goal this time. Additionally, they have only lost one clash since March 2023. Georgia cannot match this kind of form. But they have only lost two of their last 10 clashes and have conceded no more than one goal in five of the last six.

Possible Lineups
Spain (4-3-3): Unai Simón – Carvajal, Le Normand, Nacho, Cucurella – Pedri, Rodri, Fabián Ruiz – Yamal, Morata, Williams
Georgia (5-3-2): Mamardashvili – Tsitaishvili, Dvali, Kashia, Kverkvelia, Kakabadze – Kochorashvili, Kiteishvili, Chakvetadze – Kvaratskhelia, Mikautadze
Where to Watch Georgia vs Spain Euro 2024 – TV and Online Live Streaming

First Channel (1TV) will be airing the game in Georgia. In Spain, meanwhile, RTVE will show the action on La 1. British audiences need to access ITV1 (or STV in Scotland).

Prediction

Many neutrals will be hoping for another Georgian miracle here, but I cannot see it. Spain was level above Georgia in their last two recent meetings and has looked very assured so far in this tournament. With the added benefit of having a fully rested and fully available strongest eleven, La Roja will have enough quality to see off the plucky Georgians. The only question is how many will Spain win by. And for this, I’ll predict a scoreline of just 2-0, given how good Giorgi Mamardashvili is in goal.
