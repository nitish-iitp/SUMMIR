A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.

Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

Measure advertising performance
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Measure content performance
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.
Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.
Develop and improve services
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections.

Dominant Spain end Georgian dream

The match report is as predictable as the result, with one little twist. Across the 90 minutes, Spain controlled possession, created multiple chances (35 is not often achieved), entertained with skill and creativity. Four goals – Rodri, Ruiz, Williams and Olmo – showcased once again the threat variety that the team carries. Everything went to plan.

OK, that's the predictable part.

The one twist was that Georgia scored first, and made everyone else sit up and take notice. It came from the team's first break and before the leveller kept an intriguing risk aspect to the game, with further counters looking promising.

When Rodri did score, a sense of reality returned and De La Fuente can go into the game against Germany with the utmost confidence. Yes, it will be the toughest game so far, but the host nation cannot be pleased the draw has handed them Williams and Yamal on the wings to face this early.

The winner of this quarter final will certainly be eyeing the title, and my money remains on La Roja. They are a bit special.

The mouthwatering clash that has now been set up is Germany vs Spain on Friday 5 July. Arguably they are the two best teams that we've seen so far in the tournament so it feels a bit unfair that we'll lose one so early.

The game may be over but these Spanish player want more. Nico sprints away with the ball through the middle of the park leaving defenders in his wake. There was a sense he may try to better his previous goal but lays it off and the cross that follows is too strong.

The Williams goal has just added more confidence to this already rather comfortable Spanish team.

Yamal almost added a goal to his earlier assist after playing a neat one-two to take him in front of Mamardashvili but the dink over hits the keeper in the chest and goes out for a corner.

That kid is special. Don't get bored of hearing that.

GOOOAALL!! This time it counts!

That was stunning from Nico Williams. Georgia had pushed a few more players forward looking for the leveller and, as a result, allowed the Spanish winger to collect and run at the remaining players. He jinked inside and let rip, firing high into the net. Lovely stuff.

There we go again. A chance appears for Georgia to hit on the break and they do so at pace. Tsitaishvili down the inside left channel sprints away and has a choice to cross or shoot from a tight angle.

He goes for the latter. He may now regret that.

A mad couple of minutes here. First a decent counter from Georgia is cancelled out but then, again starting from Spanish attacking play on the edge of the box, Kvaratskhelia breaks and shoots from inside his own half.

Simon has a habit of going wandering when Spain have the ball, and must have been relieved to see that slide just wide of the post.

Spain 1-1 Georgia: half-time assessment

Well, while Slovakia were well worth their lead against England, no one could really argue that Georgia were in this one based on the balance of play. But that's what we love about this game: predictable it is not.

Hard work and good organisation had Willy Sagnol's men holding a dominant Spain to shots from distance and the occasional cross from, notably, Williams, Yamal and Carvajal. Throwing bodies on the line was working against a supremely talented Iberian side.

Then the miracle came.

Georgia taking the lead hadn't even been flirted with by that point. It wasn't that they were getting chances to hit on the counter, but that first one proved successful so more followed, each of them with a strong hint of danger. Spain survived them comfortably enough, while continuing with their game plan. You don't fix something that isn't broken.

And so the deserved leveller came, from the boot of Rodri at the edge of the box.

Pedri the latest in red to have a go, from just on the edge of the area. He catches it cleanly enough but it flies over the bar.

Given the quality that the Barça star has, he'll be really disappointed with that, especially given the time he had to pick his spot.

Anthems: Spain

We love a bit of the Spanish anthem, "La Marcha Real". Unlike most anthems, Spain’s is unique because it doesn’t have any lyrics.

The tune alone carries centuries of history and pride, and the fans know every note by heart.

This wordless anthem allows for a different kind of expression. Instead of singing, the Spanish supporters wave their flags more vigorously, their faces beaming with national pride and hum like mad.

Anthems: Georgia up first "Tavisupleba"

Georgia belt out their stirring national anthem, "Tavisupleba," which translates to "Freedom." This anthem is not just a song but a powerful symbol of national identity and unity, resonating deeply with both the players and fans.

Written by poet David Magradze and composed by Zakaria Paliashvili, "Tavisupleba" was adopted in 2004, marking a new chapter in Georgia's history. Its lyrics speak of freedom and the nation's spirit, a fitting tribute to a country that has overcome numerous challenges to stand proud on the international stage.

The anthem's melody is both haunting and uplifting, capturing the essence of Georgian culture and resilience. The lyrics begin with a call to unity and freedom:

"While there is a nation, Georgia's call will echo."

In the stadium, you can see the pride in the faces of the Georgian supporters. They sing every word with passion, their voices rising in unison. The anthem encapsulates their journey, their struggles, and their hopes, making this moment more than just a routine part of the pre-match protocol.

The anthem's finale is particularly stirring, as it speaks of peace and prosperity for Georgia, a heartfelt wish that resonates with everyone present:

"Long live and bless The liberty and independence of Georgia."

"Tavisupleba" is a testament to Georgia's spirit and determination. As it echoes through the Cologne Stadium tonight, it serves as a powerful reminder of the unity and pride that fuels this underdog.

Tunnel time

The players are in the tunnel and looking focused. Given that England have sneaked past Slovakia, Spain know that nothing is guaranteed in knockout football.

Unai Simon may be in Germany but this embrace ahead of the game is something that must feel like a touch of the Basque Country. Lovely to see.

Officiating Spain vs Georgia

Tonight’s officials hail from France, and there's plenty experience out there. The team consists of:

Referee: François Letexier

Assistant Referees: Cyril Mugnier, Mehdi Rahmouni

VAR: Jérôme Brisard

Assistant VARs: Willy Delajod, Paolo Valeri

Fourth Official: Serdar Gözübüyük (NED)

François Letexier has overseen several high-profile matches in European competitions. You may remember him from the Real Madrid-Manchester City clash, in the first leg of the Champions League quarter finals this past season.

The 34-year-old Letexier is generally found in charge of Ligue 1 games in his native country and was whistling at the French Cup final in 2021 between PSG and Monaco.

Players to watch

Several players could be pivotal tonight.

For Spain, Álvaro Morata has been in decent form, notably scoring a hat-trick in their last qualifying match against Georgia. His poacher's instincts and aerial ability will likely be a constant threat, as the more talented players around him do their magic.

Georgia’s hopes most probably rest heavily on Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. Known for his dribbling skills and speed, he was instrumental in their incredible 2-0 win over Portugal. His partnership with tournament joint top scorer Georges Mikautadze, who has been clinical in front of goal, will be crucial for Georgia’s chances.

Nico magic

One player that has caught the eye in the tournament to date has been Nico Williams who hugs the left wing but is happy to move around and links well with his teammates, switching as required to keep opposition defenders guessing who to mark.

Here SmarterScout shares some analysis of the winger that has the likes of Liverpool, Arsenal and Newcastle keeping tabs.

Fans gathering

The atmosphere inside and outside the Cologne Stadium is building up as fans from both nations gather in full voice. Spanish fans, adorned in red and yellow, are confident and buoyant, while Georgian supporters, draped in white and red, are hopeful and excited.

The energy and passion are palpable. I've got a feeling like this could be a special night.

What the managers say

"Spain are the best team in the competition so far, but anything can happen. It’s impossible to succeed if you only think about how to defend. We want to show that we can perform as we did against Portugal. It was a very emotional moment to go through because we did the unexpected. We are very happy. Spain have had more time to recover, but it’s OK – I’m sure my players are well recovered and excited to get on the pitch."

Willy Sagnol, Georgia coach

What the managers say

We have massive respect for Georgia. They have had a brilliant tournament and we need to be at our best to progress. I know Georgian football really well and I’ve seen the evolution in their players and the way they play in different leagues in Europe.

We simply have to do what we always try to do – produce the best version of ourselves.

Luis de la Fuente, Spain coach

Jumping back to the confirmed team news, there's no surprise to see De La Fuente make 10 changes after rotation was used for game three in the group (with nothing riding on it for them). Only Laporte plays again.

Just as unsurprisingly, Georgia are unchanged from that Portugal win.

Just under an hour till kick off now. In case you were wondering, today's other game has gone to extra-time.

England were trailing for much of regular time but a Jude Bellingham injury-time overhead kick leveled things up (many would say undeservedly so). And then no sooner than the first period of extra time had begun, Harry Kane headed in to give England a 2-1 lead.

I'll update you later on how it goes.

Spain vs Georgia: expected styles

Spain are expected to dominate possession, with their slick passing and movement designed to pull Georgia’s defense out of shape. The trio of Pedri, Rodri, and Fabián Ruiz in midfield will look to control the tempo and create opportunities for the front three.

Georgia, on the other hand, will likely adopt a defensive stance, relying on their 5-3-2 formation to stay compact and frustrate Spain. Their main threat will come from quick transitions, using the pace and skill of Kvaratskhelia and Mikautadze to exploit any gaps left by the Spanish defense. It promises to be a fascinating tactical battle.

Spanish kids

It's worth remembering that Spanish coach Luis de la Fuente has been working with a talented group of players, both experienced and young.

In fact, there can't be too many years between some of the stars and the mascots that stroll out with them in a short while.

Spain vs Georgia: previous meeting

The last encounter between these two teams was during the Euro 2024 qualifiers in November 2023, where Spain secured a 3-1 victory.

Spain dominated the match, but Georgia managed to put up a fight, scoring a goal through Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. While the odds are fairly clear on this result, knockout games in tournaments like these can often defy expectations.

Georgia will be hoping to rewrite the script tonight.

How they got here: Georgia surprise

Can you believe that some Euro 24 sweep organisers left out Georgia as one of the 'no chance' teams competing in the competition? (Yes, I may not live that down if they go on to do a Greece.)

The former Soviet republic's journey has been nothing short of miraculous. Heading into Matchday 3 with just one point, they needed a victory against Portugal to advance. Against all odds, they managed a 2-0 win, with Kvaratskhelia and Mikautadze scoring. Their progression is a testament to their fighting spirit and tactical discipline.

Georgia’s debut in the knockouts is a historic moment for the nation, and they will look to continue their fairytale run against the mighty Spain.

How they got here: Spain impress

Spain have been dominant in this tournament to far and have picked up a few extra fans along the way with their exciting style and individuals.

They won all three group games without conceding a goal, defeating Croatia 3-0, Italy 1-0 (arguably the performance of the tournament so far) and Albania 1-0: defensively solid and flowing attacking vibrancy.

In Spain they are whispering "si, podemos" but can they? They have a tough route to the final.

Georgia: Mamardashvili; Tsitaishvili, Dvali, Kashia, Kverkvelia, Kakabadze; Kochorashvili, Kiteishvili, Chakvetadze; Kvaratskhelia, Mikautadze.
