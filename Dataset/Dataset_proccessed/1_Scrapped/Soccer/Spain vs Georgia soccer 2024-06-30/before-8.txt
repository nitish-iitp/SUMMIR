BYRHYS JONES

PUBLISHED 26/06/2024 AT 22:52 GMT

Khvicha Kvaratskhelia has hailed Georgia’s 2-0 win over Portugal as “the best day of my life” after the historic win ensured his country reached the knockouts of their first European Championship. Kvaratskhelia opened the scoring for the Georgians inside two minutes and a goal from Georges Mikautadze in the second half sealed a truly inspiring win.

Khvicha Kvaratskhelia hailed Georgia’s 2-0 win over Portugal as “the best day of my life” after his country reached the knockouts of their first European Championship.
The Wednesday night win saw them through to the last 16 of Euro 2024 as one of the best third-placed teams, where they will face Spain.

Georgia started the match at a blistering pace and Kvaratskhelia netted with less than two minutes on the clock in Gelsenkirchen.

They withheld a barrage of Portuguese attacks throughout the game and Georges Mikautadze doubled Georgia's lead in the second half with his third goal of the tournament.
Speaking after the match, Kvaratskhelia said that Wednesday's win was even better than winning the Serie A title with Napoli last year.
"The Scudetto was great but today I'm so happy because you're playing for your country," Kvaratskhelia said after the game.
"This is the best day of my life because it was more difficult to do this with the Georgian team than win the Scudetto with Napoli.
"It was always a dream of mine to play for the national team and we made it through to next round, it's difficult to describe my emotions."

Captain and talisman Kvaratskhelia was at the heart of everything, winning eight duels and attracting four fouls while skipping past a myriad of Portuguese players.
Georgia now face a daunting battle with Spain in Cologne on Monday.
Luis de la Fuente's side emerged from the group stage as the only team to win all three games and not concede a single goal in the process.
They are now rightly one of the tournament favourites after winning Group B.
