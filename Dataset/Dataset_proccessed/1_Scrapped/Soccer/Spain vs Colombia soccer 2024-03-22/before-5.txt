WHAT HAPPENED?

The Chelsea full-back has remained out of action since injuring his hamstring against Everton in December. He later underwent surgery and is yet to return to the Blues' training. Along with Manchester United's Luke Shaw, James is racing against time to regain full fitness and be considered by Southgate for the England squad that will travel to Germany in June for the Euro 2024.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Despite James' lack of game time this season, especially in the last three and half months, Southgate refused to rule out the defender for the upcoming continental competition as he remained optimistic that the Blues' skipper would be back in action and prove himself before the current season ends.

WHAT GARETH SOUTHGATE SAID

Speaking to reporters, the Three Lions boss said, "Could he play seven games in the Euros? His record over the last few years would suggest no. But is he a top-level player who could provide something important? No question.

"So yeah again he is another one who the first step is get back into training, get back into the team and build that physical resistance as quickly as you can."

WHAT NEXT FOR REECE JAMES?

Dr. Lasse Lempainen, who operated on James, had informed The Telegraph back in December that the player would get into shape before the European championship. It remains to be seen when the 24-year-old returns to training under Mauricio Pochettino.
