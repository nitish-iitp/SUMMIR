INDIANOLA, Iowa - Facing the 13th-ranked UW-Eau Claire Blugolds at home, Ronaldo Ordaz delivered two clutch goals to force a 2-2 draw on Sunday afternoon.

Squaring off were two of the best scorers in the country in Ordaz and Nathan Donovan of UWEC (9-1-3), and the stars did not disappoint. Donovan struck first, a PK in the 28th minute to put the Blugolds up 1-0. Ordaz and the Storm (4-5-2) responded right before halftime, scoring in the 42nd minute to equalize.

UWEC struck quickly into the second half, scoring just 10 minutes in to open back up a one-goal lead. However, the lead was erased in the 75th minute, when Ordaz beat his defender in the box, and lofted the ball over the keeper for what proved to be the final goal of the match.

GOAL SUMMARY

After a close call in the box in the 25th minute, UWEC was awarded the PK, and Donovan went near post to put the first goal of the match on the board.
With only a few minutes remaining in the half, Ordaz reset the tone, scoring his sixth goal of the season, and was assisted by Mitchell Dickson.
In the 56th minute, with the ball outside the top of the box, two Blugolds flipped the ball from the top, to the far side, before crossing in to find an open teammate, scoring on a header.
20 minutes later, in the 75th minute, Zach Kline won the ball on the near side just before the midfield line, and found a streaking Ordaz down the center. Ordaz beat his defender to the ball at the top of the box, then went over the top of the crashing keeper to score his seventh goal of the season, tying the match at 2-2.

NOTABLES

Ordaz's multi-goal performance marked the second time of the season, matching a season-high two goals against Knox on Sept. 14 at Buxton stadium.
Dickson earned his first assist of the season, and his seventh point, tying him for second-most on the team with Kline.
Simpson recorded seven shots in the match, five coming from Ordaz, and one from Dickson and Kline each.
Mason Chaplin got the start in goal, going the full 90-minutes, and limited the high-scoring Blugolds' offense to only two goals on 12 shots with three saves.
The two goals from the Storm marked only the fourth time this season an offense has managed to score multiple goals against the Blugolds.

UP NEXT

Simpson returns to conference action for the rest of the season, facing off at Luther on Wednesday, Oct. 9 at 5:00 p.m..
