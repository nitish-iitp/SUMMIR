Romania slam 'shameful' draw manipulation claim vs. Slovakia

Suggestions that Romania and Slovakia would manipulate the draw that guaranteed both progressed to the Euro 2024 last 16 were shameful, Romania coach Edward Iordanescu said on Wednesday after the game ended 1-1.

The complexities of Group E, in which all four teams were on three points after two matches, meant one point each would suffice whatever happened in the other game between Belgium and Ukraine.

Slovakia led with an Ondrej Duda header but Romania equalised thanks to Razvan Marin's penalty after a foul on Ianis Hagi and both sides had further chances in a match played partly in a huge thunderstorm.

Romania finished top with four points ahead of Belgium, who drew 0-0 with Ukraine -- courtesy of scoring more goals in the group -- while Slovakia advanced as one of the best third-placed teams.

It was the first time in 24 years Romania have reached the European Championship knockout rounds, reviving memories of their great teams of the past.

Iordanescu spoke of his pride in the new generation, saying they had restored Romania's spirit, but he was clearly agitated that anyone thought his side would play for a draw.

"I believe it was clear that both teams gave everything for 80 minutes," Iordanescu told reporters. "Everybody gave their best. To speak before a game and to throw mud to the teams and to the players and to our work and to our dignity is shameful.

"They should have waited and see and then judge us, so this was shameful, it was not nice. They threw this garbage to us but not just to us but to the team, to our fans and to everybody.

"We showed that we have character. Romania all the time fights with character and if we were going to lose and go home, we would have gone home but with our dignity intact."

Iordanescu did not point the finger at anyone in particular but former Romania player Danut Lupu had stirred the pot by saying in an interview with AS.Ro that a draw had been arranged and there was no point risking a loss.

The statistics did not suggest two sides not going for the win with Slovakia having 13 goal attempts to Romania's nine, nine of them on target. Iordanescu said only in the last 10 minutes did his team play to secure the draw.

Romania have impressed at the tournament, as have their passionate fans who celebrated wildly on Wednesday.

"Almost the whole stadium was yellow. They were so close. They followed us at the train station, at the hotel, when we went on trips, training, when we got back to the hotel," Iordanescu said.

"That's absolutely incredible. And I really hope that this will continue."
