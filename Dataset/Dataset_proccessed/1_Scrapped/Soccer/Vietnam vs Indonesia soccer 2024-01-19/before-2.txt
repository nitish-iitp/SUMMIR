JAKARTA - The Indonesian national team will face Vietnam in the second match of Group D of the 2023 Asian Cup at the Abdullah bin Khalifa Stadium, Friday, January 19, 2024.

One of Garuda's squad players, Rafael Struick, is optimistic that he can take the three points against Vietnam. You see, coach Shin Tae-yong has conducted many evaluations of the defeat of the inaugural match against Iraq 1-3.

"After the first match, I think the evaluation is that we have to work even harder in the second match. Now, we are focused on the match against Vietnam later," said Rafael.

"I saw their match (Vietnam) against Japan. We will sharpen our pattern of play in scoring goals against Iraq," he said on the PSSI website.

Furthermore, Rafael emphasized that the attack exercise was a way to overcome the tightness of Vietnam's defensive line.

"Their defense is good. We will try to dismantle it. It will be difficult possible, but we have a chance to be able to do it," he said.

Rafael Struick's belief cannot be separated from the motivation to break the negative record of the Indonesian national team when meeting Vietnam.

Judging by the last six meetings, the Garuda Squad has never won with details of three series and three defeats.

Meanwhile, Rafael said he was in good condition, but a little tired after the first match. Even so, it's not a problem.

He is ready to give his best so that the Indonesian national team can get the perfect points against Vietnam to keep their chances of qualifying for the last 16 of the 2023 Asian Cup while improving the statistics of the encounter.

Currently, the Indonesian national team occupies the fourth position in the Asian Cup Group D standings without points. The acquisition was the same as Vietnam, but the Garuda squad lost the goal difference.

Apart from that, the clash between the Indonesian vs Vietnam national team in the Asian Cup was the first time this has happened. Previously, the two teams had never met in this Asian Confederation's biggest football event.
