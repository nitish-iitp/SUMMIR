Hargo.co.id – The victory of the Indonesian National Team in the ongoing 2023 Asian Cup against Vietnam is considered not solely due to technical factors. There’s a non-technical factor mentioned to play a significant role in the success of the Garuda Squad.

Football observer Tommy Welly stated that one of these non-technical factors is the remark made by the Chairman of the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI), Erick Thohir, to the players of the Garuda Squad before they faced Vietnam.

“Because there is a change. Because there is a remark from Erick Thohir, ‘players who are sluggish, just go home.’ That has an influence,” said Towel, his nickname, in a podcast on the Sportify Indonesia YouTube channel.

“Because losing means giving an alarm, apparently,” he added.

Indonesia successfully kept their hopes alive to advance to the Round of 16 in the 2023 Asian Cup. This success is attributed to their victory against Vietnam in the ongoing Group D match of the 2023 Asian Cup.

Indonesia’s solitary goal in the match at the Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Stadium on Friday night (19/01) was scored by Asnawi Mangkualam from the penalty spot in the 42nd minute. The goal originated from a foul committed by a Vietnamese defender against Rafael Struick.

With this victory, Indonesia’s position rose to third place in the temporary standings, collecting three points from two matches.

In the final match of the group stage, Indonesia will face Japan. This match is scheduled to take place at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium on Wednesday (24/01).

However, according to Towel – Tommy Welly’s affectionate nickname – there is another factor that also contributed to Indonesia’s victory against Vietnam. In this match, he stated that Indonesia’s mindset and tactics had also changed.

“Tactically, their play has changed. The mindset is not negative,” said Towel.

“More daring to play openly. More daring to play offensively. Against Iraq, six players were actually in a defensive position. So, it tends to be negative,” he added.

Furthermore, according to Towel, the tactics formulated by Shin Tae-yong were well-implemented by the players of the Garuda Squad in this match. They were able to adapt the playing scheme when attacking and defending.

“When attacking, they play 3-4-3. When defending, they play 5-4-1. This means flexibility in modern football theory. That’s the way,” praised Towel.

“High intensity. They also successfully exploited Vietnam’s tactical failure in the first half,” he concluded. (Bola.net/Dendy Gandakusumah)
