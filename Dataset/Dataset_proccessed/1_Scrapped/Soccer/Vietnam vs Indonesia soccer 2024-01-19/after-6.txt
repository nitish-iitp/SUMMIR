WHY IS AUSTRALIA PLAYING?

Australia has been participating in the 2024 Asian Cup as a member of the Asian Football Confederation since June 2005. This decision was made due to the lack of clear direction in the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) for the Socceroos, as well as the absence of a full World Cup quota allocated to the OFC.
Australia's official debut as a member of the Asian Confederation came in February 2006, when they participated in the qualifiers for the 2007 Asian Cup. Since then, Australia has been an integral part of Asian soccer, participating in competitions and contributing to the development of the sport in the region.

THE LAST CHAMPION

The last champion was Qatar, in 2019. On that occasion, the Qataris won their first continental title in the UAE after defeating Japan in the final.

THE CHAMPIONS

Japan holds the record as the most successful team with 4 titles (1992, 2000, 2004 and 2011) in the Asian Cup. They are followed by Saudi Arabia (1984, 1988 and 1996) and Iran (1968, 1972 and 1976) with 3 titles each. South Korea has achieved glory on 2 occasions (1956 and 1960). Meanwhile, Israel (1964), Kuwait (1980), Iraq (2007), Australia (2015) and Qatar (2019) have one title each in their competition history.

THE NO. 1 CONTENDER

Japan is positioned as the top favorite. Since their elimination in the round of 16 at the World Cup against Croatia on penalties, they have suffered only one defeat and have accumulated eight consecutive victories, including a resounding 4-1 win over Germany. Beyond their excellent results, the team has shown remarkable play and impressive offensive power, scoring a total of 40 goals in 10 games during 2023.

WHAT IS THE FORMAT LIKE?

It is comparable to the format of the European Championship. The initial phase will involve 24 teams in six groups of four. The top two finishers from each group, along with the four best runners-up, will advance to the round of 16, after which elimination will be straightforward.

Must win or win

On the other hand, Vietnam also arrives at the Asian Cup of Nations with the illusion of having a great performance and looking to fight to reach the knockout stages where they can fight to win the Cup. As in the previous and upcoming match, Vietnam arrives as the victim on paper of the match as they usually do not have great performances in the history of these tournaments, however, this match can serve as a breath of fresh air since getting the three units would put them squarely into the fight to qualify in a group where Japan and Iraq are the favorites to take the tickets that give access to the next phase.

Surprise is the order of the day

The Indonesian national team will have to take advantage of this match against the Vietnam national team to take a breakthrough and raise their collective soccer towards their attempt to qualify for the knockout stages of the 2024 Asian Cup of Nations. Indonesia also faces a very strict group, but with a real and high possibility of qualifying to the next stage of this tournament. For this game, they will have to take advantage of the possibility of getting three points against a team that may not represent a strong threat to get the three points, since their next game, which will close their participation in the group stage of the tournament, will be against Iraq, a team that does represent a danger and is much more favored to get three points to qualify as second in the group.

The Asian Cup of Nations is here

The new edition of the Asian Nations Cup is back with the best actions, emotions, controversies, plays, goals, players and matches of one of the biggest continents in the world where soccer has grown by leaps and bounds. Little by little, the continent's nations began to export several players to the world's top leagues and the project bore fruit as they gathered their best players to represent the colors of their flag with dignity on the pitch in the search for eternal glory in Asia. In this group stage match between Vietnam and Indonesia, both teams will be able to test the level they will face in the next match and the level they will have to be at to be able to face a great challenge such as this tournament. Also, after a long time away from national competitions, these 90 minutes will be useful for the players to polish and fine-tune minimum details, improving their collective and individual game.
