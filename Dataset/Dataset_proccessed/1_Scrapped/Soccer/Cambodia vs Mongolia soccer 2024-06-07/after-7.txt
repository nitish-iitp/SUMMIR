The sides meet after almost five years

Cambodia host Mongolia at the Phnom Penh Olympic Stadium in Phnom Penh on Friday for an international friendly. Both teams were knocked out in the first round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, and will hence only play a pair of friendlies this month.

Ranked 179th in the world, Cambodia lost 1-0 on aggregate to Pakistan in the first round of the World Cup qualifiers. Since then, Koupreys played in two friendlies and lost both, a 2-0 defeat to Equatorial Guinea followed by a 4-1 thumping by Guyana, both coming as part of the FIFA Series.

Head coach Félix Dalmás has called up 26 players for this month's double-header against Mongolia, including rising star Sieng Chanthea, who has scored six goals in 32 games for the side.

Angkor Tiger defender Nu Chenmakara and Boeung Ket midfielder Nop David are the only two uncapped players in the squad.

On the other hand, Mongolia lost 1-0 home and away to Afghanistan in the first round of the World Cup qualifiers, ending their campaign prematurely and on a poor note.

Since then, the Blue Wolves were seen in action against Azerbaijan and Tanzania, losing both games. They conceded four goals and scored none, extending their losing run to five games in all competitions, whereas Mongolia haven't won an official clash since June 2022.
