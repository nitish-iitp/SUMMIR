Nigeria’s Super Eagles crushed a Dubai Club 12-0 in a 2023 AFCON preparatory game on Sunday, January 7, 2024 in Abu Dhabi.

Atalanta winger Ademola Lookman scored 4 goals in the resounding 12-0 win over Dubai Cultural Sports Club in the game played behind closed doors.

The Eagles were 6-0 up at half time with CAF Men’s Player of the Year Victor Osimhen bagging a brace in the encounter.

Substitute Moses Simon also grabbed a brace alongside Umar Sadiq, while the crushed Dubai Club contributed two own goals to the scoreline.

Coach Jose Peseiro tutored Super Eagles will on Monday, January 8, 2024 play a more competitive friendly against fellow AFCON-bound Guinea at the Bani Yas Stadium.

The Eagles are expected back in Nigeria on Tuesday before leaving for Cote d’Ivoire the next day for AFCON 2023 where they will open their Group A campaign against Equatorial Guinea on 14 January.
