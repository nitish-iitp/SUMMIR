Football followers and lovers of the senior men’s national team, the Super Eagles have expressed divergent feelings following the team’s 2-0 defeat to Guinea in a friendly match played at Abu Dhabi on Monday.

The Super Eagles were beaten 2-0 by the Syli Stars of Guinea in their final friendly ahead of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations.

The encounter at the Banis Yas Stadium, Abu Dhabi, was played behind closed doors.

The Syli Stars took the lead in the 14th minute and doubled their advantage on 64 minutes.

Reacting to the outcome of the game on X, some sports lovers felt disappointed, saying they are not expecting the team to fly at Ivory Coast.

@Celineemykeny said, “I like the fact that you all don’t want to show yourself now, we don’t want the opposing team to understand our tactics until the main thing starts.”

@Tbksports noted, “Like I said before, it’s just a friendly, AFCON 2023 will be different and we are winning it.”

Another X user, @exquisiteDemola added, “Personally I don zero my expectations on you guys… Just go the AFCON and mark attendance.”

@Tobyasky said, “Guinea is beating us and we want to win AFCON. You guys ehn!
Osimhen can even pay the salary of the full Guinea squad, Nawa!”

In the same vein, @mchajji observed, “This is not good. The Super Eagles need to find a solution asap.”

Reacting to the defeat, @chinedu_Anyanwu advised Nigerians, “My advice for this AFCON:
Don’t count on this team! Don’t expect any good thing as far as Peseiro is in charge.”

@AGINAS said, “Thank God DSTV no go show this AFCON, na more sadness una for add to Nigerians. We’re not ready for another heartbreak.

The Super Eagles will return to Lagos on Tuesday night where they will be hosted by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu.

The three-time African champions will depart for Abidjan on Wednesday for the tournament proper.
