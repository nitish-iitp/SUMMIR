In preparation for the highly anticipated AFCON 2023, Nigeria's Super Eagles are gearing up for a face-off against Guinea in a friendly match set for Monday, January 8, 2024.

Originally, the Eagles had plans for two friendlies against Burkina Faso and Cape Verde. However, these plans were reshuffled after the cancellation of these fixtures. Now, the team will play Guinea then return to Nigeria on January 9 before a next-day departure to Ivory Coast.

Guinea friendly a true test

The team has already established a training camp in Dubai, where players are being put through their paces to gear up for the upcoming tournament.

The friendly against Guinea holds immense significance for the Super Eagles. It's a critical moment for fine-tuning strategies and carefully assessing the squad's readiness just before the continental tournament kicks off.

Coach Super Peseiro remains resolute, expressing confidence in his team's capabilities to excel in the tournament as he believes the squad he selected is good enough to lift the title. The test match against Syli National serves as a gauge of the team's progress in the final days leading up to the championship.

Federal Government approves AFCON budget

Meanwhile, there's good news on the financial front for the team. The Federal Government of Nigeria has approved the release of $1.3million to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) for the team’s AFCON campaign.

This fund will cover expenses such as the salaries of Super Eagles coach Jose Peserio and his coaching staff. Additionally, it will address outstanding allowances dating back to 2021.

The financial support comes as a relief for the NFF, which has been grappling with a lack of funds to pay the coach and clear outstanding payments. It also eases off-field concerns for both the coach and players, allowing them to focus wholeheartedly on their game without distractions.
