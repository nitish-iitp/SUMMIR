Guinea launches AFCON 2023 commitments against Cameroon on January 15.

Ibrahim Kone of Hibernians starred for his nation Guinea as he saved a penalty on their way to a famous victory over African giants Nigeria.

The two teams met in their final warm-up game before this month’s Africa Cup of Nations which will be held in the Ivory Coast.

Kone, who was collecting his 16th cap for Guinea, kept Nigeria at bay when he denied Moses Simon, who plies his trade with Ligue 1’s Nantes, from the spot on the 20th minute.

Simon was one of the high-profile players that composed Nigeria’s starting formation which include dalso Milan’s Samuel Chukwueze.

Guinea scored both goals on the 15th minute through Agibou Camara and Facinet Conte, just past the hour mark.

This victory will inject some crucial morale boost into Guinea’s camp even though they will be sweating on the status of star strike Serhou Guirassy – 19 goals in 16 games for Stuttgart this season – who had to be subbed off after just 26 minutes having picked up an apparent injury.

Kone’s Guinea launch their campaign on January 15 when they cross swords with another tournament favourite in Cameroon.

Their Group C commitments will pit them against defending champions Senegal and Gambia, led by former Malta coach Tom Saintfiet.

Prior to joining Guinea for this tournament, Kone played every single league game for Hibernians this season, keeping two clean sheets in the process.
