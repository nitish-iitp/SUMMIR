Nigerians in S.A Cautioned against Ferocity Ahead of AFCON Semifinals

The High Commission of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Pretoria, South Africa, has warned its citizens living in South Africa against the overwhelming threats from South Africans, mostly on social media platforms targeting the Nigerians, ahead of the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) semifinals that will be witnessed on Wednesday, February 7, 2024.

According to the advisory note released by the High Commission of the Federal Republic of Nigeria based in Pretoria, South Africa, the Nigerian community should be careful of their utterances, selective in the places to watch the match from, and provocative weird celebrations, among others.

“The High Commission hereby advises the Nigerian community to be watchful of their utterances, be mindful of where to watch the match, especially in public places, and refrain from engaging in loud, riotous, or provocative celebrations should the Super Eagles win the match,” the advisory note read in part.

According to the advisory note, Nigerians should maintain the good conduct they are known for and be law-abiding before, during, and after the match.

“Should any provocations arise, they should not be reciprocated but reported to the appropriate authorities,” the advisory read.

This has come after the attention of the Nigerian High Commission in Pretoria was drawn to potentially inflammatory online comments made by a section of South African citizens against Nigerians living in the host country, largely influenced by the forthcoming 2023 AFCON semi-final match between the Super Eagles and the Bafana Bafana on Wednesday, February 7, 2024.

The Commission noted that most of the comments consist of veiled threats against Nigerians cooking jollof rice before the match and showing pepper to Nigerians if the Bafana Bafana loses to the Super Eagles, among others.

Meanwhile, Nigeria, South Africa, DR Congo, and host Ivory Coast are in the last four of the 2023 CAF Africa Cup of Nations.
