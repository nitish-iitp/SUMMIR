You need sabi how to protect your heart against cardiac arrest during football match
Penalty shoot-outs 'fit trigger heart attacks'

Penalty shoot-outs fit get far more serious consequences dan knockout from football tournament, one study suggest.

Researchers bin find say di number of heart attacks increase by 25% wen England lost to Argentina for one penalty competition for di 1998 World Cup.

Di findings bin provide strong evidence to back up di theory say heart attacks fit dey triggered by emotional wahala.

Also stressful situation fit be anoda problem, sabi pipo tok.

Dem say strong rivalry fit generate stress, wey for some cases, get serious consequence for health.

Researcher Professor Douglas Carroll, of University of Birmingham, bin tell BBC News Online say na two components dey to heart attack.

First, na di long-term build-up of fatty deposits for di blood vessels, and second na di formation of clots, wey block blood supply, and trigger attack.

Im theory na say traumatic, or emotionally disturbing, events like football match fit trigger di second stage of dis process for pipo wey already dey at risk.

Body changes

"Di idea na say traumatic events dey directly affect systems within di bodi, in particular e dey increase blood pressure and di thickness and stickiness of di blood, to create di preconditions clot for people wey dey at risk," e bin tok.

"You fit get pipo to avoid key football matches, but perhaps dem need take steps to keep calm during dis kind events.

"Maybe pipo suppose watch dis matches wit small, rather dan larger groups so dem fit avoid one kind of excitement.

"Also, maybe e go be good idea to try to moderate consumption of alcohol."

Professor Carroll suggest say im findings fit make football authorities scrap penalty shoot-out as one way to resolve key matches.

"Di majority of football fans wey I know no like penalty shoot-outs, and say e get provisional health evidence say dey fit no be di greatest tin either, maybe dem go look for alternative solution." E tok.

Emaye wey be di co-founder of Chekker add say pipo wey don already get existing heart problems fit dey at high risk and e dey important to take steps to reduce am.

“Before di match, make pipo wey get heart issues go do confam check-up to know say dem dey okay. Dem need to also know di signs wey dey cause heart attack and e include chest pain or feeling out of breath.”
