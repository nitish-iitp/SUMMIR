<image:caption>Dr David Coyle, an entomologist at Clemon University, told DailyMail.com that Jorō spiders do not fly ‘like the monkeys in the Wizard of Oz,’ because they are too large - only the spiderlings can travel by threads of silk captured by the wind</image:caption>

<image:caption>A 'haunting' image, 'Red Bean Paste Balls', by Chinese photographer Zhonghua Yang, has won the overall prize of Pink Lady Food Photographer of the Year 2024. The image, which had first won the Champagne Taittinger Food for Celebration category, was taken in the rural area of Xiangshan, Zhejiang during busy preparations for a feast for the Spring Festival, also known as Lunar New Year. This includes the tradition of making dim sum, such as red bean dumplings, steamed rice cakes and glutinous rice cake, each of which has a legacy of traditional craftsmanship. 'This wonderful, perfectly balanced image is full of light, shadow, mystery and poignancy,' said Caroline Kenyon, founder of the Pink Lady® Food Photographer of the Year. 'It is clear a celebratory feast is being prepared. The food is exquisitely made, its circular shapes contrasting with the angularity of the fretwork screens, through which the light pours. Meanwhile, the woman who has made the food, weary, carries in yet another tray. Her role is to labour and to serve, while the guests party and enjoy'</image:caption>

<image:caption>A self portrait of the Delaney McQuown eating a BLT without inhibition won the Claire Aho Award for Women Photographers. Commenting on her piece, titled 'BLT Contemplation', the Ohio-based photographer said: ‘This photograph is part of my ongoing self-portrait project, urging women to find liberation through unidealised self-images. Excessive self-documentation fosters familiarity, enabling women to exist unapologetically in photos. Capturing myself eating a BLT without inhibition felt fitting, given the complex relationships women often have with their bodies and food. I’m passionate about women embracing their cameras, leading to liberation and self-love'</image:caption>

<image:caption>Joe Biden's cognitive decline has become readily apparent to dozens of high-ranking officials who have interacted with in recent months. He is seen here in the White Houses Situation Room back in April, during a then ongoing airborne attack on Israel from Iran</image:caption>
</image:image>

<image:caption>The report was based on interviews with more than 45 people Washington officials secured over several months, on the heels of a series of increasingly serious slip-ups by the president, seen here delivering remarks at the White House in February</image:caption>
</image:image>

<image:caption>In one instance mentioned by the Journal, Biden seemed to not understand one of his own policies during a conversation with Mike Johnson, seen here after a meeting about Ukraine spending also mentioned by the Journal, where sources said Biden appeared visibly out of it</image:caption>
</image:image>
<image:image>

<image:caption>The conversation allegedly occurred after the president pulled the speaker aside for a one-on-one chat after a meeting in the Oval Office on February 27 (seen here), attended by heavyweights like Vice President Kamala Harris, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer</image:caption>

<image:caption>Those who witnessed the exchange detailed how Johnson seemed visibly horrified by the fact Biden appeared to have forgotten details of his own policy - especially at a time where the US is involved with not one, but two conflicts at risk of reaching World War-levels</image:caption>
</image:image>

<image:caption>Others pointed to the commander-in-chief's declining grasp of important policy details, and increasing reliance on notes and impromptu offerings from aides. The president is seen reading from a cheat cheat during a meeting with Israel's Isaac Herzog</image:caption>

<image:caption>This year, Biden confused a Congressional funding bill for Ukraine with NATO, and reportedly gave a bumbling interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur, who in turn described the 81-year-old Democrat's memory as 'hazy,' 'fuzzy,' 'faulty,' and 'poor'</image:caption>

<image:caption>He added the president's mental faculties have 'significant limitations', as his physical capabilities have also come into question. Biden is seen falling on stage during the 2023 United States Air Force Academy Graduation Ceremony at Falcon Stadium this time last year</image:caption>

<image:caption>Like many politicians, Biden often workshops lines he'll be able to use later - for larger crowds - when he's in more intimate settings. Problems, however, arise when reporters are on the scene - and the president's words, because of his current position of power, are judged more harshly than a candidate's</image:caption>
