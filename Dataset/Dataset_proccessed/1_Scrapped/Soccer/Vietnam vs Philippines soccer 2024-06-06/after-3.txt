June 6, 2024 | 21:08

TPO - 34 days after being appointed as head coach of the Vietnam team, Mr. Kim Sang-sik officially debuted in the match against the Philippines at My Dinh. It was a bit difficult, but the emotional 3-2 victory brought a good start for the Korean strategist.




On the evening of 6/6 at My Dinh, Mr. Kim Sang-sik officially debuted as the coach of the Vietnam National Team in the match against the Philippines, the 1st match of 5 Group F of the 2026 World Cup Qualifiers.




This is also coach Kim Sang-sik's first match leading a national team. Before that, he spent more than 2 years in charge of Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors, a club in K League 1.




Before the match, Mr. Kim declared, "This is the first match leading the Vietnamese team, our goal is to win."




For 90 minutes, the Korean coach always appeared on the pitch, instead of sitting on the training bench.




The 47-year-old coach shared, "wants to become a brother in the team, dedicatedly guiding and supporting the players to bring out their best." Therefore, on the field, he is ready to accompany his students throughout the match, constantly giving instructions and urging Quang Hai and his teammates to move forward.




After each situation, coach Kim Sang-sik immediately shouted to the players, telling them what was or wasn't possible.




Like his predecessor Park Hang-seo, coach Kim Sang-sik is also not afraid to collide with the referee team in football matches where he believes his students must be better protected.




In the stands, former Vietnam national team coach Park Hang-seo was also present, cheering on his compatriot strategist. Before coming to Vietnam, Mr. Kim consulted Mr. Park and received many valuable advice.




When the Vietnam team suddenly took the lead, coach Kim Sang-sik was quite calm. At the same time, continue to encourage student spirit.




3 minutes after conceding, Tien Linh brought home the equalizer for Vietnam National Team. The 47-year-old teacher celebrated but remained calm, asking his students to suppress their emotions while the match was still long.




Only when Tien Linh scored twice, increasing the score to 2-1 in the 76th minute, did the Korean coach comfortably celebrate.




He jumped up on the pitch, then brightly greeted hero Tien Linh.




Finally, all emotions exploded with Pham Tuan Hai's stoppage-time goal. On the touchline, coach Kim Sang-sik jumped up to celebrate like a child. The Korean strategist had his first victory as Vietnam national team coach.
