PETALING JAYA: Malaysia defeated Lebanon 1-0 at the National Stadium in Bukit Jalil tonight for the national team’s first victory in the Merdeka tournament after 11 years.

Harimau Malaya’s solitary goal came courtesy of naturalised Malaysian, Romel Morales, in the 33rd minute, Bernama reported.

Malaysia’s new coach, Pau Marti Vicente, made six changes to the starting 11 who defeated the Philippines on Wednesday. He brought in midfielders Endrick Dos Santos and Safawi Rasid, striker Syafiq Ahmad and defender La’vere Corbin Ong.

Malaysia signalled their intent as early as in the seventh minute when Safawi’s well-taken free kick was pushed out by Lebanon goalkeeper Mehdi Khalil.

They continued to dominate the proceedings and finally broke the deadlock when Morales swept home a pass from Dos Santos in the 33rd minute.

Lebanon, under Miodrag Radulovic, were nearly punished a second time but Mehdi did well to save a close-range attempt by substitute winger Arif Aiman Hanapi, who dribbled past a defender before unleashing a left-footed shot.

The 32-year-old goalkeeper was again called into action in the 57th minute but Akhyar Abdul Rashid’s attempt from close range was weak.

Lebanon had a good chance to equalise in the 67th minute but striker Karim Darwich, headed the ball straight at goalkeeper Ahmad Syihan Hazmi Mohamed.

Lebanon was forced to play the last 10 minutes of the match with 10 men after defender Khalil Khamis was sent off after picking up his second yellow card when he fouled Akhyar.

The victory over Lebanon, ranked 116 in global standings, helped Malaysia reclaim a trophy which they last won in 2013.

Tajikistan defeated the Philippines 4-3 in a penalty shootout to secure third place.

The tournament, once a highlight of the Asian football calendar, made a comeback last year after a nine-year lapse.
