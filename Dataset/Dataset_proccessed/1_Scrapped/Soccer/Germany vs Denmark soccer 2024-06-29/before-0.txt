EURO 2024
DENMARK 0-0 SERBIA: DANES PROGRESS TO LAST 16 OF EURO 2024 AFTER GOALLESS DRAW IN MUNICH, SERBIA OUT
BYWILL EVANS

UPDATED 25/06/2024 AT 21:48 GMT

Denmark moved into the last 16 of Euro 2024 following their third consecutive draw of the tournament. It was enough to knock out Serbia, who just couldn't find the goal they needed to maintain their hopes of progressing. Denmark finished second in the group after England drew with Slovenia to secure their position as group winners.

Denmark progressed to the Euro 2024 Round of 16 after a tense goalless draw against Serbia, who exited the tournament.
Though Serbia needed a win to progress, they mustered not a single shot in a first half of limited entertainment.

Denmark, meanwhile, knew they’d progress with a draw but still pursued victory – they were just unable to create anything clear cut, snatching at the various half-chances that came their way.

Both managers made various changes in the second half in an effort to up the pace and quality, and Dusan Tadic certainly made a difference to Serbia, skimming in a series of crosses, but his team-mates couldn't convert them.
Denmark, though, move on to face the hosts in Dortmund – what an occasion that will be – and if they can find just a little more creative spark, they could threaten a shock.
Denmark ended as runners-up behind England, who drew 0-0 with Slovenia to end as group winners.
TALKING POINT - WHAT NEXT FOR DEMARK?
Denmark created little tonight, but they still showed signs that they might be able to give Germany a game. Of course, we know they are doughty competitors from years past, but it will take more than that to win in Dortmund.

Germany tend to defend with a high line, and that is exactly what Rasmus Hojlund could enjoy with his pace and power to attack the space he may be left. In Christian Eriksen has a clubmate whose speciality is picking passes and runs.
In order to make this happen, Kasper Hjulmand might consider playing Eriksen off Hojlund, not as second striker, but with the specific objective of creating for him however he chose. Then, behind them, he could stiffen his side with another midfielder, Thomas Delaney perhaps, and trust them to protect Kasper Schmeichel's goal.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - CHRISTIAN ERIKSEN (DENMARK)
Eriksen was the classiest player on show - though had Dusan Tadic started, who knows what might have happened.
PLAYER RATINGS
Denmark: Schmeichel 6, Andersen 7, Christensen 6, Vestergaard 6, Bah 6, Hjulmand 6, Hojbjerg 5, Maehle 7, Eriksen 7, Wind 5, Hojlund 6. Subs: Skov Olsen 6, Dolberg 6, Kristiansen 6, Delaney 6, Poulsen 6.
Serbia: Rajkovic 6, Veljkovic 6, Milenkovic 7, Pavlovic 7, Mijailovic 6, Ilic 6, Gudelj 5, Zivkovic 6, Smardzic 6, Mitrovic 5, Lukic 6. Subs: Tadic 7, Jovic 6, Vlahovic 6, Mladenovic 6, Milinkovic-Savic 5.
KEY STAT
Cristian Eriksen now has 133 caps for Denmark - more than anyone other player for the nation. Had Simon Kjaer come on tonight, the good friends would have continued to share the record, but he did not and Eriksen is now out on his own.
KEY MOMENTS
16’ - BETTER!
Maehle comes inside off the left and curls a tasty ball to the far post and Bah, the opposite wing-back is there! But Zivkovic fouls him just enough to stop him getting in the header he wants, and just not enough to concede a penalty. So the ball goes wide, and regardless of whether or not he was impeded, he ought to have done better.

39’ - AAARRRGGHHH!
Nice from Denmark, building down the right, and when Bah puts the ball into the box, Hjulmand flicks behind him towards Hojlund who, with the defender behind him, does well to set back for Wind. But he's falling as he shoots, sending his effort high over the bar.

64’ - EXCELLENT DELIVERY FROM ERIKSEN
Ball swinging out and picking out Vestergaard, moving late - he's got a free header! But he doesn't quite time his jump, so can only plop a tame effort into Rajkovic's soft, grateful arms.

81’ - EXCELLENT FROM VLAHOVIC
Who chases down Maehle, looking to see the ball into touch, robbing him on the by-line and laying back for Mitrovic, who tries to curl one ... and doesn't, the shot going wide. That wasn't easy - he wasn't far from the side edge of the box - but it was the best sight of goal he's had tonight, by far.

86’ - MAEHLE DOWN THE RIGHT
And improbably, he digs out a terrific cross to the far post, Dolberg leaping to try and finish. But out of nowhere, Zivkovic leaps equally menacingly, arriving just first and hooking behind to prevent an almost certain goal. That is brilliant work and keeps his team in the competition.

90+2’ SERGEJ MILINKOVIC-SAVIC, THAT WAS YOUR MOMENT!
Tadic picks a lovely square ball into him, and though he's on the edge, he has a lot of goal at which to aim. But his low curler is completely mis-hit, and Schmeichel saves easily.
