Qatar host UAE in a FIFA World Cup qualifier on Thursday

Qatar will welcome the UAE to Ahmad bin Ali Stadium for a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier on Thursday. The hosts have not been in action since claiming a 2-1 comeback home win over India in the last round of the qualifiers in June 2024.

They went behind to Lallianzuala Chhangte's 37th-minute strike but Yousef Aymen drew the game level in the 71st minute. Ahmed Al Rawi scored the match-winner in the 85th minute.

The win saw The Maroons advance to this stage of the qualifiers as Group A winners with 16 points from six games.

The UAE, meanwhile, shared the spoils in a 1-1 draw at home to Bahrain. They went behind to Mehdi Hasan's fourth-minute strike while Sultan Adli drew the game level six minutes later.
