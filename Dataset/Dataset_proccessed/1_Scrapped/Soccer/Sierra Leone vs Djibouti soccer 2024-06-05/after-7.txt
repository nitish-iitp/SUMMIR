The Leone Stars of Sierra Leone secured a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Djibouti in their 2026 World Cup Qualifier match on Wednesday.

After a cautious opening, the home side took the lead through Curtis Davies’ strike in the 12th minute. They maintained pressure but failed to extend their advantage before a controversial moment in the 34th minute. A penalty awarded to Djibouti was converted by Gabriel Dadzie, sending the teams into halftime level.

The second half saw a similar pattern with renewed attacking intent from both sides. Augustus Kargbo restored Sierra Leone’s lead in the 51st minute. They held on despite defensive pressure from Djibouti to secure all three points.
