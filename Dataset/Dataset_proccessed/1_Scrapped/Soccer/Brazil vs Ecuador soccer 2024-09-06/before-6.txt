Manchester City could have 15 players in action during the upcoming September international break, with UEFA Nations League and FIFA World Cup qualifiers taking place.

The first hiatus of the season has arrived, with over a dozen Manchester City players selected to be involved in international fixtures, as FIFA World Cup qualifying begins in South America and the UEFA Nations League restarts in Europe.

Pep Guardiola’s side have enjoyed the perfect start to the new campaign, lifting the FA Community Shield against Manchester United, and sitting top of the Premier League table after securing three wins from three matches.

Erling Haaland, who is set to feature for Norway this month, has scored consecutive Premier League hat-tricks against both Ipswich Town and West Ham, with the 24-year-old having already scored seven goals in the league this season.

Phil Foden has played just 45 minutes for Manchester City so far this campaign, and is a doubt for England’s matches against both Ireland and Finland, despite being named in Lee Carsley’s first Three Lions squad.

Four Manchester City players have been selected for England duty, with Rico Lewis given a first international senior call-up, and Jack Grealish returning to the set-up following his omission for the European Championship.

Ilkay Gundogan, who re-signed for the Sky Blues from FC Barcelona will be afforded a break during the upcoming internationals, after the midfielder announced retirement from the German national team.

Ahead of the start of the first international break of the campaign, here is a comprehensive round-up of the Manchester City players selected to feature for their national team this month!
