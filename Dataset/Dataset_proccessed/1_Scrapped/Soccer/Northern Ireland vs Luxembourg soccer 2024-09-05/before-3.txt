Northern Ireland begin their 2024-25 UEFA Nations League campaign against Luxembourg at Windsor Park on Thursday night.

The two nations will be seeking to gain promotion from League C Group 3 along with Bulgaria and Belarus.

Following a disappointing 2023 during which they lost seven of their 10 international fixtures and subsequently failed to qualify for Euro 2024, Northern Ireland have since taken positives from their first four games of this year.

A 1-1 friendly draw with Romania and a narrow 1-0 win away against Scotland in March was followed by a heavy 5-1 friendly defeat to Euro 2024 champions Spain, but they returned to winning ways in their most recent fixture against European minnows Andorra on June 11.

Indeed, two goals from Liverpool right-back Conor Bradley secured a 2-0 home victory over Andorra - one of five wins celebrated by manager Michael O'Neil in 14 matches since he was re-appointed in December 2022.

Ranked 74th in the world by FIFA, Northern Ireland are hoping to improve on their last outing in the Nations League when they picked up just five points in six games to finish third in League C Group 2 behind Kosovo and group winners Greece.

The Green and White Army may have won just one game out of 16 in their Nations League history, but they have beaten Thursday's opponents Luxembourg in their last two meetings, including a 3-1 friendly away win in March 2022.

Like Northern Ireland, Luxembourg failed to qualify for Euro 2024 after losing in the playoff semi-finals to Georgia, but they did accumulate a record 17 points from 10 group matches, winning five of those.

Ranked 84th in the world by FIFA, Luxembourg have progressed as a nation in recent years, but there is still a considerable gap between themselves and the stronger European nations. Indeed, the Lions lost twice to Portugal by an aggregate score of 15-0 in Euro 2024 qualifying.

Luxembourg have since begun 2024 with three defeats in four matches, losing 2-0 to Greece and 3-0 to both France and Belgium in their most recent two friendlies, while their only win during this run was a 2-1 success at home to Kazakhstan.

Managed by Luc Holtz since 2010, Luxembourg came agonisingly close to securing promotion from League C of the 2022-23 Nations League, finishing second and just two points behind group winners Turkey despite winning three and drawing two of their six matches.

The Lions are now targeting a strong start to the new Nations League campaign and will hope to come out on top in Thursday's clash against a Northern Ireland side whom they have beaten just once before - a 3-2 home win during 2014 World Cup qualifying.

Northern Ireland and Manchester United defender Jonny Evans announced his international retirement last week, while O'Neill has revealed that midfielder Jordan Thompson and defender Brodie Spencer are both ruled out with injuries.

Goalkeeper Conor Hazard has also picked up an injury and will be assessed, as will Bolton Wanderers defender Eoin Toal, who has joined up with the national team squad despite missing his club's League One fixture last weekend.

Left-back Jamal Lewis is currently in Brazil after finalising a loan move from Newcastle United to Sao Paulo, but he is expected to join up with the squad in time to feature in Thursday's contest.

As for Luxembourg, Holtz has named an experienced squad that includes nine players who have over 50 international caps, including 104-cap Laurent Jans who is set to start at right-back.

Benfica's Leandro Barreiro, FC Koln's Mathias Olesen and Spartak Moscow's Christopher Martins Pereira could all feature in midfield, while Gerson Rodrigues - the nation's all-time top scorer with 21 goals - is set to lead the line.


Northern Ireland possible starting lineup:
Peacock-Farrell; Ballard, McNair, Brown; Bradley, McCann, S. Charles, Lewis; McCausland; D. Charles, Magennis

Luxembourg possible starting lineup:
Moris; Jans, Dzogovic, Chanot, Mahmutovic, Veiga; Martins Pereira, Bareiro, Olesen; Sinani, Rodrigues




We say: Northern Ireland 1-1 Luxembourg

Northern Ireland have got the better of Luxembourg in their previous two meetings, but a closer contest could be in store on Thursday. Both nations will fancy their chances of success, but we can see the spoils being shared on this occasion.
