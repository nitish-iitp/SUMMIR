Liverpool’s masterclass at Old Trafford which culminated in a 3-0 win has got fans eager to watch Arne Slot’s players as soon as possible. However, they will have to wait a little longer for the team to perform together again. 

Sunday's win against Manchester United has got fans excited and pumped for the rest of the season ahead with Liverpool taking 3 wins from their opening 3 games without conceding a goal and sitting second in the league behind Premier League champions Manchester City on goal difference. 

However, fans will have to wait before they can see Liverpool play again as there will be an International Break running from the 2nd September to the 11th. 

The International break is always filled with controversy with certain fans expressing their anger into why it occurs so early on into the season.

Liverpool will be facing Nottingham Forest on Saturday 14th September next at Anfield in a 3pm kick-off.

In the meantime, the International Break includes the beginning of the Nations League campaign for European teams, as well as World Cup 2026 Qualification matches for the South American and Asian countries. African countries are also partaking in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers. 

Players like Luiz Diaz and Mohamed Salah will be looking to extend on their goalscoring exploits going into these games.

Moreover, Liverpool’s U21 stars will be competing in their U21 Euros qualification campaigns groups. 

So with this occurring, who will our stars against United be playing, what competition will this be and at what time will these games happen?
