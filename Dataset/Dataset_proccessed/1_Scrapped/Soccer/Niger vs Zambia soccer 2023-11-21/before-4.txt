Zambia coach Avram Grant is not frustrated with the team’s defensive lapses.

The 2012 African Champions conceded two goals in two minutes as they survived a scare from the Red Devils of Congo.

Zambia went on to claim a 4-2 victory over Congo.

Grant highlighted that since he took over the team has been solid at back as unit.

“I never answer that question. Give me two days to think about it,” Grant joked when asked to rate Zambia’s performance against Congo.

“It was a good performance [and gave us] something we need to improve on,” he said

In the five competitive matches he has been in charge, the Chipolopolo Boys have shipped only in on two goals against Lesotho and a dead rubber match against Comoros.

“Until now the team as a defence have played well. I think we haven’t conceded [competitive matches] to many goals. One goal against Lesotho that was also a mistake of the goalkeeper.

“But if you see today, there are no easy games. Lesotho did 1-1 in Nigeria. So there are no easy games anymore.

“The performance second half was good, first half was so so.

Grant has only lost once in seven matches he has been in charge.

Begin working at home with Google! It’s by a wide margin the best occupation I’ve had. Last Wednesday I got a fresh out of the box new BMW since getting a check for $13474 this – a month past. I started this 8-months prior and promptly was bringing home at any rate $every hour. I work through this connection, go to tech tab

I would rather have a good defence in the team than a bad front line to be honest.
