Zambia will target a second win in their 2026 World Cup Qualifying campaign when they face ‘hosts’ Niger at Stade de Marrakesh in Morocco on the evening of Tuesday 21 November 2023.

Kick-off is at 9pm CAT.

Zambia opened Group E with an entertaining 4-2 win over Congo in Ndola last Friday, with Patson Daka (two), Lameck Banda and Fashion Sakala sharing the goals at the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium.

With group favourites Morocco only getting their campaign underway in a concurrent match against Tanzania in Dar Es Salaam on Tuesday night, this clash presents Chipolopolo with a chance to get a ‘jump’ on the Atlas Lions in the race for a spot at the next World Cup.

“We needed to show a lot of good football and mentality especially in the second half. We started the game well and we were leading 1-0,” said Zambia coach Avram Grant.

“But we slept a little bit and they scored two fantastic goals to be honest. Congo is a good team and know how to play good football

“Second half we dominated the game completely and this is game which could have ended even more. We missed good chances and they also missed two good chances but we deserved to win.”

Niger, meanwhile, opened their campaign on a low note, as they suffered a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Tanzania in Marrakesh on Saturday evening.

Charles M’Mombwa scored the only goal of the game 11 minutes into the second half as the Taifa Stars got the better of the Menas.

In head-to-head stats, Niger and Zambia have met in three matches, dating back as far as 2014. Two games have ended in draws, with one victory going the way of Chipolopolo. The teams last met in an international friendly in October 2019 which ended in a 1-1 draw.
