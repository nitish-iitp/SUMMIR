Jürgen Klopp’s side have had a week to forget, and suffered their first home loss in the Premier League since October 2022 on Sunday. Analyse the game on our Liverpool vs Crystal Palace stats page here.

Liverpool vs Crystal Palace Post-Match Facts
Liverpool have lost back-to-back games in all competitions for the first time since April 2023 (run of 3), while they have lost consecutively at Anfield for the first time since losing six in a row at home from January to March 2021.
Crystal Palace ended a 13-game winless run in the Premier League against Liverpool (D2 L11), with this their first league win over the Reds since April 2017. Each of the Eagles’ last four league wins over Liverpool have been at Anfield.
This was Liverpool’s first Premier League defeat at Anfield since October 2022 against Leeds United; the Reds were unbeaten in 28 home league games prior to today (W22 D6).
Liverpool have conceded the opening goal in four of their last five league games at Anfield – as many as their previous 22 beforehand. The Reds have now gone nine games without a home clean sheet in the Premier League, their joint-longest such run in the competition (also runs of 9 in December 1996 and May 1999).
This was Palace’s first Premier League win away from home since November against Burnley, ending their 10-match winless run on the road (D4 L6).
Liverpool’s expected goals total in this match was 2.87 – their most on record (since 2010-11) in a Premier League match in which they did not score a goal. Indeed, it was the most xG without scoring by any side in the competition since Brighton v Norwich in April 2022 (also 2.87).
Eberechi Eze scored his 22nd Premier League goal for Crystal Palace, moving him joint-fifth for the club all-time in the competition (level with Jordan Ayew), behind only Wilfried Zaha (68), Christian Benteke (35), Luka Milivojevic (28), and Chris Armstrong (23).
