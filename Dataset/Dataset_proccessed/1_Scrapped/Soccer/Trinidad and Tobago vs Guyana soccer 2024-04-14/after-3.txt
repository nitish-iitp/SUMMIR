Arsenal vs Aston Villa Post-Match Facts
Aston Villa have recorded a Premier League double over Arsenal for the third time, after the 1992-93 and 2020-21 seasons. The Gunners have only lost more league games under Mikel Arteta against Manchester City (7) than the Villans (5).
Aston Villa are unbeaten in their last 10 Premier League games in London (W7 D3), including on all six trips so far this season (W5 D1) – among non-London sides, only Manchester United (3 times) have ever had a longer unbeaten run away from home in the capital in the competition.
Arsenal suffered a Premier League defeat for the first time since New Year’s Eve against Fulham (2-1), while they have now failed to score in two of their last four league games, having only gone goalless in three of their first 28 games this season.
Aston Villa won an away Premier League game against a team starting the day in the top two positions for the first time since December 2009 against Manchester United (1-0), losing 14 such games in a row prior to today.
Unai Emery has lost just one of his seven games as a manager across all competitions against former club Arsenal (W3 D3), while he is still unbeaten as an away coach at the Emirates Stadium across games with PSG (D1), Villarreal (D1) and current club Aston Villa (W1).  
There were 21 shots in the first half of this game (14 by Arsenal, 7 by Aston Villa) with only Man City v Brentford in February (22) seeing more first half attempts without a goal being produced in a Premier League match this season. Meanwhile, Villa scored with their only two shots on target in the game.
Leon Bailey has been directly involved in seven goals as a substitute in the Premier League this season (three goals, four assists), more than any other player.
Ollie Watkins has scored 19 goals in the Premier League this season, the joint-most ever in a single campaign for Aston Villa along with Christian Benteke in 2012-13. Only Erling Haaland (20) has scored more goals in the competition this term than the Englishman.
