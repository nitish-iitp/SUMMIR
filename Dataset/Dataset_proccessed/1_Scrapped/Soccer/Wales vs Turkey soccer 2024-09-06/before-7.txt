It is a new dawn for the Welsh national team with former Wales captain Craig Bellamy now at the helm after replacing Rob Page and he begins his reign against UEFA EURO 2024 quarter-finalists Turkey to kick off their 2024/25 UEFA Nations League campaign.

WALES PREVIEW: THE BELLAMY ERA

Under the management of Rob Page, Wales reached both UEFA EURO 2020 as well as UEFA EURO 2024, whilst also qualifying for their first ever FIFA World Cup in over 50 years when they qualified for Qatar a couple of years ago.

However, it was widely accepted that performances and results were not of requisite quality and a damning goalless draw with Gibraltar in June sealed his fate with Craig Bellamy, former assistant to Vincent Kompany at both Anderlecht and Burnley, taking the reins.

TURKEY PREVIEW: MONTELLA TO CONTINUE HIS PROGRESSION

Former Italy international forward Vincenzo Montella has an exciting and young group of Turkish talent at his disposal and they were involved in pretty much all of the most entertaining games of the tournament at UEFA EURO 2024.

From beating Georgia 3-1 and Czechia 2-1 in thrilling group stage matches, they then edged past a very strong Austrian side by two goals to one before having their run to the last eight ended by the Netherlands by two goals to one in Berlin after taking a first-half lead.

WALES TEAM NEWS: RAMSEY REMAINS CAPTAIN

Cardiff City midfielder Aaron Ramsey has remained as captain for Wales as they take on Turkey at the Cardiff City Stadium. Chris Mepham is an injury concern for Bellamy for this weekend after joining for Sunderland on loan last weekend.

PREDICTED XI (4-2-3-1): Ward; Williams, Cabango, Rodon, Davies; James, Ampadu; Johnson, Ramsey, Thomas; Harris

UNAVAILABLE: Mepham (Injured)

TURKEY TEAM NEWS: A FEW ISSUES

Centre-back Merih Demiral is suspended for their opening UEFA Nations League encounter with captain Hakan Calhanoglu an injury concern for the Turks alongside attacker and reported Fulham target throughout the summer, Semih Kilicsoy. Ferdi Kadioglu is also out injured.

PREDICTED XI (4-2-3-1): Gunok; Muldur, Bardakci, Soyuncu, Elmali; Yuksek, Ozcan; Yilmaz, Kokcu, Guler; Yildiz

UNAVAILABLE: Demiral (Suspended), Calhanoglu (Injured), Kilicsoy (Injured)

WALES VS TURKEY PREDICTION

As mentioned, Bellamy has come through his coaching career alongside Vincent Kompany and he has also himself expressed a desire to play football in a progressive way with an emphasis on what would be a passing style of football. Turkey showed themselves to be the entertainers of Europe this summer so that may well benefit them with their attackers going the other way. An entertaining first game to kick off Bellamy’s reign seems a likely bet.
