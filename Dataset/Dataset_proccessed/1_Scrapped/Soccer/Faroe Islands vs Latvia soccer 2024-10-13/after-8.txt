Faroe Islands

The Faroese national team has yet to lose at home in this Nations League. In the opening round in September, the hosts managed to hold North Macedonia to a 1:1 draw at home. Then they had an unsuccessful trip to Latvia, losing 0:1. But in October, the Faroe Islands gained points on their field again, this time with the team of Armenia. The Armenians got back at them by sealing a draw only at the end of the game.

Latvia

Last summer, the Latvian team was led by Italian coach Paolo Nicolato, who had previously worked with Italian national teams of different age groups. So far, he has had a bit of a mixed bag in his new role. In the summer, Latvia came third in the Baltic Cup, losing out to Lithuania in the semifinals (0:2) but beating the Faroe Islands in the match for third place (1:0). The Latvians had a similar result in the Nations League, beating the Faroes by a small margin. On the other hand, the Latvian national team suffered two heavy losses: 1:4 to Armenia and 0:3 at home to North Macedonia.

Expert Betting Tips

As all the personal meetings between the rivals ended up being low-scoring, there's no point looking for another option here. On top of that, a draw, which also applies to their H2H matches, is a great option if you're looking for something risky.
