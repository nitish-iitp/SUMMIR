JAKARTA - The coach of the Indonesian national team, Shin Tae-yong, said that he would only announce the final squad for the 2023 Asian Cup after the last trial. The agenda of the last match is the match against Iran which will be held on January 9, 2024.

Currently, the Indonesian national team is currently undergoing a training camp (TC) in Turkey since December 20, 2023.

Pada agenda TC, Skuad Garuda akan menjalani uji coba tiga kali, yaitu dua kali melawan Libya dan sekali menghadapi Iran.

The Indonesian national team has completed the inaugural test match against Libya on Tuesday, January 2, 2024 atmen Mardan Complex, Antalya. The result was not very satisfactory because the Garuda squad lost 0-4.

After the test match, the Indonesian national team still had to face Libya again on January 5, 2024, in the same place.

Just four days later, or on January 9, 2024, the Garuda Squad will face Iran as the last trial held in Qatar.

Since the beginning of TC, Shin Tae-yong has indeed brought 28 players. However, that number will be narrowed to 26 names to be brought to the 2023 Asian Cup.

Even though he had to cross out two names, Shin Tae-yong refused to rush into a decision. The South Korean tactician wanted to first monitor the players until TC was finished, including in three test matches.

"The plan is for these 28 Indonesian national team players to be brought to fight Iran (in Qatar). After fighting Iran, it has only become 26 players," Shin Tae-yong said in an online press conference on Wednesday, January 3, 2024, noon WIB.

The 2023 Asian Cup will take place in Qatar from January 12 to February 10, 2024. The Indonesian national team is in Group D with Iraq, Vietnam, and Japan.

The Indonesian national team is targeted to qualify for the last 16 of the 2023 Asian Cup. In order to reach that target, the Garuda Squad clearly needs hard work considering that the three teams faced in Group D are a strong team.
