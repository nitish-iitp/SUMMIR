Lionel Messi’s through ball led to Julián Álvarez’s goal in the 49th minute, then he assisted on Lautaro Martínez’s goal in the 88th as Argentina began the defense of their Copa América title with a 2-0 victory over Canada on Thursday night.

Argentina are seeking their third straight major title after winning the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 World Cup.

With South America’s championship moved to the United States for the second time, Messi set a Copa América record with his 35th match, one more than Chile’s Sergio Livingstone from 1941-53. Messi extended his own record with his 18th assist.

Messi, who turns 37 on Monday, created the first goal when, after a throw-in, he headed a pass through the defense for Alexis Mac Allister. The midfielder side-footed a pass to Álvarez while crashing into onrushing Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau from eight yards out. Álvarez had a virtually empty net and slotted the ball in over a sliding defender for his eighth goal in 32 international appearances.

Messi extended his Copa América assists record when he ran through the center of the midfield and rolled a pass to Martínez, who got his 25th international goal.

Messi’s best scoring chance was in the 65th minute, when Crépeau made a diving stop and Messi’s attempt off the rebound was blocked by Derek Cornelius. Messi put a chip wide after he had a one-on-one with Crépeau in the 79th minute.

He was shaken up by a sliding tackle from defender Moïse Bombito in the 82nd minute, but remained in the game.

Argentina play Chile on Tuesday at East Rutherford, New Jersey, then close the first round against Peru on 29 June at Miami Gardens, Florida. Canada face Peru on Tuesday at Kansas City, Kansas, and finish the group stage against Chile on 29 June at Orlando, Florida.

Fourteen US stadiums are hosting the tournament, which runs until 14 July. Six nations from North and Central America and the Caribbean were added to the 10 South American teams.

Slow starts did not prevent the Albiceleste from winning their previous two tournaments. Argentina opened the 2022 World Cup with a 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia and began the 2021 Copa América with a 1-1 draw against Chile.

Canada made their Copa América debut and played their first competitive match under American coach Jesse Marsch, who was hired last month. Canada’s best chance came when they tested Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez in the 43rd minute. He used his left hand to bat away a header from Stephen Eustáquio.

 This article was amended on 21 June 2024. The Copa América ends on 14 July, not 14 June as an earlier version said.
