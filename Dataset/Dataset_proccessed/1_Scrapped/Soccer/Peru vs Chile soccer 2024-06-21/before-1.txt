Predictions for the Copa América 2024, which will kick off on June 20 in the United States, offer a favorable outlook for the World Cup holders, Argentina. According to analyses based on Bet365 betting odds and the supercomputer Oddspedia, Argentina is the favorite, with a 43.8% chance of being crowned champion. This optimism is underpinned by their recent success at the 2022 World Cup and their victory at the 2021 Copa América. With Lionel Messi leading a team that combines experience and talent, Argentina is expected to dominate the tournament, facing its main rival, Brazil, which has a 15.4% probability. Other teams with high expectations are Uruguay and Mexico, with Uruguay having a 12.3% chance of reaching the semifinals, and Mexico being seen as a possible surprise package with a 10.4% chance of winning the tournament.

On the other hand, the United States and Colombia face less favorable odds. Despite a promising recent draw against Brazil, Gregg Behalter’s team is expected to be one of the disappointments of the tournament, with only a 4.7% chance of litfing the trophy. Mexico, despite doubts in their preparation, could reach the semifinals by beating teams like Ecuador and Colombia, who will have a harder time advancing beyond the quarterfinals. In terms of odds, Argentina leads with a +175 odds, followed by Brazil with +225 and Uruguay with +500. The combination of historical and current data in 1,000 simulations made by Oddspedia reinforces the perception that Argentina is well positioned to triumph in this edition of the Copa América. This is the schedule for the group matches to be played by all participating countries, and the knock-out stages.
