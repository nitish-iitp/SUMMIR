Japan sealed progression to the Asian Cup round of 16 with a 3-1 win over Indonesia on Wednesday.

Ayase Ueda scored twice for Hajime Moriyasu's side, who finished second behind Iraq in Group D with six points.

Japan took a 1-0 lead when they won a penalty in the second minute after Ueda was hauled down in the box by Jordi Amat, with the spot kick awarded after a VAR check. Ueda stepped up to take it himself and he fired home into the top corner.

Japan doubled their lead when Ritsu Doan put in a pass across the six-yard box that found Ueda unmarked at the far post for an easy tap-in. Ueda then forced an own goal in the 87th minute when Justin Hubner attempted to block his shot.

Indonesia scored a consolation goal in added time when Japan failed to clear a long throw-in and the ball fell to Sandy Walsh at the far post where he finished smartly for his first international goal.

In the other Group D game, Vietnam took the lead just before halftime when Bui Hoang Viet Anh scored from a set piece before Khuat Van Khang was sent off for a second yellow at the stroke of half-time.

Iraq equalised two minutes after the restart when Rebin Sulaka headed home from a corner before Hussein scored with a header of his own in the 73rd minute.

Vietnam nearly stole a point in added time when Nguyen Quang Hai equalised in the 91st minute but Iraq earned a penalty which was calmly converted by Huessein in the 12th minute of added time.
