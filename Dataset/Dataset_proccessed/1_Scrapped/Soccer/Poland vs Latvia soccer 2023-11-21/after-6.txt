WHERE WILL EURO 2024 BE HELD?

Germany has been selected as the host country for EURO 2024 during the 17th edition of the UEFA European Championship. This decision was made at a meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee that took place in Nyon on September 27, 2018. West Germany had already hosted in 1988, but this will be the first time Germany will host the UEFA EURO after the country's reunification.

THE EURO MASCOT

The official mascot already has a name, and his name is Albärt. The friendly bear has been christened by the choice of UEFA.com users and schoolchildren across Europe through the UEFA Football in Schools programme.
Albärt joins a distinguished list of charismatic characters who have been the mascots of previous editions of the EURO, such as Berni, Goaliath, Rabbit and Kinas. Name choices such as Bärnardo, Bärnheart and Herzi von Bär (all related to the German translation of "bear") were also exciting propositions, but in the end Albärt stood out by winning with 32% of the vote.

THE CHANGE OF DESTINY IN TITO'S LIFE

In 2010, Robert Lewandowski made the move to a professional club outside Poland by joining Borussia Dortmund. However, he came very close to joining the Premier League, specifically Blackburn. The possibility of this transfer was cut short due to the eruption of the Icelandic volcano in 2010. The resulting cloud of ash particles flooded the skies over Europe, causing significant disruptions to air traffic and ultimately preventing the completion of his move to Blackburn.

LATVIA'S LAST MATCH

On the other side of the coin, Latvia faced Croatia in a match where the only thing left for Latvia to do was to show up on the pitch and give the best of its performance, because no matter what the result, Latvia will not get out of the last place of its group, where it is already eliminated from the European Championship.

POLAND'S LAST MATCH

In Poland's last match, the Polish team faced Czechoslovakia in a decisive match of their group in the qualifiers for Euro 2024, but the 1-1 draw kept the Poles in second place in their group and with one match remaining, they are still close to a ticket to the European Championship.

Watch out for this player from Poland:

For this match, the player to watch will be Poland and Barcelona's iconic center forward Robert Lewandoski. Poland's attacker is always a latent danger in the box, whether or not he has the ball under his control, so opposing defenses must always be alert since Robert Lewandoski knows how to slip between defensive lines to get unmarked and score a goal for his team at key moments.

Watch out for this Latvian player:

For this match, the player to watch will be Latvia's iconic center forward, Roberts Uldriķis. Latvia's attacker is always a latent danger inside the box, whether or not he has the ball under his control so opposing defenses should always be on their toes as Roberts Uldriķis knows how to slip through defensive lines to get unmarked and score a goal for his national team.

Disappointed

On the other hand, Latvia unlike Poland, no longer has even the remotest chance of being able to think about fighting for a place to go up to next year's European Championship after having secured the last place finish in their group with only a total of 7 possible units since in their last match played against Croatia, Latvia lost 0-2, leaving them without the possibility of adding and remaining with 4 units so far.

One foot out of the European Championship

After playing matchday 9 of the European Championshipqualifiers and drawing 1-1 with Czechoslovakia, Poland dropped to third place in their group, below Czechoslovakia with 11 points, while they remain in second place with 12 points. With one more round of qualifiers to play, the sirens are starting to light up in Poland as they are on the verge of being present at the next big European party, which is why this friendly will serve to iron out the mistakes and arrive at the next FIFA date with a plan to achieve the feat and sneak in at the last minute to Germany 2024.
