Marcin Bułka’s first cap for Poland
 November 21 2023, 11:00 PM

Marcin Bułka earned his first cap for the Polish national team on Tuesday!

Gym's goalkeeper is now officially an international player. Marcin Bułka, who has made a tremendous start to the season, reigning supreme behind the best defence in Ligue 1 (4 goals conceded in 12 games), played in the second half of Poland's friendly win over Latvia (2-0, goals from Frankowski and Lewandowski) on Tuesday.

It is yet another milestone in the career of the 24-year-old goalkeeper, who became Gym's No. 1 in the summer, and winning the UNFP trophy for player of the month in September and being twice voted Aiglon of the month for August and September by Nice fans.

JC Todibo and Khephren Thuram did not feature for the France in Greece (2-2, Euro 2024 qualifiers).

Called up for the first time with Morocco, Sofiane Diop remained on the bench for the Atlas Lions' 2-0 win in Tanzania (2026 World Cup qualifier).
