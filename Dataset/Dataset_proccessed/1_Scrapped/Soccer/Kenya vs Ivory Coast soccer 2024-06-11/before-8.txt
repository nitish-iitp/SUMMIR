Preview: Seychelles vs. Burundi - prediction, team news, lineups

Burundi will be looking to secure a fifth consecutive victory over Seychelles when the two nations go head to head at the Stade Municipal de Berkane on Tuesday.

While Les Hirondelles could move into second place with all three points here, Ralph Jean Louis's men head into the game as one of just seven nations yet to pick up any points after the first three rounds of matches.

Match preview

Seychelles were on the receiving end of yet another heavy defeat in the World Cup qualifiers as they were hammered 5-1 by Gambia at the Stade Municipal de Berkane on Saturday.

After Mohammed Badamosi and Ryan Henriette scored for either side to end the first half level, Gambia ran riot after the break as Musa Barrow, Yankuba Minteh, Adama Sidibeh and Badamoi all hit the target to cap off a brilliant team performance.

This was a third defeat on the trot in the qualifiers for the Pirates, who kicked off the campaign with a 9-0 hammering at the hands of Ivory Coast on November 17, three days before losing 5-0 against Kenya at the Stade Felix Houphouet-Boigny.

With Saturday's result, Louis's men have now six consecutive matches across all competitions and have managed just one win in their last 17 outings, losing 13 and claiming three draws since November 2021.

Next up for Seychelles is another stern challenge of going up against an opposing nation who have won each of their previous four encounters, scoring six goals and keeping three clean sheets since June 2008.

Burundi, on the other hand, failed to return to winning ways in the qualifiers as they played out a 1-1 draw with Kenya when the two nations squared off at the Bingu National Stadium on Friday.

Following an uneventful first half, the game sparked to life in the final 20 minutes as veteran midfielder Duke Abuya broke the deadlock in the 72nd minute to put Kenya in front before Abdallah Sudi struck in the 85th minute to force a share of the spoils.

Prior to that, Burundi kicked off their quest for a first-ever World Cup appearance with a thrilling 3-2 victory over Gambia at the Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium on November 16, three days before suffering a 2-1 loss at the hands of Gambia.

With four points from three matches, Etienne Nadyiragije's side are currently fourth in the Group F standings, level on points with fifth-placed Kenya but could move into second spot with a win on Tuesday.

However, Burundi will need to be at their best as they head into the game without a win in any of their last five outings across all competitions, losing three and picking up two draws since their narrow victory over Gambia back in November.

Team News

Henriette was a bright spark in Seychelles' humbling defeat against Gambia last time out and the 24-year-old should lead the Pirates' attack once again.

He should be joined by 25-year-old Brandon Labrossec while Germany-based midfielder Charmaine Haul should start in the centre of the park.

Off the back of a resilient team display against Kenya, Burundi could field a similar starting XI on Tuesday, with Akbar Muderi, Keita Bukuru, Derrick Mukombozi and Abdoul Manirakoze forming the back four once again.

Bienvenue Kanakimana and Saidi Ntibazonkiza should retain their roles at the opposite end of the pitch while Elettihad Almisraty striker Sudi could be rewarded for his fine cameo against Kenya with a place in the front three.

Rwanda Police midfielder Abedi Bigirimana should keep his place at the centre of the park, teaming up with 24-year-old Mokono Eldhino and skipper Gael Bigirimana.


Seychelles possible starting lineup:
Kong; Cissoko, Marie, Payet, Mellie, Waye-Hive; Raheriniaina, Hausl, Gamatice; Labrosse, Henriette

Burundi possible starting lineup:
Nahimana; Muderi, Bukuru, Mukombozi, Manirakoze; Bigirimana, Eldhino, Bigirimana; Kanakimana, Ntibazonkiza, Sudi


We say: Seychelles 0-2 Burundi

Burundi will be licking their lips as they take on a Burundi side who have been one of the whipping boys in the continent. Les Hirondelles have enjoyed the better of this fixture and we fancy them to extend their winning streak against Seychelles on Tuesday.
