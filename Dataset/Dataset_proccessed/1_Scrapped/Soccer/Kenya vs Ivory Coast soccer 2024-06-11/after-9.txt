This is why Eritrea jumped ship.

This is not the first time that this African nation has been excluded from international competitions, as it frequently experiences the abandonment of players and its squad is always depleted. It is worth mentioning that the country has a very strict regime, considered one of the worst in the world, which has led several players to leave their national team in search of a better life.

They said no to the World Cup!

Although the 2026 World Cup, to be hosted by Mexico, the United States and Canada, is almost two years away, the World Cup qualifiers have already begun in different parts of the world to determine the qualifiers. The Eritrean team had the right to compete for a place in the tournament, but decided to quit for fear that its players would defect from the team.

Sébastien Haller could be the goal man for this game:

For a game where the Ivory Coast team is playing for the leadership of their group, players likeSébastien Haller will have to be called upon, the Ivory Coast center forward has been characterized for being a determinant player inside the box, likewise, his vast experience in German soccer has allowed him to improve his individual skills to be an important element in the starting eleven.

The begginin of a big rivalry

The sporting history in soccer between Kenya and Ivory Coast is not extensive, as they have not had many direct confrontations in official competitions. Only one friendly game between the two nations is known, and that was the clash between Kenya and Ivory Coast that took place in the 1985 CECAFA Cup. On that occasion, Kenya beat Ivory Coast by a score of 2-1.

What can we expect from this match? Let me give you a hint...

Let's place ourselves in the context of this match, Kenya receives Ivory Coast in the framework of the 3rd day of the World Cup qualifiers in the African continent, then, we must take into account that both teams are in Group H, where Namibia and Tunisia are tied with 6 points, however, it is Namibia who dominates in first place by yellow cards, while Kenya is second to last without having scored points and with 6 goals against. The match looks to be a duel fully loaded in favor of the local squad and despite being Kenya the team that is obliged to win, the truth is that Ivory Coast lives a much better moment and have less pressure than their rivals, which will make their game much calmer, helping them to dominate the pace of the match.

How are things going in Africa on the road to the 2026 World Cup?

For now, in the continent where man comes from, we are halfway through the World Cup qualifiers and although there is still a long way to go to know the representatives of this confederation, for now, there are already teams that are preparing to take the lead in their groups such as: Egypt in Group A, Senegal in Group B, Rwanda in Group C, in Group D Cameroon, in Group E Morocco, in Group F Ivory Coast or Gabon, in Group G Algeria and in Group H Namibia or Tunisia.

We have to give it our all because we want to go to the 2026 World Cup.

Another season in the world of soccer is over, however, that does not mean that the soccer activity in the world is over because it is time for several nations to continue their journey towards the next World Cup to be played in Mexico, United States and Canada, in addition, this will be the first World Cup competition that will have the presence of 48 countries instead of 32, 16 more slots compared to the last World Cup, so these qualifiers become much more important for each nation that wants to be present. Therefore, we will see many players give their best performance on the field with which they will try to help their national team to get three points and take a step closer to the next World Cup, since a defeat could jeopardize all the dreams of an entire country, for the moment, there is a long way to go to meet the lucky ones but there is little left to continue shouting international goals.
