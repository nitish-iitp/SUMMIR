Angola welcome Cameroon to Estadio 11 de Novembro on Tuesday with the possibility of leapfrogging the visitors in CAF World Cup qualifying Group D.

Both sides recorded victories in their last qualifying games and will be looking to take the momentum into this encounter.

Angola had a good outing at the last edition of the Africa Cup of Nations, matching their best-ever result with a quarter final appearance.

The Central Africans are also one of three teams in CAF World Cup qualifying Group D - alongside Libya and Cameroon - that are yet to taste defeat after three matches.

After settling for scoreless draws in their opening two fixtures against Cape Verde and Mauritius - both away from home - the Palancas Negras finally picked up a 1-0 victory over Eswatini at Estadio 11 de Novembro on Friday.

Mabululu's strike in the second minute was enough to secure all three points, in what was their first goal in the World Cup qualifiers. This win takes them to third place with five points, two adrift of Cameroon and Libya who are both on seven points after three matches.

Pedro Goncalves's men will host the strongest side in their group based on pedigree and the current standings, hoping to make it two wins on the bounce.

The head-to-head record between both sides is balanced, with three wins apiece alongside two draws in eight meetings. However, the last time they met in a World Cup qualifier, Angola won 2-0 on home soil after losing the reverse fixture.

The altercation between FECAFOOT president Samuel Eto'o and current coach Marc Brys did not prove to be a distraction as Cameroon dispatched Cape Verde 4-1 at Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium on Saturday.

The former Chelsea, Inter Milan and Barcelona forward was not happy with the ministry of Sports appointing Brys back in April, stating that the football federation held the right to do so. This created a dent in their relationship, leading to several confrontations.

Things got worse as the team prepared for the games against Cape Verde and Angola, with another intense confrontation leading to Eto'o sacking the coach before reinstating him later that day and apologising.

Despite the apology, Eto'o continued to frustrate the efforts of Brys and his team, first by sending in another set of technical staff to the team hotel before taking away all training materials, leaving the team with no balls to train with.

It was Brys' first game in charge of the Indomitable Lions since replacing Rigobert Song at the beginning of April, following a disappointing showing at the Africa Cup of Nations and he had a lot to prove.

However, he made light work of it as Michael Ngadeu headed the Central Africans in front in the 13th minute, before Vincent Aboubakar scored a brace either side of Jamiro Monteiro's goal for Cape Verde to take a comfortable lead into the break.

Nouhou Tolo added a fourth nine minutes into the second half, before Andre Onana saved a stoppage-time penalty to add gloss to the convincing victory.

Cameroon will be hoping to maintain their position at the top of the group, as they look to make an appearance at the World Cup for the ninth time, having qualified more than any other African nation in history.

Angola will be expected to stick to their front three of Mabululu, Gelson Dala and Milson after the victory last time out.

Kialonda Gaspar is ever-present in the Palancas Negras defence, while David Carmo is likely to remain as his partner in central defence after the clean sheet against Eswatini.

Brys is likely to stick with the same side that gave him a convincing win in his first outing as Cameroon's coach.

Aboubakar, Bryan Mbeumo and Nicolas Moumie Ngamaleu will be the front three while Manchester United's Onana remains between the sticks.

The goalkeeper is likely to be protected by the same back four from the win against Cape Verde, with Ngadeu and Christopher Wooh in central defence, while Tolo and Jackson Tchatchoua play the full-back roles.


Angola possible starting lineup:
Neblu; Mata, Gasper, Carmo, Cruz; Fredy, Show, Nteka; Milson, Mabululu, Dala

Cameroon possible starting lineup:
Onana; Tchatchoua, Ngadeu, Wooh, Tolo; Hongla, Baleba, Anguissa; Mbeumo, Aboubakar, Ngamaleu



We say: Angola 2-1 Cameroon

Cameroon are coming off a convincing victory but defensively they remain a suspect. Meanwhile, Angola are solid at the back and have a front three that can wreak havoc on the break. We think that the difference in defensive organization could sway this tie in favour of the hosts.
