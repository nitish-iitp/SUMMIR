A tenacious 10-man Libyan team has secured a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Mauritius Island in the third day of the FIFA world cup qualifiers.

The clash, held at the Martyrs of February Stadium on Thursday, June 6, 2024, saw Libya’s Faical Al Badri make an early breakthrough by netting a goal in the 20th minute.

However, the lead was short-lived as Mauritius’ Kevin Bru leveled the score at the 34th minute. The Libyan side, undeterred, pushed forward, and Ahmed Ekrawa restored their advantage with a decisive goal just six minutes later.

The intensity of the match escalated when 22-year-old Ali Youssef of Libya received a booking at the 83rd minute, adding pressure to the already reduced Libyan squad. Despite the setback, Libya held on to their lead, concluding the match with a 2-1 victory.

This win has significant implications for the group standings, as Libya now provisionally ascends to the top of Group D with seven points. This places them three points ahead of both Cameroon and Cape Verde, bolstering their position thanks to a previous 1-0 win against Eswatini and a 1-1 draw in a competitive match against Cameroon.

Looking ahead, Libya’s next match is a crucial encounter against Cape Verde on June 11, 2024. This match is poised to be a defining moment in their qualifying campaign, potentially solidifying their position at the summit of Group D, if Cameroon and Cape Verde fail to produce a winner.

The Libyan team, buoyed by their recent success, will undoubtedly aim to carry forward their momentum and edge closer to securing a spot in the world’s most prestigious football tournament.
