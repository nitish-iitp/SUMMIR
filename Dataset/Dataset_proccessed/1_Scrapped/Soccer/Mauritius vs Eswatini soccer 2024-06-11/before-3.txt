Preview: Mauritius vs. Eswatini - prediction, team news, lineups

Round four of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers sees Mauritius and Eswatini go head-to-head at Cote d'Or National Sports on Tuesday afternoon.

Both teams were beaten in their respective most recent involvements and will be looking to get back on track with all three points in this one.

Match preview

Mauritius fell to a narrow 2-1 defeat against the Mediterranean Knights of Libya in Thursday's meeting at the Martyrs of February Stadium.

After going behind to Faisal Al Badri's opener, Fidy Rasoanaivo's men levelled matters through Kevin Bru before Ahmed Ekrawa decided the game five minutes from half time.

That was a third straight defeat for Les Dodos, who remain fifth in their World Cup qualifying group having managed just one point from three outings.

Awaiting them next is the challenge of an opposing outfit with little to choose between the teams over the previous three meetings, which have yielded one win apiece and a draw.

Having scored just once across their last four home matches, Tuesday's hosts will need to up the ante at the top end of the pitch if they are to get the job done in front of their fans.

Eswatini suffered a first defeat since the turn of the year as they were beaten 2-1 by Angola at Estadio 11 de Novembro on Friday evening.

Dominic Kunene's men made a poor start to the contest and were punished inside two minutes by Mabululu whose opened proved to be the all-important moment.

Still yet to record a point from three matches, Sihlangu Semnikati remain rooted to the bottom of Group D and have endured a dismal qualifying campaign so far.

With just one victory from their last six away involvements of which half have ended in defeat, Tuesday's visitors are now faced with a must-win task on the road to avoid being left too far behind in the race for a World Cup berth.

Team News

Dorian Chiotti fended off competition to retain his place between the sticks against Libya, and the goalkeeper will expect to start here once again.

Since scoring in his each of his first two matches of 2023 for the hosts, Ashley Nazira has now gone eight international matches without a goal.

Eswatini's Sibusiso Dlamini was forced off with an injury scare against Angola and the 23-year-old is expected to sit out Tuesday's clash.

This should see 34-year-old Ncamiso Dlamini return to the lineup for a rare starting appearance nearly one year since he last featured for the visitors.


Mauritius possible starting lineup:
Chiotti; Mootoo, Vincent, Francois, Antoine; Jackson, Bru, Langue, Aristide; Kai, Nazira

Eswatini possible starting lineup:
N. Dlamini; Thwala, Mkhonta, Mabelesa, Manana; Matse, I. Dlamini, M. Mkhontfo; Matsebula, P. Mkhontfo, Ndzinisa



We say: Mauritius 1-1 Eswatini

With the teams struggling heading into this one, both will view Tuesday's contest as a perfect opportunity to get themselves back on track. However, we are backing a share of the spoils come the end of the 90 minutes.
