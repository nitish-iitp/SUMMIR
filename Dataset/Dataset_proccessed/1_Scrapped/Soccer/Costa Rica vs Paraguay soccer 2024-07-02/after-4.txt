Copa America group-stage action comes to a close in Group D as Costa Rica take on Paraugay Tuesday night at Q2 Stadium.

While it's highly unlikely, Costa Rica still have a chance at reaching the last eight of the tournament, but they'll need a little help from Colombia.

The Central American country held on for an impressive point in a goalless draw vs tournament favorites Brazil before falling 3-0 to the in-form Colombian side. Costa Rica still have a slim chance of reaching the last eight, but they'll have to at minimum come away with three points against Costa Rica (while also marginally improving their goal difference as they currently have a -3 differential) and hope that Colombia take down Brazil.

On the other hand, Paraguay were eliminate from Copa America 2024 after their 4-1 defeat at the hands of Brazil. Paraguay were the second team to be eliminated from the competition after Jamaica, and it was a rather disappointing campaign from a team that has talent in their squad with the likes of Julio Enciso, Matias Rojas and Miguel Almiron.
