PHOENIX – The state and national Republican parties want an emergency order to block those who register with a federal voter registration form from casting a ballot in this year's general election.

Attorneys for both groups as well as the top GOP legislative leaders contend that U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton got it wrong when she concluded that federal law allows those without proof of citizenship to cast a ballot in the presidential race. Bolton said as long as they use that federal form – which does not require such proof – they can vote in federal elections.
