Poland looking to end 45-year streak against Netherlands in Euro 2024 fixture

Poland will be looking to end a 45-year streak when they square off against Netherlands on Sunday afternoon.

The two nations will be getting their respective Group D campaigns underway before France face Austria later in the day.

Michal Probierz's side head into the contest at the Volksparkstadion without the services of legendary forward Robert Lewandowski, who is absent with a minor groin injury.

Lewandowski's absence significantly reduces Poland's hopes of causing a surprise in their opening fixture of the tournament at a time when they are already considerable underdogs from an historical perspective.

Poland hold dire head-to-head record with Netherlands

You have to go all the way back to May 1979 for the last time that Poland overcame Netherlands on the international scene, with that game being a Euro 1980 qualifier.

Since then, 12 matches have passed by without the Eagles getting the better of Oranje, with five draws the only positive return from a dozen outings.

Netherlands have also prevailed in six of the most recent seven meetings, with Poland's solitary stalemate during that run coming as recently as 2022.

On that occasion in Rotterdam, Poland had held a 2-0 lead in a UEFA Nations fixture, only to see Netherlands come roaring back for a 2-2 draw at De Kuip.

In fact, the last four outings have all taken place in the Nations League, yet these two nations have never met at a major tournament in the past.

Poland have recorded just three triumphs in their 19 games against Netherlands, all of which came between 1969 and 1979.

Netherlands looking to add new name to lengthy list

As for Netherlands, they entered this competition only adrift of Germany (19) in terms of different teams defeated at a European Championship with 17 scalps to their name.

Ronald Koeman will fancy his side's chances of victory with Poland only ever prevailing from two of their 14 matches at a European Championship.

They were both by 1-0 scorelines against Northern Ireland and Ukraine at Euro 2016. Five matches have since passed by without winning in normal time, although Poland have scored at least once in every encounter.
