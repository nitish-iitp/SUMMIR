Netherlands hoping to extend 17-year run in Romania Euro 2024 game

Netherlands will be targeting the extension of a 17-year streak when they face Romania in the last 16 of Euro 2024.

Ronald Koeman's side were far from convincing during the group stages, having to settle for a third-placed finish in Group D.

Although they came from behind to defeat Poland and deservedly held France to a goalless draw, Oranje were upstaged by Austria last time out, losing by a 3-2 scoreline.

Finishing behind Austria and France resulted in Netherlands missing out on a showdown with England, with the perception being they would have likely relished that contest.

Nevertheless, when they take to the field at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday evening, Netherlands will be defending a lengthy favourable run.

Netherlands dominant over Romania

In 13 meetings between these two sides, Romania have prevailed on just the one occasion, with that coming in 2007 when they won 1-0 in a qualification fixture for Euro 2008.

On that occasion, defender Dorin Goian scored the decisive goal in the 71st minute, but that is as good as it has got for the Eastern European nation.

Since then, Netherlands have recorded four victories in succession, scoring 13 times in the process and conceding just the one.

All those matches were held between 2008 and 2017, the first of those coming at Euro 2008 when Klaas Jan Huntelaar and Robin van Persie got on the scoresheet in Berne.

In the most recent encounter, a friendly in Bucharest in November 2017, Memphis Depay, Ryan Babel and Luuk de Jong all netted in the second half to help Netherlands to a 3-0 win.

Romania aiming to turn corner

Incredibly, Romania have failed to score in 10 of their 13 matches with Netherlands, while Romania have only ever won one knockout tie at a major tournament in their history.

That came in 1994 when they recorded a famous 3-2 victory over Argentina at the World Cup in the United States, although they will be encouraged that Netherlands have lost their last three knockout fixtures at a European Championship.

Meanwhile, Romania's qualification for the last 16 has set them up for their 20th fixture in the history of this competition; just two wins have come during that time.

Prior to their impressive victory over Ukraine at this edition, Romania's only previous triumph had been against England at Euro 2000 with the Three Lions going down by a 3-2 scoreline.
