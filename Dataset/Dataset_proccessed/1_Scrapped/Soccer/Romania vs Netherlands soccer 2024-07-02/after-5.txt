Netherlands' forward Cody Gakpo scored his third goal of the European Championship and Donyell Malen added two more late on as the Dutch burst back into form with a lively display to defeat Romania 3-0 in their round of 16 clash on Tuesday.

The Dutch had been lambasted by their media and fans for a poor defensive display in their final group game, a 3-2 loss to Austria, but were more composed and in control as they reach the Euro quarterfinals for the first time since 2008.

Romania controlled the ball for the first quarter of an hour before the Netherlands slowly started to get a grip on the match.

They led after 20 minutes when player of the match Gakpo drilled a low shot home at keeper Florin Nita's near post before Malen's late double helped set up a quarter-final with Austria or Turkey, who play later on Tuesday, in Berlin on Saturday.

Gakpo was a menace all night and turned provider for Malen's first goal in the 83rd minute when he kept the ball in play on the touchline and knocked it across the box for an easy tap in.

"This was the answer we had to our last performance -- good game, good goals, we played good football," Gakpo said.

"Of course we could do better but a good showing after the last game. A good step in that next direction. We felt we were in control even though they were a dangerous opponent."

Malen notched his second in stoppage time when he collected the ball in midfield, dribbled into the penalty area and fired past Nita as the Dutch served notice that they have started to click at the tournament.

"I thought there were a lot of good things we did. The team realised that the last game was really bad in all aspects and so they have given out a strong message. We played well in the whole game, except the first 10 minutes when there was a lot of pressure," Netherlands manager Ronald Koeman said.

"We had analysed Romania well. Belgium showed us there was a lot of space to exploit [against Romania]. But it took a long time before we got the second goal.

"But I wasn't scared they'd equalise because we defended so well. I though Xavi Simons was our best player too, he drove the team forward and was nice and aggressive."

Romania created just a few chances in the match and never looked a serious threat as the Netherlands controlled possession and waited for opportunities to get forward.

The Dutch had two thirds of possession and almost five times more chances with 24 attempts in the game to underline their superiority as Virgil van Dijk struck the post with a header and Gakpo had a second effort ruled out for offside.

"Very proud, sure, and pleased as well. We were defensively sound and solid and did not give up much," Van Dijk said.

"We could have scored a lot more. After a turbulent week, where a lot was said, we had to show something and we did that. We are self-critical and we knew it had to be a lot better after the last game and everyone had to take responsibility and today they showed they wanted to.

"Everyone went for the duels, won the second ball and made the chances. Playing good football gives us self-confidence."
