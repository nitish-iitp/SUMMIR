Kobbie Mainoo believes that he and his fellow England team-mates can "change the future" and end England's long wait for major trophies.
The 19-year-old could start for England in their round of 16 tie with Slovakia after impressing in the second half of the draw with Slovenia in England's final group game.
“Obviously we’re aware of the past but now we’re in a position where we can change the future for us and hopefully there’s trophies in that future," Mainoo told BBC Sport.

1530 – CAPELLO: ITALY WILL HAVE CLEARER HEADS
The former Milan, Real Madrid and England head coach feels the last-16 knockout stage will suit the Azzurri as they attempt to defend the European title they won at Wembley three years ago.
"For sure, history tells us that we have done well," said Capello as Italy return to the scene of their 2006 World Cup triumph. "Let's hope it repeats itself."
1515 – ALEXANDER ISAK HAS FINISHING POWER
Newcastle apparently want over £100m for the forward with Arsenal interested in bringing the Sweden striker to the Emirates. Which would suit the Gunners if he can do this against Spurs.
1505 – BRIGHTON LINKED WITH MINTEH
Are Brighton keen on signing Newcastle winger Yankuba Minteh?
According to several reports, the 19-year-old Gambia international player could be up for sale as Newcastle look to meet Premier League profit and sustainability rules.
Minteh spent last season on loan at Feyenoord, and he scored against Celtic in the UEFA Champions League amid an overall haul of 11.
1450 – ITALY FANS ENJOY BERLIN SUNSHINE
Countdown to the first Euro 2024 last-16 match is well and truly on with Swiss and Italy fans gathering in Berlin.
How do these teams match up in their head-to-head meetings? As you would expect, Italy well out in front with 29 wins, 24 draws and only seven defeats.
Italy last lost a match to the Swiss in a World Cup qualifier in May 1993 when Roy Hodgson's side completed a 1-0 home win courtesy of a Marc Hottiger goal.

1430 – WOLVES CLOSE IN ON CELTA STRIKER
Various media outlets suggest Wolves are on the cusp of landing Celta Vigo and Norway striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.
An initial season-long loan deal worth £2.5m could apparently be increased to £23m with Wolves having the option to buy the 24-year-old forward next summer.
Larsen scored 16 times for club and country last season. He is due to have a medical at Molineux in the next few days.

1415 – LIVERPOOL 'REJECT CHANCE' TO SIGN GORDON
According to a report on the BBC, Liverpool have snubbed the chance to sign the Newcastle and England winger Anthony Gordon which would have seen Jarell Quansah head for St James' Park as part of a proposed swap deal.
Gordon joined Newcastle from Everton in a £45m transfer fee in January 2023, and came off the bench for his first Euro 2024 appearance in the 0-0 draw with Slovenia.
The report claims Liverpool did not feel the deal was right for the Anfield club.

The 31-year-old joined United in 2019 and has since racked up 125 appearances and holds the WSL clean sheet record with 56. In 2024 she lifted the Women's FA Cup, beating Tottenham 4-0 and was part of the England side that won the Euros in 2022. Read more here

"The club is about to undergo a period of transition, and unfortunately I don’t feel it aligns with the timing of where I’m at in my career," said Earps on Instagram.

1250 – WILL ENGLAND CALL ON KONSA?
The Newcastle right-back Kieran Trippier has started the first three Euro 2024 group matches at left-back for England due to the ongoing absence of Luke Shaw. He returned to training on Saturday with the squad, but is nursing a calf injury ahead of the last-16 meeting with Slovakia on Sunday.
The alternatives for manager Gareth Southgate if Trippier is not fit is Ezri Konsa or Liverpool's Joe Gomez. Konsa would perhaps be a leap of faith with the Villa defender not operating as a left-back since his days at Charlton six years ago. Shaw also trained on Saturday, but is unlikely to be thrown in from the start in Gelsenkirchen.

1240 – ASTON VILLA WOMEN APPOINT NEW COACH
Dutch manager Robert de Pauw has signed a three-year deal to become the new head coach of Aston Villa Women.
“I’m very happy and very honoured that the club chose me as their Women’s coach,” he said.
“It’s a privilege to be here and I’m looking forward to the challenge.
“I saw the potential of the team with the young and older players, so the experience is there but also the talent.
“The ambition of the club is to be in the top six and everything is in order to make the team tick.”
1230 – HOW GOOD IS THIS GOAL?
No goalkeeper is keeping this finish out. What a strike.
1225 – GUNDOGAN WARY OF WOUNDED ENGLAND
Ilkay Gundogan has said to “never underestimate England” despite their uninspiring performances at Euro 2024. Gareth Southgate's side have underwhelmed so far, but Germany captain Gundogan is aware of the talent in the squad and still places them amongst the tournament favourites.
Germany are preparing for a last-16 clash with Group C runners-up Denmark on Saturday.
“Maybe only France have a similar squad in terms of talent and potential,” said the Germany skipper. “England are still among the favourites. In the knockouts, they are full of experience – but I can understand the criticism saying they could play better.
“In our case, you can see how getting results over the line can make the difference. The mood around Germany is very good, but that’s because we get results.”
1215 – EARPS LEAVES MAN UTD WOMEN
"Manchester United Women can confirm that goalkeeper Mary Earps will depart the football club, following the conclusion of her contract," said a club statement. "Mary joined United in 2019 and went on to make a total of 125 appearances in red, breaking the record for WSL clean sheets in one season and overall, respectively.
"Last season, Mary made history for United by beating Tottenham 4-0 at Wembley in the Women’s FA Cup Final to lift our first major trophy.
"Everyone at the Manchester United would like to thank Mary for her fine service and wish her the best of luck in the next stage of her career."
1210 – CAN SWISS SURPRISE ITALY IN BERLIN?
"We’ve done our homework,” says coach Murat Yakin, whose side progressed to the last 16 as unbeaten runners-up behind hosts Germany in Group A. “We’re struck by how Italy can mix things up, but we’re familiar with their alternatives. Italy are one of the teams that man mark all over the pitch - there aren’t too many teams that do that.
"But I want to focus more on our tactics and our shape so that we can control the opposition, and maybe even catch them off guard!
"There will be some changes to our team and that’s only natural. We have some substitutes who are ready to step in. We’re looking at two possible game plans."
A 5pm kick-off in Berlin for the first of eight last-16 matches at the Euro 2024 finals.
1200 – GOOD OMENS FOR ENGLAND?
It is three years ago today that saw Harry Kane score the second goal in his country's 2-0 victory over Germany in the last 16 of Euro 2020 at Wembley. A bit more of this tomorrow would be just the job, Harry.
1145 – FULL SQUAD IN ENGLAND TRAINING
All 26 players are on the pitch this morning in training ahead of tomorrow's huge last-16 clash with Slovakia at Euro 2024 in Gelsenkirchen. Manager Gareth Southgate and skipper Harry Kane will speak at tonight's media conference ahead of the match.

According to the London Evening Standard, Willian and Bobby De Cordova will both soon be free agents. The wingers are out of contract, but are pondering fresh terms to remain at Craven Cottage next season. Coach Marco Silva is keen to keep both players with De Cordova apparently offered a two-year deal and Willian a new one-year contract.
1115 – HARRY KANE SET FOR SPURS RETURN
With his new club Bayern Munich. The England icon is set for an emotional return to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium less than 12 months after leaving the club for Germany.
Kane was a talismanic figure for Spurs, scoring 213 goals in 320 Premier League appearances, leaving the 30-year-old second in the division's all-time top goalscorers list behind Alan Shearer. He returns to the club where it all began.
Harry’s return to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday, August 10, with Bayern Munich, will be broadcast live on TNT Sports and discovery+.
The pre-season clash for the Visit Malta Cup between Tottenham and the German giants (kick-off 5.30pm) will also see former Spurs centre back Eric Dier make his return to the club where he spent nine-and-a-half seasons.
1105 – CHELSEA SIGN VILLA KID KELLYMAN
The London giants have landed England U19 attacking midfielder Omari Kellyman on a six-year deal from Premier League rivals Aston Villa.
"It is fantastic to be standing here as a Chelsea player," the 18-year-old told the club website. "It's a massive club with an amazing history, so it is great to join.
"It is a dream come true for sure. I'm buzzing to have put on the shirt and can't wait to get started."
1055 – MARTIN SET TO SIGN NEW SAINTS DEAL
According to media reports, the Southampton manager Russell Martin is set to be rewarded with a new three-year contract after leading the club back to the Premier League at the first time of asking.
The former Scotland defender led his side to a 1-0 win over Leeds United in the Championship play-off final at Wembley last month.
1045 – SLOVAKIA CHASE HUGE UPSET WIN
Slovakia captain Milan Skriniar believes victory over England in the last 16 of Euro 2024 in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday would be one of the biggest wins in the country's history. Slovakia sealed their spot in the last 16 with a draw against Romania to finish third in Group E on goal difference. They also defeated Belgium 1-0, but lost 2-1 to Ukraine.

1035 – ERIKSEN SET TO FACE GERMANY
Denmark are hopeful Manchester United midfielder Christian Eriksen will be fit to face Germany in their Euro 2024 clash in Dortmund tonight after recovering from a stomach problem during the week.
"We expect that he will be able to play tomorrow," says manager Kasper Hjulmand.
"Germany are one of the favourites, and it's just too bad they're playing us. The quality they have and the way they've expressed themselves in the first few matches.
"But we also have a great team and so they have to be very, very good to beat us."
Denmark stunned Germany to win the Euro '92 title in Sweden with a 2-0 final victory in one of the biggest shocks of all time.
1025 – GORDON KEEN TO LIFT ENGLAND GLOOM
Anthony Gordon is ready to help lift the current gloom surrounding the England team, as The Three Lions prepare for a Euro 2024 last-16 clash against Slovakia in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday.
Gareth Southgate's side have limped their way into the knockout stages after three lacklustre group-stage performances against Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia.
"I’m an absolute nightmare for anyone I play against," says the Newcastle winger. "I'm always trying to put people on the back foot and I think I add a different element to the team.
"I think it [my direct style] brings a sense of unpredictability. I draw a lot of fouls and it can put teams on the back foot and that’s how I play football.
"That works for me, that’s the way I feel best playing. I know how hard I am to play against, I can feel it, I know they don’t like playing against me and I’m going to carry on doing it."

1015 – CHELSEA CHASE A HALLMARK STAMP
Chelsea are closing in on Leicester City midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, according to The Athletic.
The 25-year-old midfielder has also attracted attention from Brighton, but the publication believes he will choose between Chelsea or staying put.
The report explains: “Chelsea have submitted an offer to sign Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall from Leicester City.
“The Athletic revealed on Thursday that Chelsea had contacted Leicester to express an interest in recruiting the 25-year-old midfielder, although a bid had yet to be made.
“But the west London side have now sent a proposal for the Englishman to their newly promoted Premier League counterparts.
"If a deal is struck between the clubs, Chelsea would be expected to agree a long-term contract with Dewsbury-Hall’s representatives.
"He is thought to have declined the chance to join Brighton & Hove Albion and there remains an expectation that he will only move to Chelsea or remain at Leicester, where Dewsbury-Hall’s terms run until 2027.”
1005 – ITALIAN JOB IN BERLIN
Defending European champions Italy won the 2006 World Cup against France in Berlin on penalties.
Can they relive those glory days against Switzerland in the Euro 2024 last 16 this evening?
"We had a very difficult group, everyone thought we were done for, but we gave it our all and got through," says the PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. "That boosts our confidence and motivation. Once you are in the round of 16, you can go all the way.
“The adrenaline will be pumping, we know millions of Italians are behind us and that gives us an extra push going forward.”

The host nation take on Denmark at 8pm in Dortmund this evening as they chase a spot in the Euro 2024 quarter-finals.
It is a somewhat poignant return to the venue where they lost to 2-0 Italy in extra-time during the 2006 World Cup semi-finals in Germany.
"It's special when we see the pictures and videos of the fans and how they celebrate in the cities," says head coach Julian Nagelsmann.
"When we talk about 2006 it's always about that, we don't talk about the results, we don't talk about the games..it's always about the fan zones.
"At the moment I feel the same...we're not done yet.
"We'll try to continue winning the games to try to create new pictures and videos in the fan zones tomorrow and in the next weeks as well."

0925 – EVERTON TARGET HULL CITY WINGER
Everton have joined the race to sign highly rated Hull City winger Jaden Philogene, according to the Daily Mail.
The youngster is also wanted by a number of clubs on the continent, as well as Premier League sides West Ham and Tottenham.
The paper writes: "Everton are lining up a potential £16 million move for Hull City winger Jaden Philogene.
“The 22-year-old had a stand-out season in the Championship last season that has attracted attention from the likes of Barcelona and Tottenham Hotspur.
“The England U21 international scored 12 often spectacular goals, and that has also alerted West Ham who are mulling over a bid as they look to strengthen their attacking options this summer.
“However, Everton have stepped into the chase and are willing to offer around £16m for a player that cost Hull around £5m last summer when they signed him from Aston Villa, who are understood to hold a sell-on and buy-back option.
“Philogene grew up in Villa's academy where his early promise attracted enquiries from Paris Saint-Germain, Borussia Dortmund and Barcelona who have kept him on their watch list.”

0850 – ARSENAL JOIN ISAK CHASE - REPORT
The Sun reports that Chelsea have been priced out of signing Newcastle forward Alexander Isak.
Newcastle want more than £100 million for the Sweden international, leaving Arsenal still with an interest.
The paper claims: “Chelsea have withdrawn from talks over signing Alexander Isak from Newcastle due to their reluctance to meet the club's £100 million-plus valuation.
“Sources with knowledge of the negotiations have told SunSport that Newcastle would not even consider bids below £100m for Isak and believe the Swedish striker's true value in the current market is closer to £120m.
"Isak's current contract at Newcastle expires in 2028 with the club ready to offer him a two-year extension."
“Arsenal are long-term admirers, but have yet to make any contact with Newcastle.”
0840 – IS MARCUS RASHFORD HEADING FOR PSG?
The Mirror reports that Paris Saint-Germain are keen on moving for Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford.
“Paris Saint-Germain are poised to reignite their interest in Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford," says the newspaper.
“The French giants are long-term admirers of Rashford, 26, and previously held talks with the England international back when it seemed as though a move abroad could be on the cards.
“Rashford opted to stay at Old Trafford [and] went on to enjoy a career-best season under Erik ten Hag, plundering 30 goals. However, he endured a disappointing campaign last year and there has been further speculation over his future with United's top brass believed to be open to offers for all but a handful of key players.
“That has led to renewed interest from PSG.
“PSG's latest stance on Rashford comes just months after it was reported that they were set to shelve their interest due to Manchester United's demands.
"It was claimed back in April that The Red Devils were demanding a sum of £100 million in order to part with their homegrown striker, who missed out on a place in England's Euro 2024 squad.”
0830 – GOOD MORNING FROM A HUGE DAY IN FOOTBALL
