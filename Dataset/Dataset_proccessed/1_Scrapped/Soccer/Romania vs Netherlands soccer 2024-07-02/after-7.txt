Hello and welcome to this MARCA in English live blog where we will be taking you through the Euro 2024 round of 16 clash between Romania and the Netherlands.

Romania managed to defy the odds and top their group with four points, despite bottom-placed Ukraine having the same number of points. They have shown glimpses of quality and are a team not to be underestimated.

The Netherlands, however, caused a surprise for the wrong reason, finishing third in their group after losing their last match to Austria. Ronald Koeman will feel like they got a relatively kind draw given the circumstances but his side will know that they have to up their standards if they are to progress to the last eight of the competition.

Stay tuned to follow the action, which gets underway at 18:00 CEST.

Malen with the exclamation mark

As if there were any doubts, Malen puts the exclamation mark on a dominant Dutch victory.

After picking up the ball in the attacking third, he cuts in and sends his finish into the bottom corner as Koeman's men march on to the quarter-finals.

Malen sends Dutch into the quarter-finals

That should send the Netherlands into the quarter-finals. Gakpo keeps the ball on the byline and moves into the Romanian penalty area.

Ragusin seems to think the ball is going out of play, but it doesn't, and Gakpo cleverly slips the ball onto the feet of Malen, who just has to tap home to double the Dutch advantage.

Romania still in this

The Dutch thought they had scored a second courtesy of Gakpo, who collected a loose ball in the penalty area and fired home.

However, replays show that Ake's flick on to Gakpo put the Liverpool man in an offside position and the goal has been disallowed.
