According to Steven Goff of The Washington Post, Spain’s Luis De La Fuente has interest in the USMNT job 
Massoud Roushandel, president of Global Elite Sports Group, a U.S.-Spanish management firm, confirmed to The Washington Post that he and Vicente Montes emailed U.S. Soccer Sporting Director Matt Crocker on Friday about De La Fuente’s interest in the job.
De La Fuente just won the Euros for Spain today, beating England in the final.
Under him, Spain won seven games out of seven in the Euros, beating the likes of England, Germany, France, Croatia, Italy, Georgia, and Albania along the way.
They became the first team in the Euros to win with a 100% record.
De La Fuente also became the first coach to win the Euros, Nations League, U-21 Euros, and U-19 Euros.
He’s been with Spain since 2013, starting off as U-19 coach. He’s moved up to U-21, U-23, and now won trophies for the national team.
