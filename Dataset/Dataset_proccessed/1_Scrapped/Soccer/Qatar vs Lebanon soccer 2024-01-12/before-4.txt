Time difference for AFC Asian Cup 2023 in Qatar: Match kickoffs in USA, UK, Canada, Australia, India

The 2023 AFC Asian Cup begins in Qatar on January 12, 2024, with the host nation kicking off the tournament with a match against Lebanon.

From there, 24 teams will battle it out for continental glory, beginning with a group stage comprising six groups of four nations. A single-elimination knockout round follows, running from the Round of 16 all the way to the final.

Qatar, the hosts of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, are the defending champions and will once more hope to stage an exciting international tournament even if they are not considered among the favourites to win the trophy themselves.

Instead, continental heavyweights Japan, South Korea and Australia are the likely main contenders, while Saudi Arabia, who shocked eventual winners Argentina in their opening World Cup match, cannot be discounted.

Keen to watch the action unfold? Here is how the time difference works for Qatar and some of the major English-language territories, plus the kickoff times during the group stage.
