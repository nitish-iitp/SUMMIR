DOHA - Thanks to the only goal from midfielder Jackson Irvine, Australia guaranteed a berth in the round-of-16 at the ongoing AFC Asian Cup after edging Syria 1-0 in Group B here on Thursday.


Irvine scored the decisive shot in the 59th minute, when he flicked the ball past Syria's goalkeeper Ahmad Madanieh.

It was his second goal of the tournament after he scored the opening goal in the 2-0 win over India in the first game of the group.

Pablo Sabbag almost slot Syria the first goal in this Asian Cup but his small-angle shot hit the post in the sixth minute.

With two straight wins, Australia lead Group B with six points, followed by Uzbekistan who eased past India 3-0 on Thursday.

Fayzullaev headed in the opener in the fourth minute for Uzbekistan before Igor Sergeev doubled the lead and Sherzod Nasrullaev sealed the win in the first half.

Uzbekistan, who tied Syria 0-0 in the first round, will encounter Australia in the last round to vie for the group winners.

Syria might qualify for the next round as one of the best-third teams if they can beat India in the next game, while India also have an outside chance.
