Mozambique drew their first qualifier match of the round

Guinea-Bissau visit the Estadio de Zimpeto in Maputo to face Mozambique in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers in Group I. The Djurtus are looking to build on their opening-day win and boost their progression hopes.

Against Eswatini last week, they picked up a 1-0 win on home turf, with Jorge Bura netting the only goal of the game just 14 minutes after the kick-off. With the King's Shield unable to fight their way back into the tie, the hosts came away with all three points.

Ranked 114th in the world, Luis Boa Morte's side made their fourth AFCON appearance at the Ivory Coast showpiece earlier this year, although they went out in the group stages yet again. They are aiming to qualify for the fifth consecutive edition of the cup next year.

Quite similarly, Mozambique have never progressed beyond the first round of the competition in any of their previous five appearances, including in the 2023 edition this year.

Now aiming to reach the finals again, the Mambas were held to a 1-1 draw with Mali in their first game. Geny Catamo opened the scoring for them after 37 minutes but Yves Bissouma pegged them back with a second-half equalizer for the Eagles.

Following the first round of games, Guinea-Bissau sit in first position with three points, followed by their next opponents.

The Mambas have drawn their last three clashes but remain unbeaten in their last nine.

Mozambique vs Guinea-Bissau Prediction

The Mambas have failed to win their last few games but haven't lost either, which is a testament to their stoic backline. The visitors aren't going to have it easy, and may have to settle for a draw here.
