Jamaica are ranked 95 places above the Dominican Republic

Jamaica host the Dominican Republic at the Independence Park in Kingston on Thursday for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. This is their first game in the second round of qualifying for the showpiece tournament.

The sides have been drawn alongside Guatemala, British Virgin Islands and Dominica in Group E, with Guatemala crushing Dominica 6-0 in the opening fixture on Wednesday to sit atop the table.

Ranked 55th in the world, Jamaica are playing for the first time since wrapping up their 2023-24 Nations League campaign. The Reggae Boyz finished third after beating Panama 1-0 in the third-place face-off, with Dexter Lembikisa netting the only goal of the game in the 42nd minute.

Head coach Heimir Hallgrímsson has called up 26 players for this month's double-header against the Dominican Republic and Dominica, including Ligue 1's Clermont Foot forward, Shamar Nicholson, who has 16 goals to his name in 44 appearances.

There are five uncapped players in the squad, and all except Jayden Hibbert are based in Jamaica. Goalkeeper Hibbert plies his trade with Atlanta United and will be hoping to make his international debut this month.

On the other hand, the Dominican Republic are looking to put their CONCACAF Nations League disappointment behind them and begin the qualifiers on a positive note. Despite winning thrice in six games, the Quisqueyanos finished second in their Nations League group and missed out on promotion to League A.
