Preview: Jamaica vs. Dominican Republic - prediction, team news, lineups

For the first time in their history, Jamaica will host the Dominican Republic at Independence Park in the opening match of 2026 CONCACAF World Cup qualifying for both teams.

In their previous competitive fixture, the Reggae Boyz claimed a 1-0 victory over Panama in the third-place playoff game at the CONCACAF Nations League, while the Dominicans lost a friendly versus Peru 4-1.

Jamaica will enter this World Cup qualification cycle having suffered just one defeat in their previous five competitive fixtures.

That 3-1 defeat versus the USA in the Nations League semi-finals is the only time the Reggae Boyz have conceded a goal this year.

Heimir Hallgrimsson's men have been getting things done the hard way for a while now, coming from behind to claim a win or draw in three of their previous four competitive fixtures when conceding first.

That resilience not only earned them a place at the upcoming Copa America, but they have also moved up two places in the FIFA rankings, currently 55th, the third-highest position in this region among sides that must go through the 2026 World Cup qualification process.

The Reggae Boyz only claimed one victory at Independence Park during the 2022 World Cup qualification campaign, defeating Honduras 2-1 on their final matchday in the Octagon.

They have not lost a World Cup qualifier to a Caribbean opponent since September 2016, when Haiti triumphed 2-0 at Independence Park.

Following a solid campaign in League B of the most recent Nations League season, the Dominican Republic are in the second round of World Cup qualifying for the first time since the 2018 cycle.

Marcelo Neveleff's men lost their most recent international contest against Peru but have not suffered successive defeats since June-September 2023 (two).

Los Quisqueyanos have never made it beyond the second round of CONCACAF World Cup qualification, finishing second in their group the last two times they made it this far.

Coming into this encounter, the Dominicans are unbeaten in their previous five matches in all competitions when scoring the opening goal.

Playing away from home has proven to be challenging for them of late, going winless in their previous three matches outside the Dominican Republic, two of which wound up in defeat.

Since the beginning of 2023, they have only suffered one defeat versus a side in the Caribbean, losing 2-1 at Montserrat in November.

The Jamaicans will be without several veterans for this clash, including captain Andre Blake, who recently underwent knee surgery, Demarai Gray is dealing with a collarbone injury, Ethan Pinnock has a sore ankle, Joel Latibeaudiere continues to recover from a torn calf muscle and Amari'i Bell is recovering from a hamstring strain.

Michail Antonio led them in scoring during the 2022 World Cup qualification cycle with three goals, with Shamar Nicholson next at two, and the Clermont striker is just two goals behind Darren Mattocks and Paul Davis for seventh all-time with the Reggae Boyz.

Jason Joseph Yambatis and Nelson Lemaire were the only uncapped players named to the Dominican Republic side for these upcoming qualifiers, while Miguel Lloyd reached the half-century mark for caps and Daniel Leonardo Flores made his 10th appearance for the senior side in their previous encounter.

Jean Carlos Lopez, who is currently even with Cesar Garcia for the most appearances with the men's program (52), had their only goal in a defeat versus Peru.

Jamaica possible starting lineup:
Waite; Lowe, Hector, Bernard; Lembikisa, Palmer, Anderson, Leigh; Nicholson, Antonio, Decordova-Reid

Dominican Republic possible starting lineup:
Lloyd; Garcia, De Lucas, Ademan; Vasquez, Lopez, Flores, Firpo; Azcona, Ventura, Romero



We say: Jamaica 4-0 Dominican Republic

Despite the Reggae Boyz incurring a number of key injuries ahead of this encounter, this appears to be a mismatch, with Jamaica the far superior side.

They will face an inexperienced Dominican opponent that have looked overwhelmed and out of sorts against the stronger teams in this region.
