In their first match of the tournament, Equatorial Guinea showed that they are ready to challenge for a place in the next round with a 1-1 draw against the traditional Nigerian team.

TIME AND PLACE!

Equatorial Guinea and Guinea Bissau face off in the second round of the Africa Cup of Nations group stage at 11:00 at the Alassane Ouattara Olympic Stadium in Abidijan, Ivory Coast. Equatorial Guinea drew 1-1 with Nigeria in their first match, while Guinea Bissau lost 2-0 to Côte d'Ivoire. Both teams therefore need a win to have a better chance of qualifying for the final round.

Equatorial Guinea come into this game on the back of an 11-game unbeaten run, but only five wins in that time. The team qualified for this stage by finishing second in their group, with the same 13 points as Tunisia, but with a lower goal difference. Even so, in a group that also included Libya and Botswana, qualification came easily, with a nine-point lead over these two teams, making them a very difficult team to beat.

Guinea Bissau, on the other hand, have a shaky recent record, with four wins, two draws and four defeats in their last ten games, but in the qualifying phase they also came second behind Nigeria, but ahead of Sierra Leone, Sao Tome and Principe and Mauritius.
