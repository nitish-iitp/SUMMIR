Kuala Lumpur: The 3rd AFC Grassroots Conference 2023 kicked off today with the AFC Special Grassroots Awards 2023 which commemorated the unsung heroes of grassroots football in Asia in the Malaysian capital city of Kuala Lumpur. 
Setting the Conference in motion, the ceremony saw the honour of the Best Grassroots Leader bestowed upon Japan’s Masakatsu Setowaki while India’s Anantapur Sports Academy was crowned as the Best Grassroots Project. Meanwhile, the accolade of the Best Grassroots Club was awarded to Japan’s Kasuga Eagles Club. 
AFC General Secretary Datuk Seri Windsor John, who presented the awards, praised the concerted efforts of the winners and said in his opening remarks: “The manner in which our Member Associations have worked together to develop the beautiful game has been incredible and thus, it is only fitting that we kick this Conference off with the AFC Special Grassroots Awards to recognise the efforts of our grassroots heroes who work tirelessly behind the scenes.”
 
“The AFC has outlined its Vision to ensure football remains the Continent’s most popular sport, and in order to grow the game in a sustained manner, we must never neglect the grassroots.
 
“But we must also remember that while grassroots football plays an integral role in developing future stars, it is also at this stage that we mould well-rounded individuals through valuable lessons such as team spirit, discipline, and social inclusion. I thank and congratulate you all for your invaluable contribution to the sport,” he added.
 
Additionally, the AFC’s Official Global Supporter Kelme presented the winners with 60 footballs to further encourage the outstanding efforts and achievements of the winners. 
Best Grassroots Leader: Masakatsu Setowaki
 
Having spent a considerable portion of his life as an elementary school teacher to students with special needs, Masakatsu Setowaki has dedicated his life to promoting sports for people with disabilities and creating a positive impact in the Shizuoka Prefecture of Japan.
 
Since 1989, Setowaki has played a key role in establishing multiple football clubs and competitions for students with disabilities such as the first of a kind Shizuoka Prefecture Football Festival for the disabled.  
 
Marking a groundbreaking moment in the nation's sports landscape, Setowaki’s efforts spanning over decades reached a significant milestone when the Prefecture’s municipality expressed their desire to build the nation’s first ever stadium exclusively reserved for the physically and intellectually disabled. 
 
“I want to thank the AFC for recognising our hard work. Since this is the result of our collective efforts, I want to share this with all the players, staff members and volunteers who have strived to help children with disabilities stay involved in football,” said Masakatsu Setowaki, President of Shizuoka FID Soccer Federation.
Best Grassroots Project: Anantapur Sports Academy
 
Established by renowned non-profit organisation Rural Development Trust, Anantapur Sports Academy (ASA) grew from the vision of leveraging the power of sports to achieve sustainable social change among the underprivileged and marginalised children and youth in the districts of Anantapur and Sri Satya Sai in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. 
 
In just a little over a decade, the academy's contributions to enhancing the lives of the community's children have been unparalleled. Some of the major milestones achieved by ASA include the establishment of developmental centres in collaboration with FC Barcelona, the launch of residential and non-residential academies for both boys and girls, the initiation of the Anantapur Football League, and the provision of education to the region's children through the setup of mobile libraries.
 
Moreover, in addition to football training sessions, participants are also mandated to attend two life skills sessions each week, along with a monthly health and social awareness meeting. 
 
“This recognition is an immense motivation to work even harder and on behalf of the Anantapur Sports Academy, we want to thank the All India Football Federation and the AFC. But most importantly, we want to express our gratitude towards all our stakeholders who have worked so tirelessly to further our dreams,” said Sai Krishna Pulluru, Director of the Anantapur Sports Academy. 
Best Grassroots Club: Kasuga Eagles Club
 
Dedicated to harnessing the power of football to overcome demographic challenges, Japan’s Kasuga Eagles boasts of forty years of community service where the Fukuoka Prefecture based club has been enriching the region’s community across age-groups and social backgrounds. 
 
Since its establishment in 1980, the club has been striving to bridge the gap between European and Asian football standards in ways that have previously not existed in the country. 
 
With social inclusivity and “enjoying football” being cornerstone beliefs of the Eagles, the club places a strong emphasis on the philosophy of “Fureai" or “connected communication”, forging friendships that transcend age and gender through not just football but an array of sporting activities such as badminton and gymnastics.
 
A particularly commendable achievement of the club led by Chairperson Toru Watanabe has been its efforts in collaborating with local governmental bodies and businesses to engage physically inactive children who have been out of school and teaching them the valuable lessons such as team spirit and discipline.
 
Additionally, the club adheres to all categories of the Japan Football Association's Grassroots Endorsed Partner Programme, which range from tenets such as promoting the participation of girls, enhancing facilities to cater to disability football.
 
“I want to thank the AFC for this honour. At the Kasuga Eagles, we are united in our dream to create a better environment for football for everyone. I am confident that if we all work together, we can take Asian football very far,” said Katsuaki Sugiyama, Board Chairman of the Kasuga Eagles Club.
