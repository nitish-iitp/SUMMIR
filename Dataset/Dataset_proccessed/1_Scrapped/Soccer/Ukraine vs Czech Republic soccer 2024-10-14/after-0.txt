Ukraine Results

Ukraine has had mixed fortunes in recent matches, combining some solid performances with disappointing defeats. Here is a look at their last five matches:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	W/L
11.10.24	UNL	Ukraine vs Georgia	1-0	W
10.09.24	UNL	Czech Republic vs Ukraine	3-2	L
07.09.24	UNL	Ukraine vs Albania	1-2	L
26.06.24	EUR	Ukraine vs Belgium	0-0	D
21.06.24	EUR	Slovakia vs Ukraine	1-2	W

Ukraine managed to secure two victories from their last five games, including an important win against Georgia in the UEFA Nations League. However, losses to Albania and the Czech Republic have put them in a challenging position in their group. Ukraine’s defense has been inconsistent, and they will need to tighten up at the back if they want to collect all three points against the Czech Republic.

Czech Republic Results

The Czech Republic has enjoyed a slightly more positive run of form, with some impressive wins boosting their confidence. Below are their last five matches:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	W/L
11.10.24	UNL	Czech Republic vs Albania	2-0	W
10.09.24	UNL	Czech Republic vs Ukraine	3-2	W
07.09.24	UNL	Georgia vs Czech Republic	4-1	L
26.06.24	EUR	Czech Republic vs Turkey	1-2	L
22.06.24	EUR	Georgia vs Czech Republic	1-1	D

The Czech Republic has won two of their last five matches, including victories over Albania and Ukraine. However, they also suffered a heavy defeat against Georgia in early September. The Czech defense will need to remain vigilant against Ukraine’s attack, while their own forward line, led by Tomas Chory, will be key to their chances of securing another positive result.

Ukraine vs Czech Republic Head-to-Head Matches

Recent history between Ukraine and the Czech Republic shows a fairly even balance of results. Here’s a breakdown of their last five encounters:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result
10.09.24	UNL	Czech Republic vs Ukraine	3-2
08.09.21	FI	Czech Republic vs Ukraine	1-1
16.10.18	UNL	Ukraine vs Czech Republic	1-0
06.09.18	UNL	Czech Republic vs Ukraine	1-2
15.08.12	FI	Ukraine vs Czech Republic	0-0

The recent head-to-head encounters have been tightly contested, with the Czech Republic winning their most recent matchup 3-2 in September 2024. Both teams have shown they are capable of edging out narrow victories, and it’s likely that this trend could continue in their upcoming fixture.

Ukraine vs Czech Republic Predicted Lineups

Below, we present the predicted starting lineups for the Ukraine vs Czech Republic UEFA Nations League clash. Both teams are expected to field strong sides, with Ukraine utilizing a 4-1-4-1 formation, while the Czech Republic is likely to line up in a 4-2-3-1 system. The potential squads for each team are based on recent performances and available players.

Ukraine Predicted Lineup (4-1-4-1):

Trubin (GK), Konoplia (DF), Zabarnyi (DF), Talovierov (DF), Matviyenko (DF), Kalyuzhnyi (MF), Hutsuliak (MF), Shaparenko (MF), Sudakov (MF), Mudryk (MF), Dovbyk (FW)

Czech Republic Predicted Lineup (4-2-3-1):

Kovar (GK), Coufal (DF), Vitík (DF), Holeš (DF), Bořil (DF), Souček (MF), Červ (MF), Černý (MF), Šulc (MF), Provod (MF), Chorý (FW)

Players Unavailable for the Match

As the game approaches, it’s crucial to consider the list of unavailable players who may influence the outcome of the match. Ukraine has a few potential concerns, including Roman Yaremchuk, who is likely to start on the bench again. Meanwhile, the Czech Republic will miss a key player in Patrik Schick, who has been a significant goal-scoring asset for his country.

Team	Player	Reason
Ukraine	Roman Yaremchuk	Likely on bench
Czech Republic	Patrik Schick	Injury

Ukraine is expected to field a mostly full-strength lineup, with Yaremchuk’s absence not significantly disrupting their attack, as Artem Dovbyk will lead the line. On the other hand, the Czech Republic will have to compensate for the absence of Patrik Schick, their prolific striker, which may impact their offensive efficiency.

Key Factors to Watch

As both teams prepare for this crucial UEFA Nations League match, several key factors could influence the outcome. Ukraine and the Czech Republic have shown contrasting forms in recent matches, and the following elements will play a critical role:

Ukraine’s defensive inconsistencies in recent games;
Czech Republic’s solid attack led by Tomas Chory, who scored a brace against Albania;
Injuries to key Ukrainian players, such as Roman Yaremchuk, could weaken their lineup;
The absence of Czech star Patrik Schick, which may limit their attacking options;
The form of Ukraine’s Mykhaylo Mudryk, who scored the winner against Georgia;
Head-to-head history, with Ukraine winning one of their last five matches against the Czech Republic;
The Czech Republic’s ability to bounce back after tough losses, as shown in their recovery against Albania;
Ukraine’s urgency to climb out of the bottom of their group standings.

Free Tips on Ukraine vs Czech Republic

When preparing to bet on the upcoming Ukraine vs Czech Republic UEFA Nations League match, it’s essential to consider a variety of factors that can influence the outcome. Successful betting requires more than just looking at current odds; it’s about understanding the context surrounding the match. Below are some insightful tips to help guide your predictions and make more informed decisions for this game.

Head-to-Head Statistics: Ukraine and the Czech Republic have had competitive matchups in the past, with both teams securing wins. Knowing how these teams historically perform against each other can provide a valuable perspective on the possible result.
Home vs. Away Performance: Ukraine will technically be playing away from home, as the match takes place in Wrocław, Poland. Check how both teams perform when away from their home turf to gauge any potential advantages for the Czech Republic.
Team Motivation: Ukraine is currently at the bottom of the group and desperately needs a win to stay in contention for promotion. This added motivation could give them the edge they need to fight harder in this crucial fixture.

Match Prediction: Ukraine vs Czech Republic Prediction 2024

In what promises to be a closely fought encounter, the Ukraine vs Czech Republic prediction today leans towards a draw. Both teams have shown inconsistent form, but they also possess the quality to challenge one another in key moments. Ukraine will be motivated to level the score after their loss to the Czech Republic in September, but the visitors have been solid in their recent games and will be confident following back-to-back victories. With this in mind, a draw seems a likely outcome, with both teams scoring.

Ukraine vs Czech Republic odds suggest that while the match could swing either way, a tight contest with under 3.5 goals is probable. The Czech Republic’s recent attacking form, combined with Ukraine’s home advantage, makes for a compelling clash. However, neither side is expected to dominate, and the points could well be shared in this critical Nations League fixture.

Our Prediction: Ukraine 1-1 Czech Republic
Prediction Type	Prediction	Odds
Full-Time Result	Draw	3.2
