NATIONS LEAGUE 2024/2025: UKRAINE AND CZECHIA PLAY TO A DRAW IN WROCŁAW

14.10.2024 23:45

The Ukraine national team continued their Nations League 2024/2025 campaign with a match against Czechis in Wrocław.

Serhiy Rebrov’s side started the tournament with defeats against Albania (1:2) and Czechia (2:3) but secured a victory against Georgia (1:0) three days ago. This time, the team again faced the Czechs, playing a nominal home match at the Tarczyński Arena in Wrocław, Poland.

There was only one change in Ukraine's starting lineup — Stepanenko replaced Kalyuzhnyi. Riznyk left the squad due to injury, while Bondar and Kabaiev were left out of the matchday squad.

The game began with both teams exchanging chances. Shaparenko missed the target after receiving a cross from Mudryk, while Trubin had to make a save after Sulc’s effort. The Czechs took control for a while, and Černý shot over the bar. In the 18th minute, Ivan Hašek’s men took the lead when the ball fell to Červ after a corner, and he found the bottom left corner. Hutsulyak suffered an injury in the same episode and was replaced by Zubkov.

Ukraine then created a few promising attacks but lacked the finishing touches. The Czechs attempted shots from a distance but were off-target. Mudryk was a constant threat, and in the 43rd minute, he had a golden opportunity to equalize but shot straight at Kovář after outmuscling his defender in the box. The ball hit the back of Ukraine’s net again when Vítík pounced on a rebound after a save from Trubin, but the goal was ruled out for offside.

Early in the second half, Ukraine leveled the score. Krejčí handled the ball in the box while contesting with Konoplya, and Dovbyk calmly converted the penalty. The next shot on target came in the 77th minute when Kliment found space, but Trubin made a crucial save. Zubkov tested Kovář from a free kick, and later, Yaremchuk, Matviyenko, and Mudryk had chances but couldn’t find the mark.

Ultimately, the teams couldn’t be separated, finishing 1:1. After four matches, Ukraine sits at the bottom of their group.
