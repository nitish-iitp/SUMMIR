Ange Postecoglou looks on from the sidelines during the Premier League match between Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur at St James' Park

A fit and sharp Dominic Solanke is going to have a field day within this Tottenham Hotspur team.

That's not hope. That's simply looking at the facts. The 26-year-old netted 19 Premier League goals for Bournemouth last season in a team that, while it had a fine campaign in finishing 12th in the table, scored 20 goals fewer than Ange Postecoglou's Spurs side and the England international netted more than a third of them.

Ange Postecoglou reveals Tottenham stance for January transfer window after injury crisis

In their first three matches of this campaign, Tottenham have sent 48 shots at goal, three admittedly coming from a rusty Solanke in his first game at Leicester around an ankle injury he played on with. They have created many, many more openings. There were so many times on Sunday at St James' Park when dangerous balls were played into the six-yard box into space where Solanke or Richarlison would have been.

One in particular from Brennan Johnson was perfect, fired low and into that killer space between goalkeeper and the edge of the six-yard box. It's one of the key sectors Tottenham's wingers are told to go for with their low crosses and Johnson has also become adept at getting on to the end of such balls from the other flank, something drilled into him by the coaching staff.

Unfortunately nobody had shown the movement to do the same for his ball on this occasion and it might have sealed the game in Spurs' favour had they done so. Solanke will feast on such opportunities when he returns. A number of his Bournemouth goals came from such balls into the box.

Yet he was not there on Sunday. Only Spurs could sign a £65million striker who hadn't missed a single game throughout all of last season only to manage to injure him in his first game and then see their other forward pick up a muscle problem days later in training.

Everton fans will point out that Richarlison missed only 15 games across four years with them. In just two years at Spurs he's already missed 22 and been unable to play a bigger part in more because he was either carrying a problem or just coming back from one.

Even 19-year-old prolific striker Will Lankshear missed only one game in his 32-goal season last time out for the U21s. He would have been on the first team bench on Sunday had he not picked up a hamstring injury for the U21s this month which will keep him out for the next couple of weeks. Fate enjoys laughing at Tottenham Hotspur.

On Sunday at Newcastle United, Spurs' performance was light years ahead of their two previous displays at St James' Park. On those days they collapsed under the pressure of the noisy home crowd and Eddie Howe's side, shipping 10 goals across the two games and scoring once.

This time around they weathered the early storm and the crowd noise before dominating the game, allowing Newcastle just three shots on target and forcing Nick Pope into plenty of saves at the other end - six in all. They had 66% of the possession, played 415 passes to Newcastle's 180 and had 20 shots to the hosts' nine, with the Magpies' defence required to make 33 clearances and eight blocks as well as those six Pope saves.

However, as was the case at Leicester, they failed to bury their opponents in a hail of goals as they did at home against Everton and when that happens you heap more pressure on any little slip-up by the defence.

The script of course dictated that would happen and they were duly punished. Postecoglou's leader in the backline Cristian Romero was caught out of position twice and Newcastle's Harvey Barnes and Alexander Isak profited behind him, both goals coming against the run of play, but the record books will not care for that, only the scoreline.

It wasn't even a Spurs player who scored the visitors' goal in between those two home strikes. After Pedro Porro's cross was deflected on to the crossbar, the ball eventually found its way back to James Maddison and his effort was pushed aside by Pope. Johnson was attacking that back post as instructed and slid in with a shot that was heading in only for the keeper to get fingertips to it and claw it away towards his defender Burn who somehow lashed it into his own net off his shin.

"Very similar I guess to our first away game when we controlled it for the most part, nullified most of the threats that Newcastle have," said Postecoglou after the game. "It's obviously a difficult opponent here at home. The crowd create a pretty strong atmosphere for the home side, little things go their way but I thought for the most part we handled that really well.

"Then we gained the ascendancy in the game and we just needed to kill it off and we didn't and a disappointing second goal. I thought we switched off a little bit but the game should have been well over by then. So, another sore one unfortunately where we haven't got the rewards for our play, but ultimately it's three strong performances from the first three games. The results don't reflect it in that way."

The feeling compared to the last two long journeys back down south from Newcastle was a different one. Those two previous trips brought only embarrassment and anger, this one more frustration at what should have been.

Newcastle have stumbled this season in their performances, even if they remain unbeaten, but Tottenham gave themselves the platform to deliver big back-to-back wins going into the north London derby after the international break.

They failed to take it but Postecoglou will not be unhappy with the way Tottenham played for much of the game, knowing that a striker will help at one end and a sharper backline will do the same at the other.

A defence that undid its own work

Just when Tottenham's defence seemed to have it figured out so they let themselves down on two key occasions.

This was the same back four and goalkeeper that shipped four goals in April to Newcastle but they showed plenty of positives in their play this time around. Senior assistant coach Matt Wells could be seen drilling the backline ahead of the game, dealing with high balls into the box and also the ability to turn as a group when a ball over the top was played.

It was that latter one that needed everyone participating and that it didn't in the winning goal will annoy Wells and Postecoglou.

Set pieces - both defensive and attacking - were much better on the day, with new coach Nick Montgomery's influence in that department clear on proceedings. Very little got past the Spurs defence in the air from free-kicks and corners. They looked far more organised with their hybrid zonal and man marking system, with the weaker players in the air marking opposition midfielders rather than big defenders and attackers, and they were helped by Radu Dragusin's height and aerial ability.

The Romanian made an important return to the team and showed once again that at just 22-years-old, he's a big defensive talent and no bit-part player for Tottenham. If Cristian Romero or Micky van de Ven do not perform this season at any point, Dragusin is going to be pushing hard to take their place. He will get plenty of game time anyway in the months ahead with so many fixtures on the horizon.

Van de Ven looked like he would be fine to play in this game but late in the week did not feel quite ready after his injury scare in the match against Everton. He will also not be risked on international duty and has withdrawn from the Netherlands squad.

"Micky was close in training this week but with the international break he's not quite 100%. Part of me was keen to give Radu a run, especially at this venue, so yeah we're going with Radu today," Postecoglou said before the game.

The Romanian carried straight off from his impressive performances at the Euros. He made two terrific sliding stops on Barnes and Isak during the game, the latter showing his ability to chase back with the best of them.

Dragusin made four clearances, one tackle, one interception and blocked one shot in a positive display and he showed plenty of confidence with the ball at his feet. He had an 86.4% pass success rating from his 44 attempts as he tried to force quick passes to his team-mates and he sent one headed effort from a Dejan Kulusevski corner wide of the left-hand post at the other end of the pitch.

"I thought he was good, Radu. It was a great opportunity to expose him. I mean, he's only 22. He's still a young man, especially for a defender and I thought exposing him to this atmosphere and the threat, the particular threat that Newcastle posed with Isak up front, he had to be really concentrated and I thought he was," Postecoglou told football.london.

"I think he's going to play a big part in our season. Him coming through that, that whole experience, will set him up well."

The move to put Romero on the left with Dragusin on the right didn't have quite the same effect. The Argentine was not as comfortable in his build-up play and it was often down to the Romanian to sprint back to make up for Romero's occasional wanderings.

The Spurs vice-captain still looks like a player who returned to training far later than most of his team-mates after what were no doubt plenty of celebrations following Argentina's second successive Copa America win.

Romero headed the ball into the Newcastle net early on but was well offside. In defending he made two tackles, two clearances and blocked one shot, but his positioning was poor for both goals.

For Barnes' first half strike he was caught high up the pitch after sprinting like a mad man to press towards the halfway line as the furthest man forward after Spurs cleared a set piece. He ambled back slowly as Newcastle took a quick throw-in and while Maddison worked hard in trying to cover the space down the right and Yves Bissouma in the middle.

Romero threw his hands up in the air in the aftermath of the goal, frustrated at those behind him, but not acknowledging that he left them exposed.

For the winning goal, the Argentine was the only one of the back four caught out by the ball over the top, stepping forward with no sense of the line while his three fellow defenders were already on the turn.

That could be down to fitness and how switched on he still is as games reach their final stages at the moment. Spurs have conceded three goals so far this season and Romero has played a part in all of them, leaving Jamie Vardy completely unmarked at the King Power Stadium in the second half in the opening game.

The Argentine is one of the best central defenders around and he's won it all at international level, but he needs to be at his peak fitness to show that in the Premier League this season.

That will come with each game and a couple of tough World Cup qualifying matches against Chile and Colombia on international duty this fortnight might help that as long as he returns uninjured.

In front of the Tottenham backline, Bissouma continued his apology tour with another strong display, although the 28-year-old was another who looked tired as the game wore on, a hallmark of a pre-season with, at most, 45 minute displays and missing the first match at Leicester through his own daft decisions.

Maddison was equally important for long periods, not only with his creativity and forcing Pope into a couple of saves but also his work rate in getting around the pitch. Postecoglou said the midfielder's fitness is key to confidence and free from injury and able to cover plenty of yards is showing the better version of the 27-year-old.

That he now has not only Kulusevski as competition but also a rising star in Lucas Bergvall, as well as the hunger of getting back into the England squad, are all helpful driving forces for Maddison this season.

There was a tactics-heavy chat going on in the first half on the side-line between Matt Wells and Maddison in the first half as the young assistant boss dished out plenty of instructions to the midfielder in front of the dugout during a break in play due to an injured assistant referee.

It seemed to be to do with Maddison and Bissouma's role alongside each other judging by the hand gestures, and Maddison took it all in before going over to the Mali international and telling him to go to see the bench, where Montgomery dished out the second half of the advice.

Pedro Porro and Destiny Udogie had differing games in the full-back slots. The former took part in plenty of the attacking play with six shots, one tipped over by Pope, and at the other end managed four tackles, two interceptions and two clearances.

The difference again is fitness. The Spaniard had a full pre-season while Udogie had been out since April before his return to action just three weeks ago. The 21-year-old Italian looks like he's still shaking off the rust at both ends of the pitch and he will improve.

Called back into the Italy squad for their Nations League fixtures against France and Israel, further match minutes for Udogie could be beneficial for Spurs as long as he returns untroubled.

Tottenham's defence will get stronger as they get sharper and that in turn will ripple throughout the team. They need it to because sterner tests await.

Brennan Johnson and the attack

With all of the usual Tottenham scapegoats having left the club in the huge clear-out over the past 12 months, that means some fans frustrated by recent results or transfer activity have turned their attentions towards 23-year-old Brennan Johnson and that £50million price tag he arrived with.

It's tough on the young attacker, who managed 15 goal involvements in his first season and seems to be the only one in that department who truly gets what Postecoglou wants his attackers to do.

Johnson's age brings with it inconsistent touches and decisions at times, while last year's hamstring injury appears to have had a knock-on effect of some hesitation occasionally at running at his opponent, but Postecoglou has high hopes for the Wales international and it's days like Sunday when you can see why.

Johnson sometimes needs a little kick up the backside in reminding him that there's plenty of competition in the winger slots at Tottenham and every time he's been dropped from the starting line-up, he's responded with a string of positive displays including a first one which is usually an attack-altering one from the bench.

It was this time as he forced Spurs' leveller by reacting quickly to Maddison's saved shot and his own effort on the slide would have gone in but for Pope's excellent clawing save that Burn slammed back into the net.

Johnson's delighted celebration as he ran back to the centre circle showed how much the goal, regardless of who put it in, meant to him. The former Nottingham Forest man will be well aware of the social media comments. He limited who can reply on his Instagram posts after the abuse began last season and it remains that way to this day.

Johnson was a constant threat in the second half to Newcastle and left-back Lloyd Kelly, who was walking a tightrope on a yellow card.

Postecoglou explained why he took off Pape Matar Sarr and replaced him with the winger at half-time.

"Only because Pape had been booked and part of his game, he just really gets stuck into the opposition, and on the flip side, Lloyd Kelly had been booked as well. So with Brennan coming on and running at them I just felt we'd run over the top of them in the second half," he said.

"I got that sense just before half-time and I thought if we can get the ball to our wide players we can cause them some problems and it did. It worked out that way, but we simply just didn't take advantage of it."

Johnson did what he was told. He got down the flank and pulled that ball across, time after time. One deflected and looped up and Wilson Odobert got in at the back post the ball struck his knee and cannoned up and over the crossbar.

Johnson had a big chance himself when he showed great feet in the Newcastle box to carve himself out some space, only to lift his shot over the bar with a rushed left-footed effort.

Then there was that ball across the six-yard box that was exactly as the Tottenham players have been drilled to do over and over in training every single day under Postecoglou. It was a perfectly hit ball but not a single Spurs attacker made the movement they should know by now as second instinct.

"I think we did play well and that's what causes the most frustration. It was a good performance in terms of dominating the game. It doesn't get much tougher to come and do that here," Johnson said after the game.

"At the end of the day though we've come away with nothing which is really disappointing because of the football we played, the chances we created. It's easy to say we deserved to score but we've got to be more clinical and have better decision-making. It really hurts to lose today."

He added "In terms of performance that's the only thing we can take now. We can't keep dwelling on these games where we haven't scored enough goals and we've lost. Of course we're going to think about it and ways we can stop them from scoring, but I think in terms of the performance, how dominant we were, especially in that second half for large parts that's all we can take going into the next game really.

"That [amount of shots] just shows how well we were playing. Most of them weren't even pot shots either. We were getting some really good opportunities. Pape had a couple from the edge of the box, maybe another couple of them were rushed, including mine on my left foot was definitely a bit rushed. It just shows the amount of chances we're creating and it hurts to say we only scored one goal today when we've got to score more than that."

There was a strange attacking moment in the second half when Spurs were awarded a free-kick in a dangerous position just outside the Newcastle box and neither Maddison nor Porro seemed to be able to decide which of them should take it.

The visitors' attacking set pieces up to that point had all mostly been clever and well-worked, many involved short passes to Son Heung-min, who had run into the box only to play a quick reverse ball to someone on the edge of the area.

With Porro and Maddison reaching a stalemate, Son bellowed over to the bench to get Postecoglou to make the strange unexpected decision which really could have been made on the pitch by the players or the captain, with Dragusin passing on the message. The Australian held up two fingers on one hand - not those ones - and three on the other, signifying Porro's shirt number only for the Spaniard to lift his effort just over the crossbar.

Of the other attackers, Son had moments of impact - he made three key passes - but also drifted out of the game at other stages. Odobert looked better on the left than he did on the right in the first half and is still looking for that final ball which will come with knowing his team-mates' movement better. He showed some exciting moments, including working space for one blocked shot before Sarr's first effort on goal.

Kulusevski was bright again, also providing three key passes, and like Son one dribble, and then the Swede also worked hard in midfield when he switched back there with two interceptions, two clearances and one tackle.

The key for all of Tottenham's attackers will be getting a striker in between them all.

football.london put it to the Spurs boss that it was a game that was crying out for a natural front man to feast on those balls into the six-yard box.

"Yeah, potentially, but I still think even outside of that we just had some really good opportunities, a little bit more composure," he said. "Fair play to Pope, I thought he had an outstanding game, but I thought we could have tested him a few more times with just some better decision-making.

"It's not just the opportunities we did create. I thought there was another probably six to 10 moments where we could have created even more opportunities. That's been a constant theme for us that we're trying to break through."

Postecoglou was asked whether he had instructed his team to attempt more shots from outside of the box.

"No, when an opposition defence stays deep, it's pretty hard to get in there," he said. "There were 10 bodies in there at times. Apart from Isak, everyone else was in there, but we worked our way into that area pretty well, but there were other times when we got even closer to goal in the box and obviously, like I said, we just lacked a little bit of composure, sometimes our positioning was off where we should have been with work and we let them off the hook.

Tottenham have games aplenty on the horizon after the international break and they will need to score goals aplenty. It's time to turn domination into obliteration.

A season in reverse

Back in pre-season this summer, football.london offered the theory that this campaign could provide the reverse experience to the previous one.

Last time out, Spurs started like a freight train under Postecoglou only to fade at times as injuries hammered a thin squad, to leave players starting games when they were not the perfect fit for the Australian's ways and then a lack of options to change those matches as they wore on.

Even those who were a better fit within the squad were still getting to grips with what the new manager was asking of them.

Now a year on and Postecoglou's squad knows his ways and has shed those who do not fit while adding newcomers that do, meaning there are now two players in - almost - every position who can do the job asked of them.

However, the reason we thought Tottenham might need to build towards more complete performances were firstly those pesky international tournaments in the summer that would leave Postecoglou without a string of key players until the season had almost begun and then they would be lacking in sharpness and fitness.

On top of that, injuries to Destiny Udogie and Richarlison would see them only starting playing football against in August after four months out. We did not foresee Tottenham's new striker Solanke having his ankle landed on by an opponent in his first match or Richarlison getting injured again. Perhaps we should have - this is Spurs after all.

All of that added to the fact that Tottenham might take a little while to hit their stride. The performances overall have actually been reasonably strong, only for poor decisions at both ends of the pitch to derail all of their good work in two games.

A couple of better decisions in front of goal and Spurs would be sitting on maximum points after three games with Manchester City and Liverpool. Instead they have a decidedly mixed bunch of one win, one draw and one defeat.

The international break brings with it a time to reflect for Postecoglou but no real time to work with his players, other than the handful who will not be away with their countries.

Other than the injured players in rehabilitation, James Maddison, Pedro Porro, Timo Werner and Djed Spence will be the only senior outfield players remaining at Hotspur Way, as will Rodrigo Bentancur thanks to his four-game international ban following his bottle-throwing moments at the Copa America.

Sergio Reguilon will be looking to sort a move away from Tottenham with various transfer windows still open, including ones in Portugal, Turkey and the Netherlands. The Saudi Pro League window closes on Monday.

Alfie Devine is a strong candidate for a late loan before those various windows shut, with the Polish transfer window also not discounted for the youngster who Tottenham made a late window decision on loaning out after many of his previously interested Championship clubs had moved on to other targets.

Yves Bissouma is back in the Mali squad so he will be away from Postecoglou's watchful eye. It's been noticeable that after the midfielder's very public indiscretions, his social media instead has been awash with good, old-fashioned, wholesome family photos, with his parents in town recently to watch him play.

Postecoglou will also use this fortnight to finalise his Premier League and Europa League squads.

He must enter his European squad first by 11pm on September 4 and the current numbers dictate that he will have to leave someone out, even if Reguilon departs. That could well be Fraser Forster if the Australian decides to hand the experienced keeper the carrot of Carabao Cup minutes and the club-trained Brandon Austin the Europa League time, otherwise it will have to be an outfield player who misses out.

Postecoglou must name his Premier League squad on September 13 but due to the more relaxed rules in that competition, he does not need to drop anyone. He could even include Reguilon in that squad if the Spaniard failed to agree a move away and he felt the need to.

Two days after that deadline comes the visit of Arsenal for the first North London Derby of the season.

Mikel Arteta's men will provide a fearsome foe, even without the suspended Declan Rice and injured new signing Mikel Merino.

Postecoglou could have Solanke and Van de Ven back for the derby and will be hoping for some training time with both in the days before if they are available.

A North London Derby brings with it a fork in the road. Put in an impressive performance with an impressive result and it could be the perfect kickstart for Tottenham's season. Struggle against the local rivals and the grumbles will grow around the start to the campaign and the mixed results.

Tottenham need a roaring stadium and a fully-firing team to do the business against the Gunners but for Postecoglou there are just under two weeks to get through first as he prays for no further injuries and instead plenty of good minutes to sharpen his players.

The start of the season has been strange. It has arguably brought more promise within the three performances than seen in much of the second half of the previous campaign, but also some of the old problems.

It is down to Postecoglou to fix that. He is the first Spurs head coach to last a full season in half a decade - an embarrassing fact for a club that has stuttered and stumbled through managers in recent years.

The Australian has undertaken the biggest rebuild seen at the club in decades and Tottenham know they need to back his changes because the alternative would be another big slice of the shambolic.
