WHAT HAPPENED?

Concerns over Gio Reyna's playing time with the U.S. national team are likely to grow after the midfielder was benched in Borussia Dortmund's scoreless draw against Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga.

Reyna has only played 10 minutes under new manager Nuri Sahin in Dortmund's opening three matches of the campaign, which has included two league matches and a cup contest.

Sahin chose Julian Brandt to start in the No. 10 role and made several attacking substitutions throughout the match, bringing on Karim Adeyemi, Donyell Malen, and Felix Nmecha, underscoring just how far down the pecking order Reyna has fallen.

The match ultimately ended as a 0-0 draw, with Dortmund surviving Nico Schlotterbeck's 73rd-minute dismissal for a second yellow card.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Reyna's lone appearance came in a brief cameo against Eintracht Frankfurt - a 2-0 win for BVB.

The American opted to stay at Borussia Dortmund this summer despite the apparent lack of opportunities. Reyna went out on loan to Nottingham Forest last season in search of more games, but he ultimately played just 230 Premier League minutes.

DID YOU KNOW?

Reyna has played fewer minutes combined from the 2021-22 season through now than he did in just his 2020-21 breakout campaign, when he played 1,983 minutes across 32 Bundesliga appearances.

WHAT NEXT FOR REYNA?

Following the match, players will depart for the international break. The USMNT will face Canada and New Zealand in their first two matches post-Copa America. There will be increased attention to see if Reyna will receive a call-up after his limited playing time to start the season.
