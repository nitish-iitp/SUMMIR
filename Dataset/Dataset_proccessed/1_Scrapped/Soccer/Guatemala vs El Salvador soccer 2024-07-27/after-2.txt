As a defensive standout on the Coral Shores High gridiron during his sophomore campaign, Connor Dixon broke onto the Monroe County football scene and continues to hold great expectations for the Hurricanes and coach Ed Holly entering his senior season, but his impact with Special Olympics extends far beyond any snap, as Monroe County Special Olympics Manager, Sports Training and Competition Director Ruth Coleman explained, Dixon has changed the culture of Special Olympics on the Upper Keys campus.

“He made Special Olympics cool,” said Coleman, noting Dixon has recruited more than 30 peers to volunteer at Special Olympic events. “He’s leaving a legacy that’s amazing.”
