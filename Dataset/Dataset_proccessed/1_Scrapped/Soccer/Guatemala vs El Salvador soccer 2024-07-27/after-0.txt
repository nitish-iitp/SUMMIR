Charles W. Casey III passed away peacefully at the age of 68 on July 27, 2024.

Born on August 6, 1955, in Würzburg, Germany, Charles was the son of Wendell and Virginia Casey. He grew up in Whittier, California, and graduated from La Serna High School in 1973. He subsequently enrolled at USC, departing his sophomore year to pursue a real-world education. He spent the next two years working as a surveyor for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline before traveling through Southeast Asia for a year. After his return, he relocated to Laguna Beach, California, where he worked as a landscaper.
