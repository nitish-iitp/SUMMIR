Ferrysburg voters will decide on nine City Charter amendments at the polls next month, following a tense 2023 election season that saw the removal of all City Council candidates from the ballot.

After reviewing the current City Charter earlier this year, Ferrysburg’s City Council approved placing the amendments before voters on the Nov. 5 ballot.
