The Atlas Lions will be keen to bounce back from their disappointing outing in the just concluded AFCON tournament when they face off against Zambia at the Grand Stade d'Agadir on Friday. The visitors were among the only sides Morocco could beat in the AFCON Championship, and we expect a repeat of such a performance here.

Morocco

FIFA Ranking: 12th


Last five games: DWLWD

The Atlas Lions are still ranked as the best team in Africa despite their dreadful outing at the AFCON. Morocco, who managed two wins in four games, failed to get past South Africa in the Round of 16. However, they have had a decent start to this campaign with a (0-2) victory over Tanzania away from home. They have played just one FIFA World Cup qualifying game due to their involvement in order competitions. 

Morocco are still one of the most consistent teams in Africa and will be poised to rewrite their mistakes here. Morocco are the favorite to win this encounter, but their recent games suggest it won’t be an easy ride. 

Zambia

FIFA Ranking: 87th


Last five matches: DDLLW

The Chipolopolo of Zambia head here with a disappointing outing in the recently concluded AFCON tournament. Zambia won just two points in their entire stay in the competition, scoring twice and conceding three goals. In this competition, Zambia have won once and lost a game. They began their journey with a (4-2) victory over Congo Republic but suffered a defeat on the road against Niger.

Avram Grant's men have now drawn three of their previous six games, and the last time they won was against Malawi in a friendly game. 

Expert Betting Tips

Over their last five meetings, Morocco have won three while Zambia have managed a win and a game ending in a stalemate. The Atlas Lions have not been at their best lately having scored twice over their last four matches. Morocco, who are the best team in the continental, are blessed with a wide range of skillful players, but teams have mastered their tactics. At the same time, Zambia are nowhere near what they used to be, with Patson Daka being their only stand-out player. 


Zambia won’t be able to match the attacking prowess of the Atlas Lions; considering the atmosphere in the stadium, we expect Morocco to win before the break for 1.95.

This game will produce more than two goals for 2.07.

Zambia won’t be able to penetrate the host's defense; bet on BTTS no for 1.57.

Good luck!
