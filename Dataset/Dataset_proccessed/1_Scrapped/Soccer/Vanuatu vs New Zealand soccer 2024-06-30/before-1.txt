MAMA na PAPA, PLIS UTLA KAM BACK
Story written by—Naso Caleb Kila 
"I ah; I lost my mother and father, along with my elder brother in a car accident, when I was 6 years old. I was then adopted by my father's eldest sister, Nancy. She's married to a man from another village and has four kids, two of them were in high school and the other two stayed in the village with their parents when I became part of their family. My name is Judah, but they loved to call me Judas, and make jokes about my name. I would cry to myself every night and never cease praying for liberation until I was finally given the love that existed in my mind for years" 
— Judah Davis. 
Three days earlier, after our usual morning breakfast of boiled kaukau and cabbage, with noodles. My father, with his deep tone of voice told me; "Judah, you'll be staying with Aunty Nancy for three days, just three days" I didn’t want to do that. I started crying to follow them. They went ahead, I follow behind as we walked down to the main road. "The truck was small, there were a lot of passengers traveling to town, I can't take you with me" My mom told me more than once. I was deaf and dumb to her words. 
I cried and ran down the hill to where the truck was waiting for them. I wanted to go with them to town. They were to return back after three days, so we could send my elder brother away, to another village where he will stay and go to school. He was to do grade 7. 
My father was very angry. He was already on the back of the truck and never cared when I'm crying. My mother finally called me and gave me K2. That was a lot for me to buy flour balls. So I stopped crying and returned back home. I was told to stay with my aunt for the period of time they will be away. 
I ran home happily for I had the money in my pocket. I stood on the top of the hill and waved back to my mother and father. I was among many other children whose parents were going to town. We stood and wave, shouting and screaming goodbyes in unison untill the truck left our little village and roared up the mountain and hide in the corner. 
That day, I played hide and seek with my friends till dusk and returned home. I was not supposed to do anything, my job was to play and eat, that's all. My parents told me they would return back after three days, so I waited on the same hill for the same truck to bring my Mama back to me. Earlier that day, I was in the river with all the other kids playing. We build the walls by the river bank and creat a pool out of the running water and play in that pool till the time I supposed my parents will be coming back. 
I waited till there were no sign of them and I returned back home. Very early in the morning, while I was still fast asleep; someone ran into the house and cried tenderly, hugging my aunt who was already beside the fireplace to cook the breakfast. I never knew why they were crying. I woke up and moved to the fireplace, trying to investigate why my aunt was crying.
They kept it from me. They never told me. But I sensed that something was wrong when I heard mumbling whispers. My aunt, while crying came and held me close to her arms and cried. I was lost and confused. In between her tears, she told me about the accident. That my parents were dead, including my brother were killed in a car crush on their way home. And their body were transported to Goroka General Hospital. 
The incident occurred at Kuru Mountain, at the border between Okapa and Henganofi District in Eastern Highlands Province. Some, those that jump off, sustain injuries and survived but the driver, my mother and father with my brother died. 
When my aunt mentioned it to me, I stood up and ran out of the house. I ran down the hill right into the coffee plantation. They couldn't find me in there. I continued right into the middle and lost my breath somewhere underneath the umbrella coffee tree . Resting my back against it, I cried and at the same time trying to catch my breath. My face was covered with spider webs, my head was drenched with morning dews. So as my feet, up to my knee for the grass was wet in the early hours of the morning. 
"Mama" I cried softly, that those who find me couldn't hear me. "Mama" was the only sound coming out of my mouth. I couldn't believe what I heard. I don't want it to be true. I cried in isolation till all my strength was gone and I went off to sleep under the coffee tree. The day was dull and it was cold out there. My body was numb to anything. I couldn't feel, my mind had gone and I slept there as a cherry coffee bag abandoned  by the plantation workers. 
My aunt, along with others couldn't find me. They relentlessly searched for me in all the places they thought I could be found. They came into the coffee plantation but couldn't locate me either, I was sleeping right in the middle of the plantation. Inside was thick shade and most parts are dark, under coffee tree that look like an umbrella.
I slept there till the sun goes down and the moon and stars finally appeared at the night skies. I was still there till I felt the coldness of early dawn. I woke up and realized that my arms and feet were frizzy and cold as ice and turned white. My consciousness returned and I knew my parents were dead. And I started to cry again. 
It's common in the village to believe in spiritualism. So when they couldn't find me easily, they thought I was taken away by some wild spirits and all the communities came together and searched for me. I came out of the plantation on the next day. The "house cry" was already set up. There were a lot of people. Many came and expressed their deep sorrows on me over the loss of my parents. I couldn't cry anymore. I sat there and never ate anything. I just watched what they were doing. 
Few days later, the white land chrusher, followed by two ambulance from the district hospital arrived from town, with the red laplap tied all over the body. I witnessed how they removed three bodies from those vehicles out, and carried them into the "House Cry" I knew how they laid them down into their graves. I remember attempting hundred times to go down alive with them. There's no reason for me to be alive when all my families were called to their eternal home so early.  
I watched as they spread out the black and blue canvas on top before they started covered them with red soil. I sat there, without tears in my eyes. I knew how they build their shelter and threw flowers on top of their graves. And everyone finally deserted the place and returned back to their houses. Many returned to the house cry. 
"I was there when my Mama, Papa, and Brother were buried" 
The pain was unbearable. I know how it feels, it hurts very poorly. 
Everything has settled down and everyone returned back to their villages and communities. I was alone with my aunt. They opened our house, all our cooking utensils, clothes, bedding and other accessories were taken. I was left with the clothes I had on. I couldn't fake my lifestyle, I was like an open book for the community to read. I didn't ask for it, it was given to me by life, the nickname "Opharn".
"You're going to live with your aunt for three days" has turned into many years under harsh circumstances. Life is not only fragile but hash and cruel. 
I love my aunt and called her Mama. She was my mother. The only difference was, she never treated me like one. I'm loving and forgiving, I never hold her accountable for the pain she put me through and forced my feet six year old feet to walk on hot coals of life. 
We were kids, 6 to 10 year old kids. We do the same things. We play together, we laugh, we eat, we do all the things a kid of our age could do, but when we returned home in the evening, I was treated like a 20 year old child. I would fetched all the water bottles, peeled the kaukau, collect all the firewood from outside into the house. I never hate it, but what hurts is when my playmates never helped me. I couldn't complain to their mother, or father. I do it willing in total submission, whole-heartedly. 
As time goes on, I no longer feel comfortable living with them. I don't go out to play, as I usually do, with my friends not because they stopped me, but because I don't have the time to do so. I always had something to do. I was always tasked to anything they think I could. 
They burry my whole world with my Mama, Papa, and my brother. My brother loved me, I knew it. When I fell down, he would lift me up by the hand. When I'm hungry, my Mama never failed to fill my tummy. When I'm hurt and broken, or hungry; I always ran to their graveyard, spread out my arms and cried. I couldn't help myself, I needed my family back. 
I started going to school when I'm 12 years old. I was already a big boy then. I would have to walk past three villages before reaching the elementary school. I would wake up in the middle of the night with my aunt to cook breakfast for everyone; and left for school very early in the morning. It became my normal routine. It became part of me. This is me, a boy who run to school in the breaking of the day. 
I did well and continued to Arati Primary School.  I tried to be friendly with everyone at school. I never told another soul about my life. For I understood that everyone of us has our own battles. I never ask anyone for help. I don't want to be needy and so I purposed in my heart to be content  with the little that I have. 
The responsibilities were there, at home waiting for me to finish class and come home. I would threw my school bag, a string bilum in that case, and started helping my aunt in cooking, doing dishes, before I could study and rest for the night. 
I didn't know why they never loved me, as their own child. I'm not concerned about her husband but my aunt was dad's eldest sister, she never treated me like her own. 
I'm such a mess, terribly ugly and never had a family to call my own. My world did not only crushed, but became dark and unbearable. 
At 8th grade, I met Mrs Jones. She's my math teacher from Simbu. She's one of those beautiful soul that you don't often see. She camouflaged with all the others but her love can possibly melt mountains into the sea. I have no knowledge of how she came to know my story but she approached me and invited me for lunch at her home. From time to time, every lunch, I would eat at her home with her family. Then one day she got up and told to that I should ask my aunt, to let her take me to her home province, in Simbu, where I will go to high school.
My aunt has a lot of kids to worry about, and when I brought the matter to her attention, she showed no attention and interest.
 At the end of the year, I left my home, my district, my province behind and went with Mrs Jones to Simbu. Where I call Chuave my new home. 
(This year, Judah is doing his 9th grade at Yawe Moses Secondary School in Simbu Province)
               The Cry
   "Give Me a Chance to Breath"
Has been heard many miles away,
I'm just a child with so many dreams,
An innocent star who just wanna shine,
A child in my mothers arms 
A child in my father's love,
I'm an adopted child who knows not how,
And why I must continue to live.
Yes this is it! 
Every child should be treated,
Just the same, that I know.
But
It's too early to say yes,
And accept what you don't wanna know.
It's not my fault, Mummy! 
To be here in this abusive home,
It's not my fault, Daddy!
To be here in this freaky room!
A home,
Where every abusive words are mine.
A home 
Where every chores is my responsibilities.
A home 
Where everyone become my enemies.
A home 
Where the food is served selfishly.
I don't wanna live here no more;
I'm just a child.
A kid in my mother's arms and father's love,
I'm just a star who just wanna shine, 
Now please let me walk away,
Let me give myself a chance,
A chance to be and feel free,
I don't want to be here no more, 
A heavy burden laid on to a child,
Like me is so much more.
I'm hurt inside,
Let me save myself,
Should I stay and ask for more?
Should I stay and keep torturing myself apart?
No! Please let me walk away and save myself 
Tell it to the stars,
Let the blue deep ocean knows,
That I'm coming home to save myself, 
And give myself a chance, 
A chance to be Loved!
Just like a child, 
A child in my mothers arms, 
A child in my father's Love.
