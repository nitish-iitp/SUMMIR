Liberia's experienced goalkeeper, Tommy Songo, has suffered a setback ahead of the first leg of the 2025 Preliminary AFCON Qualifiers against Djibouti. The seasoned shot-stopper, initially set for a starting role, has been sidelined due to injury.

Lonestar's Head Coach, Mario Marinica, now faces a pivotal decision in selecting a replacement between Emmanuel Deanneh and Abdulai Koulibaly to fill the void left by Songo's absence. The selection of the goalkeeper for this crucial fixture is poised to have a significant impact on Liberia's performance as they kick off their campaign in the qualifiers.
