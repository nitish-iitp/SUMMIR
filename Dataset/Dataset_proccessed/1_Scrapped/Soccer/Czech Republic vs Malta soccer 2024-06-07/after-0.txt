Czechia thump Malta 7-1 in Euro 2024 warm-up
ByReuters
Updated: Jun 7, 2024, 05:43 pm

Czechia cruised past an overmatched Malta side 7-1 in their Euro 2024 warm-up match on Friday with Slavia Prague forward Mojmír Chytil scoring in each half for a team aiming to book a second straight quarter-final appearance.

Czechia coach Ivan Hasek rested a number of key figures at the match in Grodig, Austria -- including West Ham United midfielder Tomás Soucek and Bayer Leverkusen forward Patrik Schick -- and instead blooded a number of less experienced players.

Fiorentina's Antonín Barák opened the scoring for the Czechs in the sixth minute from the penalty spot before Chytil grabbed his first goal just before the break. David Jurasek, Ondrej Lingr, Matej Jurásek and Vaclav Cerny added to the Czechia tally while Paul Mbong pulled a goal back for Malta.

The Czechs kick off their Euro 2024 campaign on June 17 against Portugal in Leipzig before facing Turkey and Georgia in Group F. Czechia play North Macedonia on Monday in their final preparation match for the tournament in Germany.
