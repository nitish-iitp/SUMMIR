The two sides meet on Tuesday.

Kyrgyzstan host Chinese Taipei at the Dolen Omurzakov Stadium in Bishkek on Tuesday (March 26) for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, looking to complete the double.

The White Falcons beat Chinese Taipei 2-0 on Friday, courtesy of second-half goals from Valery Kichin, who struck a penalty, and Kai Merk.

It was their second win in three games in the second round of the qualifiers, as Kyrgyzstan climbed to second with six points. Interestingly, Oman and Malaysia have also accrued six points but are separated by goal difference.

Chinese Taipei remain rooted at the foot of the table without a single point, having lost all three of their qualifiers in the round. They've also drawn a blank each time, an unwanted distinction shared only with Nepal.

Ranked 153rd in the world, the Blue Wings aren't a formidable outfit, lacking in serious quality in almost every department. They've not qualified for a major international tournament since 1968.

Meanwhile, Kyrgyzstan are hoping to make their maiden appearance at the FIFA World Cup, especially as the tournament is expanded to 48 teams from the next edition.
