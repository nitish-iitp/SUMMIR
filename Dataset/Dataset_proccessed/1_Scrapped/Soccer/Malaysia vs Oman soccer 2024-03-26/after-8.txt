Left-back said to be struggling mentally
Ten Hag short of options in his position
WHAT HAPPENED?

The Dutch left-back has not featured for United this season, with his last appearance for the club coming 10 months ago in a 2-1 win over Fulham on the final day of the 2022-23 campaign, and it has been reported that he is struggling with his physical and mental wellbeing. The Red Devils have yet to offer a full explanation for his absence, but Fabrizio Romano says Malacia's situation is a difficult one.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Malacia's absence has left Erik ten Hag short of options on that side of the defence, with Luke Shaw also being sidelined through injury for more of the campaign. It has been reported that the Old Trafford club may look to sign a new left-back in case Malacia's condition remains an issue.

WHAT ROMANO SAID

Transfer guru Romano said on The United Stand: "It's a really complicated moment for the boy. He's really struggling. I think Manchester United will make some clarity in the next weeks or months to clarify what's happening."

WHAT NEXT FOR MALACIA?

Ten Hag recently insisted that the Netherlands international is back in training and that the 24-year-old "will fight" to get his place in the starting XI, but does not expect him to return to competitive action this season. United take on Brentford in their next Premier League match on March 30.
