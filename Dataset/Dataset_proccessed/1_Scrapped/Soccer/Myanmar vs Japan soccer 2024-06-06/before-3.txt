If AS Monaco has already finished its season a few weeks ago, 13 players in the squad are ready for internatinonal duty. They have in their sights the Euros, the Copa America and even the Olympic Games. Here's their schedule in detail.

It’s not yet vacation time for everyone. If the Principality club finished the season well, in second place, synonymous with a return to the Champions League, certain players from the squad have been called to represent their countries. This is indeed the case for 13 of them, starting with Youssouf Fofana.

Euros and Copa America ahead

The midfielder, who ended the season in top form with AS Monaco, is included in the squad for the French team to play in Euro 2024, from June 14 to July 14. Just like Breel Embolo and Denis Zakaria, who have been selected  with Switzerland. On the other side of the globe, in the United States, Folarin Balogun and Guillermo Maripán will participate in the Copa America, from June 20 to July 14.

The Olympics on the horizon

Maghnes Akliouche also has a good chance of being present in an international competition: the Olympic Games. The midfielder from the Academy is in fact in the pre-selected list of the French U23s to play in three preparation matches. As for Mohammed Salisu with Ghana, Eliesse Ben Seghir with Morocco, Wilfried Singo with Ivory Coast and Takumi Minamino with Japan, all will be in the running for the 2026 World Cup qualifiers.

The Tournoi Maurice-Revello to start

Finally, let’s head to the youth competitions where Yann Lienard, called in as reinforcement, and Kassoum Ouattara are currently participating in the Tournoi Maurice-Revello with the French U20s. A goal for them: to imitate Maghnes Akliouche, winner two years ago with Les Bleuets, or Eliesse Ben Seghir, voted best player last year.
