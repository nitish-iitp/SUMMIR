Industrial Automation Safety Measures and Best Practices


With the changes brought about by industrial automation and innovation, it is critical for organizations to improve and adopt safety measures and strategies that effectively target potential risks and hazards with automated systems. With that, here is a comprehensive guide on key safety measures and best practices that help protect employees in industrial automation settings.

Light Curtains and Area Scanners


Light curtains are photoelectric transmitters that create a 'curtain' of light beams across an area. If the beam is interrupted, it signals the machine to stop. Area scanners use lasers to detect presence and movement in three dimensions. These devices are commonly used around dangerous machinery or in areas where robot operation takes place to prevent unintended access. They are crucial for areas where human interaction with automated processes might occur, stopping machines immediately when a breach is detected.


Pressure-Sensitive Safety Mats


These mats are designed to detect weight or pressure. When stepped on, they send a signal that can halt machine operation. Safety mats are placed around hazardous areas, such as near presses or robotic cells, providing an additional layer of safety for personnel that might accidentally step into a dangerous zone.


Emergency Stops


Emergency stop buttons are a critical safety feature that allows any worker to shut down machinery immediately in case of danger. These should be accessible throughout the facility, particularly in locations where workers interact closely with machinery. They must be clearly marked and regularly tested to ensure functionality.


Robot Safety


Robotic operations introduce specific risks due to their power and range of motion. Ensuring robot safety involves implementing comprehensive safety protocols and physical barriers. Robots should be enclosed in cages with locked access doors, equipped with sensors that halt operation if a human enters the vicinity. Routine safety audits and staff training are also essential.


Dual-Check Safety (DCS)


Dual-check safety is a control system feature that uses redundant monitoring and control mechanisms to ensure safety. It requires two separate and independent confirmations before an action can proceed. DCS is particularly useful in applications where single errors could lead to serious accidents, such as in material handling or complex robotic movements. This system minimizes the risk of accidents due to control failures.


Safety in PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers)


PLCs can be programmed to include safety functions, ensuring that operations halt under hazardous conditions. Safety-integrated PLCs monitor and control automated processes, checking continuously for signs of faults or unsafe conditions. These PLCs are essential in environments where a failure could endanger lives, adjusting operations automatically in response to real-time data to prevent accidents.
