Hey everyone. I am ready to buy my first suppressor. Going to be using this solely on my 20” AR in 6MM ARC.

I have saved up enough to buy a OCL Polonium suppressor right now, and get this waiting period going.

Polonium: $549.99
Tax stamp: $200
Shipping $35
Tax: $42
Total: $826ish 

My question is though, before I buy this, is there anything else out there suppressor wise that’s worth saving up a little more money for, or even considering over the OCL Polonium? I don’t see my self buying another suppressor anytime soon after I buy this one. I think the Polonium sounds good on 5.56 based on what others say, not sure about 6MM arc. It’s really affordable (Well kinda) durability lasting me years, and noise reduction, are my main concerns. I guess I’m posting this just for reassurance. Suppressors are expensive. And I can only afford one every once in blue moon lol. I have put this purchase off long enough as it is. I really don’t even know what I like/want in a suppressor since I have such limited experience with them. I have never even shot a suppressed rifle before.

Planning to order through Capitol Armory.

Thanks everyone. Am I making a good move here?

They're gassy but sound decent. Awesome for the money. My recce 5k and 7 are both way less gassy and sound more pleasant to me. OCL appears to have a sharper pop, maybe just from the port.

I have its little brother, the Polonium K. I’ve shot it on 11.5, 12.5, 14.5, 16, and 18” rifles (the last being a 6 ARC). It’s an excellent suppressor that can take a beating. Having said that, the K is a mid backpressure can, and the full size is supposed to be a high backpressure can. If you can tune your rifle for it, you’ll have no issues. The Recce 5K is another great can, too.

Thanks for all of the help everyone! I ordered the standard length Otter Creek Labs Polonium 5.56 can!!! I finally did it. So far Capitol Armory seems great! I will be submitting electronically and as a form 4 individual.

I’m looking in to hubs and QD muzzle devices now  I guess I gotta spend a little more to really get this thing setup right. 

@Bluedog82 Could you possibly help me understand if running a Flash hider, compensator, or brake within a suppressor simultaneously have any impact on the suppressor’s actual sound performance? I cannot seem to find this answer on the internet.

Congrats! Welcome to the obsession. My Polonium has been doing hard time for 120 days so far. Waiting on that damn parole hearing is BS.

Who did you buy yours from? And did you do a trust or individual? I’m hoping mine goes through quick. I have an appointment money for some digitized finger prints  I’m not quite even at the waiting stage yet.

I bought mine from silencershop. It's a two RP trust so I'm expecting it to take forever because the ATF sucks. I've been hearing about a lot of individual purchaes being approved in 48'ish hours though.

I ordered a polonium through SilencerShop over a month ago, still on back order. Called a couple days ago and was told another six to eight weeks to fill the backlog.

Wow that’s very unfortunate, hopefully they come thru soon for you. I ordered from Capitol Armory which shows in-stock, after ordering I received my S/N for my suppressor on the receipt via email next day. Really not sure why silencershop would still be back order.

Just an update. ATF Finger prints done at a print scan kiosk, and digital eft file already uploaded to Capitol Armory. 

The prints did cost $65 bucks, if you want to go with the kiosk/digital eft route. This is easier and faster than doing this your self with those paper/ink print kits and then snail mailing it in. The trade-off is $65 extra dollars.

I’ll keep this thread updated as the progress continues. This is my first ever suppressor purchase. So I don't really know what to expect.

no experience with the polonium cans but I've bought all my cans through Capitol Armory. They make the process super easy. Even when I find other cans at different dealers, I always have them go to CA for the ease of use. No complaints whatsoever.

Yeah they are the #1 suppressor dealer in the country. And I didn’t even realize that.

@AndrewKing Any idea when the Poloniums will be back in stock? I ordered through Silencer Shop on 5/9.

Wow that’s crazy. I don’t know why they are even out of stock. When Capitol Armory always has them in stock.

Convenience and also cost. Near me the local shops charge a $125 transfer fee for anything not going through it. Which effectively kills off deals from most other regular online stores.

About 85% of everyone here said the same thing.

I think I'm up to #8 or #9 so far.

I was planning on just buying the Huxwrx Ventum 762 but ended up throwing in a Flow 6K Ti as well, figured it would be a good place to start.

Picked up my HuxWrx Ventum last week, and this by far is now my new favorite SBR in the Stable.

Larue 5.56 OBR Receiver Set, Craddock 14.7" 6ARC RTR barrel with intermediate gas length, SA AGB, and JP H3 SCS.

The barrel definitely preferred the 105gr - 108gr Hornady Box Ammo with its 1-7 Twist. I got in 500 pieces of Starline 6ARC Brass so I'll start load development here soon focusing on the 108 ELDs.

Not a fan of P&W Muzzle devises.

It will eventually be a 13.7", just waiting for my Bartlein blank to come in, with the 6ARC I'm trying to fi d the sweet spot length/MZ.

If I want to change barrel length, all I have to do is email the ATF informing them of the change. No extra cost, just a little paperwork.

I don't own one simply because so far I've refused to fill out anything, send in a finger print, along with $200 for permission to own a tube of metal baffles.

Mother Fuck the ATF and the NFA

The whole point of the NFA was to discourage folks from owning these kinds of things so..... I guess you're showing them by doing exactly what they want.

Well as of last week when I called and spoke with ATF Compliance, they stated you do. So if I have to go through the anguish of writing a 30 second email to cover my ass so be it, no skin off my nose.

I believe it’s “recommended” but not actually required by law.

You must be getting ready to buy one, in your last post you mentioned you would definitely be running a can.

Polo is an awesome can, you’ll love it. Gassy is subjective. Just tune your rifle accordingly, and you’ll be fine. Tone is awesome & built like a tank, but still light…

Sort of like “you need to alert us if you’re traveling out of state with your can… It’s not legally required and you really only just need a copy of your tax stamp, but we’re nosy as fuck, so you should tell us…”
