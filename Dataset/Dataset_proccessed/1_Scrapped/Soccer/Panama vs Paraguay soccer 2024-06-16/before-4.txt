I have been a loyal long time customer of Surgeon.. Just a heads up to the community. Surgeon is no longer selling actions to the public again. Sad to see them go!

Looks like they left PHX too.

I was always a fan of Surgeon. They did a lot of neat things 20 years ago.

I'm pretty sure that the company has sold at least two times now. I have a Prague, OK made 1086. Not sure I'd buy anything made recently, but the original dudes who were with them 1-2 decades ago still make fantastic stuff in Oklahoma (Impact, Stuteville Precision, Stewart Rifles).

I'm probably way off, but IMO they've been bought and sold by several capital investment individuals/companies in hopes to make a profit. We've seen this before with many big names.

The old school stuff is still pretty damn awesome.

Are they no longer owned by Strategic Armory Corps (owners of McMillan, Armalite, etc.) or is it more of a "we wanna sell complete rifles only" type of deal.

I was told from Surgeon that all actions are to be kept for Surgeon Scalpel builds. In house production guns only. They will no longer support the shooting community for custom builds.

ohhh

I wonder if they have a pile of “phoenix az” branded actions and are just waiting for their “College Station TX” branded actions.


I’ll buy another when/if they get whatever this is sorted out. Till then I’ll buy more ammo.

Kind of shitty news. I'd love to buy the company Surgeon, tweak the lineup a bit and fix their miserable marketing. They were at the forefront for a while and then got left behind. I've had a few surgeon actions and they're probably my favorite 700 style action, behind the tempest maybe.

I always wanted an old school scalpel in that mcmillan sand camo stock. Was waiting on one to pop up for sale for a while and got tired of waiting so I'm putting a similar one together in 223rem. Alex Wheeler barrel, surgeon dbm, TT diamond, my first attempt at bedding - pretty happy with it, couple small mistakes I won't make next time. Need to get it all cerakoted FDE and it should be done! Interesting that this rifle may be one of the last custom builds using a surgeon action.

Agree unless they make "improvements" that lessen the quality or usefulness...............am really getting tired of the disposable china shit mindset that keeps infiltrating all manufacturing.

Armalite and McMillan rifles are owned by the same guy also. Most all the parts for Surgeons, McMillans and Armalite made in the same shop.

Surgeons never die they just get better with age. There will always be parts and maybe there will be more actions. Impact is just a knockoff of Surgeon with a new flavor every week. New bolts with different lift. Actions riddled with machine work, and titanium, which did not last long. New gimmicks to excite the PRS crowd into a buying frenzy and gulping large quantities of cool-aid. As Robert Gradous used to say, there is a lot of sexual fantasizing going on for ones satisfaction. A good shooter with an old out-dated Surgeon will probably hand someone their ass on a platter!

Most actions these days are just very small variations of a pushfeed R700. There's not a lot of ingenuity in this space, outside of the odd action maker like ARC.

I wouldn't call a Surgeon "outdated". I fail to see what Impact does (since this is the common comparison) that a Surgeon (or most any other pushfeed R700 clone) doesn't.

Surgeons marketing sucks. As a company, they failed to retain market space when newer action makers came in. There's certainly ample things you can pick on Surgeon for, in regards to how they operate as a company. However, I don't really see the argument that a Surgeon action is somehow antiquated and "outdated" compared to modern R700 clones.

Pre-fits is where Surgeon went wrong and lost market share.

$1300 for a 591 and then you need to get it coated. Lots of good actions around that price with nitride/DLC already done ready for a pre-fit. IMO, the quickness someone can assemble a "custom rifle" (impact/pre-fit barrel/chassis) and go shoot 1/2moa killed surgeon as an option for a lot of people. Dasher not feeding well? Have a creedmoor at your doorstep in 3 days.

I still love them and maybe they've still been selling well but it's not hard to see why a lot of people would look elsewhere.
