Hello,
So I started shooting .22LR about 9 months ago, after many years of CF. I purchased a Tikka T1x with 16.5" barrel. I'm using mostly moderate priced target ammo(ex. SK match, Standard, Semi-Auto, Eley Target, subsonic, etc). I shoot only at 100 yards and the Tikka on calm days is a .75-1.25" shooter (add 0.5 on 4-8mph days). I want to step up my game and shoot out to 400. I'm considering a Vudoo V22 vs. Anschutz 1710 vs. Anschutz 54:18 with MDT stock vs. Tikka T1x action with premium barrel. These 4 range in price from about 1500 to over 3400. Like I said, goal is 400, not BR or PRS. Any opinion or advice would be welcomed, thanks.

I will preface my comments that I am not a Vudoo shooter. I have owned multiple Anschutz models over the years. I am currently shooting 2 54:18s and a 1727F/AI rig. there are difference between the 1710 and the 54:18 that are important. The 54:18 is built off the 54 match rifle and has a match level trigger (far supierior). The 1710 is part of the sporter series. I have also heard great things about the 1761 series. The vodoo gives you a greater selection of barrels, Triggers and stocks being a Rem 700 clone. The Annies are more of a set menu, Yes you can get it re-barreled after sale (I got a great one done by Anshutz NA.

All I can tell you is that I futzed around with different actions, barrels, and chassis, and I never got a single one to consistently shoot through the center of the target @ 50 yards trying every kind of expensive ammo there was. Super frustrating at a match when you know your hold and POA was perfect yet it's a miss. I bought my Vudoo from Altus as an in-stock, already-built gun in an MPA Matrix, threw some SK Match in the mag, and boom. My zero targets rarely have more than one hole, and I'm very near the podium at the monthly NRL22 match. Now I know that if I miss it's a miss.

The guys shooting the RimX have similar results. I looked at the Anschutz, but I wanted something more like my PRS comp guns.

My advice is wait till you have the money and then put the one you want together, and I am certain you will not be disapointed. I just wish I had saved all that money I spent chasing it.

1710 has a match trigger option my Kelby stocked one has it but still not the 54 trigger. The begara actually shoots really well also imho. I think about selling my 1710 sometimes because I don’t use it enough since I’m back in an Elr phase if it was a vudoo it have more appeal so there that as well. If you cf is acis there that as a size crossover mag wise. I ran czs before that and they run well also but it was heavily modified with nothing really left of the original rifle.
I think if it did it all over again and it wasn’t a fortner it be a vudoo tbh

Agree with Fig, if you are serious about shooting, you will never be happy without building one the way you want it. I no longer shoot anywhere near competitively due to some physical issues, but I love accurate rifles and my 1727/AI is wonderfully accurate and "cool"(at least to me ), it how ever really heavy and more set up for NRL or PRS.

I own an Annie 1761 MPR and 3 1/2 Vudoo's (second single shot now being built). I keep the Annie around because I have an affinity for blue steel and wood but I shoot the Vudoo's.

I'll preface my comments that I am a Vudoo shooter and have been since their beginning in 2017. I am still shooting my original V22 serial number 10 and it's great. I did get it rebarreled a little over a year or so ago with a 1.2" Bartlein barrel. Being able to use any of my 700 foot print stocks/chassis and triggers is a huge advantage.

OP where do you shoot near Garner?

Do not build out your T1X. I’ve got 3 1/2 yrs and 10’s of K through mine. My savage MKII feeds better that my Tikka with an aftermarket barrel.

I was thinking of keeping my current one and buying another one to build but leaning as option 4. Today was a rather calm day and I shot 11 different ammo types...4 groups sub MOA (best .47) and worst was (ug) 2.9. It's solid!

Well I know where you shoot then. LOL I went out yesterday and again more wind like the last time I was out. Fine for the centerfire but not for testing rimfire ammo.

Seems like a large investment for a “broad” goal of 400? Call me crazy, but if I’m going to dump that kind of change into a 22, my goal would be more than shoot 400. I can shoot 400 with my current CZ457 setup.

Anschutz 1727F Match-AT-X, RimX-AT-X, RimX McMillan M40A1, Winchester 52C
Annie is the "new" rifle, RimX's Bartlien Barrels spun up by TS Customs and the Winchester 52. Right now the Anschutz is the new fascination. Son in-law shoots a Vudoo in a AT-X. I practice with and shoot all 4 in NRL22 and PRS Rimfire matches. Can't go wrong with any of them.

I have a Vudoo and I have an Annie that is very similar to a 54.18, Accuracy wise they both shoot excellent. At 50
yards both have shot groups under .25, the difference is insetting the magazine into the rifle.

The Annie you have to pay attention to get the mag positioned correctly to insert it into the stock
where the Vudoo is almost stupid proof.

It may work out great for you. Mine shoots well, but I forget how rough the feeding is until I run the Savage.

you can step up your game by shooting your tikka out to 400yds. I do it with my T1X. I have shot out to 500yds with the Tikka. I moved to SC and only have 300yds now. I shoot twice a week at 200yds and 300yds. I set up 12" gongs for sighter at 200 and 300yds. 200yds i have 4" 3" 2" and a 1" gongs. At 300yds I have 8" 6" 4" and 3".
I have a T1X, CZ 455, Kidd Supergrade and 2 Bergara B14R with EC V2 tuners, all of them can run this course, but the B14R are the most accurate. My B14R's can run with the Vudoo's I have done it.

If you have the money go with the Vudoo. The 700 foot print is the way to go. The B14R are a 700 foot print also.

Long range shooting is not as much about the gun, but is all about the ammo! Try better ammo in your gun first. all of my gun like SK Long Range for matches. Eley Contact for everyday shooting.

I have owned and sold two Vudoos. I have 10k rounds through my first RimX, and have a second that is getting broken in. The RimX magazine works very well, and I prefer the feel of the action over the vudoos.

I have a 1710 in the MDT chassis (check the px). The trigger is incredible. The insertion of the magazine can take a lot of practice to do quickly on the clock. And the bolt requires a cadence to operate and not induce a misfeed. I can run the bolt on my RimX almost as fast as I can possibly imagine, with no issue. If I do that with the Annie, I have a feeding issue 1-2 rounds out of 10. Operating it at a moderate pace , with very deliberate movements, and it feeds perfect - all ammo types too. It is a nice rifle , turns heads, and accuracy wise is a beast. But the operational differences to me drive me to stick with RimX.

Just out of curiosity, what is your current set up? Sitting atop my Tikka is a late 1980s B&L Bavlar 6-24 with 1/2" dot so any "distance" work is counting clicks...I guess another scope may be on the horizon...

I’m running a 16 inch 457 in a manners, Area 419 30 moa rail, badger rings, Bushnell LRTSi scope. It takes me 19.83 mils to reach 400, iffin I remember correctly I am dialing 15 and holding 4/5 for targets at 400. I don’t shoot 400 much, mostly 168 and in cause it’s available in the backyard for me. When I was going to The Range Complex in Autryville, I would always take the CZ to play with.

Thats scope will handicap you some, but it’s a work around. I shoot an old Japanese Weaver V16 with a crappy reticle on top of my 223 bolt gun. I have ran it to 600 yards, granted not the same comparison, but a crappy reticle will hold you back some but not completely.

I surely wouldn't buy a sporter Anschutz for 400yard shooting, 1710 will find things uncomfy after a spell. I have a 1416 Annie, and Weatherby Annie, both 64's that shoot to 400 remarkably well with my selection of ammo, but failure to eject will rule the day.
Get a Rem 700 footprint action and customize your platform, and thank yourself for not trying to put rds into a 1950's style 5rd magazine.
I had a Vudoo from Altus, as an above poster, very accurate and smooth operating system, yet I couldn't warm up to it. I sold it, and am revisiting that plan, but I have 3 Rim X's, and like for the fact they feel too much like my Impact 737 CF rifles.
Add Rim X to your thought plan, I have custom chambers, and prefits, and of course will put more effort into a custom chamber job, but to date, the most accurate barrel for one I have owned and shot was a 20" Proof carbon prefit. Though, I'd take a custom job over a prefit, just because I can control the input, weight, length, etc...
I know that certain reamers, for specific games, can help, at the end of the day, the bullet you are chambering will be .001 minimum over barrel diameter, you are crushing the power band just by chambering the round. More to it than this, but heck, we are trying to do neat things with a primitive design.
In the end, you are at the mercy of the ammo you buy to meet your certain expectations.

OP, I own a first-gen Vudoo and a Rim-X I built in late 2022. After competing at one level or another with both of them all last year, I find myself favoring my Vudoo.

Why?

Well, I like chocolate ice cream better than vanilla. I like both. But I like chocolate better. It's a preference, pure and simple. No other reason. Both are superbly accurate. The do feel a bit different to run, in no small part because they're in different chassis and the Rim-X has a much heavier barrel contour (22" Shilen Heavy Varmint compared to the Vudoo's 22" Bartlein MTU).

I will say one thing in the Rim-X's favor right up front: it feeds smoother than the Vudoo. Period. The Vudoo is in an MPA BA Comp chassis; the Rim-X is in an MDT ACC Premier. I don't think the chassis have anything to do with the smoothness of feeding; the two platforms simply have different design philosophies.

As others have written here, buying into the Vudoo or Rim-X ecosystems puts you into the huge world of R700 clones (as does a Bergara B14, but that's at a different level). Go Anschutz, and you go pretty much all in with Anschutz. They're amazing rifles... BUT:

If You buy a Vudoo or a Rim-X and decide it's not for you, resale would be pretty quick. Anschutz? I' not so sure (and honestly for all I know there's as much demand for a used Anschutz as a used Vudoo or Rim-X.

If you live near Garner NC, @Rob01 and I can put you behind multiple Vudoos and at least one RimX to try out... and my Rim-X is getting lonely.

Update: I'm going to start shooting some N50 Benchrest and the Annie is in a different class than the Vudoo so I'm going to take it out to the range and see how it shoots and maybe compete with the 1761.
