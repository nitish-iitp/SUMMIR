AFCON qualifiers: Minteh salvages point for Gambia against Madagascar

Oct 14, 2024, 11:49 AM | Article By: Lamin Darboe

Wing wizard Yankuba Minteh has salvaged a point for The Gambia against Madagascar in their crucial 2025 Total Energies Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.

The Scorpions came from one nil down to draw 1-1 with Madagascar in their continent’s biennial biggest football showpiece qualifier match played in Morocco on Friday.

The Gambia and Madagascar both came into the match with a point after drawing with Comoros Islands in their previous qualifier matches.

The duo required the maximum points to keep their dreams of qualifying for the 2025 Total Energies Africa Cup of Nations.

  Clement Couturier gave Madagascar the lead before half time from a stunning strike.

The Gambia reacted quickly for an equaliser but to no avail thus the first half ended 1-0 in favour of Madagascar.

Upon resumption of the match, The Gambia knew that a defeat against Madagascar would dashed their chances of qualifying for the 2025 Total Energies Africa Cup of Nations.

The Scorpions regrouped themselves and piled heavy pressure on Madagascar defence line, creating goal scoring opportunities.

Wing wizard Yankuba Minteh levelled matter for The Gambia in the stoppage time to earn the Scorpions a point against Madagascar in their continent’s biennial biggest football fiesta qualifiers.

The Gambia and Madagascar now secured 2 points each after three group matches.

The Scorpions will play against Madagascar in their fourth qualifier match today, Monday, 14th October 2024 in Morocco at 2pm.
