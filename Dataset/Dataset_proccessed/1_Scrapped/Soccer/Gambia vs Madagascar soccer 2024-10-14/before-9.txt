PDOIS HAVING PLANNED AND SET IT'S AGENDA FOR THE PRESS CONFERENCE, HALIFA SALLAH OPEN THE PDOIS PRESS CONFERENCE OF WEDNESDAY 09TH OCTOBER 2024 FOR MEDIA PRACTITIONERS STATING THAT
1. "Good afternoon Media Practitioners, 
-We've called you here today for not an ordinary purpose.
-This is the beginning of another stage of development of PDOIS in reaction to another stage of development of the Republic of The Gambia.
-Countries, parties develop in stages. And they do in reaction to the necessities and urgencies of our time. But they also do as a result of strategic decisions.
-We as a party, had to understand the country we live in, our members chose to sign a contract with country and people. And to this day that contract has not been breached.  
-We saw the need to take the country to the stages that the level of consciousness of the people demanded. And that is why in 2016, we became part and parcel of Coalition 2016 in order to effect a change in the country that had never happened since 1965.
-Many people will tell you that politics is about numbers. However it is important to tell you that no single opposition party can teach lessons for how to change governments through numbers.
-Gambia has never been changed by people of support of a single opposition party, to come to office.
-The only change that ever happened is the change brought about by a coalition in 2016. And the architects of that change must also be known not to exclude members of PDOIS. So at least we know how to effect change. And we took back to back in bringing it about and playing a major role in ensuring that it happens. Therefore we come back to you and tell you that we have capacity to effect change, the facts are there to back out assertion. 
-We are convinced that, that change was just a stage the purpose it served was to break that belief in the Gambian people that they were powerless, they were helpless, they never have the power or authority to be able to change governments. That myth has been destroyed.
-That is why as a party, in 2021 we saw the need to go back to the Gambian people to tell them what we believe would be the way to eradicate their poverty.
-We are convinced that Gambia has to become a freer, fairer and better society.
-We are convinced that the objective of every country is to ensure that your people are well fed, that they have clean drinking water and they are properly housed. Food, water and security constitute the basis of building human civilization. Any people that cannot provide that to a people cannot possibly leave here on the phase of this earth in prosperity and liberty.
-That is why it is the cornerstone of programmes of this party to ensure that every Gambian has food of adequate quantity and adequate quality. To have proper clean drinking water and to be properly housed. That is the cornerstone of our programme.
-We are convinced that in 2021 we sought to give the people an option, of how to eradicate poverty in the country, eradicate ignorance, eradicate any form of injustice that they may have been subjected to.
-But the results revealed that they did not vote for us to take charge of the affairs of this nation. Why didn't they do so;
(a) Is it not that they did not appreciate the candidate?
(b) Is it that they did not appreciate the programme?
(c) Is it that they did not understand the programme?
-Those are fundamental questions we as a party had to address. 
-And, therefore we decided to look inwards, try to build the foundation that will enable us to come to the Gambian people again and engage you. We have done that. 
-The party is ready to move, after careful consideration of all those factors that require development in this country.
-And the fundamental lesson we want to share with you is we are convinced that the people are not satisfied with the change that took place in 2016 and it's aftermath.
-Since they are not satisfied it is for them to tell us, why they are not satisfied and what type of Gambia they want? When they answer that question, they will also know the type of leadership they want.
-That is where we are and that is the foundation of the basis of holding this Press Conference.
