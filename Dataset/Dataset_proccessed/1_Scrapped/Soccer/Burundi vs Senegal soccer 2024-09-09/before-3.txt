'Flames have no time to complain for losing to Burundi' - Mabedi

Malawi’s Flames coach Patrick Mabedi has said his charges have no time to complain after starting the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers with a home 3-2 loss to Burundi on Thursday afternoon.

“We have no time to complain, as you know we have another game [coming],” Mabedi told the press.

The Kaizer Chiefs legend attributed the defeat in the Group L match at Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe to inadequate preparations.

“It was very bad. Even the play was not good. To be honest, we were not ourselves. Our combination play was very bad. Organisation at the back was very difficult. We couldn't coordinate very well. We were struggling defensively and in combinations going forward,” he told the press.

Makono Eldinho’s 87th minute winner stunned the Flames who thought they had snatched a point after the hosts’ Lanjesi Nkhoma’s 75th minute goal had pulled the game level at two-all.

Earlier, Burundi went in front through Malawi midfielder Chimwemwe Idana’s own goal in the 23rd minute, only for striker Chawanangwa Kaonga to equalize via a deflected free-kick six minutes later.

Five minutes later, the Falcons restored their advantage as overlapping defender Jean Claude Girumugisha volleyed from close range.

Reflecting on the goals the Flames conceded, the former Kaizer Chiefs skipper described them as cheap.

“Even the goals, we gave them away. They never worked for them. Overall, we had a bad day in the office. We made errors that cost us the game,” Mabedi said.

The result saw Burundi leading the group heading into their next assignment against Senegal on September 9, 2024, whereas Malawi face Burkina Faso in neutral Mali on September 10, 2024.
