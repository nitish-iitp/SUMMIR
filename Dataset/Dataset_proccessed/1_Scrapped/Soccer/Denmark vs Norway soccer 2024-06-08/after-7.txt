Denmark take on Norway this weekend

International football is back in action with another set of matches this weekend as Norway lock horns with Scandinavian rivals Denmark in an intriguing clash at the Brondby Stadium on Saturday. Both teams have good players in their ranks and will want to win this game.

Norway finished in third place in the UEFA Euro qualification standings and have failed to make it to the tournament this year. The Norwegians eased past Kosovo by a comfortable 3-0 scoreline in their previous game and will look to achieve a similar result this weekend.

Denmark, on the other hand, topped their group in the qualification standings and have been in excellent form over the past year. The Danish outfit edged Sweden to a narrow 2-1 victory last week and will be confident ahead of this fixture.
