Iraq and Palestine will continue their World Cup 2026 qualifying bids on Thursday, when they meet in a third-round group fixture in Basra.

The hosts have managed four points from their first two outings after cruising through the second round with a perfect record, while their visitors began with a draw and a defeat in September.

Iraq will bid to return to winning ways in Asian World Cup qualifying on Thursday, having failed to win for the first time in the latest campaign last time out in search of a first group-stage appearance since 1986.

After falling short at this stage in qualifying for the 2022 competition, the Usood al-Rafidayn began their latest bid in the second round and advanced in top spot with a perfect record, winning each of their six outings and scoring 19 goals while only conceding twice along the way.

That saw Jesus Casas's team head into Group B in the third round, and they continued their perfect record in 2026 qualifying with an opening 1-0 victory at home to Oman last month, having stood strong throughout the contest after Aymen Hussein put them ahead in the 13th minute.

A trip to Kuwait then followed most recently, and the Usood al-Rafidayn did remain unbeaten but failed to make it eight straight victories in this campaign, instead leaving with a share of the spoils as the game ended goalless, having been reduced to 10 men inside the first 10 minutes following Rebin Sulaka's red card.

Having still only conceded two goals in their eight qualifying matches across stages, Iraq will bid to continue their unbeaten record on Thursday with a victory to stand a chance of moving into one of the automatic group-stage qualification spots after three rounds of fixtures.

In their way stand a visiting side who will search for their first win of the third-round group at the third time of asking on Thursday after progressing through the previous stage in tougher fashion than their hosts.

Also aiming to reach the World Cup for the first time in their history, Palestine began in the second round and advanced in second spot behind Australia, collecting eight points from their six matches courtesy of a pair of victories over Bangladesh in March.

After that group campaign culminated in a 5-0 thrashing at the hands of Australia, the Lions of Canaan returned to action in September with a trip to heavily-fancied South Korea and took a commendable point from a goalless stalemate before meeting Jordan in Kuala Lumpur in the second round of fixtures.

Makram Daboub's team were unable to add to their points tally in that contest, though, instead suffering a third defeat of the qualifying campaign, as Yazan Al-Naimat and Noor Al-Rawabdeh fired the visitors to a 3-1 victory with second-half goals after Wessam Abou Ali had previously drawn the Lions of Canaan level on the stroke of half time.

Now facing an increasingly tough challenge to progress in continental qualifying, Palestine will bid to move into the group's top four at the halfway stage with an impressive victory in Basra on Thursday.

Iraq head into Thursday's meeting without defender Rebin Sulaka, who will serve a suspension following his sending off in their draw with Kuwait last time out.

In his absence, Saad Natiq may come in from the outset to join Zaid Tahseen at the heart of a back four, while captain Jalal Hassan will continue between the sticks having earned 85 international caps thus far.

At the top end of the pitch, Ipswich Town striker Ali Al-Hamadi has missed out on the squad through injury, meaning Aymen Hussein, who boasts 28 goals in 77 appearances for the national team, will continue to play a crucial role in the attack, while Mohanad Ali will offer further threat having netted 20 of his own in 49 caps.

Palestine will be without Mohammed Saleh, who has pulled out of the squad for their two upcoming qualifying fixtures after receiving a call-up due to an injury.

Oday Dabbagh, who plies his trade in Belgium with Charleroi, is arguably their main attacking threat, having notched up 16 goals in 39 international caps, and he should again lead the line alongside Wessam Abou Ali, who opened his account in their defeat to Jordan last time out, despite competition from Tamer Seyam.

Captain Musab Al-Battat offers plenty of experience in defence, having turned out 65 times for his nation, while 48-capped Mohammed Darwish will bid to return to the midfield from the outset after Oday Kharoub and Ataa Jaber were preferred last month.


Iraq possible starting lineup:
Hassan; Saadoon, Natiq, Tahseen, Doski; Iqbal, Attwan, Bayesh, Hadi; Ali, Hussein

Palestine possible starting lineup:
B Kharoub; Al-Battat, Termanini, Hamed, Saldana; Abu Warda, Darwish, O Kharoub, Cantillana; Dabagh, Abou Ali



We say: Iraq 3-1 Palestine

Palestine do have the tools to cause their hosts problems on Thursday, but Iraq boast more quality throughout their ranks and should see Thursday's meeting as a good opportunity to pick up three more crucial points in World Cup qualifying.
