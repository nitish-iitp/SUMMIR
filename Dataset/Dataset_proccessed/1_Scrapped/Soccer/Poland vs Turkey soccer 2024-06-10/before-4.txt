Euro 2024 is less than a week away and managers from the 24 nations have now named their squads.

Defending champions Italy missed out on the 2022 World Cup but will be defending their title in Germany.

Bayern Munich's Harry Kane and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham will attempt to lead England to their first European crown.

With Norway failing to qualify, there will be no Erling Haaland or Martin Odegaard but there are plenty of other Premier League players on show in the coming month.
