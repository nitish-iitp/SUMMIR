Guatemala host Martinique on Thursday

Guatemala and Martinique will battle for three points in a CONCACAF Nations League fixture on Thursday (September 5th). The hosts are coming into the game on the back of a memorable 1-1 draw against Uruguay in an international friendly over the weekend.

They went behind to Lucas Pino's 21st-minute strike before Pedro Altan stepped off the bench to draw the game level midway through the second half.

Martinique, meanwhile, have not been in action since sharing the spoils in a 1-1 draw against Suriname in an international friendly in March 2024. First half goals from Brighton Labeau and Justin Lonwijk ensured the two sides canceled each other out.

Les Matinino will now turn their attention to the Nations League and have been drawn alongside Guatemala, Costa Rica, Suriname, Guadeloupe and Guyana in Group A of League A.

Guatemala vs Martinique Prediction

Guatemala narrowly preserved their spot in League A of the Nations League last term, with just one point separating them from eventually relegated Curacao. La Furia Azul will be keen to claim maximum points here ahead of the more challenging visit from Costa Rica next week.

Martinique, for their part, are unbeaten in four games - their best run of form for over 18 months. Their impressive run has been founded on a sturdy defense that has conceded just one goal in their last four games.

This is the maiden meeting between the two sides and the result here could set the pace for the rest of their campaign. Guatemala are the pre-game favorites according to the bookmakers and we are backing the home side to claim a routine victory in addition to a clean sheet.

Prediction: Guatemala 2-0 Martinique
