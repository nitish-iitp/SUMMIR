The improvement from the first match of the season to the second match was exactly what coach Nils Eriksson wanted to see.

After falling 3-0 in its season opener last week against Centennial, the Bend High boys soccer team rebounded with a 3-3 draw against South Medford Wednesday in a game that featured three lead changes and was tied on four separate occasions.
