Preview: Equatorial Guinea vs. Liberia - prediction, team news, lineups

The midway point of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers sees Equatorial Guinea entertain the challenge of Liberia at Estadio de Bata on Friday afternoon.
 
Both teams are without a victory from their opening two qualifying matches and will be keen to get themselves up and running at the third time of asking.

Equatorial Guinea were agonisingly denied a much-needed triumph in their most recent encounter against Togo, which ended 2-2 at Nuevo Estadio de Malabo on September 9.
 
Goals from Luis Asue and Jannick Buyla either side of Roger Aholou's strike put Juan Micha's men on course to claim all three points before a 95th-minute equaliser from Kodjo Laba forced a share of the spoils.
 
After picking up two wins and a draw from their first three competitive outings of 2024, Nzalang Nacional have won just one of the subsequent five—a 1-0 victory over Malawi in June's World Cup qualifying matchup.
 
Luckily for Equatorial Guinea, they are just a point off Togo, who sit second in Group E of the AFCON qualifiers, with current leaders Algeria on course to finish top thanks to their four-point buffer.
 
Since their AFCON debut in 2012, Friday's hosts have more than given a good account of themselves on the continental front and will be aiming to edge closer to a third consecutive tournament by coming out on top here.
 
Liberia fell well short of the challenge posed by Algeria in a 3-0 loss at the Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Complex when the teams locked horns just over a month ago.
 
Baghdad Bounedjah completed the rout 10 minutes from time after Amine Gouiri and Adem Zorgane had netted in the opening half to leave Mario Marinica's men with a mountain to climb.
 
That was a first loss since the turn of the year for the Lone Stars, who had recorded two victories and three stalemates from five prior involvements across all competitions.
 
Liberia are level on points with Equatorial Guinea heading into Friday's meeting in Bata, where defeat for either team could spell the end of their continental ambitions.

Federico Bikoro has been called up for the first time since March and will have the opportunity to extend his all-time record of 55 appearances for Equatorial Guinea.
 
Forward Emilio Nsue, who won the last AFCON Golden Boot award, remains unavailable, having been hit with a six-month international suspension by FIFA.
 
Twenty-eight-year-old Iban Salvador has often spearheaded the hosts' attacking unit in Nsue's absence and will be expected to lead the line once again.
 
Goalkeeper Abdulai Koulibaly is back in contention to feature between the sticks after coming off with an injury scare in Liberia's defeat to Algeria last time out.
 
Tommy Sango came on to replace Koulibaly in the aforementioned game, but his wait for a first starting appearance in 2024 for the visitors is set to go a little longer.


Equatorial Guinea possible starting lineup:
Owono; Anieboh, Orozco, Akapo, Ndong; Obiang, Bikoro; Buyla, Eneme, Miranda; Salvador

Liberia possible starting lineup:
Koulibaly; Sackor, Kamara, Dweh; Kenneh, Chauncy, Dorley, Sangare, Teclar; Ernest, Swen



We say: Equatorial Guinea 1-0 Liberia

Neither team is in good scoring form coming into this one, and a drab affair could be on the cards here.
 
Having said that, we are tipping Equatorial Guinea to come out on top in front of their fans at the sound of the full-time whistle.
