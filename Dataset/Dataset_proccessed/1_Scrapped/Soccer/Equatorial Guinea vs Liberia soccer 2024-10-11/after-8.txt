The forward confidently converted from the penalty spot in the 34th minute after Sampson Dweh fouled Salvador inside the box.

With this result, Equatorial Guinea confidently moves into second place in the group with four points from three matches, while Liberia remains at the bottom with just one point from their three outings.

Algeria confidently leads the group with a perfect nine points after three matches, and Togo is confidently third with two points.

Despite Liberia confidently pushing for an equalizer in the second half, they were unable to break down the Equatorial Guinean defense.

Several confident substitutions from both teams couldn’t alter the outcome, with Equatorial Guinea confidently holding on for the vital three points.

Group leaders, Algeria extended their Group E lead with a 5-1 victory over Togo in a TotalEnergies CAF Africa Cup of Nations, Morocco 2025 qualifier. This puts them seven points ahead of Togo, who have two points from three matches.
