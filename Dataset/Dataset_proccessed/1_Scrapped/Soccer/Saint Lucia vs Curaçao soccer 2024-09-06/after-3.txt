Hall: Promotion is the priority

Barbados senior men's team Kent Hall has has eyes set on Concacaf Nations League promotion ahead of his team's League C campaign

Renaldo GilkesSeptember 6, 2024 09:36 AM ET

Expectations matching reality is one of the most difficult combinations for humans to digest, but not for Head Coach of the Barbados senior men’s football team, Kent Hall.

Hall was recently appointed as the fulltime coach of the senior Tridents after being selected on an interim basis for the June international window when Barbados faced Curacao and Haiti in the 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers.

The premier objective for the former national midfielder is to get his country back into League B of the Concacaf Nations League.

"We have set that target of topping the group and getting us back to League B”

Barbados was relegated from League B after a winless campaign, where they suffered six consecutive defeats, which resulted in the exit of Portuguese tactician Orlando da Costa.

The Tridents have been drawn Group A of League C, alongside regional minnows Bahamas and the United States Virgin Islands (USV.  

Barbados is the “giant” of the group with a superior FIFA ranking of 177th, in comparison to Bahamas (203rd), and USVI (208th), therefore progressing from this group should be of relative ease for the Tridents.

Coach Hall said he was aware of the supporters’ expectations and welcomes the pressure that comes along with it, because his staff and players have similar expectations and objectives, with promotion being the ultimate one.

Barbados’ quest to League B begins tomorrow at 4 pm versus the Bahamas at the Bethlehem Soccer Stadium, in St Croix, then they will face USVI on Tuesday at the same time and venue.

Hall explained to Loop Sports that while he is fresh into his role, he has made some significant observations and coupled them with desired outcomes.

“It’s still early in terms of my tenure and working with my staff and players, so I know we still have a lot of areas to  improve on and  a lot of aspects that we can add to how we want to play that we haven’t been able to get to, but  nonetheless we recognize  that it’s a result environment, so we have to try to focus to get those results and we have set that target of topping the group and getting us back to League B”, said Hall.

Barbados and Rapid Wien winger Thierry Gale is unavailable for this international window.

Hall’s introduction has seen the inclusion of some new, youthful faces to the senior team, which obviously means the exclusion of some more familiar names, who would have been a part of the national team during the last dismal Concacaf Nations League campaign.

Notable omissions are Wales players Akeem Hill, Elijah Downey, Rashad Smith and Nadre Butcher, Paradise FC pair Jomo Harris and Armando “Sugar” Lashley.

Hall said while experience is valuable, performance exceeds everything.

“Every player with a Barbados passport is eligible.

Experience has a certain value, but it’s also down to what you can do on the pitch and any given moment players will demonstrate a certain quality.

We also know the international environment is, if you can’t compete  physically, you can’t compete and so the  main thing is you have to get players who are up to the physical demands of international football”, said Hall.

Talisman Thierry Gale, college players Tajio James and Devonte Richards are unavailable due to commitments to their respective institutions.
