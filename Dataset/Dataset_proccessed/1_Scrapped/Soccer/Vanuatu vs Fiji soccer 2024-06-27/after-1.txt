Vanuatu makes history to reach first-ever OFC Nations Cup grand final after beating Fiji at Freshwater Stadium

In a historic feat, the Vanuatu national team reached their first-ever OFC Nations Cup grand final by defeating Fiji 2-1 at Freshwater Stadium in Port Vila. This milestone achievement was celebrated widely across the football-loving nation. Vanuatu will face New Zealand in the final on Sunday, marking a significant moment for the team and their supporters.

Both teams were vying for their first final appearance, with Fiji having previously finished third in 1998 and 2008, and Vanuatu’s best results being fourth place in 2000, 2002, and 2008. Fiji coach Rob Sherman made strategic changes, including the return of Scott Wara and Setareki Hughes replacing Sairusi Nalaubu. Vanuatu’s coach Juliano Schmeling also had to make several substitutions due to injuries, bringing in Kerry Iawak, John Wohale, James Iamar, and Tasso Jeffrey.

The match atmosphere was electrifying, with a strong turnout from the local community and the large Fiji contingent in Port Vila. Fiji started aggressively, with Vanuatu’s new goalkeeper Iamar making crucial saves early on. Despite Fiji’s dominance, Vanuatu capitalized on their opportunities. Johnathan Spokeyjack scored the opening goal in the 12th minute, sending the home crowd into a frenzy – a minute before Bong Kalo had just lost penalty kick by hitting it into the post, but luckily Spokeyjack had the chance and took it with a sublime finish.

Fiji equalized quickly in the second half, with Sitiveni Cavuilagi scoring his first international goal. However, Vanuatu regained the lead through Jason Thomas’s header from a corner taken by Godine Tenene in the 57th minute. The game became an intense end-to-end battle, with both sides fighting hard until the final whistle.

The victory sparked celebrations throughout Port Vila, as fans rejoiced in Vanuatu’s remarkable achievement of reaching the OFC Nations Cup final for the first time.
