“The story has a new chapter..”

That’s what the Marshall Islands Soccer Federation wrote on Twitter.

And then they revealed that their men’s team will play a team from the Federated States of Micronesia in a futsal match they’ve dubbed “Men’s futsal series”..

The series is set to take place in the Marshallese capital of Majuro.

The match will be played on July 24th.

UPDATE ON JUNE 29TH: But there may be more than one match for the Marshalls.

Because Kiribati have thrown their hat in the ring.

Kiribati Island Football Federation president Eriati Reebo confirms to Football in Oceania that they are currently working to see if they can make it to Majuro, with a decision to be made in early July.

The story has a new chapter..
