Lightly used optic mounted on Ar15. Illuminated G2B mil retical. Rifle is basically a safe rider. Decided to put a holographic red dot on it for fun. $450 shipped with insurance.

Great price. This is a solid optic at this price point.

If I hadn’t already burned through my toy allowance this month, I’d be adding a 4th one to my collection.
