EURO 2024 qualifying top scorers: Romelu Lukaku finishes clear of Cristiano Ronaldo

Tuesday, March 26, 2024

Romelu Lukaku finished as the top scorer in UEFA EURO 2024 qualifying having hit four goals in Belgium's final game to surge past Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo – and set a new record in the process.

Top scorer: Lukaku's 14 Belgium goals

Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku scored four goals against Azerbaijan on Matchday 10 to finish UEFA EURO 2024 qualifying with an overall record 14 strikes, taking him clear of the chasing pack in the process.

Who was the top scorer in the EURO qualifying group stage?

EURO 2024 qualifying top scorers

14: Romelu Lukaku (Belgium)
10: Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal)
9: Kylian Mbappé (France)
8: Harry Kane (England)
7: Rasmus Højlund (Denmark)
7: Scott McTominay (Scotland)
6: Zeki Amdouni (Switzerland)
6: Erling Haaland (Norway)
6: Bruno Fernandes (Portugal)

Lukaku fired in a remarkable four goals in the space of 21 first-half-minutes in Belgium's final qualifier, helping the Red Devils dispatch Azerbaijan 5-0. That took the Roma ace onto 14 strikes overall – surpassing the previous record of Northern Ireland's David Healy and Poland's Robert Lewandowski for a single European Qualifiers campaign.

Lukaku's four-goal haul also lifted him past Ronaldo, who reached ten goals by finding the net in Portugal's 2-0 victory against Liechtenstein on Matchday 9 but could not bolster his tally in his team's final outing against Iceland. The striker has won almost everything there is to be won in football but is yet to finish as top scorer in a EURO qualifying tournament. France's Kylian Mbappé moved to nine with his treble against Gibraltar on Matchday 9, but did not register in his substitute outing versus Greece as the campaign drew to a close.
