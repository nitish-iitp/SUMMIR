We said: Tanzania 0-2 Morocco
Tanzania got their World Cup qualification campaign off to a solid start with victory over Niger, but the visit of Morocco is arguably the sternest test that a nation could face in the CAF region. The Atlas Lions will be raring to get some points on the board after their contest with Eritrea was cancelled at short notice, and we believe that Walid Regragui's men will earn maximum points in this one.
