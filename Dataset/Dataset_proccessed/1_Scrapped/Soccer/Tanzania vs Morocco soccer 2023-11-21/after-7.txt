President Samia Suluhu Hassan

DAR ES SALAAM President Samia Suluhu Hassan has wished the country’s senior football team Taifa Stars all the best in their match against Morocco tonight.

The two teams meet at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam in a late kick-off match set at 10:00pm.

Conveying Samia’s good wishes on Tuesday was the Minister for Culture, Arts and Sports Damas Ndumbaro who visited players in camp.

“Yesterday, during the cabinet meeting, the President said I should tell you that she is congratulating you for the away victory.

“The second thing is that she is wishing you triumph in today’s match against Morocco and the third one…she is traveling to Dubai but has said she is going to watch the game from the first minute to the last minute,” Ndumbaro says.

However, the President has already bought Ordinary seat tickets of the 60,000 capacity Stadium and fans are being encouraged to put on Taifa Stars jerseys when going to the venue.

A win by the envoys takes them to six points from two matches as they aim to qualify for the 2026 FIFA World Cup finals to be jointly hosted by Canada, Mexico and United States of America.
