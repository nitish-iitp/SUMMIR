Benin will host Rwanda in a 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match at Stade Felix Houphouet-Boigny on Friday evening.

The hosts will be aiming to secure their second consecutive victory, while the visitors are still seeking their first win of the qualifying campaign.

After being outclassed by West African rivals Nigeria in their Group D opener, falling to a 3-0 defeat, Benin bounced back with a 2-1 victory against Libya in their second match.

The Cheetahs fell behind in the ninth minute when Faisal Al Badri converted a penalty for Libya, but a 12-minute spell in the second half, during which Steve Mounie scored and Junior Olaitan converted a spot kick, saw Benin turn things around to secure victory.

This result took Gernot Rohr's men to second in the Group D table with three points, and they will now aim to make good use of their double-header against Rwanda in the next few days to ensure they edge closer to clinching an AFCON ticket.

Since their quarter-final finish in Egypt back in 2019, Les Guepards have failed to feature in the Africa Cup of Nations and will head into Friday's clash looking to maintain their five-match unbeaten run in this fixture, which could take them closer to ending this absence.

The Cheetahs secured a 1-0 win at home against Friday's visitors during a World Cup qualifying match in June, a result they will be hoping to replicate this time.

Rwanda have only appeared in the AFCON once in their history, in Tunisia 2004 when they failed to progress beyond the group stage after one win, draw, and defeat each.

The Wasps began their journey to qualify for the 2025 edition with a 1-1 draw against Libya in Tripoli before holding Nigeria to a goalless draw a few days later.

The Wasps, now unbeaten in their last three matches, will face Benin looking to continue their fine form under Torsten Spittler. Since the German took charge of the team in November, they have lost just once, drawing four and winning three of eight matches.

With two draws, Rwanda remain unbeaten in this AFCON qualifying campaign, but picking up their first win is now crucial, and they will be hoping to replicate their 1-0 away victory against Benin in an AFCON qualifier in 2011.

Mounie, who has 18 goals since his debut for Benin in October 2015, should spearhead Les Guepards' attack, while Dodo Dokou, Jodel Dossou and Olaitan offer support behind the striker.

Olivier Verdon, Cedric Hountondji, Yohan Roche and Rachid Moumini are expected to form the back four once again.

Rwanda will be without midfielder Rafael York and forward Hakim Sahabo, who were both excluded due to disciplinary reasons.

Innocent Nshuti has scored the Wasps' only goal so far in this AFCON qualifying campaign, and he is expected to lead the line once again.


Benin possible starting lineup:
Dandjinou; Roche, Verdon, Hountondji, Moumini; D'Almeida, Imourane; Olaitan, Dokou, Dossou, Mounie

Rwanda possible starting lineup:
Ntwari; Omborenga, Mutsinzi, Manzi, Niyomugabo; Rebangouka, Bizimana; G. Mugisha, Muhire, Kwizera; Nshuti



We say: Benin 2-1 Rwanda

Rwanda have struggled to create chances and find the net in their opening two matches, and we believe that Benin have significantly more quality in attack to score more goals in this game, while also maintaining a solid defence, which is why we are predicting a home victory.
