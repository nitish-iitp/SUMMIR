How Italy could line up against Spain

Taking on perhaps their toughest opponents in Euro 2024's 'Group of Death', Italy will aim to build on a winning start when they meet Spain on Thursday evening.

Beating Albania in their opening Group B fixture leaves head coach Luciano Spalletti with some breathing space, but he is unlikely to tinker too much with the starting XI that lined up in Dortmund.

When his Azzurri squad arrive in nearby Gelsenkirchen, Spalletti could even name an unchanged team, captained by goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma and spearheaded by Gianluca Scamacca.

Every member of the Italian squad took part in full training at the start of the week, so several players will not have given up hope of forcing their way into a successful side.

A slightly more conservative approach could be required against tougher opposition, so either Alessandro Buongiorno or Gianluca Mancini may replace former full-back Riccardo Calafiori in central defence, while Mancini's Roma teammate Bryan Cristante could come into midfield.

The latter would join Jorginho and undisputed starter Nicolo Barella, who will be looking to score in three consecutive internationals for the first time in his career, having netted La Nazionale's leveller against Albania.

Of course, Spalletti's options have been diminished by a long absence list featuring Francesco Acerbi, Giorgio Scalvini, Domenico Berardi, Destiny Udogie, Nicolo Zaniolo and Sandro Tonali - but there are still several candidates to fill the wide positions.

Andrea Cambiaso, Matteo Darmian and Raoul Bellanova all offer something different on either flank; Giovanni Di Lorenzo and Federico Dimarco will be difficult to displace, though.

Italy possible starting lineup: Donnarumma; Di Lorenzo, Bastoni, Calafiori, Dimarco; Jorginho, Barella; Frattesi, Pellegrini, Chiesa; Scamacca
