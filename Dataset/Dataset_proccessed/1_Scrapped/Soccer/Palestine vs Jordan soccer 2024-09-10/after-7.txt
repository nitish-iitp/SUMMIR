MEN’S FOOTBALL: Yazan al-Naimat scored twice as Jordan beat Palestine 3-1 in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday to top Group B of Asia’s World Cup qualifiers on goal difference. Second-placed South Korea left it late to win 3-1 in Oman and Iraq in third drew 0-0 against Kuwait. In Group C Australia followed up their 1-0 loss at home to Bahrain with a 0-0 draw in Indonesia and remain outside the qualifying places.

MEN’S RUGBY LEAGUE: St Helens have blamed the huge rise in operating losses reported in their latest accounts on increased energy costs, a reduction in the amount of money received from television coverage, general inflationary pressures and repayments for loans taken out during Covid. The Saints, who are at risk of missing out on the play-offs this season, lost over £1.3 million in the year ending October 2023.

MEN’S FOOTBALL: Table-topping Doncaster Rovers can move four points clear in League Two tomorrow evening with a win at struggling Harrogate Town. Rovers have won four of their first five games of the season whereas Harrogate have just one victory to their name and haven’t scored in their last three matches. Second-placed Notts County are not in action until Saturday when they visit league new-boys Bromley.

MEN’S CRICKET: Warwickshire’s Alex Davies became the first player to hit 1,000 runs in this year’s County Championship Division One after knocking up 58 in the first innings of their rain-affected Division One match against Worcester on Tuesday. Davies is currently averaging 56.88. Durham’s David Bedingham followed Davies across the 1,000-run threshold when he notched up a century against Lancashire at Chester-le-Street.
