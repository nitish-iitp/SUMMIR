Most new publicly accessible space in Ontario requires lots of effort and money to create, making the Bruce Trail a miracle.

There are places where the Bruce Trail reaches a rocky lookout and suddenly the view is open to the horizon. In locations like Mount Nemo on the edge of Burlington, or even at Mono Cliffs north of Orangeville, the Toronto skyline can be seen on clear days.

That’s always a pleasant sight in a deep rural or wilderness environment: suddenly there’s a reminder of the city and the seven million or so people nearby. A very “town and country” experience.
