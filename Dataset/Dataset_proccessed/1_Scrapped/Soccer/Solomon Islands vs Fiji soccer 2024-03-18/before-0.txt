South Africa-based Flames striker Frank ‘Gabadinho’ Mhango joined Malawi National Football Team’s camp on Saturday after touring Champion Stadium in Mponela, Dowa District, on Saturday.

Gabadinho has returned to the Flames fold after missing two World Cup qualifiers against Liberia and Tunisia last year.

His absence caused a stir but he has been included in the 32-member squad for the Four Nations tournament.

The Moroka Swallows forward said he was delighted to represent the country.

“I am always happy to represent the country and I am looking forward to helping Malawi win,” the former Orlando Pirates striker said.

In another development, Mhango, who joined Swallows from AmaZulu, has applauded Champion Stadium owner King Kabvina for constructing a facility that can comfortably host matches.

“It is rare for business people in Malawi to consider investing in sports infrastructure. I am fascinated with the facility which Kabvina has constructed. It is one of the best facilities in the country and it is my hope that stakeholders will support him. Others should emulate the example he has set,” Mhango said.

On his part, Kabvina said he was delighted with Gabadinho’s gesture.

“I have been encouraged to continue investing in this facility,” he said.

The facility recently hosted FCB Nyasa Big Bullets, who camped in Mponela for pre-season training for a week.

Bullets also played two friendlies at the venue, thrashing Kalembelembe FC 6-0 and Chatoloma Admarc 6-1.

Mighty Mukuru Wanderers are also camping in Mponela and training at Champion Stadium.
