Saudi Arabia Makes History Awarded 2034 FIFA World Cup in Groundbreaking Decision 🇸🇦👏🏼⚽️🎉

FIFA has officially announced Saudi Arabia as the host nation for the 2034 Men's World Cup. The decision was confirmed during an online meeting attended by representatives from over 200 FIFA member federations, led by FIFA President Gianni Infantino. The vote, which took place on Wednesday in Zurich, was a significant moment in global soccer as Saudi Arabia became the first and only candidate for the 2034 tournament.

The decision to award Saudi Arabia the World Cup is seen as part of the country's broader efforts to elevate its international profile and develop soccer in the region. Saudi Arabia has already made strides in sports investment, with notable projects such as the Saudi Pro League's attraction of top global football talent and hosting major sporting events.

The awarding of the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia underscores FIFA's ongoing efforts to spread the sport's influence globally and invest in new regions while celebrating football's deep cultural connections across the world.

How did Sri Lanka’s national team, ranked 205th by FIFA, manage to surprise everyone by beating 🇰🇭 Cambodia in the AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifiers?

Seasia Goal researched the Sri Lankan Football Federation for swiftly transforming the team by scouting diaspora players worldwide. Just three months after losing twice to Brunei with an aggregate of 0-2, Sri Lanka revamped their squad, now mainly consisting of descent players. The new lineup against Cambodia, with 8 out of 11 descent players, shocked Cambodia and dashed their Asian Cup hopes.

Can this new Sri Lankan national team make a big impact in the 2027 qualifiers, soon?

Welcome to the era of modern football!

I may not be a "sports fan" but I'm a #Rassie fan.

He is the epitome of #AuthenticLeadership and here's why:

1. He leads with #Empathy and has been able to squash the talking points of "quota hires" in rugby. How? He sees the person, the #talent and does unto others as he would like done unto him.

2. Emotional Intelligence is made up of:  #SelfAwareness, #SelfManagement, #SocialAwareness, and #RelationshipManagement. We are all a work in progress... However, having a leader who embodies this allows a team to be Receptive To Feedback, find Inspiration from others versus seeing them as a threat, Embrace Challenges and #FailForwardFast 🌻

3. I will venture as far as to say, he understands the splitting of energies between the Journey and the Destination. In this case, pitstop. 

So often we get frustrated focusing on Why Things Didn't Work Out  and miss the learnings (I call them muscle builders) embedded in the journey. Hence some of us only enjoy the glory of living for a split second after an achievement  and move on to the next thinking "tjoo I'm glad that's over" 

Never reflecting, Never drawing insights, and Never giving ourselves a High5! 

Our final destination on earth is to give back what the land has afforded us i.e the physical body. This is not a negative or morbid realization - It Just Is .... Because the purpose of Life is to Live 🌻

Live it. Live it to the fullest - if fear or doubt stands in your way - reflect and ask yourself Why.

May Q4 2024 awaken your spirit, draw you from the darkness and bring you into harmony with the Creator. #YouAreEnough

📢 FIFA’s recent announcement confirmed the hosts for the 2030 and 2034 World Cup 🏆⚽️

In 2030, we’ll celebrate the centenary of the world’s biggest single-sport tournament across 6 nations.

🌍Main Hosts:

🇪🇸Spain
🇵🇹Portugal
🇲🇦Morocco 

🌎Opening Matches: 

🇦🇷Argentina
🇺🇾Uruguay
🇵🇾Paraguay

The 2030 announcement by its own is worthy of an analysis to be done later. But the spotlight is 2034, where Saudi Arabia have made their mark 🇸🇦

💼 Saudi Arabia is not new to football investments. Here are some examples ⬇️

🏟️ Clubs Owned/Partially Owned by Saudi Fund PIF:

- Newcastle United
- Al-Ittihad
- Al-Ahli
- Al-Nassr
- Al-Hilal 

⭐️ Star Players Signed in Saudi Pro League:

- Cristiano Ronaldo: Al-Nassr 
- Karim Benzema: Al-Ittihad
- Neymar: Al-Hilal
- Riyad Mahrez: Al-Ahli
- Sadio Mané: Al-Nassr

🏆 Past Tournaments Hosted:

- 5x Spanish Supercup
- 2023 Club World Cup

🌍 Now, Saudi Arabia have a monumental opportunity to showcase their Vision 2030, which looks to diversify their economy from oil and enhance the country’s global image. 

⏳Only time will tell if current skepticism around both 2030 and 2034 announcements are proven right. 

📈The economic impact for host nations is clear, but the bigger question remains: What does this mean for the sport’s future? 🤔

As for now, all roads lead to Saudi 🇸🇦⚽️🔜

The FIFA male and female Under 17 World Cup, in which I played in the first ever edition in 1985, are to become annual events from 2025 to 2029.

It seems the influence of Qatar, alongside Saudi Arabia are now becoming even more acute as the game expands tournaments with little, if any thought or explanation as to how it impacts the players, firstly, the fans or the game around the world.

Today, as we saw with the 2030 men’s World Cup which will bizarrely be played over three continents simply to bypass the rules of rotation and clear the path for Saudi Arabia to host 2034, it’s clearly all business.

How do countries qualify, if it’s annual?

How do young players transition into professional football, if it’s annual and presumably they will need to play a number of qualification games along with the expanded  tournament?

What about the right of other countries to grow their domestic games through hosting? Why are tournaments being locked up in one country over extended periods?

Why 5 years in Qatar, and Morocco?

FIFA’s only comment seems to be, we need to use the stadia:

‘FIFA said the decision to choose a single host nation for multiple editions centred on the ability to make “use of existing footballing infrastructure in the interest of tournament efficiencies and sustainability”.’

‘Tournament efficiencies and sustainability?’

What about the players? And the game?

Crazy.
