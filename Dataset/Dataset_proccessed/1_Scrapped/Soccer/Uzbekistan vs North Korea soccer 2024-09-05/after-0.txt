The match will take place at 19:00 at the "Bunyodkor" stadium in Tashkent.

The Uzbekistan Football Association and the Tashkent Police Department have called on fans to maintain public order and uphold fan culture.

"Entering the field is strictly prohibited! We remind you that during one of the previous matches, fans who grossly violated the rules set by the AFC ran onto the field, which led to disturbances. Law enforcement agencies applied administrative measures and fines to these fans," the Association recalled.
