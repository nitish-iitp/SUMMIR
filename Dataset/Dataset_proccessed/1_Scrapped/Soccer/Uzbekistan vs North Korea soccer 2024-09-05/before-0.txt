On Thursday, Uzbekistan will welcome North Korea to the Milliy Stadion in Tashkent for a World Cup 2026 qualifying clash.

The two nations are set to compete in Group A in the third round of qualifying alongside Iran, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Kyrgyzstan.

Uzbekistan are in the hunt to reach their first-ever World Cup after successfully negotiating the second round of qualifying.

They won four and drew two of their six matches in the second stage to finish in the top two of Group E alongside Iran.

A strong defence ultimately played a key role in Uzbekistan's progression to the third stage, with Srecko Katanec's side keeping three clean sheets in their final four matches of the second round.

They will be aware that their task will become much tougher in the next section of qualifying as they bid to secure a top-two finish and automatic qualification.

At the very least, they will want to clinch third or fourth spot which would give them another chance to qualify for the 2026 World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico.

With Uzbekistan looking to get off to a positive start, they may be able to take confidence from the fact that they have won their last three meetings with North Korea.

Meanwhile, North Korea are looking to reach the World Cup finals for the third time and the first time since 2010.

They managed to progress through the second round of qualifying despite forfeiting a scheduled home game against Japan in March.

North Korea took nine points from their five other matches to clinch second spot in Group B after finishing two points clear of third-placed Syria.

Sin Yong-nam's side have prepared for the third round of qualifying by playing two friendlies against Jordan last month, playing out a goalless draw before losing 2-1 just two days later.

They will now travel to Tashkent for their first meeting with Uzbekistan since falling to a heavy 4-0 defeat in a friendly in June 2019.

North Korea will be looking to clinch a head-to-head victory for the first time since recording a 4-2 win in World Cup qualifying in 2015.

Utkir Yusupov is set to start between the posts for Uzbekistan, with Husniddin Alikulov, Abdukodir Khusanov and Rustam Ashurmatov expected to operate as the three centre-backs.

Roma's Eldor Shomurodov is Uzbekistan's all-time leading goalscorer, and he will look to add to his 40-goal international tally when he features upfront on Thursday.

Meanwhile, Kang Ju-hyok is likely to feature in goal for North Korea, while Choe Ok-chol, Jang Kuk-chol, Kang Kuk-chol and Kim Yu-song are set to line up in the back four.

Ri Jo-guk is likely to offer one of North Korea's main goal threats after scoring a hat-trick in the most recent qualifier against Myanmar in June.


Uzbekistan possible starting lineup:
Yusupov; Alikulov, Khusanov, Ashurmatov; Turgunboev, Shukurov, Masharipov, Hamrobekov, Sayfiyev; Shomurodov, Urunov

North Korea possible starting lineup:
J. Kang; Choe, Jang, K. Kang, Y. Kim; I. Ri, Han, K. Kim, P. Kim; Paek, J. Ri



We say: Uzbekistan 2-1 North Korea

Uzbekistan will be full of confidence after putting together a four-game unbeaten run, and we think that they will extend that streak by claiming all three points against a country they have beaten in each of their previous three head-to-head matches.
