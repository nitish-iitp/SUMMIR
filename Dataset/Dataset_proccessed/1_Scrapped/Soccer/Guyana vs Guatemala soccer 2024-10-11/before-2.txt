Preview: Guadeloupe vs. Martinique - prediction, team news, lineups

On Friday, Guadeloupe will seek consecutive CONCACAF Nations League triumphs when they host Martinique on matchday three at Stade Roger Zami in Le Gosier.

Last month, the Guadeloupeans moved into a tie for third in Group B with Suriname, beating them 1-0 on matchday two, with La Matinino three points behind them at the bottom of the group following a 2-2 draw versus Guyana.

After a rough opening game in this tournament, losing 3-0 to Costa Rica, Guadeloupe got their Nations League campaign back on the right foot against Suriname.

That was their first-ever League A victory at this tournament, and it has them within a point of Guatemala and Costa Rica for first in the group.

Jocelyn Angloma's men have won four of their previous five encounters across all competitions, posting a clean sheet in each of those triumphs.

However, they lost two of their previous three domestic fixtures outside Guadeloupe, defeating Sint Maarten 2-0 in between those two matches.

The Gwada Boys have never lost consecutive Nations League fixtures away from home in the same season, though that streak will end if they lose on Friday.

Guadeloupe have not conceded a single goal in the opening half all year and have not lost when leading in the final 45 minutes since Guatemala beat them 3-2 in July 2023 at the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

It was a nightmare start for Martinique on matchday two, going two goals behind after 24 minutes, but to their credit, they reacted well and were able to claim a point.

That was also the first time they came from behind to earn a point in a Nations League fixture since September 2019, when they erased a 2-0 half-time deficit and drew Trinidad and Tobago 2-2.

Marc Collat's side have suffered just one defeat in their last five Nations League encounters, but they are still seeking their first away victory at this tournament.

Les Matinino will enter this match on a four-game winless run across all competitions, and they have not won a contest outside Martinique since defeating El Salvador 2-1 at the 2023 Gold Cup.

The five combined goals that they conceded in their last two competitive fixtures is one more than this side gave up in their five matches played before that.

Martinique are unbeaten in their previous three away matches versus Guadeloupe, beating them 4-3 in a friendly at Stade Robert Bobin over two years ago.

We saw three new faces in the Guadeloupe starting 11 on matchday two, with Junior Senneville, Alexandre Arenate and Kilian Bevis replacing Jerome Roussillon, Jordan Leborgne and Marcus Coco.

Leborgne notched his first international goal in their previous encounter, as Teddy Bartouche made six stops to collect a clean sheet.

A straight red card issued to Florent Poulolo means that he will miss this encounter for Martinique through suspension, while Johnny Marajo was the only newcomer in their starting 11 against Guyana, taking the place of Patrick Burner in a front three.

Brighton Labeau moved into a tie for seventh in all-time goals for the national team, alongside Mickael Biron and Jordy Delem, as he and Rudy Varane scored to help them earn a point in their previous match.

Guadeloupe possible starting lineup:
Bartouche; Cavare, Gravillon, Saintini, Roussillon; Cadiou, Solvet, Baron; Mirval, Ambrose, Phaeton

Martinique possible starting lineup:
Clementia; Dussaut, Moltenis, Bellance, Moutachy; Mandouki, Appin, Renel; Fabien, Labeau, Biron



We say: Guadeloupe 2-2 Martinique

When these teams face each other, it is usually a reasonably close game with plenty of goals, and we expect to see a wide-open contest between two sides in high spirits after their matchday two results.
