Preview: Algeria vs. Guinea - prediction, team news, lineups

Algeria seek to continue their 100% start to World Cup qualifying on Thursday, when they host Guinea at Stade Nelson Mandela in Algiers.

The Fennec Foxes were one of seven nations across nine groups to win both fixtures after two games in November 2023, and they will back themselves against Syli National.

Algeria are in competitive action without Djamel Belmadi for the first time since 2018 after the long-serving boss departed following disappointing back-to-back early exits at the Africa Cup of Nations.

Belmadi's Fennec Foxes were eliminated in the group stage again at the start of the year — same as they were few years back as defending champions — leading to the change, with Vladimir Petkovic replacing the departed manager.

The Bosnian-born Swiss coach was in charge of non-competitive fixtures in the previous international window in March, leading Algeria to a win over Bolivia (2-1) and a 3-3 draw with South Africa.

Despite AFCON 2023 failure, Petkovic will hope to pick up where Belmadi left off in World Cup qualifying, keen to add to the North African nation's wins over Somalia (3-1) and Mozambique (2-0).

Success on Thursday will take the Fennec Foxes six clear of their third-placed opponents in Group G, possibly creating separation after three games.

Guinea hope to avoid that outcome in Algiers, keen to prevent their hosts from opening a gap that could be unassailable despite being only three matchdays into qualifying.

Syli National reached the last eight at AFCON 2023 under Kaba Diawara before exiting at the quarter-finals against Congo DR.

Guinea ended a five-year wait (nine games) for success in World Cup qualifying by defeating Uganda (2-1) in November 2023, but the joy of that triumph was short-lived as they were beaten 1-0 by Botswana.

Road games have been a bugbear for the West African nation, underlined by zero wins in their last seven matches, losing five in that sequence.

More worrying in that period has been the inability to find the back of the net across different iterations of the national team, failing to score in four of those away fixtures.

It remains to be seen if Diawara's men are successful in Algiers, even if they seek to capitalise on Petrovic's teething problems in getting his ideas across in Algeria.

Riyad Mahrez's exclusion from Petkovic's 25-man group caused a stir, even if the Al-Ahli forward missed his club's final two league games because of a knock.

The former Manchester wide attacker is joined by Ramy Bensebaini, Islam Slimani and Youcef Belaili on the sidelines for this round of international games.

Despite the absences, Baghdad Bounedjah, Said Benrahma, Houssem Aouar, Ismael Bennacer and Nabil Bentaleb are part of the group.

Guinea are without Naby Keita, who has not played since being suspended by Werder Bremen in April, while Mouctar Diakhaby is in the wars after suffering a serious knee injury.

However, the away side can lean on Serhou Guirassy, who netted 28 goals in as many appearances for Stuttgart in the concluded Bundesliga campaign.


Algeria possible starting lineup:
Zeghba; Kerkhof, Mandi, Madani, Ait-Nouri; Bentaleb, Bennacer; Benzia, Aouar, Benrahma; Bounedjah

Guinea possible starting lineup:
Kone; Diakite, Sow, Jeanvier, I. Sylla; Guilavogui, Diawara, Konate, S. Sylla; Guirassy, Bayo



We say: Algeria 2-0 Guinea

While Guirassy's return to fitness and form at the culmination of Stuttgart's season give Guinea hope of upsetting Algeria, the Fennec Foxes should edge Thursday's game against their West African visitors who seldom secure positive results on their travels in World Cup qualifying.
