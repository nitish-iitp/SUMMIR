Guinea and Ghana took the headline victories as Africa’s 2026 Fifa World Cup Qualifiers saw nine matches played on Thursday 6 June.

Ghana defeated fellow West Africans Mali 2-1 in Bamako in a night match, coming from behind (Kamory Doimbia put the hosts ahead late in the first half) thanks to strikes from Ernest Nuamah and Jordan Ayew – the latter deep in injury time. The result sees the Black Stars draw level with Comoros at the top of Group I.

Guinea, meanwhile, secured the surprise result of the day, as they stunned Algeria 2-1 at the Nelson Mandela Stadium in Algiers.

Second-half goals from Morlaye Sylla and Aguibou Camara took the Syli National to a famous victory – and level with their opponents on six points at the top of Group G. The Fennec Foxes were searching for a third straight win to take control of the group, but instead may find themselves in a four-way tie by the end of Friday.

The other night games saw Egypt defeat Burkina Faso 2-1 in Cairo – via a quick-fire brace from Mahmoud ‘Trezeguet’ Hassan – for a third straight win in Group A and a four-point lead at the top of the log; Benin defeated Rwanda 1-0 in Abidjan (via Douko Dodo’s first-half goal) to further muddy the waters in an already competitive Group C; and DR Congo struck a late equaliser via Fiston Mayele to hold Senegal 1-1 in Diamniadio and deny the Teranga Lions top spot in Group B.

The lone afternoon match was played in Lilongwe, where Malawi claimed a 3-1 home win over Sao Tome & Principe to move up to third place in Group H, three points behind leaders Tunisia and one behind Namibia.

Chawanangwa Kawonga, Lanjesi Nkhoma and Chifundo Mphasi netted for the Flames, while ST&P’s consolation was scored by Denilson Silva.

In the early evening fixtures, Guinea-Bissau and Ethiopia played out a goalless stalemate at Estadio 24 de Setembro in a Group A clash; Libya rose to the top of Group D with a 2-1 home win over Mauritius in Benghazi (goals from the Mediterranean Knights’ Faisal Al Badri and Ahmed Ekrawa sandwiched an equaliser from Kevin Bru); and Sudan claimed a surprise 2-0 away win over Mauritania in Nouakchott to rise to the top of Group B. Thierry Maki’s strike and an own goal from Aly Abeid secured the victory for the Falcons of Jediane.

The World Cup Qualifiers will continue on Friday 7 June with nine matches across the continent, featuring reigning African champions Ivory Coast taking on Gabon, as well as Nigeria and Morocco playing host to South Africa and Zambia respectively.
