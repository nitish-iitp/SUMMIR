Hello! Today we’re talking about the scorer of the World Cup’s fastest goal — who dare not set foot in his home country.

On the way:

🇹🇷 Hakan Sukur’s fall from grace

🤔 Real set sights on Rodri?

Sukur’s Exile In U.S: Former forward worries about prison if he returns to Turkey

Any list of Turkey’s finest footballers would have Hakan Sukur on it. Any list worth its salt would have him very near the top. Kral, they called him, or ‘King’. Which is what Sukur was.

His prolific goalscoring earned him that title, as did the trophies. He was in Galatasaray’s UEFA Cup-winning team (what is now the Europa League) in 2000 and lifted eight domestic titles there. But nowhere in Istanbul will you find any mention of him. Sukur is a ghost. It’s as if he never existed.

The Athletic’s Nick Miller tracked him down to California, where the 53-year-old is in a form of self-imposed exile. Nick’s interview with him is riveting, bringing to life a story I was totally unaware of: about the sad fate of a one-time national hero who shot Turkey to the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2002 and bagged the fastest goal (10.8 seconds) in the tournament’s history on the way (below).

Sukur is persona non grata in his homeland. People there are literally scared to mention his name. If he goes back, he risks winding up in prison. What on earth happened?

How it came to this

In his old life, Sukur was Turkish royalty. After his playing career ended, he gained election to the country’s parliament and served as a useful PR tool. He was friends with Turkey’s current president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan — by no means a figure renowned as a libertarian.

Sukur was also friends with Fethullah Gulen, somebody Nick describes as a “religious preacher” who amassed a huge following in Turkey (almost a cult following). Sukur was one of those followers and when Gulen fell badly out of favour with Erdogan, the former footballer’s reputation suffered.

Gulen would be accused of being behind an attempt to oust Erdogan and his government in a violent coup in 2016. Sukur, for his own safety, had moved to the U.S. by then and was threatened with four years in jail after posting messages online criticising Ergodan and his son.

His assets were seized. His father was temporarily arrested (or “taken hostage”, according to Sukur). He has never been back. “They wanted me to return to Turkey and accept the rhetoric of the current regime,” he told Nick. “I did not accept their offer.”

He who shall not be named

It’s not going too far to say Sukur has been expunged from Turkey’s consciousness. He is nowhere in any of Galatasaray’s tributes to past triumphs. It’s seen as politically dangerous to speak about him. A TV commentator who did was promptly taken off air.

In the States, he opened a coffee shop (which soon began receiving strange, intimidating visitors). He worked as an Uber driver and an Amazon distributor and today he coaches young footballers. He rarely gives interviews and this one was worth months of effort on Nick’s part.

“I’m like Voldemort,” Sukur said. “He who shall not be named. But a good version.”

News Round-Up 🗞️
Vinicius Junior wants Spain to be stripped of 2030 World Cup hosting rights if the country can’t address its record on racism. Spain coach Luis de la Fuente responded by saying Spain is “not racist”. He’s rather missing the point.
Remember Chelsea’s hierarchy selling hotels owned by the club to a company controlled by said hierarchy? It raised £76.5m ($100.5m), it did Chelsea a favour with profit and sustainability rules — and the Premier League has decided it’s all fine and dandy.
Here’s a deal to track long term: Liverpool have nabbed forward Rio Ngumoha from Chelsea’s academy. He’s 16 and tipped to go far.
Inter Miami will move into their new Miami Freedom Park stadium in 2026. It’s official and it’s a big step forward.
Valencia striker Rafa Mir appeared in court yesterday after being arrested on suspicion of sexual assault.
After leaving Borussia Dortmund, 35-year-old Mats Hummels has taken a free transfer to Roma. Good stuff. There’s plenty of life in the old dog yet.
Real ❤️ Rodri? Looking at Madrid’s methods on big transfers

Spanish newspaper AS got tongues wagging this week by banging an image of Rodri on its front page and headlining him as Real Madrid’s transfer project for 2025.

We’ve seen this before with players such as Jude Bellingham and Kylian Mbappe. Some would call it Madrid’s playbook. The local media (who can look like enforcers for Spain’s big two) set the ball rolling with news and analysis. Madrid bide their time and make their move once the ground is hot. The method is tried and tested.

Rodri’s contract at Manchester City ends in 2027. He’s not biting on the chance to extend. More to come on this, I reckon.

… but will he win Ballon d’Or?

There’s no mystery behind Madrid’s mooted interest in Rodri. He’s the market leader in his position. He’s also a prime contender for the 2024 Ballon d’Or and straight up, he or Vinicius Jr (below) should win it.

The Ballon d’Or shortlists for the men’s and women’s games were announced yesterday, with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo missing for the first time in two decades. That era is over.

Bolivia is a brutal environment for football. It has geography on its side — so mountainous that today’s World Cup qualifier between Bolivia and Venezuela will take place… wait for it… 4,150 metres above sea level (you get the message from the picture above). His curiosity tickled, Stuart James decided to investigate.

It’s a first because no previous international fixture has been staged at Estadio Municipal de El Alto, a venue in Bolivia’s second-biggest city. Venezuela’s players are using hyperbaric chambers (a means of oxygen therapy) to prepare. Altitude makes Bolivia exceptionally tough to beat on their own soil.

Tonight’s result might normally pass you by but, on this occasion, look out for it. TAFC will, too.

Newcastle United’s sporting director, Paul Mitchell, has spoken about their tricky transfer window. In his words: “There are things we got wrong with our strategy.” You do wonder about alignment there.
On Tuesday we flagged up The Athletic’s survey on Chelsea’s recruitment. The results are in — and 80 per cent of those who responded have less confidence in the club’s owners than they did in May. Going well, then.
We await Mauricio Pochettino’s arrival but, in the meantime, USMNT interim coach Mikey Varas (above) is holding the fort. I must confess, I know nothing about him — or I didn’t until I read this excellent article.
It’s Republic of Ireland versus England on Saturday. In a parallel universe, Declan Rice and Jack Grealish could have been lining up in green.
The Nations League returns tonight, but how does it work, what’s changed and why does it matter? Eduardo Tansley has all the answers.
