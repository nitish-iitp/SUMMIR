SCOTLAND 0-1 HUNGARY: STEVE CLARKE'S SIDE CRASH OUT OF EURO 2024 AS BARNABAS VARGA IN SCARY COLLISION
BYALASDAIR MACKENZIE

UPDATED 23/06/2024 AT 21:45 GMT

Scotland failed to advance from the group at a major tournament again as they fell to a dramatic 1-0 defeat to Hungary at Euro 2024. Pushing forward in search of a winner that would guarantee them a place in the knockouts, Scotland were undone as Kevin Csoboth delivered a sucker punch on the counter-attack in the 100th minute. Hungary's win keeps their faint hopes of reaching the last 16 alive.

Scotland suffered more major tournament heartache as Kevin Csoboth’s 100th-minute winner sent Hungary above them into third place to keep his nation’s Euro 2024 last 16 hopes alive.
The Scots, aiming to reach the knockout stage for the first time in their history, came close themselves in a frantic finale when Grant Hanley squandered a big chance deep in stoppage time, while they had a major penalty shout waved away by Argentinean referee Facundo Tello.

But as Scotland piled numbers forward in search of a late winner from a corner, they were instead caught on the break, substitute Csoboth slotting home to make up for earlier hitting the post with only the goalkeeper to beat.

However, Hungary’s victory was laced by concern for striker Barnabas Varga, who required lengthy treatment with sheets held around him after a nasty clash and was stretchered off. Later reports said that he was in a stable condition in a local hospital.
The result sees Hungary leapfrog Scotland into third place in Group A on three points, and they must now await the remaining group stage results to see if they will qualify as one of the best third-placed teams.
TALKING POINT - SCOTS MADE TO PAY FOR LACK OF CUTTING EDGE
Scotland had to win, yet it took them until deep in stoppage time to create any noteworthy chances. They couldn’t convert possession into opportunities before the break, and flinging on a collection of supposedly more creative players after it still didn’t yield much in the way of a goal threat.
This do-or-die game could have gone either way in a frantic period of stoppage time, but ultimately Scotland are heading home because their stodgy attack failed to produce more than an Antonio Rudiger own goal and heavily deflected Scott McTominay strike over three games.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - ROLAND SALLAI (HUNGARY)
The Hungary forward was one of the more threatening players in a game that for a long time was devoid of creativity and spark. Then, when it mattered most, he led the decisive break and kept a cool head to tee up Csoboth for the winner.
PLAYER RATINGS
Scotland: Gunn 7; Hendry 6, Hanley 7, McKenna 6; Ralston 6, Gilmour 6, McGregor 6, Robertson 6; McTominay 6, McGinn 6; Adams 5. Subs: Armstrong 6, Shankland 6, McLean 6, Christie 6, Morgan N/A
Hungary: Gulacsi 6; Botka 7, Orban 6, Dardai 6; Bolla 6, Nagy 6, Schafer 7, Kerkez 6; Szoboszlai 7, Sallai 8; Varga 6. Subs: Nagy 6, Szalai 6, Adam 6, Csoboth 8, Nagy 6
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
42’ - HUNGARY HIT THE BAR! This time Szoboszlai elects to drift a cross to the back post instead of shooting and it catches out the Scottish defence, finding Orban at the back post who heads off the bar and over. He might have been offside, though.
68' - VARGA RECEIVING MEDICAL AID This really doesn't look good. Gunn is back on his feet, and there is a potential penalty check from VAR. But more concerning is the health of Hungary's Varga, who is clearly seriously concerning his team-mates. A blanket is being held up to protect him as he is treated, and a stretcher has been rushed on.
79' - SCOTLAND PENALTY SHOUT! Armstrong goes haring after a through ball into the box and after a tussle with a defender, he hits the deck. There are huge roars for a penalty, but they are waved away!
92' - HUNGARY HIT THE POST! Scotland hanging on by their fingernails! They are torn wide open and Csoboth only has the keeper to beat, but his shot across the face of goal thumps the far post!
99' - BIG SCOTLAND CHANCE! But it falls to the wrong man! The ball breaks to big Hanley in the box and he tries to side-foot it in from 14 yards, but it's straight at the keeper!
100' - GOAL! Scotland 0-1 Hungary (Csoboth): Unbelievable! Hungary break from the Scotland corner and score the winner with the final kick of the game. It's more major tournament heartbreak for Scotland. Csoboth is the man with the winner, firing home into the corner from 12 yards out.
