Aruba Vs Puerto Rico 1x2 Fixed Odds

Fixed Odds is also commonly known as 1X2 or singles. It is a popular betting option for English and Americans.

1 - Odds for Home Win X - Odds for Draw Outcome 2 - Odds for Away Win

All soccer bets for Fixed Odds (1X2) apply only to the full 90 minutes play of match results unless otherwise stated. This includes injury time goals but not extra-time (ET) score and golden goal or penalty shoot-outs.

Should a match be abandoned before 90 minutes play then it will be declared void. The goals scored and match result will not be counted.

Aruba Vs Puerto Rico Asian Handicap Betting

Asian handicap betting is the most popular way of betting on football in the Far East by the Asians. It offers great value to the bettor and is potentially less risky than traditional fixed odds (1x2) betting. You must either select the favoured team to overcome a handicap (framed in goals) or oppose the favourite with the handicap.

There are only two possible selections in Asian handicap betting, home team win or away team win. Asian Handicap betting thus eliminates the draw option used in normal multiples (1x2).

The greater the difference in ability between the teams involved in the match, the more goals you would expect the favourite to win by and the bigger the handicap will be. The underdogs will therefore be given a head start, a handicap, (of 0.5, 1 ball, etc.) by the favourite.

The favourite has to overcome the indicated handicap, and will have it taken away from its final score. The handicap for the favourite is preceded by a minus (-).

Aruba Vs Puerto Rico Total Goals (Over / Under)

The total goals or goal-line is the number of goals that we think will be scored in total in a particular match in normal time 90 minutes, excluding extra-times.

You bet either over or under the goal-line. Where the total number of goals equals the goal-line, stakes are refunded. For instance, you bet on Total Goals Over 2, but the match ended 1-1 in full time, you do not lose or win here, so your stakes are refunded.

We have specially includes some very good examples on betting on total goals:

FULL TIME RESULT	TOTAL GOALS LINE	VERDICT
2-1	Over 2.5	WIN
2-0	Over 1.75	WIN HALF
1-0	Over 1.25	LOST HALF
0-0	Under 2	WIN
1-1	Under 2	DRAW
More Explanation And Bet Examples:

If you bet on “over” when the line is 3, you lose your bet if one or two goals are scored and win if more than three goals are scored. If exactly three goals are scored, your stake will be refunded.

If you bet on ‘under’ when the line is 2.5 and there are one or two goals in the game, your bet wins. If there are three or more, your bet loses.
