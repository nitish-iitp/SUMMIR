The men’s national football team was in Puerto Rico to compete in the Concacaf Nations League 2024/25. The first two matches of Group C in League B took place in the host country. The third and fourth matches are in Aruba itself. Aruba is in League B, Group C along with Haiti, Puerto Rico, and Sint Maarten.

The first match was held on September 6 against Sint Maarten. Aruba dominated the Sint Maarten team for 80 minutes, and although they sought to score, they did not succeed. The first goal of the match came in the 81st minute and was scored by Gerwin Lake. The game continued into extra time, and in the 93rd minute, a second goal was scored by Ronan Olivacce. The match ended 2-0.

The second match was on Monday, September 9. Here, the national team faced Puerto Rico. In the first half, although both teams sought to score, neither succeeded. The match continued into the second half with a 0-0 tie until the 72nd minute. At that point, Leandro Antonetti opened the scoring and scored the only goal of the match. The game ended 1-0.

With this result, Aruba is placed in last place with 0 points, and Haiti is in first place with six points. Next month, Aruba will be the host for the matches of weeks three and four. Aruba will face Haiti in both matches, while Sint Maarten and Puerto Rico will also play two matches here in Aruba.
