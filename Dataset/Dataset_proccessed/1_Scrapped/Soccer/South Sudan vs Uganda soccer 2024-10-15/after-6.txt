South Sudan hold Uganda Cranes at the break

2025 AFCON Qualifiers | Half Time

South Sudan 1-1 Uganda

Uganda Cranes held by South Sudan in a 1-1 stalemate in the 2025 AFCON Qualifiers encounter at Juba Stadium on Tuesday evening.

Uganda Cranes head coach Paul Put made three changes introducing Allan Okello, Tadeo Lwanga and Derrick Nsibambi for Travis Mutyaba, Ronald Ssekiganda and Jude Ssemugabi respectively.

The hosts started the game on the front foot, seeking an early opener, but Uganda's backline stood tall and firm.

Denis Omedi broke the deadlock in the 18th minute with a simple finish to give the visitors the bragging rights.

But the lead lasted for a little while as South Sudan levelled matters through Yohanna Juma's brilliant curling effort.

Three minutes later, Tadeo Lwanga pounced on Allan Okello's delivery into the area but failed to find the target.

In the 28th minute, Okello put to waste a glorious chance. Roger Mato's long effort forced Mato in a big save and Okello failed to guide home the rebound.

It's 1-1 at halftime as the two sides extend the fight to the second stanza. A win for Uganda Cranes today confirms a slot in the forthcoming 2025 AFCON tournament.
