Uganda Cranes head coach Paul Joseph Put has made three changes from the team that started against South Sudan in a group J AFCON qualifier at Namboole.

In Juba, the Belgian tactician has named Taddeo Lwanga, Allan Okello and Derrick Nsibambi.

Okello came on as a second substitute while Lwanga was among the substitutes who didn’t take part in the Cranes 1-0 home win over South Sudan.

Nsibambi didn’t not even make the substitute bench in the home encounter.
