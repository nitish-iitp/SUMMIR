Craig Goodwin is next up with Channel 10 and says that the Australia coaches have calculated that there were only 46 minutes of playing time across the match.

“It’s not the way that we want to start our campaign, a loss at home, but we have to go away and improve. We have to look at the positives, this is the first game, there are nine games to go.

“This is a taste of the type of football that we’re going to face in this campaign. That’s Middle Eastern style of football. I’ve got my own opinions on that type of football but that’s the style of football that we’re going to encounter. But we lose this game because of us – it’s on us, not on them.”

Alessando Circati was one of the Socceroos better performers on the Gold Coast and is talking to Channel 10.

“We travel a long way, I spent 25 hours on a plane to be here, the last thing we want to do is lose. But we can play a lot better, we should play a lot better. Effort-wise, we all put in 100%. I played a new position that I’ve never played before, I gave it my all, but now we just have to focus on Indonesia.

The defender can’t hide his frustration with the way the second half was played, but it could just as easily be said that Australia needs to avoid being beaten by what they know.

“I don’t think we played five minutes of continuous football, every three minutes there was someone on the floor, but I can’t make comments about that.”

Full-time: Australia 0-1 Bahrain

Bahrain clinch their first victory over Australia at their seventh attempt and what a stage to do it on – a third round 2026 World Cup qualifier away from home.

It was a limp performance from the Socceroos and they were too easily sucked into the visitors’ game play as soon as they sensed they might leave with a point. It was a shock when one turned into three points for Bahrain, with what could prove a costly defeat for Australia to open their campaign in a tricky group.

Australia will lose Kusini Yengi for the clash with Indonesia on Tuesday following a straight red for a stray high boot that caught Baqer Mahdy on the neck. The Socceroos will be on a plane to Jakarta tomorrow for the match on 10 September, now desperate for a victory to reignite their World Cup qualification hopes.

94 mins: Mabil draws a simple foul about 10 metres outside the penalty box and the 28-year-old takes on kicking duties himself. Mabil finds Mitch Duke alone in the box but the forward headers back across goal and out for a corner. That might just have been Australia’s best opportunity of the match, but it has gone begging.

GOAL! Australia 0-1 Bahrain (Souttar og 89)

Bahrain snatch the lead as a drive down the left from Abdulla Al-Khulasi ends with a speculative cross. Harry Souttar sticks a boot out to try to block before the ball reaches the danger zone, but instead deflects it straight past Maty Ryan.

Red card to Kusini Yengi

77 mins: Kusini Yengi is sent off for what can only be described as a very high boot that has caught Bahrain defender Baqer Mahdy on the neck. The Socceroos forward was immediately apologetic but was always in trouble with a foot raised that high. Australia will have to find a way through with 10 men but Bahrain might look to take advantage of outnumbering the hosts.

69 mins: As soon as play resumes and Mohamed Marhoon collapses with Circati leaping behind him for a clearing header. The Bahrain midfielder is left screaming in pain while rolling around the floor while the players come together but it is debatable if there was even any contact this time as Marhoon is helped from the field.

53 mins: Abduljabbar hits the deck clutching his face and wallowing in despair. Circati is quickly on top of the Bahrain forward with claims of an overreaction but VAR will take a look. There isn’t much to see on the replay even as Abduljabbar stays down and the players from both sides congregate for some stern words. Play finally resumes without any further action being taken.

Some half-time reading with John Duerden looking at the World Cup qualification format being used across Asia for the first time, and how it can boost the hopes of Iraq reaching the showpiece event in 2026:

“No World Cup qualifier has been played in Baghdad since before the US-led invasion in 2003. The capital may still be off-limits for Fifa but Basra could be the springboard for success. More than 150,000 saw the Lions of Mesopotamia win all three games in the southern port city in the previous round – no team in Asia will relish going there with the World Cup at stake.”

Half-time: Australia 0-0 Bahrain

An even opening half as both sides made a fast start before Bahrain enjoyed a period of control. Australia were able to prevent the visitors from creating any genuine chances beyond one break away into the box, and then closed out the half with some opportunities of their own.

But the stats set the scene clearly: Australia lead 3:1 in shots, with 1:0 on target, while enjoying 66% possession without launching much by way of attack.

Craig Goodwin has been the standout among the front three, while Alessandro Circati has popped up a few times as Australia look for more bodies in the box.

44 mins: Souttar drifts into midfield and cuts open the Bahrain defence to find defensive partner Circati charging down the right. The 20-year-old can’t quite get to the ball in time but that was more promising as the Socceroos push for an opener on the brink of half-time.

41 mins: CHANCE! Behich moves the ball quickly to Goodwin down the left and the winger whips in a cross to find Yengi at the far post. The striker takes the shot first time but can only fire wide. That’s what Australia have been probing away for across the past 10 minutes but it ended in a tough chance for Yengi.

33 mins: An exquisite first-time ball from Irvine finds Boyle in space on the right but the right winger is blocked before it reaches Metcalfe charging into the box. That’s the first sign of variety and creativity in attack for Australia for quite some time, and we’re yet to really sight Kusini Yengi while he’s leading the line.

31 mins: Australia clear a pair of defensive corners then win one closer to their own goal. Goodwin heads to the right flag to take it as the Bahrain defence looks rattled simply by Souttar’s presence in the six-yar box. A short corner ends with Goodwin on the right side of the box, a sharp cross lands with O’Neill but the midfielder can’t keep the volley down and is still yet to score for the Socceroos.

25 mins: Bahrain have worked their way on top with some neat exchanges in their attacking third, though without threatening inside the box or anywhere near Ryan’s goal. Australia could do with some time with the ball just to regain some control.

7 mins: Australia are very nearly through the Bahrain defensive line but the linesperson raises the flag for offside.

Both sides launching into this match with plenty of energy.

4 mins: Socceroos gloveman Maty Ryan comes charging to the edge of the penalty box and leaps high at a bouncing ball. The keeper clears the ball with a firm fist but takes out a Bahrain attacker at the same time. VAR is in play at this stage of qualification but the Australia skipper is fortunate to have got a hand to the ball amid a robust challenge.

If Australia’s third round group including Japan, Saudi Arabia, China, Indonesia and Bahrain feels familiar, that’s because it should. As Joey Lynch explains:

“If familiarity does indeed breed contempt, Australia and Japan would be forgiven for having one of the most contemptuous rivalries in football. The reality is that their rivalry is one is largely built of mutual respect.

“This campaign will mark the fifth consecutive World Cup cycle the Socceroos and Samurai Blue have been paired in the same qualification group, continuing a trend that first began when Australia joined the Asian Football Confederation in 2006 – fresh off defeating Japan at the World Cup in Germany.”

Captain Maty Ryan returns to the starting line-up after sitting out the last of the second round qualifiers in June as he finalised his plans for the current season. The 32-year-old has since moved to Serie A giants AS Roma though is yet to make his mark with the gloves and should appreciate any minutes he gets with the Socceroos. Craig Goodwin is also back for his first match with the Socceroos since March and arrives with strong form for Al-Wehda in the Saudi Pro League behind him, while Martin Boyle will start on the opposite side.

Kusini Yengi will again lead the line after impressing in the second round of qualification, while Alessandro Circati will partner Harry Souttar in the centre of defence as Graham Arnold backs in youth at either end. But Nestory Irankunda has been unable to force his way into the starting line-up with the teenage sensation named as a sub. The 18-year-old was included in the Socceroos squad after overcoming an injury scare in training with Bayern Munich – here is that squad in full for this match against Bahrain, as well as the clash with Indonesia on 10 September:

Preamble
Martin Pegan

The road to the 2026 World Cup is a long and winding one and Australia have taken it further off the beaten track with a first men’s football international on the Gold Coast as they begin their third round qualification campaign against Bahrain.

The Socceroos breezed through the second round with a perfect record from six matches while blasting 22 goals without conceding, but will expect to face tougher tests from here. Graham Arnold’s side have been placed in Group C alongside familiar foes Japan and Saudi Arabia, as well as China, Indonesia and tonight’s opponents.

Australia have beaten Bahrain in all of their previous six meetings, though the 80th-ranked side are on a four-match unbeaten run and finished second in their group behind the UAE in the previous World Cup qualification stage. The most recent encounter between these sides might be relatively fresh in the memory as Australia won an Asian Cup warm-up match 2-0 earlier this year with Mitch Duke scoring after a Bahrain own goal.

Arnold would probably take that same result now with the margin for error tightening as the Socceroos chase a top-two finish in a tricky third round group to advance directly to the World Cup across the United States, Canada and Mexico. More pathways will open up if Australia finishes third or even fourth in their group, but the focus for the 24th-ranked side will rightly be on avoiding the playoffs this time around.

It's official, tonight's match is a sell out! 👏

Incredible support on the Gold Coast 🙌
