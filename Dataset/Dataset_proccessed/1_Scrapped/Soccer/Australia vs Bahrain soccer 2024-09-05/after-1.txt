Bahrain frustrate Socceroos in shock qualifier loss
ByAAP
Updated: Sep 5, 2024, 11:41 pm

A 10-man Socceroos outfit has suffered a shock 1-0 loss to Bahrain on the Gold Coast in a disastrous setback to their hopes of direct World Cup qualification.

Striker Kusini Yengi was red-carded for a high challenge then the Socceroos were red-faced by an 89th-minute own goal, against the run of play, as Bahrain frustrated their way to a maiden win over Australia.

The loss, in the side's first game on the Gold Coast, is a massive setback to begin the third round of qualifying that continues in Jakarta against Indonesia on Tuesday.

Only the top two sides in a pool that also includes China, Japan and Saudi Arabia will earn direction qualification to the 2026 showpiece.

Australia enjoyed 70 per cent of possession and, in the second half particularly, camped in Bahrain's half attempting to pick up the pace after a lacklustre first 45 minutes produced few highlights.

They made more than double the amount of passes than their rivals, but those efforts only yielded four shots on target, goalkeeper Ebrahim Lutfalla barely troubled as a frustrated Socceroos outfit slowly lost patience.

Things threatened to unravel in a final 20 minutes, crafty Bahrain winger Mohamed Marhoon going down in the corner and earning Alessandro Circati a yellow card, despite replays suggesting a lack of contact.

Marhoon was theatrical again moments later, falling to the ground after Circati won a header.

Fullback Harry Souttar was then booked for a high challenge and Yengi earned a straight red after 80 minutes when his boot caught the neck of Sayed Baqer as he contested a loose ball.

Yengi had a forgettable night, bumped off the ball early in the contest then scuffing a deflection from Craig Goodwin's laser-like cross approaching halftime.

Not even the injection of Bayern Munich excitement machine Nestory Irankunda after 57 minutes could spark something.

Starting on the right, he showed dash to earn an early free kick, then had a shot blocked and shot saved after moving to the left at the introduction of substitute Awer Mabil.

Bahrain strung out their time on the ball looking to run out the clock, but it was the visitors who struck first, Abdulla Alkhalasi's cross deflecting off Souttar and beating Mat Ryan on his near post.

Only six minutes of injury time were awarded, but the Socceroos missed a golden chance to equalise, Mitchell Duke's open header blazing across the face of goal.

A pitch invader then capped off the chaos, Australia's final foray ending in a limp turnover before the full-time whistle sparked wild scenes from Bahrain's bench.
