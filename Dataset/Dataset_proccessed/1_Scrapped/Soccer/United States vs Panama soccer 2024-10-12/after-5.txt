Five players started the 1-1 draw with New Zealand on Sept. 10: Brenden Aaronson, Mark McKenzie, Aidan Morris, Yunus Musah and Matt Turner.
Tim Ream captains the USMNT for the 11th time tonight. Having made his international debut nearly 14 years ago, Ream becomes the 10th USMNT field player to earn a cap after their 37th birthday, and first to do so since Preki on Sept. 5, 2001, at Costa Rica.

Midfielder Gianluca Busio earns his first cap and start since the Gold Cup semifinal against Panama on July 12, 2023, in San Diego.
Forward Josh Sargent, who already has four goals and three assists for Norwich City this season, collects his first start since the 1-0 win against IR Iran on Nov. 29, 2022, at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
Midfielder Brenden Aaronson starts three straight USMNT matches for just the second time, and first since World Cup Qualifying in October and November 2021: 2-1 win vs. Costa Rica (Oct. 13, 2021), 2-0 win vs. Mexico (Nov. 12, 2021) and 1-1 draw at Jamaica (Nov. 16, 2021).
Similarly, center back Mark McKenzie starts back-to-back USMNT matches for the first time since June 2021, a 3-2 extra time win against Mexico (June 6, 2021) and 4-0 friendly win against Costa Rica (June 9, 2021).
The current squad’s all-time leading cap-winner, Christian Pulisic makes his team-leading 10th appearance of 2024 tonight. It’s the fourth calendar year in which Pulisic has earned double-digit appearances.
Pulisic has six career goal contributions in five career matches against Panama (4 goals, 2 assists), trailing only Landon Donovan (7 – 4 goals, 3 assists) in all-time USMNT goal contributions against the Marea Roja.
