In the first match under new head coach Mauricio Pochettino, the United States men's national team defeated Panama in a friendly on Saturday night by the score of 2-0.

The USMNT was able to earn some revenge after previously falling to Panama in the Copa América group stage on June 27. The U.S. squad failed to advance to the knockout stage following the loss, which ultimately led to the firing of former manager Gregg Berhalter.

There initially appeared to be some skepticism regarding changes under Pochettino following a scoreless first half, although it it didn't take long for the United States to get on the board under the 52-year-old once the second half started.

Following a give-and-go from Brenden Aaronson and Christian Pulisic, Yunus Musah scored off a slick feed from Pulisic to break the tie in the 49th minute.

Panama nearly got on the board a few minutes later, but the USMNT maintained the lead following a double save by Matt Turner.

Team is so much more fluid going forward now. Only 60 minutes and they look a lot better on the ball.

Job well done for the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/USMNT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#USMNT</a> in Pochettino's first match in charge. Starting to see his ideas on the pitch. Great effort from the players. Great performances for Pulisic, Turner, Musah, Jedi &amp; Pepi. 2-0 over Panama. Mexico away up next. Breaking it down on <a href="https://twitter.com/CBSSportsGolazo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CBSSportsGolazo</a> now.
