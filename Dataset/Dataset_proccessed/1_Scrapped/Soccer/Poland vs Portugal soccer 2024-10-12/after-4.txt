Poland vs Portugal

The Seleccao's icons made it nine points from a possible nine for the 2016 European champions in the Nations League

Cristiano Ronaldo scored the 906th goal of his illustrious career as Portugal took a step closer to the Nations League knockout rounds after beating Poland 3-1 on Saturday.

Bernardo Silva gave the Portuguese the lead in the 26th minute as he finished off a gorgeous team move, before Ronaldo tapped home after Rafael Leao's shot cannoned off the post 11 minutes later. Piotr Zielinski set up a nervy finale for the visitors after slotting past Diogo Costa with 12 minutes remaining, only for Jan Bednarek's own goal in the 88th minute to settle matters.

The result ended Poland's 10-match unbeaten home run as Portugal maintained their three-point lead at the top of League A Group 1.

GOAL rates Portugal's players from Stadion Narodowy...

AFP
Goalkeeper & Defence

Diogo Costa (7/10):

Other than conceding the goal late on, he seemed to be in the right position to deal with Poland's efforts. A safe pair of hands.

Diogo Dalot (7/10):

Not many threats came his way so he developed a habit of bombing forward and roaming into open spaces.

Ruben Dias (8/10):

The centre-back was, largely, calm and collected at the back and even though his team let in a goal, he was solid for large swathes of the game.

Renato Veiga (8/10):

The Chelsea defender made a number of timely headed clearances and tackles at the back.

Nuno Mendes (7/10):

Some of his crosses into the box were a bit wasteful but he made one crucial interception in his own area and his piercing pass into the box was turned into his own goal by Bednarek.

Midfield

Bernardo Silva (8/10):

The Manchester City star took his goal with aplomb and looked like his usual busy self for his country, popping up all over the pitch.

Ruben Neves (8/10):

Played a delightful, defence-splitting ball to Bruno Fernandes, who then set up Silva for Portugal's opener.

Bruno Fernandes (8/10):

Looked like a different player to the one that is struggling at Manchester United this season. Nearly scored a wondergoal and had something of a swagger about him against the Poles. Didn't quite have his shooting boots on but he was a threat throughout.

Attack

Rafael Leao (9/10):

Nearly scored a goal of the season contender as his blistering pace took him past several defenders, before firing against the post moments before Ronaldo's tap-in. Repeatedly burned past Polish players in what was a frighteningly good performance that deserved a goal.

Cristiano Ronaldo (7/10):

Missed a gilt-edged chance early on as he hit the bar from three yards out but was in the right place at the right time to get on the scoresheet once again. His third goal of the competition shows he can still contribute to this Portuguese team but tougher tests lie ahead.

Pedro Neto (7/10):

The agile Chelsea winger showed his attacking talents on repeated occasions but wasn't quite as effective as Leao. Wasn't far off from grabbing a late goal, as goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski was equal to his curling shot.

Subs & Manager

Francisco Trincao (7/10):

Showed really quick feet and fleet of foot to get away from Poland's defence.

Diogo Jota (6/10):

Spurned a good chance to finish off the home side.

Nelson Semedo (7/10):

Won the ball in his own area and soon after, Portugal made it 3-1.

Otavio (N/A):

Had little time to make an impact.

Samu Costa (N/A):

Was brought on right at the end.

Roberto Martinez (7/10):

His team had a game plan and they stuck to it, outclassing Poland for long periods. The Portuguese looked slick and showed good cohesion against a side that don't often lose at home. However, they lost a bit of control in the second half with his substitutes.
