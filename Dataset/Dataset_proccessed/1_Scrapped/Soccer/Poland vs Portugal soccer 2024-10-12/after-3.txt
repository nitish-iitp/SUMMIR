Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 133rd international goal on Saturday evening, with the 39-year-old helping Portugal record a 3-1 victory over Poland in their UEFA Nations League contest.

The result has left Roberto Martinez's side at the top of Group 1 of League A, boasting nine points from their opening three matches, while Poland sit down in third spot, three points behind second-placed Croatia.

The breakthrough came in the 26th minute of the contest, and it was a wonderful goal from Portugal, with Bruno Fernandes expertly heading down towards Bernardo Silva inside the penalty box, and the Manchester City attacker volleyed into the bottom corner.

Portugal had their second of the match in the 37th minute; the goal was all about Rafael Leao, with the forward driving through a number of Polish challengers before striking against the base of the post, and Ronaldo was on hand to convert from close range.

Poland had seven attempts in the opening half of action, but they were undone by a ruthless Portugal outfit, who are now in an incredibly strong position at the top of the section.

The home team did have one back in the 78th minute of the contest, with Piotr Zielinski firing into the back of the net from inside the box after the ball broke kindly for him in a dangerous area.

However, Portugal scored a third in the 88th minute when Jan Bednarek turned a dangerous cross from Nuno Mendes into the back of his own net from close range, with Martinez's side securing a vital win.

Ronaldo hit the crossbar before getting his name on the scoresheet in the 37th minute, and he has now scored 11 times for club and country during the 2024-25 campaign, with the legendary forward still a goal machine.
