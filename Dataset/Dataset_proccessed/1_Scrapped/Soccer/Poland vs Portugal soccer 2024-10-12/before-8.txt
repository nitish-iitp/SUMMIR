Portugal Predicted Lineup vs Poland Preview

After a lacklustre performance in Euro 2024, Portugal has decided to keep head coach Roberto Martinez on board, while Cristiano Ronaldo remains an option for the team. The first champions of the Nations League kicked off their new season at home with a match against Croatia, securing a 2-1 victory.

Diogo Dalot and the previously mentioned Ronaldo propelled the home team into a strong advantage, but a Dalot own goal added an unexpected twist to the match. Ronaldo’s goal marked a remarkable milestone, being the 900th in his legendary career.

In their latest match, Portugal showcased their determination, bouncing back from an early setback to triumph over Scotland. The Scots initially took the lead with a goal from Scott McTominay.

Still, it was the former Manchester United stars, Bruno Fernandes and Cristiano Ronaldo, who turned the tide and secured the win for Portugal. Cristiano Ronaldo has found the back of the net in four of Portugal’s last six competitive away games, tallying six goals in total.

Portugal has secured six consecutive competitive victories on the road, with four of those wins coming by a margin of two goals or more.
