England men's Under-18s were beaten 2-0 by Sweden in their first of two games in Marbella this week.

The Young Lions trailed by two goals at the half-time interval and struggled to find a way back into the game in rainy conditions.

Liam Bramley made second-half substitutions in an attempt to get back into the game but it was to no avail, despite Jesse Derry and Bailey Dipepa going close with headers.

His side will now take on Ukraine or the Netherlands on Monday in the second match of their October camp.

England: 1 Oliver Whatmuff (Manchester City), 2 Leo Shahar (Newcastle United), 3 Chukwuemeka Adiele (West Ham United), 4 Ollie Harrison (Chelsea), 5 Olutayo Subuloye (Chelsea), 6 Carter Pinnington (Liverpool), 7 Frankie Runham (Chelsea), 8 Harrison Armstrong (Everton), 9 Mateus Mane (Wolverhampton Wanderers), 10 Chris Rigg (Sunderland), 11 Jesse Derry (Crystal Palace)

Substitues: 14 Trey Nyoni (Liverpool) for Harrison 59', 16 Souleymade Sidibe (Stoke City) for Armstrong 59', 17 Baylee Dipepa (Southampton) for Mane 59', 12 Airidas Golambeckis (West Ham United) for Pinnington 69', 21 Jaden Dixon (Stoke City) for Shahar 69', 18 Trevan Sanusi (Newcastle United) for Runham 69', 20 Harry Amass (Manchester United) for Adiele 78', 15 Callum Olusesi (Tottenham Hotspur) for Rigg 78', 19 Ben Broggio (Aston Villa) for Derry 78'

Substitutes not used: 13 Douglass Lukjanciks (Everton), 22 Nicolas Michalski (Blackburn Rovers)
