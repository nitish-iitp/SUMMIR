Verdict: Both teams to score

Best odds: 14/17

Bookmaker: BetUS

Portugal head into their UEFA Nations League encounter with Poland in fine form, having secured back-to-back wins in September to lead League A Group 1. The Selecao relied heavily on their talismanic captain, Cristiano Ronaldo, who reached yet another career milestone during last month’s fixtures, inspiring the team to consecutive victories.

As they prepare for the clash in Warsaw on Saturday, Portugal sit at the top of the group, three points clear of Poland.

Poland

Poland’s star captain Robert Lewandowski continues to be a reliable force for his national team, adding to his remarkable tally of 84 international goals with a strike last month in a thrilling 3-2 win over Scotland. Despite surrendering a two-goal lead, Poland salvaged all three points through a last-minute penalty from Nicola Zalewski.

However, Poland’s momentum was halted by a narrow 1-0 defeat to Croatia in Osijek, leaving them tied with Croatia in the standings, three points clear of Scotland. After a disappointing group-stage exit at Euro 2024, Poland’s goal in the Nations League is not only survival but also pushing for an unexpected spot in the knockout phase.

New head coach Michal Probierz has been tasked with refreshing a somewhat stagnant squad while keeping the Eagles afloat in League A. His challenge is balancing the need to develop a squad for the future, particularly with an eye on the 2026 World Cup, while ensuring they avoid the threat of relegation.

A third-place finish in the group would force Poland into a relegation playoff, while ending up in fourth place would mean automatic demotion to League B – something Probierz and his squad will be desperate to avoid.

Team News

Poland’s lineup for the clash against Portugal could see some fresh faces, such as Maxi Oyedele from Legia Warsaw and Michael Ameyaw from Rakow Czestochowa, but the team’s core remains built around familiar figures.

Jan Bednarek will anchor the defence in a back three, while Piotr Zielinski of Inter Milan continues to pull the strings in midfield. Up front, Lewandowski will be leading the line as Poland’s all-time top scorer.

Lewandowski will once again be without his usual strike partner, Arkadiusz Milik, who is sidelined due to injury. As a result, either Karol Swiderski or Krzysztof Piatek should join him up front, providing additional support as Poland seeks a crucial result in this Nations League encounter.

Portugal

Portugal’s UEFA Nations League campaign has started perfectly, with maximum points from their first two Group 1 matches. Much of the credit goes to Ronaldo, who continues to deliver at the highest level, even at 39. After scoring Portugal’s second in a 2-1 win over Croatia, Ronaldo followed it up with a memorable cameo against Scotland, hitting the woodwork twice before netting a dramatic late winner to secure a 1-0 victory.

Despite ongoing debates about Portugal’s reliance on their veteran forward, coach Roberto Martinez has remained firm in his support of Ronaldo. Martinez’s faith has been rewarded, as his side seems well-positioned for a deep run in both the Nations League and the road to the 2026 World Cup.

The Selecao are aiming to repeat their 2019 triumph in this tournament after narrowly missing out on the 2023 Nations League finals, finishing second to Spain. With a top-two finish now enough for quarterfinal qualification, Portugal can edge closer to the knockout stage by defeating both Poland and Scotland in their upcoming away fixtures.

Having not lost to Poland since 2006 – taking four points from them in the first-ever Nations League season – Portugal can enter this weekend’s game with confidence, hoping to extend their unbeaten streak against their hosts.

Team News

Martinez has introduced some new faces into his squad for the upcoming Nations League fixtures, including Ricardo Velho, a goalkeeper from Farense, and Samu Costa, a midfielder from Mallorca. These inclusions show Martinez’s commitment to refreshing the team while maintaining a competitive edge.

One notable recall is Juventus winger Francisco Conceicao, who returns after missing the September matches due to injury, and his recent form, including a stunning solo goal against RB Leipzig in the Champions League, has made him a valuable addition. However, Sporting Lisbon pair Geovany Quenda and Pedro Goncalves are ruled out due to injuries.

With Martinez known for his flexibility in tactics, he may opt for a 4-3-3 formation against Poland, with Ronaldo leading the line.

Conclusion

Both these teams boast more quality in attack than at the back, and with players like Ronaldo and Lewandowski on the pitch, goals should come at both ends of the pitch.

Verdict: Both teams to score

Best odds: 14/17
