Namibia Get Bonus Ahead Of Bafana Clash

The Namibian national team have received a R300,000 bonus for their historic first-ever win at the Africa Cup of Nations and just days before facing Bafana Bafana.

While South Africa kicked off their tournament with a 2-0 defeat to Mali, the Brave Warriors were one of the surprise packages of the first round, beating Africa’s third highest-ranked team Tunisia 1-0.

The current tournament is only Namibia’s fourth ever AFCON and they started the tournament with a bang, which has now been rewarded by the President of the Namibia Football Association [NFA], Robert Shimooshili, and PST Bet Founder and CEO, Steve Hamunyela.

Both have jointly pledged a substantial N$150,000 (R150,000) each towards the Brave Warriors. 

Shimooshili, moved by the team’s dedication, said, “You left your families back home, and while on this mission, put everything aside to focus on your assignment and make us proud. The Namibian nation is grateful for the history made,” he said in a statement from the NFA.

“We believe in your potential; this contribution is not just financial support, it’s a vote of confidence in the resilience and determination displayed by the Brave Warriors. You have brought honour and pride to the nation.”

Urging fellow Namibians and businesses to join the cause, Shimooshili added, “I challenge the Namibian nation to, those who can, support the team in whatever way they can.”

Speaking at the same event, Hamunyela of PST Bet conveyed profound gratitude and appreciation to the team for their triumphant performance, saying the financial support is a step in enhancing the team’s resources and fortifying their chances in the upcoming matches.

On this, Hamunyela remarked “This donation is PST Bet’s way of thanking the Brave Warriors. Our special way of saying we love you.” 

Namibia will face neighbours South Africa on the 21 January 2024 in Korhogo, and take on Mali in San Pedro on the 24 January 2024.
