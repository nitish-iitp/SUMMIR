South Africa vs Namibia LIVE!

A crucial match in Group E of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations took place in Korhogo this evening. South Africa, fresh from a defeat to open their tournament, beat Namibia in something of a local rivalry on the international scene.

The 601-mile border that runs between those two nations is rarely focused on when it comes to football but the stakes are high when these neighbours meet tonight. The Brave Warriors of Namibia, rank outsiders heading into this AFCON, won their first-ever game in the competition at the tenth attempt last time out and a point will now send them into the last-16.

Bafana Bafana, meanwhile, were beaten by Mali but the west Africans' draw with Tunisia yesterday has kept the group wide open. A brace from Themba Zwane led them to a 4-0 win after Percy Tau netted an early penalty.

Pitchside microphones picking up the pained grunts of Thapelo Maseko after he goes down under a rough challenge, landed right on his shin.

Studs up, too. Will VAR want a look at that?
