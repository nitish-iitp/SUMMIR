NYAMBE HELPS NAMIBIA TO VICTORY IN AFCON OPENER

Derby County’s Ryan Nyambe helped Namibia start their 2023 Africa Cup of Nations campaign in impressive fashion with a 1-0 win over Tunisia on Tuesday.





The result proved to be a huge upset as Deon Hotto's 88th-minute header secured victory for The Brave Warriors in Group E.

Namibia, who are ranked 115th in the world were and without a victory in any of their previous nine matches in the competition, were worthy winners at the Amadou Gon Coulibaly Stadium in Korhogo against the 2004 winners.

Defender Nyambe, after playing the full 90 minutes, now has 15 caps for his country following his international debut in 2019.

Next up for Namibia is a clash against South Africa on 21st January before facing Mali in their final group fixture on 24th January as they bid to reach the knockout stages.

The right-back has made 16 appearances for Derby since signing as a free agent in September and recently penned a new deal until the summer of 2025.
