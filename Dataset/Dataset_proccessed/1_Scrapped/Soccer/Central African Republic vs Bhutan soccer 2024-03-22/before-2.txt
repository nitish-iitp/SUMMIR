India's UN representative calls for reform amidst UNSC gridlock
On UNSC reforms, India's permanent representative to the United Nations Ruchira Kamboj says, "...The current permanent members were the product of the geopolitical context of the 20th century. Times have changed and the world today is a multipolar one. There needs to be a new logic to the permanent category composition if it were to continue, and that cannot work without changes...We have not heard anything on text-based negotiations within a fixed time frame in the UFC model yet again today, no real surprise...To say let us agree before we start negotiations is like giving every member country a veto. And while vetoes may be used in the United Nations Security Council, we don't operate on the basis of vetoes in the United Nations General Assembly. Thus, when asking for an impossible consensus preceding text-based negotiations, isn't the UFC just vetoing the whole process and suggesting my way or the highway approach?..."
