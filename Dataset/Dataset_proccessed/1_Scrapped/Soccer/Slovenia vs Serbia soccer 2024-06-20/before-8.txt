And it was confirmed on Wednesday night that UEFA had fined the Serbian Football Association €4,500 for the "throwing of objects" and a further €10,000 for "transmitting a provocative message not fit for a sports event".

Albania were also issued with fines following their match against Italy, which they lost 2-1. A large pyro was set off by Albanian fans after Nedim Bejrami fired them into a shock lead just seconds after kick-off.
