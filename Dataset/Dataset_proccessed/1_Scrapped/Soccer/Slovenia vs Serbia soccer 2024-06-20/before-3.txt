How Slovenia could line up against Serbia

Slovenia boss Matjaz Kek could be tempted to name an unchanged starting lineup for Thursday's Euro 2024 Group C clash with Serbia at the Allianz Arena in Munich.

Kek's side rescued what could prove to be a valuable point in a 1-1 draw with Denmark last Sunday, with left-back Erik Janza scoring 13 minutes from time with a deflected long-range strike.

The 30-year-old is expected to retain his place in a four-man defence alongside Jaka Bijol, Vanja Drkusic and Zan Karnicnik, protecting goalkeeper Jan Oblak of Atletico Madrid.

Should Kek stick with a 4-4-2 formation, Adam Gnezda Cerin and Timi Max Elsnik could continue in centre-midfield as Petar Stojanovic and Jan Mlakar operate on the flanks.

Few will be surprised to see RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko lead the line; the highly-rated 21-year-old has scored 11 goals in 30 international caps for Slovenia and is set to be joined in attack by Andraz Sporar.

David Brekalo, Zan Celar, Jasmin Kurtic, Benjamin Verbic and Jon Gorenc Stankovic all gained minutes off the substitutes' bench last time out and will be pushing to feature again in some capacity against Serbia.

Slovenia possible starting lineup: Oblak; Karnicnik, Blazic, Bijol, Janza; Stojanovic, Gnezda Cerin, Elsnik, Mlakar; Sporar, Sesko
