KRISTI CETA SPORT SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2023

The plan of measures foresees the tasks that all structures will perform, in order to guarantee order and public safety before, during and after the match. 

The police appeal to all fans not to commit violent acts, as they will be punished according to the penal code.
