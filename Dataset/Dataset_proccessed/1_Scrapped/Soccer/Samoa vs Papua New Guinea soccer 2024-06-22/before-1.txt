BOOKMARK

Taylor Swift spent the weekend in Edinburgh, playing record-breaking shows at the city's Murrayfield Stadium. But she's only just getting started.

Throughout the next couple of months, the Anti-Hero singer will be playing some of the country's biggest and best stadium venues. In the process, 34-year-old will be performing to hundreds of thousands of fans from all over the world.

Of course, when tickets were first released back in August 2023, they sold out extremely quickly. But there are still ways of buying tickets to some of the star's massive events in the coming weeks and months.

Taylor Swift tickets were originally released on Ticketmaster, one of her official retailers. Since then, many Swifties have flocked to resale websites such as viagogo and Vivid Seats to buy second-hand tickets to the Eras Tour.

These legitimate tickets are being sold by fans who can no longer attend their events. As a result, they are being advertised once again. However, they may be a little more expensive than the tickets' face value.

Sites such as viagogo and Vivid Seats allow fans to buy resale tickets from other fans. However, it is important to note that many event promoters say tickets should not be resold after initial purchase and will not be valid for admittance to gigs.

Fans attending live events with tickets acquired through resale websites are advised to double-check the ticket terms and conditions at the point of sale - such as Ticketmaster or Live Nation - to ensure a smooth live event experience. Tickets could be voided if they were found to be bought second-hand. As a result, fans are buying at their own risk.

With that said, viagogo also commented: "viagogo is a regulated marketplace where fans have the freedom to buy and sell tickets to their favourite live events, safely and securely, backed by a guarantee."

At the time of writing, viagogo has some of the cheapest Taylor Swift resale tickets. Certain seated tickets are being advertised for just £292 each. While others have also reached as high as £320.

Some more seated tickets for Taylor's Wembley Stadium shows are being sold for £432, as well. Whereas front standing tickets for London are being sold for £751.

Here's everything you need to know about how to get resale tickets right now.

Ticketmaster has its own resale service, which it uses to combat the rising prices of second-hand tickets. However, these resale tickets are extremely rare.

As a result, there are very few resale tickets popping up each week on Ticketmaster's resale service. You can use the link below to search for your own.
