$4k, and that’s over $1200 off!

I honestly expected it to have thermal integrated for that price, but no it has 2 different colors of reticles and is NV compatible! What am I missing?

Good to sell to the taxpayer, unless it’s the actual taxpayer buying it…

Not entirely sure, but I think it’s because you can independently zero two different reticles. So, for example, you could have one set for .300 Blackout subs and one set for supers.

It’s got titanium in it, instant up charge. Plus it has two independent reticles and zeros, that’s like having two scopes on one gun so they charge you twice.

Cheaper to just custom order an Alpha Tarac and use with any red dot/hws that you like.

Thanks for the heads-up. I'll rather go for something affordable, I won't spend 4k on the sig romeo 9t. Maybe a good deal for those who have the $$$ to spend.

it's a standout choice for serious shooters with advanced features like MOTAC motion sensing technology and multiple reticle options, If you're looking for a reliable optic that excels in various shooting scenarios, the Romeo 9T is definitely worth considering. However at that price point definitely not me.

I just don’t think $4k is justified for a red dot. That’s within $500 of the Wilcox Boss which does Avery hi by the 9T does and more (laser and illuminator to actually reduce weight on the rifle)

For $4k, it should laser range find and display on screen lol.

Every scope I own has a setting for 2 loads. It's called a paint marker and a twist of the dial lol.

If you are considering a $4k optic because you can have 2 reticles, one for “X shooting” and one for “Y shooting,” consider buying a Eotech exps, and spending the ~$3200 difference on a second rifle/optic combo…

And if it's needed on the same gun, you can simply use a quick attach mount and run 2 separate optics and still have thousands leftover.

Only makes sense if you have cash to burn and a 300BLK upper running supers and subs.

And want to save $215 dollars by not purchasing the Wilcox Boss (which has IR laser / illuminator, dual reticles, and weighs 4 oz less).

The Sig is outrageous and should be laughed at

Tell me you've never been in the same room as a wilcox boss, much less used one, without telling me

Please enlighten me! I read @TheHorta 's thread on the Boss so I can't fathom what more hands on experience would give me 

For serious, I haven't spent $4k on the Boss either which makes the 9T even more insane at $4k

First off, in my experience everything made by wilcox is garbage, and I've had the displeasure to handle more of their crap than most. Honestly it's plain out wrong that we send people off to die with this crap.

They advertise the boss as this great solution to 300 bo subs and supers which it fails at miserably. There's no way to adjust windage independently, so unless the difference in poi is just vertical you're SOL, and if it is just vertical just get an eotech 300 bo dot for 500 and get a better laser/IR separately. Theirs sucks.

If you wanna run 300 bo and you have subs and supers in different postal codes, and you use a magnifier, and you use NV, this is it for now. So pony up or go be poor somewhere else.

Not sure if it is unfortunate or not, but the kilo of coke is the “10% for the big guy.” The red dot purchaser never sees it…

Damn and I thought $800 for a T2 was insane. I hope they make another less premium version of this that just functions like a normal RDS.

I’m not saying Wilcox (or Wilcocks) is the gold standard, but seems at the price point the Boss has way more features.

Have you had subs impact meaningfully different than supers (left or right) inside 50 yds?

It’s not a poor discussion as much as it is just a reality check that is a red dot for $4k.

I guess if shooting quarters with subs and supers is your thing then it makes sense. I’d rather have a quality barrel with a reasonably heavy profile so subs and supers impact similarly

Expectations for certain products may be higher, especially when it comes to price. Although the Sig Sauer ROMEO9T Mil-Spec Red Dot offers great accuracy and functionality, everyone may have their own preferences and expectations from such sighting devices.
I myself very often fall for discounts, but then I regret it. However, it is important to remember that the value of a product is determined not only by its cost, but also by its value for money and suitability to needs.

Sadly yes, ze 300 bo is a fickle mistress and riddled with crabs, but it's still the best suppressed SBR caliber I've ever shot

fwiw OP was running a deal on the 9T for 3300 a few months ago so I went for it, didn't have to pay up front and can always cancel if something better comes along

Just my 2 cents, I've been grappling with the 300 bo sbr platform for years and there's nothing better out there for now

I’ve got a 300 blk I run only suppressed so different use case than you.

When do you find yourself switching from subs to supers and vice versa?


I hate a lot about this picture, but theoretically one dot could be zeroed to subs and one could be zeroed to supers

Yeah except not ugly. Everybody knows that looking cool is half the battle. They need to just move the features from the 8 into the body of the 9t and price it similarly to an exps3 and I'm pretty sure it would be a hit. Probably an unpopular opinion, but I'd definitely sell my Eotechs for something like that just so I don't have to think about the auto shutoff and more frequent battery changes.
