Upsets are unusual in the first round of the high school soccer playoffs, and that didn’t change when the Section 1 and Section 3 tournaments in Class 3A started Tuesday.

Every team in the Sun Thisweek and Dakota County Tribune coverage area plays in those sections. In the boys and girls tournaments in both sections, only one lower-seeded team won – the Park of Cottage Grove boys, who as a sixth seed defeated third-seeded Apple Valley 3-1. Park is the defending section champion.
