I see that Manners is releasing this new stock at SHOT Show. They are calling it the Night Stalker aka MCS-NS. I am pretty excited about it and it provides me everything I want in a night time predator setup. I will wait to see what kind of price they put on it before I get my hopes up but if it's under $1500 then I think I'll be putting an order in once they open up the order banks.

My experience is limited so maybe I just haven’t found the winning recipe but I can’t figure out why you’d want the rear flush cup so far down. Slinging the rifle with it that low always makes it want to roll over away from you. Am I missing something here?

We kicked placement around a bunch on this one, i perfer a little higher location my self, more inline with the bore, the main reason for this location is that this is a compact stock, at full collapse, it is only about a 11 lop. That means even when set at 14 lop the cup stays way forward. The first test prototype hardware set had it higher, but it was hitting the shooters cheek during recoil. Also there is ton going on with the colapsable cheek and butt hardware going in and out, you run out of usable stock area for a cup location real fast. We actuality looked at a cup on the pad hardware also, but it was also awkward. Being short and compact, the rear location actually works good.

The actuall production hardware parts have two cups, same location, one right one left.

Thank you

Is there enough clearance in the design for actions with adjustable trigger hangers or would it likely need to be sent out for inletting?

When ordered, the action inlet should come with enough room cut out for that actions hanger. Bat machine will usally need the most room, they have a front and rear hanger screw sone will beed less. I think all of are mini chassis are now updated to accept them all. With that said, it always seams there is a new action or trigger design that comes out that we need to a update on. Please tell the office when u order what you got. they will get you squared awsy. Thank you

I am interested in this as well.

Also, it appears one cannot move the shoulder pad down? Like on a three-way adjustable buttplate on a KRG, for example.

@tmanners any idea on lead times? I ordered 2 LRHs last November during the sale and actually received them both in 5-6 months, but I know guys that ordered at the same time and waited much longer.

It’s heavier then I’d like but everything else I’ve been looking for in a night time stock and I’d love to get my hands on one sooner then later.

I can definitely see why there wasn’t much of a choice on this stock specifically.

I can see why there wasn’t any choice with this stock. My comment wasn’t meant as a critique, I’m very interested in this stock. I was dead set on a LRH but this thing is too cool looking.

I just wonder if there’s a set up people use to not have the rifle roll over when slung. I’ve used a few stocks and I never see anyone mention it. Makes me feel like it’s just me lol

As of right now we will quote 6 months. We actually have pre production tooling up and running currently. We anticipated on running a huge amount of these and invested according in the production tooling to run those numbers. These will of course run out of the new process that we developed just like the LRH and the Pro Hunters. One thing we are doing different is cutting back a few options in these. I hope guys understand why. The standard configuration is pretty much fully loaded. They come with imbedded efr rails with cups, adj butt with cup, adj cheek with new quick adj feature, 7 inch arca rail, dual in-set pick rail, you get a choice with either a proof sendero or m24 barrel contour, choice of short or long action inlet and your choice of elite camo. Only additional options offered, m5 mini or new micro chassis, the efr front bridge mount and assesory rail. This will allow for much smoother production and faster run times in the shop.
I dont know if many guys have noticed, but we do offer a bunch of standard builds in the lrh and prohunters on are on line web page setup with the most popular options. We will always be a custom shop and take custom orders to your build specs. I hope guys understand they are all hand built, some will run faster some long.
Thank you

Thanks for the response. The way it comes with the bridge and probably mini chassis is all I need!

The night stalker is actually designed to be rear heavy to compensate for the additional weight of a forward mounted clip on. To acomplish this, the shell is designed to be very light, strong and rigid before hardware. Fully inleted before hardware is only about 20 to 22 ounces. Once the adj butt, cheek, efr rails with cups, 7" arca rail and dual pic rail are added, they will come in at about 2.9 lbs with a very rearward balance point. Thus is the same concept that we use on the big competition stocks like the king of 2 mile gen2 stock, by making a super light weight shell and adding the weight in the rear hardware , the overall weight stays lower, but the balance point is moved that will offset the additional weight of the night vision, or in the case of the big comp guns, a 34" long 2"dia to 1.1"dia super heavy barrel.

@tmanners looking forward to picking one up. Have always loved your stocks and really like the direction things have been headed. Also, every interaction with your customer service has been spectacular. Recently had a slight mix up by an incorrect part getting sent and you guys made it right real quick with no fuss.

Completely unrelated, negative comb PH would be my ultimate lightweight hunting stock.

I placed my order for my Pro Hunter 6 months ago and I got the email today that it's ready to ship so I imagine the six months on the new stuff will be spot on like he quoted.

Hi adisan, once we get the remington based version up and running we will look hard at doing it. But we do have something very cool in the works that contains a LRH and a micro chassis for the tikka's slated for release mid second quarter this year.

Any reason to go with the mini chassis over the micro? Does the micro do everything the mini does while shedding a few oz? Thanks for answering all the questions.

On the nightstalker i would go with with m5 mini over the micro. The micro is realy designed for the superlight builds. The night stalker is going to be a heavier build especially with a clip on, the xtra few ounces under action will not be a bad thing.

Not going to lie, this one kind of pissed me off. I just dropped $1,500 on a CS2 a few months ago and love everything about it except the butt doesnt lock up tight and has a wiggle to it. I emailed Manners about it and was told, "yea its just the way its designed" and then a few months latter this comes out and it locks up tight. I hope this is something i can send me CS2 into Manners and have updated to the new butt system.

Any word on if the CS2 can be upgraded to the new "locking" system on the NS?

Placed an order for one. The hardware comes in black not green like all the pictures have shown and they don’t offer a color change on those components. I believe someone above asked about that so I asked when I had them on the phone.

I just found out about this while looking at pics so I can try to add a bag rider to my CS. I was looking at getting a LRH for a ARC CDG long action build I will eventually get to and I think this will fit my needs better, all be it at heavier weight which might be a good thing. I think the one thing I would add would be a flush cup on the right side. I prefer to run the sling on the outside.

What is the color scheme of the the one pictured? I'm digging it.

We will start taking orders next monday. We will be back from the shot show and office will be at full staff. Thank you
Tom is the reach to the trigger the same as the tcs? I know some people with small hands struggle to reach the trigger on that stock. I happen to have little girl hands so just want make sure I’m not messing up by ordering one.

Lots of unanswered questions still floating in this thread. Any word on any of these? Maybe Tom will chime in.
