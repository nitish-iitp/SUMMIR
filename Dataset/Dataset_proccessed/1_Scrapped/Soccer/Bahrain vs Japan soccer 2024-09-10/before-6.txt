JAKARTA - The Indonesian national team coach, Shin Tae-yong, discussed the naturalization process for the two new Garuda Squad players, Mees Hilgers and Eliano Reijnders. Shin hopes that the process can be completed in November 2024 so that they can defend the team.

Mees Hilgers and Eliano Reijnders are candidates for naturalization players who have just been introduced by PSSI General Chair Erick Thohir. This certainty was discovered after Erick Thohir shared a photo with the two on Instagram on Friday, September 6, 2024.

Mees is an FC Twenty player who plays as a defender, while Eliano is a versatile player or able to play in all positions. The presence of both is expected to increase the strength of the Indonesian national team in the Third Round of the 2024 World Cup Qualification in the Asian Zone.

"The two players (Mees Hilgers and Eliano Reijnders) may not be easy to play in October 2024. However, we hope that November 2024 (they) can play," said Shin Tae-yong in a statement quoted on Monday, September 9, 2024.

The presence of Mees Hilgers and Eliano Reijnders will clearly help the squad. The reason is, the Indonesian national team is currently struggling in the Third Round of the 2026 World Cup Qualification. The Garuda squad is in Group C with Saudi Arabia, Australia, Bahrain, China, and Japan.

After making a slick debut by detaining Saudi Arabia 1-1, the Indonesian national team is currently preparing for the match against Australia. The match will be held at the Gelora Bung Karno (SUGBK) Main Stadium, Jakarta, on Tuesday, September 10, 2024.
