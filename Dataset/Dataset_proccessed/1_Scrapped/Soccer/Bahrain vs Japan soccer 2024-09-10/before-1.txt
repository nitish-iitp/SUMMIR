France face Italy in Nations League
Mbappe shrugs off criticism
Forward told he is "lying or stupid"
WHAT HAPPENED?

Mbappe sent out a strong message to his critics ahead of France's Nations League clash with Italy. On Thursday, Mbappe told reporters: "I'm at a stage in my life and my career where I don't notice anymore. I come, I play, I try to do my best, to help the team. What people think is the least of my worries."

This has not gone down well in certain sections of the French media, with journalist Daniel Riolo asserting Mbappe is either "lying or he is stupid".

WHAT KYLIAN MBAPPE'S DETRACTOR SAID

Riolo said on RMC Sport: "If you have unanimity around these remarks, it means something, you can't interpret them differently. You are clearly facing someone who has a deplorable attitude. Either he is lying or he is stupid. He can't say that he doesn't care what people think since he is a player who benefits from the services of the most cutting-edge communication agencies in Paris. If you have people who manage everything around your life, it means that you pay attention to your image and what you give. You can't say that 'People's opinions are the least of your worries' or it means that you haven't understood what is happening around you, which I don't believe."

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Mbappe has had a solid if unspectacular start at Real Madrid since moving from Paris Saint-Germain this summer. A return of three goals in five games may not be what many expected of the 25-year-old, not long after registering one goal in five matches for France at the Euros. But, the former Monaco man appears to be relaxed and seems ready to do his talking on the pitch.

WHAT NEXT?

After taking on Italy on Friday night in their Nations League opener, Mbappe's France face Belgium - a team they beat 1-0 in the last 16 of Euro 2024 - on Monday night in their second game of the competition. The French also have Israel in their Nations League group.
