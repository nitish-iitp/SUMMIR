Preview: Bahrain vs. Japan - prediction, team news, lineups

Bahrain welcome Japan to Riffa for an AFC World Cup qualifier on Tuesday fresh off the back of a stunning victory last week.

On a day of many shocks across Asia, Bahrain's win was arguably the biggest of all, as they went to Australia and took the three points against all odds.

In one of Bahrain's finest-ever results, Dragan Talajic led his side to a 1-0 win on the Gold Coast, with Harry Souttar's late own goal separating the sides.

Bahrain had lost all four previous meetings between the two, and Australia were on a run of 11 wins in 13 games, illustrating how much of a surprise the full-time result was.

Talajic may wish that the qualifying phase could end here, with Bahrain up in an automatic qualification spot for the 2026 World Cup, but sadly for them, there are still nine more matches to navigate.

Those unlikely points should give Bahrain a huge advantage in the race for fourth behind Japan, Australia and Saudi Arabia in this group though.

A fourth-place finish will advance one of the minnow nations in this section to the final group phase, which could involve many nations who have never reached the finals.

Indonesia and China are the other sides Bahrain are likely going to be challenging with for a top-four place, and even though the former won a surprise point away to Saudi Arabia last week, the win in Australia should give Talajic's men the upper hand going forward.

Their next test will be an arduous one, though, as Japan come into this match on the back of inflicting a 7-0 thrashing on China.

Japan are the only team Bahrain have lost against in their last eight matches, going out to their upcoming opponents in the round of 16 of the Asian Cup earlier this year.

However, this has not been the happiest of hunting grounds for Japan in recent visits, as they have lost two of their last three matches away to Bahrain.

Visiting optimists will look at the fact that Japan have won 10 of the other 11 meetings between the nations though, and they are huge favourites to do so again here.

With Australia and Saudi Arabia dropping points already after one game, Japan's 7-0 win sets them on course to finish in the top two, which would seal their place at the finals without the need of going through the fourth stage.

After a poor Asian Cup campaign which saw Hajime Moriyasu's side exit at the quarter-final stage to Iran, the Samurai Blue will be looking to make amends with comfortable qualification for the World Cup.

In that objective, Japan are certainly flourishing, as they have won all four games to nil since their elimination, scoring 18 goals.

After their stunning win away to Australia, Talajic is more than likely going to opt for the same starting XI that featured last week.

The one big name missing from the squad this week is Bohemians striker Abdulla Yusuf Helal, who has not been called up despite an excellent start to the season in the Czech Republic.

Despite their huge win over China, Moriyasu could make some personnel changes to the Japan team here, with Junya Ito and Daizen Maeda both making a big impact off the bench.

Maeda netted the sixth, while Ito had a hand in three of their second-half goals, and the two could be rewarded with a start here.

In an unfamiliar left wing-back role, Kaoru Mitoma still shone, but Takefusa Kubo was the star of the show, registering two assists earning him the man of the match award.

Missing out on this squad are defenders Hiroki Ito and Arsenal's Takehiro Tomiyasu, who are both injured, while Celtic striker Kyogo Furuhashi has been snubbed once more.


Bahrain possible starting lineup:
Lutfalla; Emmanuel, Baqer, Benaddi, Al-Khalasi; Madan, Haram, Al Asfoor, Marhoon; Al Aswad, Hasan

Japan possible starting lineup:
Suzuki; Itakura, Taniguchi, Machida; Ito, Morita, Endo, Mitoma; Kubo, Minamino, Maeda


We say: Bahrain 0-3 Japan

Despite a stunning victory on the road last week, lightning is unlikely to strike twice for Bahrain here, as Japan's might may well be too much for them to handle.

A 7-0 win over China on matchday one for Japan has set the standard in this group, and Moriyasu's men are resounding favourites to make it two from two.
