Hong Kong had to settle for a 2-2 World Cup qualifying draw with Turkmenistan after equalising twice and launching a late assault on the visitors’ goal, on a night of breathless, exhilarating action at the national stadium.

The only shame was that only 6,601 fans were there to see it, albeit they created the racket of a crowd 10 times that size in So Kon Po.

Ruslan Mingazov, the Kitchee winger, whose name was roundly booed before kick-off, was the almost inevitable source of both Turkmenistan goals. Wong Wai and Everton Camargo, with his fourth strike in four Hong Kong appearances, netted for the hosts.

After losing 4-0 in Iran on Thursday, Andersen made seven changes – this a game where he fancied his chances.

Hong Kong are progressing under Andersen, no question. They are energetic and brave and aggressive.

But there remains a penchant for blasting a revolver at their own feet.
