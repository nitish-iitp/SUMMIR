Morocco’s Atlas Lions, qualifying as the 2025 AFCON hosts, dominated Gabon (4-1) this Friday evening at the Grand Stade of Agadir.

The Atlas Lions opened the scoring through Hakim Ziyech (10th), who converted a penalty awarded to Abdessamad Ezzalzouli. Gabon had the chance to equalize in the 16th minute, but Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang hit the post.

A second penalty, awarded to Morocco after a foul on Soufiane Rahimi in the box, allowed Ziyech (26th) to score twice and break the deadlock for Morocco.

The Gabonese Panthers reduced the deficit 5 minutes before the end of normal first-half time through Aubameyang’s penalty. In the second half, Brahim Diaz tripled Morocco’s lead in the 59th minute. Ayoub El Kaabi (82nd) came on for Rahimi and quadrupled the Atlas Lions’ lead. Morocco, already qualified as hosts, are in Group B alongside Gabon, Central Africa and Lesotho.

The final phase of the CAN (Morocco-2025) will take place from December 21, 2025 to January 18, 2026.
