AFCON 2025 Qualifiers: Morocco Clinches 4-1 Victory Over GabonMoroccan cuisine

Rabat - Morocco kicked off their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying campaign with a convincing 4-1 win over Gabon at the Grand Stade of Agadir on Friday.

Despite already securing a spot as the tournament's host, the Atlas Lions put on a strong performance, with Hakim Ziyech delivering a standout display.Moroccan cuisine

The Galatasaray midfielder opened the scoring in the 10th minute with a Panenka-style penalty, awarded after Ez Abde was fouled in the box. Ziyech’s cheeky shot skimmed just above the ground, leaving Gabon's goalkeeper with no chance.

Moments later, Gabon star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had the opportunity to equalize from the spot but saw his effort slam against the post.

The first half was full of drama, with four penalties awarded in total. Ziyech converted his second penalty of the game, while Aubameyang redeemed himself by scoring on his second attempt, pulling Gabon back within striking distance.

However, Morocco extended their lead in the second half when Brahim Diaz netted his debut goal for the national team in the 59th minute, capping off a swift attack.

Ayoub El Kaabi, the Olympiakos forward, sealed the victory with a fourth goal in the 82nd minute, ensuring Morocco's comfortable win.

As the hosts of AFCON 2025, Morocco’s qualification is already assured, but they remain determined to dominate their group, which includes Gabon, the Central African Republic, and Lesotho.

Set to be held from December 21, 2025, to January 18, 2026, the coming continental tournament will mark Morocco’s return to the African  stage as one of the continent’s football powerhouses.

Morocco’s squad continues to build on the success of their historic fourth-place finish at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, showcasing their ambition and growing reputation in African and global football.
