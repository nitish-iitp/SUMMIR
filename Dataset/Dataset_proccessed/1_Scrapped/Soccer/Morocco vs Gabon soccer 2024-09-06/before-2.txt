Preview: Morocco vs. Gabon - prediction, team news, lineups

Morocco will host Gabon at the Stade Adrar on Friday in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, aiming to extend their winning streak to three matches across all competitions.

As the hosts of the next edition of this tournament which will hold in 2025, Morocco's participation in these qualifiers is merely a formality.

Morocco's reputation has soared following their impressive performance at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where they became the first African nation to reach the semi-finals.

Despite being among the favourites at the 2023 AFCON, they were eliminated in the round of 16 after losing 2-0 to South Africa.

Still under the guidance of Walid Regragui, the Atlas Lions have returned to winning ways, securing victories over Zambia (2-1) and Congo (6-0) in recent FIFA World Cup qualifying matches.

Olympiacos forward Ayoub El Kaabi was the star of the show against Congo, scoring a hat trick, while Azzedine Ounahi, Chadi Riad and Soufiane Rahimi were also on the scoresheet.

While Morocco's participation in the next AFCON is already guaranteed, they will use these qualifiers as preparation for the tournament.

The Atlas Lions have won the AFCON title only once in their history, in 1976 when the competition featured a round-robin format for the final four to determine the winner, instead of a knockout stage – the second (1959 being the first) and final time the round-robin format was used.

Gabon will be eager to secure their place in the AFCON, competing in a group that also includes Lesotho and the Central African Republic.

The Panthers, who missed out on the last edition, have appeared nine times in the tournament with their best results coming in 1996 and 2012, reaching the quarterfinals on both occasions.

Thierry Mouyouma's team has shown good form in World Cup qualifying, winning three out of four matches, including a 3-2 victory over Gambia in their last match.

Former Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Jim Allevinah, and Denis Bouanga were key to the win, with all three getting on the scoresheet.

Historically, Gabon has a positive record against Morocco, with four wins, two draws, and two losses in 10 encounters, while they are unbeaten in their last two meetings.

Regragui has extended call-ups to West Ham's Nayef Aguerd and Ounahi, who has just sealed a loan deal to Greek side Panathinaikos FC, despite both players struggling for playing time at their clubs.

After his heroics against Congo, El Kaabi will be hoping to retain his place as the focal point of Morocco's attack ahead of Fenerbahce's Youssef En-Nesyri.

As for Gabon, the front trio of Aubameyang, Allevinah, and Bouanga are all included in the squad and will be looking to make the difference once again.

Wolverhampton Wanderers' Mario Lemina is expected to anchor the midfield alongside Guelor Kanga and Medwin Biteghe.


Morocco possible starting lineup:
Bounou; Hakimi, Aguerd, Saiss, Allah; Ounahi, Azzouzi; Ziyech, Diaz, Seghir; En-Nesyri

Gabon possible starting lineup:
Noubi; Obiang, Appindangoye, Ecuele Manga, Oyono; Biteghe, Kanga, Lemina; Bouanga, Allevinah, Aubameyang



We say: Morocco 1-1 Gabon

Morocco have already secured qualification to the AFCON as hosts, which could affect their zeal in this game as it will only be a preparatory game for them. Combined with their struggles against Gabon, this is why we think that the visitors can get a result here.
