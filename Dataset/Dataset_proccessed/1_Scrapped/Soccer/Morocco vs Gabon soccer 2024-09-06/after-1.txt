Morocco secured a hard-fought 4-1 victory over Gabon on Friday as part of the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers at the Agadir Stadium.

The game kicked off with Morocco dominating possession early on, and their efforts bore fruit in the 11th minute when Hakim Ziyech scored a penalty kick with a precise shot that left Gabon’s goalkeeper helpless. Morocco’s lead was further extended in the 26th minute as Ziyech converted a penalty with a clinical finish.

Gabon attempted to rally, and their persistence paid off just before halftime. In the 41st minute, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang struck a powerful shot from the left, redeeming himself after a missed penalty earlier in the match.

Despite the goal, Gabon’s fortunes were marred by a missed penalty opportunity when Aubameyang’s attempt in the 17th minute was off target.

The second half saw Gabon scale their offensive efforts. However, the Moroccan side held the line, repelling numerous attacks. The 60th minute brought another breakthrough for Morocco as Brahim Diaz scored with a left-footed shot from the center of the area, marking his first goal with the Atlas Lion.

As the match progressed, Gabon made several tactical changes, substituting key players including Shavy Babicka and Brimau Nziengui in hopes of turning the tide. Despite the changes and a late push in the 71st minute, Morocco’s defense held firm.

In the 82nd minute, Kaabi further cemented Morocco’s win with a beautiful left-footed shot from close range from the left side that found the center of the goal.

With the win, Morocco secured three points in the Group B. The team will face off against Lesotho on Monday.
