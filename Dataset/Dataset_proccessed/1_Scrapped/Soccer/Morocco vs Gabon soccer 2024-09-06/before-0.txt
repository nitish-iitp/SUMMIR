Bruxy Cavey delivers a sermon at a movie theatre in Kitchener in 2006.

The Record
By Michael Coren Contributor

Rev. Michael Coren is a Toronto writer. His memoir, “Heaping Coals,” can be preordered now.

Note: Two remaining sexual assault charges against Bruxy Cavey were withdrawn in a Hamilton courtroom Wednesday Sept. 4, 2024.

The Meeting House, one of the largest churches in Canada, has announced that it is closing down. “It is with sadness that we are required to bring the public-facing ministry of The Meeting House to an end as of August 29,” its leaders stated on the Oakville-based church’s website. “Going forward, there will no longer be churches operating programs or doing ministry under the banner of The Meeting House” but “new missional churches” will be launched.

Opinion articles are based on the author’s interpretations and judgments of facts, data and events. More details
