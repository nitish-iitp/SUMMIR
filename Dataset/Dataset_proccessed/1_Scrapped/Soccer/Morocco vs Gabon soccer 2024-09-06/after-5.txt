Morocco will face off against Gabon today as part of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers. The match will take place at the Grand Stade in Agadir at 8 p.m.

The match is highly anticipated, with Morocco looking to assert its dominance, while Gabon will attempt to defy the odds.

Since their last encounter with Gabon in October 2019, where they suffered a surprising 3-2 defeat, the Atlas Lions have been on an upward trajectory.

Their awe-inspiring run to fourth place in the 2022 Qatar World Cup and their monumental victory against Brazil in a March 2023 friendly have solidified their status as a force to be reckoned with. The squad hasn’t lost a competitive match at home since that defeat against Gabon in 2019.

Meanwhile, Gabon faces an uphill battle following their underwhelming 2024 run. The Panthers lost two matches and won only one out of four competitive games.

Their 3-0 defeat to Senegal in a March friendly further casts doubt on their chances. However, the team is likely to benefit from the presence of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who scored in Gabon’s recent 3-2 win over Gambia.

Probable Lineups
Morocco:

Experts from Goal expect Walid Regragui to adopt a balanced 4-2-3-1 formation, blending defensive and attacking tactics.

Morocco starting lineup: Bounou; Hakimi, Aguerd, Abqar, Dari; Abdelhamid, Amrabat; El Khannouss, Ounahi, Ziyech; Ben Seghir.

Gabon:

Thierry Mouyouma is expected to adopt a more aggressive 4-3-3 formation.
Gabon starting lineup: Mbaba; Oyono, Ekomie, Moucketou, Manga; Ngouali, Kanga, Lemina; Bouanga, Allevinah, Aubameyang.

Predictions

The Atlas Lions are widely expected to continue their winning streak against Gabon and secure a comfortable win. Experts set the likelihood of a Morocco victory at 77%, with a 50% chance of the Moroccan side finding the back of the net three times or more.

The win is critical to restoring morale for Moroccan fans following the team’s underwhelming performance in the 2024 AFCON, where they lost 2-0 to South Africa in the Round of 16.
