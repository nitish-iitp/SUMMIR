JAKARTA - Good news came for the Indonesian national team ahead of the match against Vietnam at the My Dinh Stadium, Tuesday, March 26, 2024. Rafael Struick was confirmed to have followed the group to Hanoi.

Struick flew to Hanoi on Monday, March 25, 2024, at 14.00 WIB, following the Garuda Squad which will undergo the second round of the 2026 Asian Zone Qualification World Cup against Vietnam.

The naturalized player was actually still in Indonesia when the entire squad departed on Saturday, March 23, 2024.

Struick did not join the group due to health problems. He had a stelah fever that helped the Indonesian national team win 1-0 over Vietnam at the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium, Thursday, March 21, 2024.

However, on Monday (25/3/2024) his condition recovered so Struick immediately followed his colleagues in Hanoi. This was conveyed by PSSI through PSSI Executive Committee Member Arya Sinulingga.

"Earlier, in accordance with the direction of the PSSI General Chair, Erick Thohir, after seeing Rafael's condition (Struick) getting better and asking us to dispatch Rafael. Today (25/3/2024), Rafael will leave for Hanoi at 14.00 WIB directly," said Arya Sinulingga in a statement quoted Monday, March 25, 2024.

"We also quickly gave a ticket to Rafael. Hopefully he can recover his physical condition so that tomorrow (26/3/2024) can strengthen the Indonesian national team. Let's pray together so that Rafael can strengthen the Indonesian national team," said Arya Sinulingga.

The joining of Struick with his colleagues is a breath of fresh air for Shin Tae-yong. The reason is, the match against Vietnam is very important in order to open up opportunities to qualify for the third round of the 2026 Asian Zone World Cup Qualification.
