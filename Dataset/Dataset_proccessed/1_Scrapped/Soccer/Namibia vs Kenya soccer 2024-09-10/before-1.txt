Preview: Namibia vs. Kenya - prediction, team news, lineups

Namibia and Kenya return to action in Group J of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers when they go head to head at the Orlando Stadium on Tuesday.

This will be the first meeting between the two sides since September 2013, when the Harambee Stars picked up a 1-0 victory at the Moi International Sports Complex courtesy of David Owino Odhiambo's fifth-minute strike.

Namibia were guilty of a lack of cutting edge in front of goal in Saturday's opening game against Cameroon as they fell to a 1-0 defeat against the Elephants at the Roumde Adjia Stadium.

Following a goalless first half, Veteran striker Vincent Aboubakar delivered the goods once again as he broke the deadlock in the 65th minute to fire Cameroon to all three points.

Having suffered a humbling 5-0 loss against Angola in the 2024 COSAFA Cup final on July 7, Namibia have lost back-to-back games for the first time since October 2021, when they were beaten twice by Senegal in their World Cup qualifying double-header.

Collin Benjamin's side will now look to bounce back from their opening-day disappointment and get their qualifying campaign up and running as they aim to secure consecutive AFCON appearances for the first time.

Namibia booked their spot in the knockout stages of the 2023 AFCON in January after picking up four points from three matches in Group E to finish as one of the best third-placed sides before falling to a 3-0 loss against Angola in the round of 16 on January 27.

Kenya, on the other hand, are seeking their first AFCON appearance since 2019, when they crashed out in the group stages after picking up three points from a possible nine to finish third in Group C.

However, the Harambee Stars were denied a dream start to their quest for a place in Morocco on Friday as they played out a goalless draw with Zimbabwe when the two nations squared off at the Mandela National Stadium.

This followed a heartbreaking run in the COSAFA Cup back in July, when Kenya crashed out in the group stage despite picking up six points from their three matches to finish second in Group B.

Following Friday's result against Zimbabwe, Engin Firat's men are now unbeaten in eight of their last nine matches across all competitions, claiming five wins and three draws while scoring 17 goals and keeping six clean sheets since last November.

Kenya, who are 108th in the latest FIFA World Rankings, will have to show their mettle at the Orlando Stadium as they take on an opposing side who have won four of the last six meetings between the two teams since October 1996.

Despite their loss against Cameroon, we expect Benjamin to field an unchanged starting XI, meaning that Riaan Hanamub, Ngero Katua, Kennedy Amutenya, Charles Hambira and Ivan Kamberipa should form the back five once again.

Peter Shalulile has netted 16 goals in 49 senior caps since his debut in September 2014 and the Mamelodi Sundowns striker should lead the Namibia attack, while Aprocius Petrus and Moses Shidolo should team up in midfield.

As for Kenya, Alphonce Omija was forced off with a 21st-minute injury against Zimbabwe at the weekend and the 21-year-old defender is a major doubt for Tuesday's clash.

In his absence, Ararat-Armenia man Amos Nondi will push for a starting role, teaming up with Sylvester Owino, Erick Otieno and skipper Joseph Okumu at the defensive end of the pitch.

Up top, we expect an unchanged attacking duo of Rooney Onyangon and Eric Omondi, while Duke Abuya, Anthony Akumu, Richard Odada and Austin Odhiambo retain their roles in the centre of the park.


Namibia possible starting lineup:
Maova; Hanamub, Katua, Amutenya, Hambira, Kamberipa; Hotto, Petrus, Shidolo, Tjiueza; Shalulile

Kenya possible starting lineup:
Odhiambo; Nondi, Owino, Okumu, Otieno; Abuya, Akumu, Odada, Odhiambo; Onyangon, Omondi


We say: Namibia 0-1 Kenya

Kenya have put together a solid run of results this year and will be looking to build on their stalemate against Zimbabwe on Tuesday. While we expect Namibia to put up a fight, we are backing the Harambee Stars to come away with a narrow victory at the Orlando Stadium.
