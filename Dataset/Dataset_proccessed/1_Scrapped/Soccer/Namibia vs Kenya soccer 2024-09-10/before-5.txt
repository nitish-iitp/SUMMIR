Preview: Zimbabwe vs. Cameroon - prediction, team news, lineups

The Mandela National Stadium will play host to Zimbabwe and Cameroon when they face off in their second Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on Tuesday evening.
 
Zimbabwe could only manage one point from their opening qualifying fixture against Kenya, but Cameroon will head to Kampala on a high having beaten Namibia in their most recent encounter.

Administrative issues forced Zimbabwe to miss out on the last AFCON qualifying campaign, and they will be keen to make an impression this time around, having been drawn in Group J alongside Kenya, Namibia and Cameroon.
 
Michael Nees's men got the ball rolling with a goalless stalemate against Kenya on Friday in a game where neither team really did enough to come away with maximum points, boasting just one shot on target apiece.
 
A second straight goalless outing would have been disappointing for The Warriors, but recording a third clean sheet in four matches certainly offers some optimism for a side who were so defensively porous earlier this year.
 
Zimbabwe were breached on a whooping 10 occasions in their opening four matches and lost three times with the exception of a penalty-shootout triumph over Zambia in the Four Nations Football Tournament.
 
Despite nine previous editions of this fixture, Tuesday's meeting marks the first AFCON qualifying matchup between the sides, although they already met in the competition proper 20 years ago when Zimbabwe fell to a 5-3 defeat in the group stages.

Amid a dramatic turn of events leading up to the game, Cameroon showed great mettle to get the job done against Namibia courtesy of a narrow 1-0 triumph at the Japoma Stadium in Douala.
 
A power tussle regarding location issues between the national football federation president Samuel Eto'o and Prime Minister Joseph Ngute put Saturday's game under huge doubt before a resolution was reached a few hours before kickoff.
 
AFCON 2022 leading goalscorer Vincent Aboubakar was on target 20 minutes into the second period to secure all three points for Rigobert Song's men in a keenly contested affair.
 
Consequently, the Indomitable Lions have now emerged victorious from two of their last three competitive outings, either side of a 1-1 stalemate against Angola in their most recent World Cup qualifying fixture.
 
With their off-field issues showing no signs of going away any time soon, Cameroon must now remain focused on the pitch as they look to qualify for a sixth straight AFCON tournament off the back of consecutive no-shows in 2012 and 2013.

Vincent Aboubakar grabbed his 39th international goal last time out, moving him just four strikes shy of the legendary Roger Milla in second place on Cameroon's all-time scoring chart.
 
Aboubakar also recorded his 102nd cap for the away side and now sits joint-fourth in Cameroon history with Emmanuel Kunde, only behind Geremi Njitap, Samuel Eto'o and Rigobert Song.
 
Twenty-seven-year-old Nouhou Tolo could miss out here with his fitness currently hanging in the balance after coming off with an injury scare against Namibia.

Making a sensational return to the international scene after a three-year absence, Khama Billiat was thrown straight into the thick of things for Zimbabwe against Kenya.
 
Teenage Hadebe's exclusion from the starting lineup in the aforementioned game was somewhat surprising, and the defender could be set for an immediate return to action.


Zimbabwe possible starting lineup:
Arubi; Takwara, Zemura, Murwira, Garananga; Munetsi, Rinomhota; Chirewa, Billiat, Musona; Dube

Cameroon possible starting lineup:
Onana; Kilama, Wooh, Ngadeu, Tchatchoua; Baleba, Hongla, Anguissa; Bassogog, Aboubakar, Mbeumo




We say: Zimbabwe 1-2 Cameroon

Cameroon have often enjoyed the better of this fixture having lost just one of the previous nine meetings.

We expect more of the same here with the away side narrowly edging out their hosts to secure maximum points.
