Namibia were beaten in their first qualifier

Namibia and Kenya lock horns at the Orlando Stadium in neutral South Africa on Tuesday for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. Neither side won their opening game of the campaign last week and will be looking to bounce back here.

Ranked 98th in the world, the Warriors lost 1-0 to Cameroon on matchday one. Vincent Aboubakar struck the only goal of the game in the 65th minute as the visitors saw their resistance broken.

It was their second consecutive loss in all competitions and extended their winless run to three games, failing to score in each of them too. After a gap of four years, Namibia qualified for the 2023 AFCON this year, wherein they reached the last 16.

The side will be aiming for bigger things at the Moroccan showpiece next year, but they will have to recover from this early setback and get their qualification campaign up and running before it's too late.

Meanwhile, Kenya played out a 0-0 draw with Zimbabwe in their first qualifier match. The Harambee Stars were stoic in defense once again, picking up their second clean sheet in a row, but they struggled offensively.

Engin Fırat's side have enjoyed a good year overall though, losing just one of eight games so far, and will be aiming to return to winning ways here as a first AFCON qualification since 2019 is on the line for them.

Namibia vs Kenya Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
There have been six clashes between the sides in the past, with Kenya winning twice and losing four times.
Each of the last three encounters between the sides have seen the winning team win by 1-0: Kenya in September 2008, their opponents in June 2012 and Kenya again in September 2013 (all three came in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers).
The sides are meeting for the first time in 11 years.
In seven official games this year, the Kenyans have lost just once: a 2-0 defeat to Comoros at the 2024 COSAFA Cup.
Namibia vs Kenya Prediction

The Harambee Stars are the favorites here despite their patchy run lately, but they also possess some quality attacking options that can hurt their opponents. We're betting on them to come away with a win, albeit narrowly.

Prediction: Namibia 0-1 Kenya
