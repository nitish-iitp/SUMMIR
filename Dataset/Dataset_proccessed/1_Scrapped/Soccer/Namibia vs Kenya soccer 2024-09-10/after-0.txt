Harambee Stars Shine in a Gripping 2-1 Victory Over Namibia
 September 10, 2024  Communications

Harambee Stars claimed a 2-1 win over Namibia in their 2025 AFCON Qualifier on Tuesday, September 10, 2024, at Orlando Stadium, South Africa.

The first half saw both teams locked in a defensive battle, with neither side able to break the deadlock, resulting in a goalless half.

After the break, John Avire opened the scoring for Kenya in the 57th minute with a well-executed free-kick that left the Namibian defense rooted.

In the 76th minute, a swift counter-attack led by Eric Ouma saw him set up Duke Abuya, who calmly netted Kenya’s second goal, putting the match beyond Namibia’s reach.

Though Namibia managed to pull one back in the 94th minute through Deon Hotto’s goal , it was too little, too late, and Harambee Stars sealed the match with a 2-1 victory.

Harambee Stars currently tops Group J with 4 points.

Next, Kenya will face Cameroon in their home-and-away fixtures in October for the ongoing 2025 AFCON Qualifiers.
