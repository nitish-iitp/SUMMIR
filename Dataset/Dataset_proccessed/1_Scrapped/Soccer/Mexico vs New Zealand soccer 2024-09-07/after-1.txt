MEXICO DEFEATS NEW ZEALAND 3-0 IN FRONT OF NEAR EMPTY ROSE BOWL

Pasadena, CA – On a sweltering 98-degree day, Mexico faced off against New Zealand in a sparsely populated Rose Bowl. Mexico’s “El Tri” took an early lead, with Orbelín Pineda netting a right-footed shot from the center of the box to the bottom left corner in the 5th minute. Roberto Alvarado set up the play with a well-placed header, showcasing Mexico’s quick offensive start.

Throughout the first half, Mexico maintained control of the game, dominating possession with 57.2 percent of the ball. Their control stifled New Zealand’s offense, limiting them to zero shots on goal. Mexico’s midfield consistently disrupted New Zealand’s attempts to build momentum, while their defense remained impenetrable, giving New Zealand few opportunities to challenge their backline. Despite the sparse crowd, Mexico’s early dominance suggested confidence and composure on the field.

As the second half kicked off, Mexico ramped up the intensity, relentlessly pressuring New Zealand and showing no signs of letting up. Their aggressive strategy bore fruit in the 53rd minute when 23-year-old César “El Chino” Huerta unleashed a clinical right-footed strike from close range, driving the ball into the center of the goal. The play leading up to this moment was a masterclass in precision, with Luis Romo delivering a perfectly timed cross that set up Huerta’s decisive finish.

Barely four minutes later, Mexico further solidified their dominance. In the 57th minute, Luis Romo, a dynamic force in both attack and midfield, unleashed a precise right-footed shot from outside the box, slotting the ball into the bottom right corner with finesse. This goal not only highlighted Romo’s exceptional technical skill but also the seamless flow of Mexico’s offensive play. Orbelín Pineda, who had been instrumental throughout the match, provided another assist, underscoring his remarkable vision and playmaking talent.

The rapid-fire goals within a few minutes left New Zealand reeling, struggling to regain their footing. Mexico’s ability to transition fluidly from midfield to attack, coupled with their sharp finishing, exposed New Zealand’s defensive weaknesses and left them floundering under relentless pressure.

The official attendance was reported as 25,271, though the actual crowd seemed much smaller. This gap between the announced and visible turnout could be due to several reasons, such as the difference between tickets sold and how many people actually showed up. Venues often count all sold tickets, even if not everyone attends. Additionally, there may have been a fan boycott at play, possibly driven by frustrations with team management, high ticket prices, or other factors. The intense heat or the nature of the matchup might have also kept some fans away.
