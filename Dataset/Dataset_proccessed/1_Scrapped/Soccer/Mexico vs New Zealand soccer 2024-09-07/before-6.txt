INTERNATIONAL PREVIEW | ROYALS REPRESENTING THEIR COUNTRY

Share

ROYALS AROUND THE WORLD

The opening month of the season has come and gone, and with a two week break from League One football, three of our stars have hit the skies to represent their nation across Europe and beyond.

There's no friendly action in this round of matches, with the trio's fixtures all set to be in competitive tournament action, and you can read below to see what's ahead:

BASIL TUMA - MALTA U21

Our young forward kicks off the action in the international break as his Maltese side make the long trip to Kazakhstan for a Euro Under 21 qualification tie. The trip East is closely followed with a home tie against Scotland U21.

The matches are the penultimate batch before the end of the group stage, with Tuma's side looking to pick up their first point in the qualification phase. In his country's last outing in the group, Tuma impressed in the away tie with Belgium where his pace won a penalty that was duly converted by his teammate Andrea Zammit.

Kazakhstan U21 v Malta U21	Thursday 5th September 2024, 2pm (UK Time)	European Under-21 Championship qualification
Malta U21 v Scotland U21	Tuesday 10th September, 5.30pm (UK Time)	European Under-21 Championship qualification
CONIAH BOYCE-CLARKE - JAMAICA

Coniah Boyce-Clarke has been called up to Steve McClaren's maiden Jamaica squad for their upcoming CONCACAF Nations League ties with Cuba and Honduras.

The opening tie will see Coniah and the Reggae Boyz enjoy home advantage at Independence Park in Kingston, before a flight across the Caribbean sea for an away tie with Honduras follows.

Coniah's Nation picked up Third Place in the last iteration of the competition, and will be looking to improve upon a positive showing last time out.

Jamaica v Cuba	Saturday 7th September 2024, 1am (UK Time)	CONCACAF Nations League
Honduras v Jamaica	Wednesday 11th September, 3am (UK Time)	CONCACAF Nations League
CHARLIE SAVAGE - WALES

Charlie Savage completes the line-up of international Royals this break, with the Welshman looking to continue his goalscoring run of three goals since the season got up and running.

His Wales side are in contention to qualify for next summer's European Under-21 Championship, and will travel to Iceland knowing a victory could go a long way to securing at least a Play-Off berth.

Iceland v Wales	Tuesday 10th September 2024, 5.30pm (UK Time)	European Under-21 Championship qualification
TYLER BINDON - NEW ZEALAND

New Zealand international Tyler Bindon has been called up to the White Caps' squad for their friendlies with Mexico and the USA, but has withdrawn due to medical reasons.
