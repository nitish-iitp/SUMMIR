Tuesday evening, playing in their first ever Big South Conference matchup, the Tri-City United girls soccer team faced off against defending conference champs St. Peter. The Saints looked every bit the team that was advertised with speed and experience across the board and a 4-0 halftime lead resulted in a 6-1 victory for St. Peter.
