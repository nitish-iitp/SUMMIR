Lithuania are aiming to win the cup after 2010

Lithuania host Estonia at the Darius and Girėnas Stadium in Kaunas on Tuesday in the final of the 2024 Baltic Cup, aiming for their first title in the mini-tournament since 2010.

Ranked 137th in the world, Lithuania overcame Latvia in the semi-finals to get here. Second-half goals from Armandas Kucys and Artūr Dolžnikov earned them a 2-0 victory away from home.

It also extended the side's winning run to three games in all competitions, with Luthania previously beating Gibraltar in a pair of 1-0 wins in the 2022-23 UEFA Nations League relegation play-outs in League C.

Meanwhile, Estonia are in their third final in the last four editions of the Baltic Cup. Having finished runners-up in the 2018 edition, the Blueshirts made amends two years later by going all the way to lift their fourth title in the competition.

Jürgen Henn's side are looking to make it five and will be feeling confident of their chances following a 4-1 win over the Faroe Islands in the semi-finals. Petur Knudsen put Faroe Islands in front after 24 minutes, but Alex Tamm, Henri Anier, Edgar Tur and Danil Kuraksin all struck apiece to give Estonia a huge win; their first in all competitions since January 2023.
