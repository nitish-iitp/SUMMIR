Anyone know where I can get some 66%(or 2/3rd) IPSC C zone only (not full silhouette) AR 500 steel targets? A full C zone is roughly 12"x24" with a 6"x6" head box. The ones I have are "9x18" with a 4"x4" head box. I find lots of full size C zone, or 66% whole silhouette, but not what I'm looking for.

I purchased a couple several years back, but now can't find any. Looking for single hole hook hanger mount. I find this to be my perfect size for training purposes at various distances.

I’m a little confused by your wording regarding 66%, but there are a number of companies offering various sizes of C-zone steel.

Two different sizes.

Reduced 2/3rd size is what I'm looking for. I can find full size in 100 different places.

Call d&m targets ask for Seth. Tell him what you want and I'm sure if you order enough he will program it up and make it for you.

Have you done any searching yourself or are just expecting us to do all the work for you?

Here’s what you asked for:

Well, no its not. It's still not a 4''x4" head box. They are insanely proud of that target set up. All I need is the plate, with a single hanger hook hole. And yeah, I just threw this up without bothering to google 

I have two of what I'm asking for. I can't find them anymore. I most likely bought them off ebay, and the seller no longer makes them.

Maybe so. I'm also not paying $300 plus when all I need is a $100 plate

Its not a $100 plate if no one makes it for $100. Be less picky or pony up are your options.
