Our prediction for this Nations League match:

Netherlands

	

Match Time & Date:

07/09/2024

20:45

Prediction: 3-1

	

Bosnia Herzegovina

Philips Stadion will be packed when Netherlands and Bosnia Herzegovina take on each other in their Nations League opener. The Oranje aim to recover from the EURO 2024 defeat to England and they will not have a better chance than this to return to winning ways. Memphis Depay remains in the recovery room, alongside Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong, while PSV forward Noah Lang is back to contention.

The Balkan Dragons, on the other hand, are on a six-game losing run in all competitions and seeing that Netherlands are a real force to be reckoned with at home, we are tempted to put our money on the Oranje. Ifet Djakovac and Esmir Barjaktarevic are the new names in Sergej Barbarez’s team. As always, the opposition defenders should have Fenerbahce striker Edin Dzeko at bay. In their last meeting in a competitive match Netherlands defeated Bosnia 3-1.

HIGHLIGHTED PLAYER (MEMPHIS DEPAY):

Memphis Depay is a Dutch winger who started his professional career at PSV Eindhoven. During the 2014/2015 Eredivisie campaign the pacey footballer was on Manchester United’s radar and on June 12, 2015 the Premier League club confirmed the signing of the Dutchman. Many people expected that he would impress in the 2015/2016 Premier League season, but the former PSV ace played below expectations for the Red Devils, scoring only two goals (one assist) during the season.

After playing only for league games for Man Utd in the 2016/2017 season, Memphis Depay was sold to Olympique Lyon on January 20, 2017. Depay signed a four-and-a-half year deal with les Gones for a fee of around £16 million. The Dutch winger was producing fine performances for Lyon in the 2016/2017 season; he scored five goals for the club, while providing eight assists for his teammates.

Memphis Depay made his senior debut for Netherlands on October 15, 2013 in a 2-0 win over Turkey. Depay did well to win the 2011 European Championship with Netherlands U17 team.
