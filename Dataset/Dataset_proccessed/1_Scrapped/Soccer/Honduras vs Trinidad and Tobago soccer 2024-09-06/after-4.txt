Jamaica face Cuba in the Nations League on Friday

Jamaica welcome Cuba to Independence Park for a CONCACAF Nations League clash on Friday (September 6th). The hosts have not been in action since falling to a 3-0 defeat to Venezuela in the Copa America in July 2024.

All three goals were scored in the second half, with Eduard Bello, Salomon Rondon and Eric Ramirez finding the back of the net to help La Vinotinto claim all three points.

Cuba, meanwhile, fell to a 3-1 defeat away to Honduras in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier in June 2024. They took the lead through Maykel Reyes' 22nd-minute strike but Anthony Lozano drew the game level for Honduras in the 26th minute. Edwin Rodriguez put the hosts ahead in first half injury time while Rubilio Castillo made sure of the result in the 82nd minute.

Jamaica vs Cuba Prediction

Jamaica had a Copa America to forget as they lost all three games played in the USA, scoring just one goal and conceding seven. The Reggae Boyz will have to put that behind them as they aim to make it out of the Nations League group stage for the second consecutive season.

Cuba have lost four of the last five head-to-head games and are the underdogs once again despite having a superior record in this fixture historically.

We are backing the home side to claim a comfortable victory in addition to a clean sheet.

Prediction: Jamaica 3-0 Cuba
