Chris Gonzalez-Muniz recently received a private invitation to try out for MLS Next Real Colorado, a high-level club team that would create a pathway to semi-pro and professional offers, causing him to miss MHS's season opener against Rifle. Gonzalez-Muniz ultimately decided to finish out his time at MHS and play for the Red Hawks — and scored the team's first goal in its match against Delta a few days later.

In the 2024 season opener for the Montrose boys soccer team, there was a bit of a perfect storm working against the Red Hawks.

Like Montrose, Rifle had a large group of returning contributors from last season. Unlike Montrose, all those players were suited up for the game on Aug. 29, a game that the Red Hawks lost 2-1.
