Owensboro High School might have had a slow first half, but it picked up speed in the second half against Apollo.

OHS put together a 6-0 boys soccer win Thursday night at Shifley Park. The Red Devils are 7-1-2 on the season and 3-1 in the 9th District.

The Red Devils got two goals each from Ryan Sovar and Byaruhanga Mutabazi. Brian Payne scored the first goal for OHS, and Peter Mbayo also had a goal for the Devils.

All four of those players had one assist each, and Broderick Divine and Patrick Alexander also put up an assist each for OHS.

Mbayo scored from 25 yards, and both of Sovar’s goals were from 20 yards or more.

The OHS goals in the second half came in the 51st minute and 55th minute. There was then a flurry at the finish of goals in the 75th and 77th minutes (both of Sovar’s), and in the 78th minute.

“We’ve got some good finishers on this team, got some kids who can really stretch the field, some hard-nosed midfielders, I’m happy with what we got,” OHS coach Ryan Haley said. “They’ve had a long week, practice Monday, game Tuesday, practice Wednesday, game Thursday. They’ve got two games Saturday.”

Landon Black was at keeper for OHS and he made three saves and recorded his fifth shutout.

OHS took 20 shots on goal. Apollo managed four shots on goal. The Eagles were the aggressor in the first half, and Haley wanted that changed in the second half.

“Kids are funny, sometimes they show up ready to go, and sometimes they don’t,” Haley said. “At halftime we talked about sometimes other teams are just better than us, and we have to face that reality. They didn’t like hearing that, they came out in the second half and brought more effort and more composure.

“It seemed like they didn’t want to take Apollo seriously. The fact is Apollo can get you if you sleep on them. You have to give full effort. In the first half I thought they outplayed us to be honest. I liked how we responded in the second half. We got some guys in the game, we used more than we did last time we played Apollo.”

Apollo dropped to 4-4 on the season.
