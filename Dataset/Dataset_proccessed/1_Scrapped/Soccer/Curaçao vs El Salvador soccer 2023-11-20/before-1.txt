Hi, I'm a little new to OC and my boss kinda threw this task at me for me to sort out. I have a background in CS, so I have tried to look at the backend of our OC instance to try and figure this out. Not much luck.

OC info
Version: 3.0.3.2
Theme: Custom theme (it shouldn't be causing problems? It's just different CSS from what I can tell).
Extensions: we have a few 3rd party extensions installed from the marketplace, but I can't tell which ones are 3rd party and which ones are OC native.

The issue I need to resolve is that when editing customer details, the region / state keeps getting lost. EG:

1. Customers -> Customers
2. Edit client
3. change details / reset password from admin panel
4. Save details to get error: !Warning: Please check the form carefully for errors!
5. We find that the region/ state is blank and no options available

The current workaround I have found is select another country, reselect the customer's actual country, then select the correct region / state. But this means referential information needs to be available to the admin staff, which our client is not happy about (a lot of cross referencing, human errors occurring).

I have tried googling around to find other solutions or workarounds. The only other solution I've found was to remove zone or region requirement. This is not a valid solution since the client does require the address for shipping information.

I should also mention, if a customer has multiple addresses, this issue exists for all addresses (not just default).

I don't think this is a bug in a fresh install of that version of OpenCart, so it must be a custom code change or extension.

You could try disabling the extensions one-by-one until the problem disappears and then the one that you disabled last is the problem.

Okay, thanks for confirming this isn't a bug. I'll try troubleshooting the modules today (there appears to be a lot). Thanks for the advice!

It can be worth having an OpenCart support agency on hand if there are on-going things that need to be fixed/added.

We generally are able to manage on our own, it's just that I'm taking over for this client and I'm learning OpenCart. I don't think my boss wants to spend money on support.

That being said, my senior found the issue, turns out CloudFlare's RocketLoader addon was causing the issue. Apparently it rearranges how the JS is loaded and so it doesn't load customer profiles properly, turning off the addon for this client fixed the issue.

Thanks so much for your time and for responding to my query!

And thanks for updating this post with the cause - that will help the community!

If you could now add [SOLVED] to the start of the post title that would be great.
