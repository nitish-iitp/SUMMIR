Did they shut it down or is it just overwhelmed with work?

We didn't receive any email notifications regarding a shutdown of that system.
Of course, that doesn't mean schit.

Okay, here’s the reasoning behind it then. Political pressure on the Republocrats.

“The system, crucial for processing applications for silencers, short-barrel rifles, and other NFA items, reportedly closed due to Congressional budgeting concerns, leaving many to question the timing and reasoning behind the decision.”

And

“In the months leading up to the shutdown, the eForms system saw a notable increase in the speed of application approvals. This efficiency led to speculation that the ATF might have been attempting to clear a backlog of applications before taking the system offline. The sudden halt in operations has transformed initial excitement over rapid approvals into concern over future delays and the impact on customer service. Congressional records emphasize the importance of prioritizing funding for the NFA Division to enhance processing times and address mounting backlogs, highlighting the critical nature of the eForms system to the firearms licensing process.”

Biden admin is using it to try and force a vote in their favor. There has been no government shutdown despite all the hue and cry that there will be.

It’s just politics as usual.

Of course this happens one day after I read about all the 3-4 day approval times, decide to jump on the bandwagon, and buy another suppressor.

Just got this pop-up when accessing my SilencerShop account.

Some idiot programmer couldn’t figure out how to add 2/29 as a date and it crashed the system.

It’ll take the GayTF a month or two to figure it out.

This^^^ Didn't source a decent date library (and the lowest bidder most like built their own) and when the automated update hit the front end shit the bed. As an aside, I withdrew a Form1 and got the verification e-mail about 5 hours after the outage started so stuff is still getting processed but trying to certify? Well, we are fucked for the moment!

one glaring flaw in this statement is that they aren't clearing any backlogs at all. I'm still sitting on a shit ton of form 4's from mid last year, and all the new submissions are getting approved in days or weeks.

If I had to guess, and just a guess, the blitzkrieg on new form approvals is just them trying to skew their numbers in the "approval wait times" aggregate.

None of me believes these assholes just finally decided to start doing their job for our benefit.

"Impatient" is my middle name 

Seriously, I don't need another can but when I saw these fast approvals I figured I'll get another one and take advantage. But it seems no one really knows what is going on. I realize eforms has regular maintenance outages, but those videos make it seem like this is NOT just a planned maintenance outage. I hope they are wrong.

It went down Tuesday night. The 27th.
This doesn't seem like it would be a software date issue.

The NFA is clearly unconstitutional with recent SC rulings. I wonder if it will be heard before I'm dead.

This all has to do with the .gov shutdown that was looming. They will shutdown stuff, sites etc, a few days prior. I saw a continuing resolution was passed yesterday. I would guess the site will be back up on Monday.
