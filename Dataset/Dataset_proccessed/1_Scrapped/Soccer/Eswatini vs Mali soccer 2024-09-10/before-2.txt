Football meets education. This is what the FIFA Football for Schools Development Programme presents in as far as the development of the beautiful game is concerned. The Eswatini Football Association (EFA) President Peter Simelane launched the FIFA Football for Schools Development Programme on Wednesday at the Somhlolo National Stadium in the presence of two FIFA experts, Mr. Antonio Buenano, Mr. Alberto Giacomini, and EFA’s Technical Development Committee Member Nhlanhla Mabuza to mention but a few.

“It is a great honour for me the President of the EFA to be part of this launch of the FIFA Football for Schools Programme which also doubles to be the closing ceremony of the very first Capacity Building Workshop for this significant football development programme,” Simelane said.

The EFA President also expressed his delight on the vitality of this important football development programme. “This is a vital football development programme, as it will enhance the skills of the participants of the workshop who are key stakeholders in as far as the success of the Football for Schools Development Programme and the development of the beautiful game in the country is concerned”, Simelane said.

To the participants of the workshop, the EFA President urged them to implement the knowledge to the children. “As a football association, we now entrust the participants of this workshop who are now the ambassadors of this football development programme, to implement what they have been equipped with to the children of the various schools as they develop their lives. Football is a school for life, of which the Football for Schools Development Programme is a unique initiative that enable football to meet education”, Simelane said.
