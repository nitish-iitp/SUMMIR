San Marino are ranked 210th in the world

In a clash of two minnows, San Marino host St. Kitts and Nevis at the Olympic Stadium of Serravalle on Wednesday for an international friendly.

Ranked 210th in the world, San Marino are often considered to be the worst football team in the world, given their deplorable record in official games.

In fact, La Serenissima have lost each of their last 11 games and haven't won on record since April 2004, when the side beat fellow strugglers Liechtenstein 1-0 in a friendly.

San Marino's team consists of part-time footballers, none of whom have ever made a name for themselves in the professional circuit. This showed once again last year when San Marino lost all 10 of their UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying matches.

On the other hand, St. Kitts and Nevis are looking to put their struggles behind them and start 2024 on a positive note, as last year, the Caribbean outfit won only thrice from 13 matches, all coming in the 2022-23 CONCACAF Nations League.

In June, the Sugar Boyz will begin their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign, so preparations for that objective start now, with the San Marino double-header this month.
