A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.

Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

Measure advertising performance
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Measure content performance
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.
Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.
Develop and improve services
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.

Argentina - Ecuador: As it happened

Argentina battled their way into the semi-finals of Copa America with a hard-fought victory over Ecuador on Thursday.

Ecuador put the world champions under pressure from the very start but they were unable to take advantage of their many forays into the box. Instead it was Argentina who found the opener, Lisandro Martinez nodding home after a Lionel Messi corner kick had snuck through to the back post.

Argentina led at the break but Ecuador began the second half in a positive vein and looked to have found a leveller when they were awarded a penalty after Rodrigo de Paul handled in the box. Captain Enner Valencia stepped up confidently but his spot kick cannoned back off the post. It looked like it wasn’t going to be Ecuador’s day but they stunned Argentina with a dramatic late leveller, Kevin Rodriguez’ shot creeping in at the back post.

The game went straight to penalties and, despite Lionel Messi hitting the crossbar, some goalkeeping heroics from Emiliano Martinez gave Argentina the advantage in the shootout. Nicolas Otamendi stepped up to take the fifth penalty and his conversion sent Argentina into the Copa America semi-finals.

Argentina's incredible run continues

Under the guidance of Lionel Scaloni Argentina have enjoyed a historic period of success. That run began with the 2021 Copa America, La Albiceleste’s first major tournament triumph in 28 years. One year later, the big one; Argentina lifted the World Cup in Qatar to finally deliver the trophy that had eluded Lionel Messi.

They have lost just one game since the infamous loss to Saudi Arabia in their opening game of the tournament back in 2022. That defeat came las November in a World Cup qualifying loss to Uruguay. Despite that reversal Argentina still find themselves top of the CONMEBOL qualifying table and they now progress to the semi-finals of Copa America.

That's exactly what Argentina needed, something that will force Ecuador to come out and play a bit more openly. It was a clever back post run from Martinez and a lethal finish to flick the ball past Dominguez.

Brilliant ball from Lionel Messi to clip a ball over the top for Enzo Fernandez. The Chelsea man sprints through on goal, bundles one defender to the ground, before seeing his shot deflected off another. 

Corner kick to Argentina.

Neat one-touch play from Argentina in the Ecuadorian half. Lionel Scaloni's men are building in confidence and starting to look more dangerous. 

And with that, Tagliafico takes a heavy touch and allows the ball to spin ahead of him and out for a goal kick.

Enner Valencia

He's back on his feet and he's back on the offensive. The first booking of the game goes to the Ecuadorian skipper for a clumsy late challenge on Mac Allister on the halfway line.

Close from Enzo!

Argentina break and make space for Molina on the right flank. He stands up a cross to the penalty spot and Enzo Fernandez meets it well with his head. 

He aims for Dominguez' left-handside but his header drifts just wide of the post.

Lionel Messi has been peripheral in the opening 25 minutes, spending most of it wandering around on the right flank. With Lautaro down the middle Messi's sticking to the flank a lot more rigidly than he usually does, opted not to drift inside.

Brilliant from Messi to skip past a challenge on the edge of the box and curl a cross into the middle. Tagliafico is there to pick up the ball on the far side but his pass is a little aimless. Ecuador clear.

Ecuador find Enner Valencia running in behind and the big forward does well to control the ball and find Angelo Preciado in the middle. He tries to deflect the ball past Martinez but it flies over the crossbar.

Both teams will be fairly happy with how the first 13 minutes have gone. Argentina have dominated the ball and looked confident, but Ecuador will be no push-overs and have already showed some ambition on the counter-attack.

Moises Caicedo leaps on a flick-on from Valencia and charges in on goal. As he approaches the goal Romero gets a boot in and pokes the ball back to Emilian Martinez, who scoops it up.

COPA AMÉRICA 2024

Who is the top scorer in Copa América?

The incredible form of Argentina striker Lautaro Martinez has been one of the stories of the tournament so far, forcing his way into Lionel Scaloni's starting XI for this evening's game. The Inter Milan striker is out on his own at the top of the scoring charts as it stands, but there's plenty of soccer still to be played...

Can Ecuador pull off a shock against Argentina?

It's a tough proposition for Ecuador, who finished second in Group B and narrowly struck past out-of-form Mexico in their final group stage match. Coach Felix Sanchez has experience at La Masia in Barcelona but his style is tougher, more defensive with Ecuador.

Sanchez has not had to change his backline during the 2024 Copa America and William Pacho, centre-back for Bundesliga side Eintract Frankfurt, was one of the best defenders across the group stage. That defensive solidity will be key if they are to frustrate Argentina.

Injury comeback for Lionel Messi

Lionel Messi has not played since the second game of the competition but returns to the team this evening. The 37-year-old had an injury to his right thigh but has returned to training this week and starts against Ecuador. He has not scored in the 2024 Copa America but still has a chance of reaching another record tally.

He could have three more games, if Argentina reach the final, and Messi needs just four goals to equal the all-time Copa America scoring record (17).

Can Lautaro Martinez continue scoring form?

Argentina won their group with ease, conceding no goals in their three matches. In fact, in the last nine matches, Lionel Scaloni's side have kept eight clean sheets and their defence is probably the best in the competition.

Also very important, however, is the form of Lautaro Martinez. The Inter Milan striker has four goals in three games this Copa, making him the top scorer in the competition. At times Martinez has not convinced for Argentina, but in this form he is lethal.
