MONROVIA, Liberia - The Malawi national football team, known as the Flames, secured a crucial away victory on Friday, November 17, 2023, defeating Liberia 1-0 in the first game of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches, writes Happy Valirani.

The match took place at the Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Stadium in Monrovia, Liberia.

Chifundo Mphasi, a substitute player, scored the only goal of the match in the 78th minute, ensuring Malawi’s victory.

The Flames are part of Group H, which includes Tunisia, Equatorial Guinea, Liberia, Namibia, and Sao Tome & Principe.

The Flames are set to host Tunisia on Tuesday, November 21, 2023, at the Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe for the second game of Group H. Tunisia, Equatorial Guinea, and Malawi all currently hold three points.

However, Tunisia leads the group due to a higher goal count, followed by Equatorial Guinea and Malawi. Namibia, Sao Tome & Principe, and Liberia have yet to register a win in Group H.

Patrick Mabedi, the Flames’ coach, expressed his delight at the win and commended the players for their excellent performances.

“First and foremost, I would like to thank God Almighty for the victory. I would also like to thank the boys for their great performance today. They really executed the game plan very well,” Mabedi said.

“Although the rains disturbed us, especially in the second half, we managed to get a goal, defend it, and win the game. It has always been difficult for Malawi to win, especially in West Africa, so today we have ended that jinx, and I am very happy. Our focus now is on Tunisia on Tuesday at home. We need to start preparing for that game so that we should do better as well,” Mabedi explained.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup finals will be hosted by Mexico, the United States of America, and Canada.

In other Group H games played on Friday, Tunisia beat Sao Tome & Principe 4-0, while Equatorial Guinea beat Namibia 1-0 on Wednesday.
