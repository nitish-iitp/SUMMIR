Wake me up when great test cricket is featured in the Olympics.

Well, they already have bed racing, racewalking, rope climbing and the latest craze break dancing. Adding one more gimmick in T20 is par for the course.....

CWI has found a way to get its own t20 tournament back something many a cc.comer lamented about when they roasted WICBC for giving away the format to CPL. What say them now that CPL has agreed to give CWI its support and a window has been found in the 2025 calendar to have a regional t20 competition? Can they support their country team as opposed to a franchise team based in their island? That the initiative can culminate in a team from any of the islands repping the WI in Los Angeles is just toppings on the cake.

That rules out Guyana

Possibly. However, Guyana would be a better lock to represent South America…

In reply to mikelegend

other South American teams will probably just concede!

 
VIX 2024-09-09 14:54:26 

Guyana identifies as an Island. 

 
natty_forever 2024-09-09 15:36:24 

Guyana plays qualifiers for football in which Federation? The same should be for cricket. No rocket science needed.

Dude, are the rules of FIFA the same as the Olympics?

 
anthonyp 2024-09-09 17:49:45 

Why yall worrying about Guyana? Guaranteed Olympic spot for us if we gotta play against the other South America countries 

Can't say the same for the Islands... yall gotta battle it out to get there.

Football nuh play in the Olympics?
And do teams have to qualify?

Please refrain from referring to me as Dude...

 
natty_forever 2024-09-09 19:13:23 

On 24 February 2022, the FIFA Council approved the slot allocation for the 2024 Summer Olympics. The host nation France, earned automatic qualification to the tournament. For the remaining 15 slots, the AFC and CAF each received 3 automatic slots with a 4th nation from each confederation being granted a spot against each other, UEFA received 3 slots, CONCACAF and CONMEBOL received 2 slots, and the OFC received 1 slot.[1]

The IOC uses existing structures to run their qualifiers.

Guyana, Suriname and French Guyana play their Olympic Football qualifiers as part of CONCACAF and not CONMEBOL.

The ICC have an Americas Grouping made up of Associate Members such as:

Argentina
Bahamas
Belize
Bermuda
Brazil
Cayman Islands
Chile
Costa Rica
Falkland Islands
Mexico
Panama
Peru
Suriname
Turks and Caicos Islands

These are likely to play in a separate competition that may involve other Associate Members worldwide depending on the number of teams required for the competition

In other words, as far as the Olypicvs are concerned, there is no entity called West Indies as
a member of the IOC.
The IOC deals with individual countries who are members and operates on that basis on statutes with existing
protocols with international associations and groupings of countries.
For the LA Games, the IOC has included cricket but with only a small number of countries to take part ,these
will most likely be Australia, India,England et al.
For subsequent Games, the numbers may increase starting with the Brisbane Games and so individual
countries worldwide will most likely go through qualifications as thy now do for cricket world cups.
The individual WI countries except for Guyana will have it hard to make it to to the Olympics as they will
not only have to do well in their region..North and Central America as a first step but will certainly come
up against big time Associates from other parts of the world to make the final list.
We have seen WI fail in this regard with WC qualification.
The question thought is whether the individual WI nations are and will be prepared for this.
At least one, Jamaica, is not as its cricket is at a low ebb in both interest and quality.
A smaller county such as Antigua, Grenada, St Kitts, Nevis or St. Lucia can certainly hold its
own against the current Jamaica team. Perhaps even Cayman Islands will fancy their chances
of advancing out of the region to meet more sterner tests.
Should be fun...as was the case with the SANFORD tournament which has paved the way
for T20 in the Region

We will gladly grant you guys Guyanese citizenship after 3 years participation in our local T20 competition!

The Olympics have kept Great Britain as an entity, so if they feel that as a full member of the ICC, a West Indies Team will be better for the Competition, they cud opt that way.
In other words, the Olympics cud well be a catalyst for going it alone

 
imusic 2024-09-10 20:57:58 

In reply to Maispwi

There have previously been “catalysts” for exactly that

Last time, CWI sold the rights to T20 cricket in the region to CPL and abandoned regional t20 as a consequence.

 
hubert 2024-09-10 21:58:01 

In reply to Maispwi

There is no such thing as a West Indies Olympic Commitee. They have no membership. Great Britain has.
IOC is not gonna makew non country a member. Each member of WI has to compete under their own
Olymp[ic Committee. The IOC may make the WI area as a host for qualification, but there will not be a
Leeward or Windwards team.
The IOC/ ICC may ask WI to stage the events for qualification for 2032 but that would involved even
Guadeloupe or Puerto Rico Cayman Islands etc if they choose to play cricket.

Qualification for Olympics is not a West Indies cricket Board matter. They only blowing smoke.
The six or so countries for both men and women are virtually selected already for the LA Games.
The USA as host already has a regional, hemispheric pot.....
The others will go to top rated T20 countries and that does not include WI as a Block.
Bear in mind that cricket in the Olympics is an experiment at this stage. The future of it
will depend on success and acceptance .However the good thing is that Brisbane
will he hosting the 2032 Version.
Time enough for West Indies as a Nation to gain IOC membership.
If Jamaica is gonna compete they will be doing so as an IOC member and the cricket team
will be treated as such in much the same way under their own flag as the Track and Field contingent.

Bear in mind that the LA Games is an experiment to revive cricket so there are not many countries
involved...but the good thing is that Brisbane will be hosts in 2032 and depending on the success and acceptance of cricket in LA
will make it easier to have a full slate of countries for that edition.
Time enough for Caribbean Nations to see Associate status or for West Indies to become a Country and have
membership ala Great Britain .
I won't be here to see that

As I understand it, CWI owns cricket in the region.

Essentially meaning cricket cannot play in the region without CWI’s (or whatever acronym they choose to refer to themselves as) blessing.

Not sure how accurate that is but it’s how I understand it.

Research the use of the word, ownership..the ICC may have something to say about that.
And the ICC is an affiliate of the IOC., just as FIFA is, and just as other Sports bodies such as the IAAF

They cannot stop individual nations from playing in the Olympics or playing other nations. They are granted ownership of WI cricket by the ICC.


That's my understanding, anyway

 
hubert 2024-09-11 02:14:22 

In reply to googley

They are custodians. They only 'own 'what are within their domain.They do not 'own 'cricket in
Guadeloupe or Cayman Islands or Bermuda and Bahamas etc etc.

If for example Yard leaves the WI set up as they did the Federation, they become custodians of the game within their orbit as
an independent entity. WI can't tell them what to do as they would be under ICC directly as are
all associates and individual members in the world.
U R Right.
