Grenada is beginning to despair. However, the second goal for the locals could have come. They are creating good plays in the last minutes. As long as they don't make defensive mistakes, everything is possible.

Both teams are looking to create counter-attacking plays. At first glance, it seems that both teams are looking to play with wingers, who usually receive the ball after a play with a midfield pivot. The moves usually end in crosses to the strikers for them to execute the closing play.

If Granada arrives with a good study of their rival, and takes advantage of their locality, they can win this match. Let's hope they take advantage of the opportunity.

Kirani James National Stadium

This is a stadium located in the capital city of Grenada, St. George's. This name has a purpose, and it was inspired by Kiran James, a Grenadian athlete who was recognized for being a specialist in the 400 meters. He was the winner of the first gold medal for Grenada in 2012. For that reason the stadium was named after him.

This multi-sport facility was founded in 1983 and since its construction has been a key developmental facility for many of the country's athletes. The Kirani James National Stadium has a capacity of 5,000 people. In addition, it now has modern facilities for the ongoing development of its athletes.

Best achievement for Grenada

The Grenada national soccer team has had several highlights throughout its history, but one of the most significant achievements is having qualified for the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup.


In the Gold Cup, which is the most important national team tournament in the CONCACAF region (which includes North America, Central America and the Caribbean), Grenada made it to the quarterfinals in the 2023 edition. This was a remarkable feat for a soccer team that has historically been in development and has not had a consistent presence in high-profile international tournaments.

Statistics (Probability of winning)

This meeting between the two has a relatively short history, nevertheless it serves to have an interesting forecast to know who can win in this match. Since, if we see the performance of both, we will realize that it is not easy to understand who can win. However, in the last 4 matches in which these two teams have faced each other there has been a clear favorite, and it has been Granda, who won 3 matches and drew 1 against St. Lucia. In the 4 matches Granada took 10 points, while Santa Lucia only 1. 

This makes it clear on paper that Granada is the clear favorite to win this match and take the 3 points. However, there may be factors that influence the outcome of the match, making it possible for St. Lucia to win. In soccer anything is possible.

St. Lucia may have a strong footing in the match.

Unlike Grenada, St. Lucia seems to have a bit of an advantage for this match. In addition to showing an interesting quality in the last match, they played in the CONCACAF Nationals League. Also, the most recent win-loss record, St. Lucia in the last 4 matches has drawn 2 and lost 2. Not the most attractive numbers, however, they are better than Grenada. At least, in the last few games. 

Santa Lucia should not be overconfident for this match. Since anything can happen, and really, what they have shown in the last 4 games is not that convincing. They must come with a lot of focus if they want to win this match.

Grenada must seek stability

Although Grenada is tied with St. Lucia in group B at the moment in first place. This is not saying much, as Grenada is coming from a streak in the last few games that are not so positive (excluding this group stage match). In the last 4 matches outside the tournament they lost 3 and drew 1. In short, the last match could be a small bubble, which can burst in this match. At the same time, it could be the beginning of a new positive streak for the team from Granada.

In conclusion, anything can happen for the Granada team, from the positive to the negative. What they must do, however, is to come prepared for this game, as they are tied with Santa Lucia.
