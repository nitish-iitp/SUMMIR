INTERNATIONAL WHITES IN ACTION THIS WEEK

With the first international break already upon us, here is a round-up of where our internationals will be in action over the course of the upcoming days.

Wanderers have had five members of the squad called up for duty away with their countries. Dion Charles, Luke Southwood and Eoin Toal have been selected for Northern Ireland, while Josh Sheehan will be representing Wales and Chris Forino has been called up to Saint Lucia's squad for the first time.

As previously announced, this has led to Wanderers' scheduled League One game at Cambridge United to be postponed and rearranged for Tuesday 26th November.

Dion, Luke, Eoin and Josh will be starting their UEFA Nations League campaigns, while defender Chris Forino takes part in the CONCAF Nations League.

Northern Ireland start their set of fixtures with a home game against Luxembourg in Belfast before travelling to Plovdiv to take on Bulgaria in Group K.

Sheehan, who captained Wales last time out, will be facing Turkey in Cardiff and Montenegro in their first two Nations League games under new boss Craig Bellamy.

And summer signing Forino will be hoping to earn his first Saint Lucia cap when they face Curacao and Grenada at the Kirani James National Stadium.
