Preview: Indonesia vs. Australia - prediction, team news, lineups

Indonesia will be hoping to inflict Australia's second defeat in the AFC World Cup qualifiers on Tuesday when they host them at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium.

After one game, the home side are in third place with one point in their six-team group, while the visitors are fifth with no points following their 1-0 loss against Bahrain on September 5th.

The hosts drew 1-1 against Saudi Arabia on September 5 in a match in which they had just 34% possession and were forced to defend for large periods.

Despite Saudi Arabia producing 18 shots, only four were on target, and they created just two big chances.

Indonesia had eight shots and two attempts on target, though manager Shin Tae-Yong will be concerned that his team failed to generate any big chances of their own.

The draw means that Shin's side have lost just once in their last six AFC World Cup qualifying matches, winning three times and drawing twice.

However, Indonesia's home form is concerning, especially as they have won just twice, drawn once and lost five times in their last eight home games.

Opponents Australia come into the clash having suffered a shock defeat against Bahrain, who are 80th in FIFA's rankings of national teams, 56 places lower than Australia.

The Socceroos had 71% possession and limited Bahrain to just one shot on target, but they lost due to Harry Souttar's 89th-minute own goal.

Boss Graham Arnold could point to the fact his side were reduced to 10 players when Kusini Yengi was sent off in the 77th minute, but this does not excuse his team's inability to make the most of their dominance.

In fairness to Arnold, prior to his side's loss last time out, they had won the previous four games and scored 14 goals without conceding.

Australia have only lost two of their last 14 matches, winning 11 times and drawing once in these fixtures.

The Socceroos' away record is also impressive considering they have won their last five games on the road and have kept five clean sheets in the process.

The hosts are likely to be without midfielder Thom Haye, who was substituted in the 56th minute for Marselino Ferdinan due to injury.

Ivar Jenner could join Ferdinan in midfield, while centre-backs Rizky Ramadhani, Jay Idzes and Calvin Verdonk could shield goalkeeper Maarten Paes.

As for Australia, Mitchell Duke may replace the suspended Kusini Yengi, while Martin Boyle and Craig Goodwin could operate out wide as wingers.

Elsewhere, Aiden O'Neill and Jackson Irvine could play in midfield alongside Connor Metcalfe.


Indonesia possible starting lineup:
Paes; Walsh, Ramadhani, Idzes, Verdonk, Tjoe-A-On; Sulaeman, Jenner, Ferdinan, Oratmangoen; Strui

Australia possible starting lineup:
Ryan; Circati, Souttar, Rowles, Behich; Metcalfe, Irvine, O'Neill; Boyle, Duke, Goodwin



We say: Indonesia 0-3 Australia

While Indonesia did well to earn a draw against Saudi Arabia, their home form is quite concerning.

Additionally, Australia will be hoping to prove that their loss against Bahrain was a one-off result by securing all three points in Tuesday's clash.
