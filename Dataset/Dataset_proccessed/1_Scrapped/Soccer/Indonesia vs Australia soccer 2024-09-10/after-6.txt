Australia unable to convert dominance in 0-0 draw with Indonesia

Despite a marked improvement in performance, it was another frustrating night for Australia in their AFC Asian qualifying campaign, with the Socceroos playing out a 0-0 draw with Indonesia in Jakarta.

In the second match of Round Three in their FIFA World Cup 2026™qualifying campaign, Australia put in a dominant display at the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium, managing 63% possession, 19 shots, 32 touches in the opposition box, and an incredible 15 corners.

But, despite creating a number of inviting opportunities, Australia couldn’t convert that dominance into goals.

Head Coach Graham Arnold made five changes to the side that lost to Bahrain last Thursday with Cam Burgess, Sammy Silvera, Keanu Baccus, Nestory Irankunda and Mitch Duke all coming into the starting eleven. Kye Rowles, Aiden O’Neill and Martin Boyle made way, along with the suspended Kusini Yengi and Connor Metcalfe, who missed out through injury.

Australia lined up in an attacking 4-4-2 formation with Irankunda partnering Mitch Duke up front, while Craig Goodwin and Silvera started on the left and right flanks respectively. Meanwhile, Indonesia opted for their customary 4-5-1 set-up.

In a blistering start to the game, Indonesia imposed intense early pressure on the Australian goal, with Maty Ryan having to spring into action with two saves in quick succession in the first 30 seconds, after attempts by Sandy Walsh and Rafael Struick.

But, Graham Arnold’s side stood strong and successfully weathered the early storm from the hosts with the game beginning to settle after the first ten minutes.

The Socceroos then started to impose themselves on Indonesia with some good build up play through the midfield resulting in a string of corners and goalscoring opportunities.

In the 19th minute, Baccus - fresh from returning to fitness - saw a shot from distance blocked, bouncing wide for a corner.

Just a minute later, after some excellent work from Duke and Jackson Irvine, the ball fell to Souttar in the six-yard box, with the centre-back thumping a shot down the throat of goalkeeper Maarten Paes, who parried well. Only moments before, Alessandro Circati had seen a powerful, goal-bound volley well blocked.

Midway into the first half, Australia were really starting to assert themselves with a clear shift in momentum. The Socceroos produced wave after wave of attacks and a constant stream of corners, including a glorious inswinger from Goodwin which found the towering Harry Souttar who hit the target with his header, but, again, couldn’t beat Paes.

Arnold’s Australia became more and more dominant as the half wore on, while Indonesia looked bereft of ideas, not managing a single shot for the rest of the half after their rampant opening 30 seconds.

In minute 34, the Socceroos came agonisingly close to taking the lead, when Irankunda let rip with a stunning hit from range, which struck the base of the post, before ricocheting off Paes, who was fortunate to see the ball fall to safety.

Seconds later, Baccus - who was growing in influence - threaded a clever ball through to the lively Goodwin, who had his attempt from a tight angle well saved by Paes yet again.

The second half was more balanced with both sides looking threatening. Australia were in control and continued to probe, while Indonesia sat back and looked to spring on the counter. Several promising counter attacks were nullified by the excellent Souttar and Burgess.

Goalscoring opportunities came and went for the Socceroos, with a Goodwin free-kick well saved by the excellent Paes, while a couple of penalty shouts were waved away by the referee.

Arnold made a double change in the 66th minute, bringing Josh Nisbet and Adam Taggart on for Goodwin and Mitch Duke and it was almost the dream introduction for Taggart. The ever-creative Baccus dinked a lovely ball into the box and the Australia No.9 did well to hold off the defender, but his shot didn’t truly trouble the Indonesian gloveman.

Australia remained camped in the Indonesian half for the remainder of the game, but simply couldn’t find the breakthrough. In minute 77, Awer Mabil, who replaced the lively Irankunda, couldn’t quite convert a header after an inviting cross from Aziz Behich. Circati later connected well with a strike after a second ball, but the determined Indonesian backline blocked once again.

After his heroics in the first 30 seconds, Maty Ryan was virtually a spectator on the night where he surpassed Mile Jedinak on the leaderboard of Socceroos with the most caps as captain.
 


Ultimately, it wasn’t to be for Australia, who leave Jakarta with a share of the points.

The team now sit in fifth place in Group C in the AFC Asian Qualifiers™ Road to 26 campaign and will next be in action on Thursday 10 October when they host China PR at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide.
