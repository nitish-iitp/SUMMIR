Bilal El Khannouss, Facundo Buonanotte and Bobby De Cordova-Reid were substitutes for their respective nations
The Leicester City centre-back started while Mads Hermansen was an unused substitute in the League A Group 4 clash at Kybunpark in St. Gallen.
The hosts took a 26th-minute lead through Remo Freuler which was cancelled out almost immediately by Gustav Isaksen.
Zeki Amdouni restored their advantage but Christian Eriksen's equaliser ensured the points would be shared, leaving Denmark second in the group, on seven points from their four matches.
Elsewhere, Jordan Ayew and Abdul Fatawu both featured from the bench for Ghana in their 2-0 defeat to Sudan in Africa Cup of Nations qualifying earlier in the afternoon.

The attacking pair, introduced in the 57th minute of the contest at Martyrs of February Stadium, could not prevent goals from Ahmed Hamed Mahmoud Mohamed and Mohamed Abdelrahman Yousif Yagoub within the space of three minutes which tilted the game in Sudan's favour. 
Third in Group F, on two points from four games, Angola are top of the pool and host the Black Stars in the next international window on Monday 11 November. 
Also in qualifying for AFCON, Bilal El Khannouss was on the bench as Morocco thrashed Central African Republic 4-0 in Group B. Eliesse Ben Seghir's brace was followed by Youssef En-Nesyri's penalty and Abde Ezzalzouli added a fourth to complete the rout at Honneur Stadium.
Walid Regragui's side are top of Group B having won all four of their opening matches, ahead of taking on Gabon on Monday 11 November. 
Overnight, Facundo Buonanotte watched on as Argentina defeated Bolivia 6-0 in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier at Estadio Mâs Monumental. A Lionel Messi hat-trick was the headline of the night as Lionel Scaloni's side remained top of the group with seven wins from 10.
In the early hours of Tuesday morning, meanwhile, Bobby De Cordova-Reid was an unused substitute in Jamaica's goalless draw with Honduras at Independence Park in the CONCACAF Nations League. Remaining top of Group B, Steve McLaren's side now have eight points from four matches in the competition.
