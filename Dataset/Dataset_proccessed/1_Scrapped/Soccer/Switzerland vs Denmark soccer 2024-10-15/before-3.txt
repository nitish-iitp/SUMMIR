Switzerland is already reaching the do-or-die phase of its UEFA Nations League campaign as it hosts Denmark on Tuesday.

Time is fast running out for Switzerland to get its first points of the UEFA Nations League on the board, while Denmark travels to St. Gallen on Tuesday hoping to pile more misery on its host. The Swiss sit dead last in Group A4 and are current favorites to be sent down to League B unless a sudden shift in results can resurrect their chances of surviving in the top tier for at least another year. Murat Yakin’s sidehave already suffered one humbling at home to Spain thus far in the Nations League, but have a chance to give their fans something to smile about after a dreadful run so far.

Only one other team has leaked more goals than Switzerland thus far in the latest chapter of the Nations League’s top flight, with Israel’s nine goals just one worse off than the Swiss count to date.

However, Yakin’s men have also scored just once in their three outings thus far in the tournament, giving them the worst goal difference among any of the 16 countries as things stand.

Denmark, on the other hand, only just saw its perfect run of results come at a halt in Spain, losing 1-0 on Saturday after Martin Zubimendi came up with the only goal of the game for the Euro 2024 winners.

Back-to-back 2-0 wins at home to Serbia and Switzerland precedes that and caretaker coach Lars Knudsen will look to draw on the same knowledge that guided his outfit to victory in Copenhagen when these sides clashed last month.
