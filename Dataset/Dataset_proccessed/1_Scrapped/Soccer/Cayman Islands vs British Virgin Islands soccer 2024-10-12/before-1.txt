TUPELO – Tupelo needed not one, but two comebacks to defeat Madison Central.

The Golden Wave rallied back from down 20 points in the first half and from down two late in the fourth quarter to beat the Jaguars 28-23 at home Friday night. Tupelo wide receiver Tyreke Darden hauled in the game-winning touchdown with 43 seconds left in the game.
