Uganda 2-2 South Sudan
Burundi 3-2 Ethiopia

Uganda U-20 National Team shared spoils with South Sudan in the U-20 CECAFA Zonal AFCON Qualifiers on Friday in Tanzania.

John Paul Dembe continued his impressive run scoring a brace just like he did in the game against Burundi.

The gaffer Matia Lule made three changes, introducing Sowedi Lwenda, John Innocent Kisolo and Bashir Mansur in the starting lineup.

Uganda Hippos kicked off with great pace as they were seeking an early opener in the game.

Forward John Paul Dembe broke the deadlock in the 15th minute to place Uganda in the driving seat.

Six minutes later, Dembe doubled Uganda's lead with a delightful finish that left South Sudan's backlines helpless.

In the 31st minute, Emmanuel Swoka pulled one back for South Sudan and the game gave the side lots of confidence.

In the second stanza, South Sudan started on the front foot but goalkeeper Abdu Maganda was equal to the challenge.

However, the introduction of Johnson Kabagambe and Godfrey Ssekibengo balanced the game.

Patrick Valentino levelled matters in the 89th minute to secure a golden point for South Sudan.
