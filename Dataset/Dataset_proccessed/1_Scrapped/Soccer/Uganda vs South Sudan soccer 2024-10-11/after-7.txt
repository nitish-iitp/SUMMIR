Uganda Cranes will be seeking to secure 2025 AFCON Qualification when they face off with South Sudan on Tuesday in Juba.

Paul Put’s men will progress to the continental showpiece in case they win and South Africa also registers victory away to Congo Brazzaville.

The Cranes have missed out on the previous two AFCON editions (2021 and 2023).

Uganda and South Africa are currently both on seven points in Group K of the AFCON qualifiers.

Congo Brazzaville are third on three points while South Sudan are pointless.

The Cranes come into this contest after a scrappy 1-0 win over South Sudan at Namboole.

Bevis Mugabi scored the all important goal in the second half to break South Sudan’s resilience.

South Sudan is in a must win situation if they are to keep their AFCON qualification dream alive having lost their first three group games.
