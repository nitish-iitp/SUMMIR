West Ham United’s early summer internationals | All You Need To Know
3RD JUNE 2024

Following a domestic season full of thrills and spills, football’s attention now turns to a mouth-watering summer of international action that is set to involve a host of West Ham United stars.

Ahead of the 2024 UEFA European Championship and the 2024 Copa América - both of which are scheduled to begin later this month - a selection of Hammers will be looking to seal a place in their countries’ final squads, while those already confirmed will be hoping to impress in the lead up to competition kick-off.

In total, eleven members of Julen Lopetegui’s squad are in line to take to the field for their nations in a combination of senior friendlies and World Cup qualifiers over the next week-and-a-half.

Read on for all you need to know about the first bout of West Ham United’s summer internationals, ahead of Euro 2024 and the Copa América…

Who has been called up?

Forward Jarrod Bowen was named in England’s 33-man provisional squad for Euro 2024 after top-scoring for West Ham United during 2023/24 with 20 goals in all competitions, and subsequently winning the coveted Hammer of the Year prize.

The 27-year-old - who currently has seven caps to his name - will look to boost his chances of a seat on the plane to Germany during warm-up friendlies against Bosnia & Herzegovina at St James’ Park on Monday 3 June (7.45pm BST) and Iceland at Wembley on Friday 7 June (7.45pm BST).

Already sure of his spot at the tournament, goalkeeper Alphonse Areola was named in France’s 25-man squad for the Euros in mid-May.

Ahead of their Group D opener against Austria, the two-time European champions will play friendlies against Luxembourg and Canada, on Wednesday 5 June (8pm BST) and Sunday 9 June (8.15pm BST) respectively.

Czech Republic duo Vladimír Coufal and Tomáš Souček are also set to be involved at the Euros, and first face two exhibition outings against Malta on Friday 7 June (4.30pm BST) and North Macedonia on Monday 10 June (5pm BST).

Edson Álvarez didn’t feature in Mexico’s first warm-up game in the build-up to the Copa América, against Bolivia on Saturday 1 June, after being named in Jaime Lozano’s provisional list of 31 players little under a month ago.

The 26-year-old midfielder could play in upcoming US-based friendlies against Uruguay on Thursday 6 June (2am BST) and Brazil on Sunday 9 June (1.30am BST).

The latter of those clashes could also involve Álvarez’s Club teammate Lucas Paquetá, who is hoping to feature at the Copa América for a third time.

After taking on Mexico, Paquetá and Brazil are due to play another friendly against the United States in Florida, in the early hours of Thursday 13 June (12am BST).

Michail Antonio and Jamaica are similarly gearing up for the Copa América, but rather than exhibition action, they will contest a pair of FIFA 2026 World Cup qualifiers in early June before they make their way over to the USA.

The Reggae Boyz will host the Dominican Republic in Kingston on Friday 7 June (12.30am BST), before travelling to Dominica on Sunday 9 June (8pm BST).

Two African Irons are also in line for World Cup qualifying double headers, with Nayef Aguerd and Morocco taking on Zambia on Friday 7 June (8pm BST) and Congo on Tuesday 11 June (5pm BST), and Mohammed Kudus and Ghana facing Mali on Thursday 6 June (8pm BST) and Central African Republic on Monday 10 June (8pm BST).

Finally, Dinos Mavropanos and Callum Marshall are part of the Greece and Northern Ireland squads set for friendlies against Germany (Friday 7 June, 7.45pm BST) and Malta (Tuesday 11 June, 5pm BST), and Spain (Saturday 8 June, 8.30pm BST) and Andorra (Tuesday 11 June, 7.45pm BST), respectively.

Where can I watch the games?

Both of England’s warm-up friendlies, against Bosnia & Herzegovina on Monday 3 June and Iceland on Friday 7 June, will be broadcast live on Channel 4, with coverage starting at 7pm ahead of the 7.45pm BST kick-offs.

Premier Sports will be showing France v Luxembourg (Wednesday 5 June, 8pm BST), Czech Republic v North Macedonia (Monday 10 June, 5pm BST) and both of Northern Ireland’s fixtures, against Spain (Saturday 8 June, 8.30pm BST) and Andorra (Tuesday 11 June, 7.45pm BST).

Morocco and Ghana’s World Cup qualifiers, against Zambia (Friday 7 June, 8pm BST) and Congo (Tuesday 11 June, 5pm BST), and Mali (Thursday 6 June, 8pm BST) and Central African Republic (Monday 10 June, 8pm BST), will be streamed on FIFA+.

Unfortunately, the remaining fixtures are not available to watch in the UK.
