The Black Stars have arrived in Bamako for their 2026 World Cup qualifier against Mali on June 6, 2024.

The Black Stars aim to recover from a poor start to the qualifiers, having secured a 1-0 win over Madagascar and recorded a 1-0 loss to Comoros last year.

Otto Addo's team are aiming for their first win in five matches across all competitions, having previously suffered two defeats and three draws.

The Black Stars will face the Central African Republic at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium on June 10, 2024, following their match against Mali.

Ghana’s hopes of qualifying for the World Cup in the USA, Mexico, and Canada would receive a massive boost if they win in these two games.
