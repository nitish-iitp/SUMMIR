Black Stars are fourth in Group I

Two of West Africa's premier football nations will take to the pitch on Thursday, June 6, 2024, to vie for direct qualification to the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted by the US, Canada, and Mexico.

Ghana, a four-time Africa Cup of Nations champion seeking to rebound from a recent slump, will face a Malian team that is the bookmakers' favourite to top Group I of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers.

The Black Stars of Ghana departed for Mali on Tuesday, June 5, 2024, and arrived on the same day to continue preparations for the match on Thursday, June 6, 2024.

GhanaWeb brings you the stats, team news, major statements, and everything you need to know about the match between the Black Stars of Ghana and the Eagles of Mali.

State of Group I

Leading Group I of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers are the Comoros Islands, who won their opening two matches against Ghana and the Central African Republic.

Mali is second, having amassed four points from their opening two matches against Chad and the Central African Republic.

Madagascar has the same number of points as fourth-placed Ghana (3) but leads the Black Stars due to a superior goal difference.

The Central African Republic is fifth with a point, while Chad is at the bottom with no points and a negative goal difference from the opening two matches.

Head-to-Head

According to football data outlets like AIscore, Ghana and Mali have met 10 times, with the Black Stars winning five times and Mali winning three. The ten matches have produced 22 goals, with each side scoring 11.

In World Cup qualifiers, the two countries have met twice, with Ghana edging Mali with a win and a draw.

In the last six matches played between the two countries in all competitions, Ghana has won two, drawn one, and lost three to Mali.

In their last matches across various competitions and friendlies, Ghana's record reads 2 losses and 4 draws, while Mali's reads 3 wins, 2 draws, and one defeat.

Team News

Both teams enter the game with some of their star players. Ghana will be without captain Andre Dede Ayew, while Mali will miss Tottenham midfielder Yves Bissouma, who is still recovering from an injury sustained during the season. Mamadou Fofana and Salim Diankate have received their first call-ups and hope to make their international debuts in this match.

Ghana's squad includes two new players, Ibrahim Sulemana and Brandon Thomas-Asante, who hope to make their debuts and contribute to a victory for Ghana.

Key Players

Mohammed Kudus is Ghana's poster boy and aims to shine once again for the Black Stars. The return of Thomas Partey is a significant boost for Ghana, who played their opening two matches without the influential midfielder.

Lassina Sinayoko of AJ Auxerre and Kamore Doumbia of Brest are players on the Malian team that Ghana must be wary of.
