AUSTRIA 1-2 TURKEY: MERIH DEMIRAL GRABS BRACE TO SET UP EURO 2024 QUARTER-FINAL CLASH WITH THE NETHERLANDS
BYEUROSPORT

UPDATED 02/07/2024 AT 22:53 GMT

Merih Demiral was the match-winner for Turkey as they turned in a brilliant performance to knock out Ralf Rangnick's Austria. The defender scored once in each half - his initial strike in the very first minute of the game - to take his men through to a last-eight meeting with the Netherlands, who beat Romania earlier on Tuesday. Michael Gregoritsch got one back for Austria but it was in vain.

Turkey kept their Euro 2024 campaign going with a thrilling 2-1 win over Austria to reach the quarter-finals.
Both of their goals came from corner kicks, both whipped in by Arda Guler and both finished off by centre back Merih Demiral. The first effort came after just 57 seconds, with Demiral extending the lead just before the hour.

Austria pinned Turkey back for the remainder of the half, and got back into the match on 66 minutes from a corner of their own when substitute Michael Gregoritsch turned in a loose ball at the back post.

NETHERLANDS SET UP SEMI-FINAL CLASH WITH ENGLAND AFTER COMEBACK WIN OVER TURKEY

08/07/2024 AT 05:28

With the Turkish players tiring, their goalkeeper Mert Gunok pulled off what could be the save of the tournament in the final minute of added time, turning a towering header from Christoph Baumgartner around the post when an equaliser looked certain.
This victory means Turkey will now face the Netherlands in Berlin on Saturday as the final Euro 2024 quarter-final was confirmed.
TALKING POINT - OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS – FOR EVERYONE
It’s not just England that will be rubbing their hands and thinking a final is there to be reached from this side of the draw. Switzerland have never so much as seen a semi-final at a major tournament, while the Dutch are arguably playing the better of all four sides and will relish the chance to add to their one international gong to date.
It is the Netherlands that Turkey will now face in Berlin, and Vincenzo Montella’s side have more than a punchers chance in the German capital. The benchmark for Turkish international football is the last four, a stage they reached at the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2008. After a thrilling night in Leipzig, a semi-final is within sight again.
Turkey are carrying a lot of injuries, suspensions and potential suspensions into the business end of the tournament, but they also have momentum. After a last minute winner against the Czech Republic and a last minute save for the ages to see off Austria, belief will be coursing through their veins. A side that plays and lives right on the edge could well go further than any Turkish side before them.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH – ARDA GULER (TURKEY)
Believe the hype. Guler might not have played much for Real Madrid this season, but Leipzig saw powerful evidence of why the Spanish giants have recruited this young talent. He orchestrated everything good that Turkey did, calmly kept possession and drew fouls to alleviate the pressure on his side. When the big moments came at the top of the pitch he was there, with his wicked set piece delivery leading to both Turkish goals.

MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
1' GOAL! AUSTRIA 0 TURKEY 1 (DEMIRAL 1) Turkey lead after just 57 seconds! A lightning break wins them an early corner, which Guler drops straight on Pentz. He leaves it, the ball ricochets off Posch and Baumgartner, and then Pentz, before Demiral slides into the six yard box to drive the ball high into the net. What a start!
5' SO CLOSE! Oh my word. Austria win a corner, and whip it in low to the near post. It misses two players at the front post, goes past Gunok and then Baumgartner fails to turn it in from a yard out at the back under pressure from Demiral! Goodness me.
51' BIG SAVE! Baumgartner slides a gorgeous pass right through the heart of the Turkish defence, perfectly timed for Arnautovic, who is clean through. Arnautovic shoots low, and Gunok ruhes out to block with his legs. What a chance!
59' GOAL! AUSTRIA 0 TURKEY 2 (DEMIRAL 59) Turkey have doubled their advantage, and it's that man and that creator again! Guler, being pelted by plastic cups in the corner from the Austrian fans, ignores the hail of plastic and whips a perfect ball in to the near post. It only needs a glance and Demiral provides it, sending the ball fizzing past Pentz to make it 2-0!
66' GOAL! AUSTRIA 1 (GREGORITSCH 66) TURKEY 2 Game back on, and it;s another goal from a corner! Sabitzer whips it to the penalty spot, where Posch glances the ball across goal. It drifts to Gregoritsch, completely unmarked at the back post, and he half-volleys the ball into the roof of the net!
90+5' WHAT A SAVE! Austria lob a hopeful ball to the back post. Baumgartner rises, and thumps a towering downward header to the bottom corner. It looks in for all the world, until Gunok, dives across to turn the ball around the post at full stretch! That is an unbelievable save!
