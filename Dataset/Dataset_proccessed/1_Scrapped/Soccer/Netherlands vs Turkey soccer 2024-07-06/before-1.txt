Netherlands lineup vs. Turkey: Predicted XI for Euro 2024 quarter-final

The Netherlands will continue their quest for a second continental crown on Saturday, with a Euro 2024 quarter-final against Turkey standing between them and a place in the final four.

A convincing 3-0 win over Romania in the last 16 means that Ronald Koeman may be loath to make many changes, particularly as his team carved out numerous chances to score.

Donyell Malen could be the beneficiary of Steven Bergwijn's misfortune, though, as the latter was substituted midway through Tuesday's match because of injury and has since trained individually; Malen replaced the Ajax winger and then netted twice in the dying stages.

Therefore, it could be a straight contest between the Borussia Dortmund forward and fellow Bundesliga star Jeremie Frimpong to start on the right side of an attack led by mercurial maverick Memphis Depay, who averages almost a goal every other game for the Oranje.

On that same flank, Denzel Dumfries was back on form earlier this week, so Lutsharel Geertruida should remain benched; Nathan Ake starts on the left, with Stefan de Vrij and captain Virgil van Dijk occupying the centre.

While Gakpo and Malen grabbed the headlines last time out, midfield duo Jerdy Schouten and Xavi Simons both impressed, gaining glowing praise from the Dutch press, so they are again set to feature alongside AC Milan's Tijjani Reijnders.

Should Koeman opt for continuity, Tottenham Hotspur defender Micky van de Ven and fans' favourite Wout Weghorst will have to make do with a place on the bench.

Netherlands possible starting lineup: Verbruggen; Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake; Schouten, Reijnders; Malen, Simons, Gakpo; Depay
