If in doubt, break glass for Wout

The Athletic

Even the Dutch, with all of their footballing principles, aren’t opposed to throwing on a big guy and crossing it in.

Everyone has a hard line somewhere, at which they’ll abandon the ‘philosophy’ and take the most direct route to goal.

Weghorst’s introduction allowed the Dutch to move into a 3-2-5. He had a role in the winner too.

In 45 minutes, he had nine touches and three passes, but an unquantifiable impact on his team-mates.

When it doubt, get Wout.

Arda Guler impresses again

Getty Images

While a Barcelona teenager — Lamine Yamal — has rightly been garnering attention throughout the tournament, another from Real Madrid is starting to lay claim to equal billing.

Arda Guler may not have played too often for Madrid last season, but he ended the season in fabulous form (five goals in five games) and has brought that momentum to Germany.

His second assist of the tournament was a beauty…Verbruggen helpless.

Gakpo has become their star man

Getty Images

It may have been attributed to Turkey’s Mert Muldur as an own goal but it was the presence of Cody Gakpo that counted once again.

While the debate has centred around Memphis Depay or Wout Weghorst as Netherlands’ main striker, it is Gakpo who has looked the most likely route to goal.

He has three goals and one assist in the competition, from his position starting on the left flank and drifting inside.

England will know all about him but in an Oranje shirt he looks to possess a different level of confidence.

Super six for the Dutch

Getty Images

With this win, Netherlands have reached the semi-finals of a European Championship for the sixth time.

Only Germany — who have made it to nine — have reached more.

But then, the hosts are no longer in this one are they? And that’s what matters right now.

The Briefing: Weghorst’s impact, Guler shines and Dutch comeback courage

Getty Images

So, Netherlands come from behind to beat Turkey and book a semi-final showdown with England.

Samet Akaydin headed Turkey into the lead but two goals in six second-half minutes turned Saturday’s quarter-final on its head.

Stefan de Vrij headed the leveller before a Mert Muldur own goal sent the Dutch to their first Euros semi since 2004.

Tim Spiers, Jordan Campbell and Liam Tharme break down the main talking points from Berlin.

If you go back 28 years...

The last time Netherlands and England met at a European Championship? Arguably one of England’s greatest wins the tournament’s history.

The wonderful Carl Anka revisits a special day for England, and something Netherlands will want to put right in Dortmund.

An unforgettable campaign

Whatever happens next, Euro 2024 will always have Arda Guler.

And there should be a few tournaments to follow too.

Well played, young man.

Bart Verbruggen — a Netherlands’ match-winner

Getty Images

There was some fantastic goalkeeping in those final minutes from Bart Verbruggen to protect his side’s lead.

A young keeper with huge talent — as Brighton’s goalkeeping coach Jack Stern knows all too well:

💬 “He’s a world-class professional and he’s going to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world eventually.”

You can read more where that came from with the excellent Andy Naylor and the link below.

A fraught finale

It’s an own goal that decides it. Tosun is booked late for dissent at being penalised for a foul. Rennes forward and unused substitute Bertug Yildirim is then sent off from the bench for his actions.

All before the final whistle goes and the Dutch’s win is secure.

Zirkzee gets a chance to shine

90+4' Netherlands 2-1 Turkey

Joshua Zirkzee’s first minutes of the tournament. Ronald Koeman didn’t pick the Bologna attacker — who is of interest to Manchester United this summer — in his initial squad, and even criticised his goalscoring.

But he is a technically excellent forward — and Koeman has turned to him to close it out.

What a save from Verbruggen

90+2' Netherlands 2-1 Turkey

That is the pick of the bunch. Stunning save from Verbruggen at his feet, and from point-blank range, after the close-range effort from Kilicsoy.

This game is an absolute state right now.

90' Netherlands 2-1 Turkey

Great strike from Gakpo. Fine save from Gunok.

Back up the other end and the delivery from wide is headed off-target by Akturkoglu.

Zirkzee enters the fray

87' Netherlands 2-1 Turkey

Now Koeman makes further changes, with Zirkzee and Frimpong on for Depay and Simons. Bring on the pacey counter-attacks, yes?

Well, it’s still Turkeytrying to press and get increasingly desperate. Tosun sends a header just over, when some of the crowd thought it was in.

Send it to the big man

Getty Images

87' Netherlands 2-1 Turkey

Cenk Tosun and Wout Weghorst on the same pitch. Football is healing, everyone is going back to big guys up-front.

It’s been a fascinating wrinkle on a tournament which has been pretty tactical. Nobody, not even the total footballing Dutch, are above crossing to a target man. And funnily enough, it helps your ball-to-feet No 10s be better when there’s someone to occupy the centre-backs.

Next goal wins, or it feels like it

Getty Images

85' Netherlands 2-1 Turkey

It’s gone down as an own goal to Mert Muldur, which looks right.

Akturkoglu, Yokuslu, Tosun and Celik have all come on now.

Tosun has already headed one chance well over. Now the pressure is really coming in the Dutch box.

So far they are finding the blocks they need, but this really now feels like next goal wins — and everyone’s trying to score.
