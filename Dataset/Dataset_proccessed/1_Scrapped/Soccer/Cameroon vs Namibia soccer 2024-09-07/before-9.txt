FECAFOOT Takes Legal Action Against Indomitable Lions Coach Marc Brys Over Player Passports

GAROUA— In a never before seen escalation of the ongoing conflict within Cameroonian football, the Cameroon Football Federation (FECAFOOT) has taken legal steps against the national team coach, Marc Brys, over his refusal to hand over the passports of the players.Watch live soccer online

This latest development adds another layer of tension to the already volatile situation as the Indomitable Lions prepare for their crucial match against Namibia on September 7, 2024.

According to the legal summons issued by FECAFOOT and executed by Master Abdourahmane, a bailiff at the Court of Appeal of the North and the Courts of Garoua, Coach Brys has been formally ordered to surrender the passports of all players on the national team. FECAFOOT argues that Brys's refusal to comply has caused significant disorganization within the team, potentially jeopardizing their performance and even leading to a possible withdrawal from the competition.

The legal document asserts that Brys’s actions are without "serious reasons or motives" and warns that FECAFOOT will pursue all legal consequences if the coach fails to comply. The order demands the immediate handover of the passports to Benoit Angbwa, FECAFOOT's National Football Selection Coordinator.Watch live soccer online

This move underscores the deepening power struggle between FECAFOOT and the Ministry of Sports and Physical Education (MINSEP), which has resulted in two competing technical staffs for the national team. The conflict has created confusion and uncertainty, with FECAFOOT unable to exert full control over the team despite holding official authority.

As the deadline for compliance looms, the football community waits to see how Coach Brys will respond and whether this legal action will further destabilize the Indomitable Lions ahead of their important fixture.

The stakes are high, and the ongoing saga is a stark reminder of the challenges that arise when sports and politics collide on the national stage.
