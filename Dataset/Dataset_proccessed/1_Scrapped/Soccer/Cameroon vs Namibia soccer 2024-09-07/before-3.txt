Warriors will have to do without Kulula and Kasume at #AFCONQ
September 3, 2024

The Brave Warriors will have to do without Erastus Kulula and Romeo Kasume when they take on the Indomitable Lions away at the Garoura Roumde Stadium on Saturday, 7 September 2024 (5pm).

Kasume and Kulula are not eligible to travel from Kosovo due to VISA restrictions. Kasume and Kulula are being substituted by Punaije Katjimune and Lawrence Doeseb.

“It’s a huge blow to the team but we equally believe in all the players and what they bring to the team, Kulula and Kasume had an impressive year with the team thus far, they both featured in the World Cup qualifiers in June and did well for first timers at a big stage, they went on to play in the COSAFA Tournament.

Katjimune and Doeseb are young and eager to play, and this are the kind of players we need said Head Coach, Collin Benjamin.

Benjamin’s side travelled to South Africa on Sunday,1 September to continue with preparations before they depart to Cameroon on 4 September 2024. The team will travel back to South Africa to play their second match in the group against Kenya on Tuesday, 10 September 2024 at the Orlando Stadium. 

The two top finishers will qualify for the tournament to be hosted in Morocco from 21 December 2025 to 18 January 2026.
