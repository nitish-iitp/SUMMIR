Match Preview

Spain and Brazil will meet for the first time in 11 years on Tuesday when they play an international friendly in Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu.

Real Madrid pair Vinícius Júnior and Rodrygo will look to impress in their home stadium after helping Brazil to a 1-0 win in England on Saturday night. That victory ended a three-game losing streak and inflicted England’s first defeat in 21 matches at Wembley Stadium.

Seventeen-year-old Endrick – who will also be joining his Brazilian teammates at Real Madrid next season – scored the only goal of the game after coming off the bench.

Spain’s 1-0 friendly defeat to Colombia in London on Friday was their first loss in nine games and followed a six-game winning streak, in which they’d averaged 3.7 goals per game. It was only the second time Spain have lost under Luis de la Fuente after defeat to Scotland in his second match in charge a year ago.

Brazil travel to Madrid with plenty of injury issues depleting their squad. Gabriel Martinelli, Joelinton, Éder Militão, Casemiro, Neymar, João Pedro, Ederson, Alisson, Gabriel Magalhães and Marquinhos make up the bulk of a long – and star-studded – injury list.

Spain, meanwhile, could be without Rodri. The Manchester City midfielder was allowed to skip training on Monday to tend to a personal matter and therefore should be considered a doubt.

The Seleção have a good recent record against teams from the UEFA confederation. They’ve won 11 of their last 12 friendly matches against European nations (D1), scoring 26 goals and conceding only four times. The last European team to beat them in a friendly was Switzerland in August 2013.

Spain vs Brazil Head-to-Head

This will be the first international meeting between Spain and Brazil since the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup final, when Brazil beat La Roja 3-0 on home soil at the Maracanã, Rio de Janeiro. Goals from Fred (2) and Neymar saw them win the tournament ahead of hosting the 2014 World Cup.

Overall, Spain have won just two of their previous nine games against Brazil – their first in May 1934 at the World Cup (3-1) and a 3-0 friendly win in Gijón back in September 1990. The three goals in that win are the only ones they’ve scored in their last six meetings with the Seleção.

Spain vs Brazil Prediction

Despite their impressive win against England at Wembley on Saturday, the Opta supercomputer still sees a Brazil victory as the least likely result in this match (27.0%). Spain have home advantage, and that helped them win 43.9% of the simulations before kick-off.
