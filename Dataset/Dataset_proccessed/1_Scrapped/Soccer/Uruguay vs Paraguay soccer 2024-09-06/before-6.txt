This month the Uruguayan national team faced Guatemala in a friendly match that ended in a 1-1 draw and will face Paraguay and Venezuela in the qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup. In this match the former Barcelona striker Luis Suarez was absent and after this, a press conference was called which would give clues to the future of the Uruguayan in the national team.

The Uruguayan Football Association announced on their social media that the striker wants to send a message to the fans through the media. He will appear at 20:00 local time on Tuesday 2 September.

"Suarez has something to tell you. The top scorer in the history of the ‘Celeste’ will give a press conference on Monday from the Centenario Stadium," reads the text published on the national team's official channels, along with a photograph of the veteran striker and the caption “press conference”. Fans are already taking it for granted that he will confirm that he will not wear the ‘Celeste’ shirt again.

While this press conference was being announced, he scored two goals against Chicago Fire in Inter Miami's most recent MLS match. In the game just before that, he scored another brace against Cincinnati to boost Inter Miami's run of outstanding form, which has now made it four domestic wins in a row.
