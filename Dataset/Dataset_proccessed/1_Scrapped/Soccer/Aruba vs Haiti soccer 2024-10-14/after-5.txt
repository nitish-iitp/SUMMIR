SALISBURY Md. -- Two first half goals were enough to get the Rams girls soccer team a win over Easton. 

The Rams struck in the 15th minute, McKenzie Watson crossed the ball to Ashley Garcia-Ramirez who scored the tap-in goal to put the Rams in front. Eleven minutes later the Warriors tied the game up with a Dafny Vasquez long shot that floated into the corner of the net.
