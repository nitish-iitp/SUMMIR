Sweden will be looking to continue their strong start to the Nations League group stage when they welcome Estonia to Solna on Sunday.

The hosts were disappointing in the last two competitions. Jon Dahl Tomasson's men missed out on Euro 2024 after finishing third in Group F of the qualifiers and they finished bottom of League B Group 4 in the last Nations League. The Blue and Yellows were expected to respond and they did so in midweek in Baku, where they beat Azerbaijan 3-1.

Estonia are one of the worst nations in Nations League Group I. Ranked 123rd in the FIFA national team rankings, they finished the EURO qualifying campaign without a win in eight matches and suffered seven defeats. Their Nations League campaign got off to a poor start but the Blueshirts weren't too bad as they conceded just one goal and registered three shots on target.

Sweden vs Estonia Betting Tips: Sweden to win

The last few meetings between these two nations have only gone in favour of one side, Sweden and I don't think things will change this weekend. The last two competitive h2h meetings have been in the EUROS. Sweden won both encounters 7-0 on aggregate and their recent form - two wins from their last two competitive matches - is another reason to back them to take all three points on Sunday.

Estonia go into Sunday's game on a run of eight consecutive defeats. They shipped 20 goals in total and failed to score in all eight of those games, so anything other than a win for the hosts would be a surprise.

Estonia head coach Juergen Henn will once again be without the services of Maksim Paskotsi this weekend due to injury.

Paskotsi picked up the injury while playing for Grasshopper in the Swiss Super League and the 21-year-old is expected to be sidelined for several weeks.
