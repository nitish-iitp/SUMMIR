Sweden will face Estonia at the Friends Arena on Sunday in another round of their 2024-25 UEFA Nations League campaign. The home side have endured a slow start to life under head coach Jon Dahl Tomasson but put out an impressive showing in their group opener on Thursday and now sit atop the Group 1 standings.

They beat Azerbaijan 3-1 in their tournament opener last time out with the striking duo of Alexander Isak and Sporting man Viktor Gyokeres combining to devastating effect to secure maximum points on the road for Blagult.

Meanwhile, Estonia locked horns with Slovakia in their opening game on Thursday, suffering a 1-0 defeat in an overall disappointing performance on home turf in which they struggled to find invention in the final third.

The visitors have a sterner test this weekend and will be looking to give a good account of themselves against the group favorites. Following Sunday's game, Sinisärgid will break from action before returning next month to play Azerbaijan at the Lilleküla Stadium.

Sweden vs Estonia Head-to-Head and Key Numbers
Sunday's game will mark the 21st meeting between Sweden and Estonia. The home side are undefeated in all 20 of their previous matchups, picking up 18 wins and two draws.
The two teams last faced off in a friendly clash earlier in the year which Blagult won 2-1 via goals from Sebastian Nanasi and Isaac Kiese Thelin.
The hosts have won their last four games in this fixture.
Estonia's only clean sheet in this fixture came back in July 1921.
Sweden were ranked 29th in the latest FIFA rankings and now sit 94 places above their weekend opponents.
Sweden vs Estonia Prediction

Sweden's latest result ended a run of consecutive defeats and they will be looking to build on that this Sunday. They have won three of their last four games on home soil and will head into the weekend clash as clear favorites.

Meanwhile, Estonia saw their latest result end a run of back-to-back victories and will be looking to bounce back here. The sheer gulf in class and quality between the two teams could, however, see Jurgen Henn's men lose this one.

Prediction: Sweden 3-0 Estonia
