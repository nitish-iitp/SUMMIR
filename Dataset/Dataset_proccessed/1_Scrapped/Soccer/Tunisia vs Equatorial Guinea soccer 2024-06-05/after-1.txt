Malawi National Football Team coach Patrick Mabedi says time has come for the Flames to start preparing for life without South Africa-based striker Frank Gabadinho Mhango as age is catching up with him.

In an interview with South African publication  Soccer Laduma just before releasing his final squad last week ahead of 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers against Sao Tome and Principe at home tomorrow and  Equatorial Guinea  away on June 10, the Flames mentor said there is need to manage the transition by giving a chance to up-and-coming players.

Mabedi is quoted as having said: “We sometimes need to accept change and transition in football. We must look at the future because the reality is that Gaba will not always be here for the national team and we need to find replacements for him.

Mabedi: We need to accept change

“We need to prepare players that will take over from him.  He is one of my sons. Like I said, he is a very good player, but the reality of life is that we need to prepare young players to take over from him and others. When I was at Kaizer Chiefs, they had to prepare young players to take over from me and others.”

The former Kaizer Chiefs captain also dismissed suggestions of any rift between him and the former FCB Nyasa Bullets striker.

He said: “As a professional coach, I have nothing against Gaba. Do you know that I am the one who recommended Gaba to come to South Africa [in 2012] and he stayed with me when he arrived here? I was the one who took him to Bloemfontein Celtic; I am that one person who encouraged Gaba to come and play in South Africa and people should know that Gaba is my boy.

“He [Gabadinho] is a very good player and has done very well for his country. But like I said, with the national team, you do not have enough time to work with the players in the way that you would like as a coach. So, consistency is also very important for a player to remain at the top.”

But football analyst David Kanyenda, while agreeing that age is catching up with the forward, said the same should also apply to other players such as Mozambique-based captain John ‘CJ’ Banda.

He said: “The age issue is true for Gaba and a lot others in the squad too. ‘CJ’, for example, isn’t particularly young. For me, ‘CJ’ is a tactical hazard. What do you want him to do on the field?”

Kanyenda, who is also Mighty Mukuru Wanderers board member, but was speaking in his personal capacity, said Mhango deserves a place in the squad following his impressive performance which helped Moroka Swallows escape relegation.

He said: “What’s important is performance and Gaba finished the season in fine scoring form and, therefore, ought to have been drafted into the squad

“Maybe the real issue for his exclusion relates to discipline. If so, the coach should have been candid about the same rather than plead Gaba’s age.”

But Mabedi said he has no grudge against Gaba, saying if that was the case, he would not have called him up when the Flames played Zambia, Kenya and Zimbabwe in the Four Nations Tournament which Malawi hosted in March.

Meanwhile, the Flames now have a  full squad following the arrival of Banda last night.

“We are starting our full training today as we have all our players,” said Mabedi yesterday.

Malawi started their 2026 World Cup campaign with  a 1-0 victory over Liberia in Monrovia in November 2023, but lost by the same scoreline to Tunisia at Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe.

Tunisia  lead the table with six points. They are tied on points with second-placed Namibia, but are separated by goal difference.  Liberia are third with three points while the Flames, also with three points, are fourth.

Guinea, who forfeited points from their matches against Liberia and Namibia after featuring an ineligible player, are fifth with no point just like group anchors Sao Tome.
