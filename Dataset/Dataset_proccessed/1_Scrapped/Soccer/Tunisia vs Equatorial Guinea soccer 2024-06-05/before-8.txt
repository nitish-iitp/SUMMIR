The next fixtures of the 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers will go underway on Wednesday, 5 June 2024 and the stakes have been raised ahead of the third match day out of 10 to be played.

These matches will determine which teams will take part in the next instalment of the showpiece to be hosted in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The winners of the groups will qualify for the next World Cup finals, and the second-placed teams will enter a playoff round which will decide which two sides will get spots in the tournament.

The first match in a week which will be packed with African football action is from Group H, Namibia who are currently first will go up against Liberia who are placed third at the Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg.

Namibia made history as they made it to the knockout stage of the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) for the very first time earlier this year, and now will hope to keep up the momentum as they seek to secure their maiden World Cup qualification.

Another fixture in the group will be Tunisia facing Equatorial Guinea at the Stade Olympique Hammadi Agrebi. Tunisia has gone through a spell of underwhelming performances, needing penalties to beat New Zealand when they played an international friendly in March at the Cairo International Stadium.

The North African side has now gone five games in a row without a win in normal time, losing twice and grabbing three draws. This run saw the team unexpectedly crash out of the 2023 Afcon in the group stages.

Equatorial Guinea will be hoping to resume their World Cup qualifying campaign on a positive note, but they will have a difficult task in facing a team that has won five of their last seven meetings against them, with one draw since June 2012.

There will also be fixtures played from Group A, B and I. Sierra Leone play against Djibouti, Central African Republic go up against Chad and Togo will take on South Sudan.

Fixtures, 5 June 2024

Namibia v Liberia (18:00)

Sierra Leone v Djibouti (18:00)

Central African Republic v Chad (18:00)

Togo v South Sudan (18:00)

Tunisia v Equatorial Guinea (21:00)
