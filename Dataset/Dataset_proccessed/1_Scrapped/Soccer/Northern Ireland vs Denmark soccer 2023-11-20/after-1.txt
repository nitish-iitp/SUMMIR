'Optimistic for the future'

22:26 GMT 20 November 2023

FT: Northern Ireland 2-0 Denmark

Michael O'Neill, Northern Ireland manager: "I'm certainly more comfortable tonight than I was after Friday night. I think we need to give this team a lot of time to grow, they are still very, very young. Qualification is important and everyone wants to qualify but we need certain things to go in our favour and we need consistency in our selection.

"We've been really challenged in this campaign with players missing out, even yesterday we lost Daniel Ballard, Ciaran Brown comes in and he was brilliant. He's not had an easy campaign and yet tonight I thought he played terrific, so for him that will really boost him.

"There's a lot of players in this group who are just getting to grips with international football and there is obviously a lot of younger players as well, so they can only benefit from what we experienced tonight.

"We have so little time, it's very, very quick. Sometimes we only have seven days with the players and two games, so the training time is very, very important, so hopefully we'll get that with the games that we have in March and again in June.

"I think what we have is a really committed squad. We don't have any sort of withdrawal situations or anything like maybe in the past and we have a really hungry group of players who really want to do well. They are a really tight group of players and I think we have to be optimistic for the future with them."

The three centre halves, taking into the consideration the quality of the opposition, I think they were magnificent tonight.

Paddy McNair, playing in the centre of the three, was magnificent tonight.

FT: Northern Ireland 2-0 Denmark

Dion Charles, Northern Ireland striker: "It was incredible. We worked tirelessly all game and we got our rewards in the end.

On how his goal felt: "Incredible. All the hard work I put in during the game - I got the reward in the end. That first chance probably came a bit too soon in the game. I knew if I kept getting in the right positions then I'd get another opportunity. Luckily I was there at the end.

Looking ahead: "We are a very young squad and inexperienced, but that gives us a lot of hope moving forward, into the next campaign in March. It shows we can go toe-to-toe with a big nation like Denmark.

"Now it's up to us to give those standards every single day we are on the training pitch and out there at Windsor. It's about breeding that winning mentality and hopefully this is just the start."

Denmark had 72% possession and they lose the game 2-0. When you think about and the fact they had one or two moments in the game. The best chances of the game came for Northern Ireland in terms of real quality.

FT: Northern Ireland 2-0 Denmark

Michael O'Neill, Northern Ireland manager: "We see Stuart Dallas and Steven Davis at the game tonight and it would be lovely to have them available to us again. I think it would help the team further and hopefully we get some of the older boys back as well.

"I still think that they have a lot to offer but I think where we are now with this group of players, what they need is some time, games at this level, they need positive experiences like they got tonight because they have had a few negative experiences and that makes it difficult. You want to be coming away to play international football believing that you should be at this level and that you can win at this level, so hopefully that creates that for the players tonight."

Once that second goal went in, the place was bouncing.

Jim and I have played in games against nations we weren't expected to beat and there's no better feeling, playing out there and beating one of the big sides.

'It helps our self-belief'

FT: Northern Ireland 2-0 Denmark

Michael O'Neill, Northern Ireland manager: "We had four under-21s start the game tonight, we have a lot of players in single figures for caps. The two lads Toal and Brown, they're playing their league football in League One.

"It's massive step to play against players that play Champions League football or Europa League football and in the top leagues, so it helps with our self-belief that you can deal with the game at this level but you can only really do it in a good structure, in a good team and a compact team and that's what we were tonight."

Shea Charles has done great, he has been a massive plus.

The introduction of Dale Taylor, he'll play better and he will enjoy it more because he will be playing first team football and he has done great in first team football.

FT: North Macedonia 1-1 England

In Group C, England were held to a 1-1 draw by North Macedonia.

The hosts were awarded a controversial penalty at the end of the first half when England debutant Rico Lewis caught striker Bojan Miovski's with his hand as he jumped up for a header.

North Macedonia captain Enis Bardhi put his side ahead from the rebound after his spot-kick was saved by England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.

England equalised in the 59th minute when Phil Foden's corner deflected in off Macedonian Jani Atanasov under pressure from Harry Kane.

Conor McMenamin was at Glentoran and he could have stayed there, but he really wants to play international football and he knew he had to go to that next level to keep getting into that squad.

We've spoke about it, I think he's a bit unfortunate that he hasn't started more games, and you saw the impact he has made tonight.

'There were great performances'

FT: Northern Ireland 2-0 Denmark

Michael O'Neill, Northern Ireland manager: "I thought right through the team there were great performances. Isaac Price and Shea Charles were terrific, George Saville was great in midfield as well. The back three were very solid, Trai Hume had to do very well after being booked early on and had to keep his discipline against a very fast winger on that side and I thought we manged the game very well.

"I'm pleased with every single player. Jamal Lewis had a great performance. Conor Hazard hasn't played very often and to come in and keep a clean sheet, all of those things just help players believe that they can deal with the game at this level and we showed that tonight."

'Two terrific goals'

FT: Northern Ireland 2-0 Denmark

Michael O'Neill, Northern Ireland manager: "It was a great performance. We had to be very disciplined without the ball. I thought that we started the game well and then we got a little bit deep at times but we defended well, we didn't really give up very many chances but when you're that deep there is always a chance that you could get a ricochet and it can go against you.

"Then second half we got a bit more territory, we talked about that at half time and obviously we scored to terrific goals by making them turn the ball over in the middle third of the pitch and being able to counter attack from there."

If you're not playing (club) football it's an impossibility, you're not going to win a game of international football, it's as simple as that.

These lads have got to force their way into first teams, they have got to be playing regularly and they have to be put under that intense pressure because nothing replicates it until you're standing out there.

Isaac Price: "I don't think there is any feeling like scoring in football so when it hit the back of the net I went straight to the corner flag. It was a great feeling.

"It's massive [for belief]. Since I've been here there have been a few games where we have not really pleased the crowd. We know one of the main parts of our game is getting the crowd on our side because they are loud when we have them.

"It showed today. We went 1-0 up and they were singing the whole way through. It's something for the fans as well because it will be frustrating for them when they are travelling away and watching us and we're not getting the results that we should be getting. It just shows that we are capable of it."

'It's gone our way'

FT: Northern Ireland 2-0 Denmark

Isaac Price, Northern Ireland: "It was a great victory for us. I feel like in the past games a few of them have gone against us and we've narrowly missed out by one goal and we feel like we could have got more from the games.

"Especially when we went to Denmark and gave them a tough game over there. We were unlucky to lose 1-0 and this has kind of summed up our campaign. We are a team where we defend and make it hard for teams and today it has gone our way."
