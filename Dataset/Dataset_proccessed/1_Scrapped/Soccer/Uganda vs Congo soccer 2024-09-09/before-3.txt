UGANDA CRANES HELD TO A 2-2 DRAW AS AFCON BEGINS

Uganda cranes almost secured three important points in their opening game of the Total African Cup of Nations (AFCON) against South Africa, only to concede a last-minute equalizer to settle for a point in their 2-2 draw against their hosts.

The group K opening game that was played on the night of September 6, 2024, at Orlando Stadium in Soweto, Johannesburg, had the home fans celebrate first as Brigton forward Lyle Foster scored an opening goal in the 14th minute.

Uganda came from behind to equalize in the 51st minute through Denis Omedi, and Rogers Mato made it 2-1 in the 53rd minute, raising hopes for the visiting fans only for Thalente Mbatha to equalize in the last minute of added time to make it 2-2.

In the other group K results, Congo Brazaville beat South Sudan 1-0, which means they top the table with three points and Sudan is at the bottom of group K with zero points.

Uganda Cranes will play again on Monday, September 9, 2024, as they host Congo Brazzaville at Namboole Stadium, while South Africa plays South Sudan.

According to Ugandan coach Pat Paul, he hopes that his side manages to secure a win at their home ground in Namboole if they are to have a chance to qualify for the 2025 African Cup of Nations.

“The home game at Namboole is a crucial one as we host Congo, and a win is all we need at home,” Pat said.

Uganda Cranes has had a good run at home in the past games, and with the home support, a home win will boost morale in the Cranes camp.
