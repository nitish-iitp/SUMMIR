In a competitive football match played at Orlando Stadium, South Africa, the Uganda Crane on Friday secured a point after holding Bafana Bafana in a 2:2 draw game in their opening quest for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers in Morocco.

The two goals were scored by Denis Omedi and Rogers Mato earning Uganda a point in the campaign.

South Africa’s Lyle Frazer scored the opening goal in just 14 minutes of play, putting Uganda back in the 1:0 first half.

However, just 6 minutes into the second half, Uganda’s Omedi leveled up the scores, displaying a comeback into the game.

In the 53rd minute Uganda’s Mato gave the team 2:1 lead until the 4 minute into the added time when South Africa’s Thalente Mutyaba equalized for Bafana Bafana ensuring a shared point for the contest.

Uganda will be playing Congo in their upcoming game on Monday, 9 September 2024 at their home ground at Mandele National Stadium, Namboole.

In the other group game Congo secured 1:0 victory over South Sudan played on Thursday 5 September 2024.

Earlier, Kenya and Zimbabwe played out a goalless draw in their opening match at the Mandela Stadium in Uganda.

Uganda Cranes are in Group K with South Africa, Congo, and South Sudan. Congo is on top of the group with 3 points, Uganda and South Africa have 1 point each, and South Sudan has zero points.
