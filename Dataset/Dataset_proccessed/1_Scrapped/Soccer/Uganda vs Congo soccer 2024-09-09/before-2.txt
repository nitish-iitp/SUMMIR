Preview: Uganda vs. Congo - prediction, team news, lineups

Uganda will set out in search of their first win of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers when they welcome Congo to the Nelson Mandela National Stadium on Monday.
 
Congo, meanwhile, make the journey looking to make it two wins from as many matches, having narrowly pipped South Sudan to all three points last time out.

Having missed each of the last two AFCON tournaments, Uganda were keen to kick off their qualifying campaign with a victory and nearly managed an opening-day upset against South Africa.
 
Paul Put's men came within touching distance of securing all three points at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Friday, but eventually had to make do with a share of the spoils in Pretoria.
 
After going behind to Lyle Foster's opener, the Cranes rallied in the second half to hit back through quickfire goals from Denis Omedi and Rogers Mato Kassim before Thalente Mbatha levelled matters in stoppage time.
 
Since kicking off 2024 with a friendly 1-0 victory over Kuwait, Monday's hosts have come out on top in just one of their subsequent five outings across all competitions, which came against Botswana in June.
 
Nonetheless, Uganda's performance against South Africa will surely offer some hope heading into Monday's encounter against an opposing outfit who have managed just one win from five previous editions of this fixture.
 
Congo kicked off life in Group K with a much-needed 1-0 triumph against the Bright Stars of South Sudan when the teams went head-to-head at Stade Alphonse Massemba-Debat on Thursday evening.
 
Massanga Matondo's strike within the opening 15 minutes was enough to settle matters and hand Isaac Ngata his first win in charge at the third time of asking since taking over from his opposing number in Monday's clash, Paul Put.
 
That was a first win in six matches for the Red Devils dating back to March 2023, when they also beat South Sudan in an AFCON qualifying fixture, albeit all to no avail as they failed to make it through to the competition's finals.
 
A chance to secure consecutive wins for the first time since 2018 now awaits Congo, who are still picking themselves up off the back of a humiliating 6-0 defeat against Morocco in June's World Cup qualifier.

Following his strike against South Africa, Uganda's Denis Omedi has now netted five times in his last seven games for club and country, making him one to keep a close watch on.
 
Goalkeeper Ismail Watenga has reclaimed his place in the hosts' lineup since temporarily dropping out towards the back end of last year.
 
Congo's Morgan Poaty came off with an injury scare 10 minutes into the second half against South Sudan, and the 27-year-old is a doubt for his side's trip to Kampala.
 
Should Poaty be deemed unfit to participate, Brunallergene Junior Etou is the favourite to come into the XI for what would be only a second international appearance.


Uganda possible starting lineup:
Watenga; Kayondo, Capradossi, Mugabi, Bwomono; Aucho, Mutyaba, Ssekiganda; Mato, Mukwala, Omedi

Congo possible starting lineup:
Ndzila; Etou, Bidounga, Passi, Andzouana; Dembi, Massanga; Bassouamina, Ndockyt, Mboungou; Ganvoula




We say: Uganda 1-0 Congo

Buoyed by their narrow victory last time out, Congo will undoubtedly be feeling better about themselves heading into this one, but we can see them coming away empty-handed, albeit by only a narrow margin.
