How to Watch

FUFA TV and UBC TV are expected to broadcast the game

Uganda Cranes will be seeking maximum points against Congo in their first home fixture and their second of the 2025 AFCON qualifiers on Monday at Mandela National Stadium.

Paul Put’s charges were denied a maiden win over South Africa in their first Group K contest of the qualifiers on Friday at Orlando Stadium.

With the Cranes leading 2-1 courtesy of Denis Omedi and Rogers Mato sensation strikes, Sibongakonke Mbatha stoppage time leveller denied them a perfect start to the qualification campaign.

Congo on the other side cruised 1-0 past South Sudan in their opening game on Thursday.

Chandler Massanga scored the all important goal for the 1972 African champions.

Under the stewardship of Isaac Ngata, Congo will be aiming to return to the final AFCON tournament for the first time since the 2015 in Equatorial Guinea. They have missed out on the previous four continental tournaments.

Uganda Cranes head coach Put targets maximum points

“We are still work in progress but I am impressed with the progress and I know we will get there soon.

“Congo has a lot of quality with very good players featuring in big leagues. We definitely do not undermine them but our target is to pick maximum points.”

Team News

Muhammad Shaban is doubtful for this game according to Put,

“Shaban picked up an injury in the final 15 minutes of the last training session ahead of the game against South Africa. We will see how he reacts in training and hopefully he can be available.” Said Put

Kenneth Semakula and Halid Lwaliwa who missed the trip to South Africa due to visa issues are in contention.
