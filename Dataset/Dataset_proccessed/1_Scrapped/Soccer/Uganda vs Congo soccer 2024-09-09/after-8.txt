Major new development in Congo

Congolese Morgan Poaty was injured 10 minutes into the second half against South Sudan and is a doubt for the match. Should Poaty not be fit to participate, Brunallergene Junior Etou is the favorite to enter the eleven in what would be his second international appearance.

Congo

Congo kicked off their Group K campaign with a much-needed 1-0 win over the Bright Stars of South Sudan when the two sides met at the Stade Alphonse Massemba-Debat on Thursday night. A Massanga Matondo goal in the first quarter of an hour was enough to settle the contest and give Isaac Ngata his first win in charge for the third time since taking over from his counterpart in Monday's clash, Paul Put.

It was the Red Devils' first win in six matches since March 2023, when they also defeated South Sudan in an African Cup qualifier, although it was all in vain as they failed to qualify for the finals of the competition.

Uganda

Uganda, who have not participated in either of the last two Africa Cup of Nations, were looking to start their qualifying campaign with a win and came close to pulling off a shock on matchday one against South Africa.

Paul Put's side came close to taking all three points from Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Friday, but in the end had to settle for a share of the spoils in Pretoria. After going behind to Lyle Foster's early goal, the Cranes rallied in the second half and came from behind thanks to quick goals from Denis Omedi and Rogers Mato Kassim, before Thalente Mbatha equalized in stoppage time.
