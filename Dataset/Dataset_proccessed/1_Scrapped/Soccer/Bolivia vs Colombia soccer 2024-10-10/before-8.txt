Preview: Ecuador vs. Paraguay - prediction, team news, lineups

Ecuador will look to continue their excellent form in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying when they welcome Paraguay to Quito on Thursday.

Despite being handed a three-point deduction following document issues in the previous qualifying campaign, Ecuador find themselves above the likes of Brazil, and currently in one of the six automatic qualifying spots.

It is not unfair to suggest that these two sides have been the least entertaining across South American qualifying so far, but neither will care too much about that if they make it through.

Remarkably, Paraguay have scored two and conceded three across their eight matches so far, with only one of those games not ending 0-0 or 1-0.

Every Ecuador game so far has been either a draw or settled by a solitary goal, with two 0-0 and four 1-0s too, but the hosts are in excellent shape after eight matches, despite being handed a three-point penalty before the section began.

Without the penalty, Ecuador would be sat on 14 points, just four behind continent leaders Argentina, after narrowly getting over the line with a 1-0 win over Peru last month.

Sebastian Beccacece's side lost in Brazil a few days earlier, but they remain above the Selecao courtesy of the matchday eight results, and it is very tight with just two points separating five nations in the final few qualifying spots.

That loss in Brazil was just their second in qualifying, and the other came away to Argentina, so there is no shame at all at losing away to two of the toughest international teams on the planet, and if they can remain tough to beat, they will be on course to reach a fifth World Cup in seven attempts.

Paraguay took advantage of Brazil's troubles to beat them just a few days after that though, with the 1-0 success bringing them right back into contention to qualify.

Gustavo Alfaro's side currently occupy the playoff place in seventh, with one of the five teams currently separated by just two points set to miss out.

Paraguay will hope that is not them, but it will be a staggering achievement if they do make it playing the way they are currently.

No team has a worse attack or a better defence across CONMEBOL qualifying, and unsurprisingly, their two wins so far both ended 1-0 - against Brazil and Bolivia.

Visitors to Quito should know what to expect in this one too, as Paraguay's last two away games in qualifying have ended goalless, but with every point proving vital at present, there is no reason for Alfaro to change.

Paraguay's results at the Copa America illustrate that, as they scored in all three group games but lost each one and were eliminated.

Ecuador's match-winner against Peru, Enner Valencia, is the only player in the squad with over 50 caps, and that experience is proving vital, but 22-year-old Moises Caicedo is close to joining him in that club, as he is just two shy of reaching the half-century.

Ten players have been left out from the previous squad, with Carlos Gruezo and Jhegson Mendez two big misses for the hosts due to injury.

A lack of game time at Leganes has seen defender Jackson Porozo left out entirely this time, but the back three should remain the same from the Peru win.

Paraguay's main men have been struggling for game time in the Premier League, with neither Julio Enciso or Miguel Almiron permanent starters at Brighton & Hove Albion and Newcastle United respectively.

Alvaro Campuzano will miss the two matches this week due to injury, while Blas Riveros's cameo against Brazil was not enough for him to earn a call up again, as he has not been playing much with Talleres in Argentina.

Ecuador possible starting lineup:
Galindez; Torres, Pacho, Hincapie; Preciado, Franco, Caicedo, Estupinan; Mercado, Valencia, Paez

Paraguay possible starting lineup:
Fernandez; Caceres, Balbuena, Alderete, Alonso; Villasanti, Bobadilla; Gomez, Enciso, Almiron; Pitta



We say: Ecuador 0-0 Paraguay

Ecuador ended 2023 by going five games unbeaten, and despite losing to Brazil last time out, the win over Peru suggests they should be among the favourites to qualify, and they will be favourites to win again here.

It is almost certain to be a cagey encounter, though, and Paraguay took four points from September's internationals without conceding, so they are likely to make it tough for Ecuador.
