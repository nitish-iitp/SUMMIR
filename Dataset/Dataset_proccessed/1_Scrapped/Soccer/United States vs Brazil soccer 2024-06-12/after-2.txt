GAME NOTES | FIVE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT BRAZIL

USMNT Starting XI Cap Numbers (including this match): Christian Pulisic (68), Tim Ream (58), Weston McKennie (53), Antonee Robinson (43), Matt Turner (41), Tim Weah (39), Yunus Musah (37), Gio Reyna (28), Ricardo Pepi (25), Chris Richards (18), Joe Scally (11).

With an average age of 25 years, 151 days, tonight’s Starting XI is the second youngest lineup the USMNT has fielded in 20 all-time matches against Brazil, coming in behind the XI that began the last meeting on Sept. 7, 2018 (23 years, 111 days).

With an average of 37.3 caps, tonight’s lineup is the third-most experienced in 71 matches under Gregg Berhalter, ranking behind only the Starting XIs from the 2019 Gold Cup Final against Mexico (43.2) and Semifinal against Jamaica (39.4).

Berhalter makes two lineup changes from Saturday’s match against Colombia, inserting striker Ricardo Pepi for Folarin Balogun and midfielder Yunus Musah for Johnny Cardoso.

Pepi earns his first start of the year and just the second in his last 12 international appearances, while Musah earns his second start of 2024.

Christian Pulisic captains the team for the 23rd time tonight, tying Thomas Dooley for eighth on the USMNT’s all-time captains list. The USA is 16W-3L-3D when Pulisic wears the armband.

Four starters have previous senior international experience against Brazil: Tim Ream (Sept. 8, 2015); Weston McKennie, Antonee Robinson and Tim Weah (Sept. 7, 2018). Substitute Tyler Adams also appeared in the 2018 match in East Rutherford, N.J.

Weah recorded his sixth international goal and 10th career goal contribution for the USA in Saturday’s match against Colombia.

McKennie makes his 50th career start, becoming the 43rd player to start a half century of USMNT matches.

Making his 11th appearance tonight, fullback Joe Scally starts back-to-back games during the same international window for the first time.

With their starts against No. 5-ranked Brazil, Scally, Pepi and Chris Richards will make their first appearances against a top-five team in the FIFA World Rankings.

Goalkeeper Matt Turner made his USMNT debut in Orlando, saving a penalty kick to keep his first clean sheet in the 7-0 win against Trinidad and Tobago on Jan. 31, 2021 at INTER&Co. Stadium.

Pulisic recorded his first career hat trick in Orlando, coming in the 5-1 win against Panama in World Cup qualifying on March 27, 2022.

Though born in Denville, N.J., substitute midfielder Johnny Cardoso grew up in Porto Alegre, Brazil.

The USA is 7-2-0 all-time in Orlando, winning each of its last seven matches in The City Beautiful.

This is the USMNT’s first appearance at Camping World Stadium (formerly the Citrus Bowl), since a 1-0 win against Sweden on Jan. 24, 1998, a match where Gregg Berhalter earned his first start in his third international cap.

Berhalter is 43W-15L-12D in 70 matches as USMNT head coach.

The USMNT is 1W-18L-0D all-time against Brazil, with the team’s only win coming behind Preki Radosavljevic’s goal in a 1-0 victory in the Gold Cup Semifinal on Feb. 10, 1998. The team’s 11-match winless streak against Brazil is currently the longest of any international opponent.

Forward Josh Sargent (foot injury), is not dressed for tonight’s match. Six substitutions are allowed in three different moments. Halftime does not count as a substitution moment.

Tonight’s match will be officiated by Mario Escobar of Guatemala. The USMNT is 3W-1L-2D in six matches refereed by Escobar.

With more than 57,000 tickets sold as of Wednesday morning, tonight’s attendance already ranks as the highest for a U.S. Men’s or Women’s National Team match in Florida, beating the previous high of 52,033 for the USMNT’s 2-1 win against Nigeria on June 7, 2014 in Jacksonville in the team’s send-off match for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
