Ream: We needed a good result going into Copa America

Tim Ream also spoke to TNT after the draw: "We obviously wanted to put right what we did wrong the other night (against Colombia). We knew it was going to take a lot of hard work and intensity and just sticking together. That was the big message, stick together and come with intensity. For the majority of the game I think we did that.

"We obviously had to show a different side, defending a little bit more that we like, but that's a world-class team obviously. And to come away with, building on the first minute and creating a lot of chances ourselves. Overall, I think we can be very happy.

"It's a good result going into tournament play and that's what we needed."

Turner on his performance

More from Turner's discussion with TNT after his 11-save performance: "I don't want to get too far ahead of myself because I know how quickly this game can humble you. But it was a good game, I thought I controlled a lot of different areas of the game really well, in possession, out of possession, it was just good overall. It was nice to bounce back after a tough game.

"We really stared in the face of adversity and were able to bounce back a few days later. In tournament play that's so, so important."

Turner: 'Huge bounce-back performance'

Matt Turner also spoke to TNT sports after the game: "Obviously a huge bounce-back performance for us from the other day, we don't really want to speak about that one anymore. What we did today can put that to bed. The atmosphere was great and had a real intensity, especially down the stretch both teams really wanted to win. That's something that we'll be able to build off of for the real deal.

"There was a lot of talk amongst the players (after the 5-1 loss to Colombia). At the end of the day, tactics doesn't matter, who's out there shouldn't ever matter, it's about representing something bigger than yourself and when you put on this crest there's a certain level of expectation. We need to know, friendly or not, it doesn't matter, you're the USA, you're going to play in Copa America, you're going to play against South American teams that don't like you very much and want to prove a point. So we have to have a certain level of intensity every time we step out onto the pitch that we lacked in the Colombia game but had tonight."

Scally: 'We can make a deep run'

Joe Scally spoke to TNT Sports after the draw: "It was definitely a difficult game. We knew the players they have coming into it. For myself, I gained confidence from last game, I thought I had a good game. Just knowing I'm able to keep up with those guys and always believing in myself. It felt good to be out there, builds confidence for myself and the team.

"We know we have a strong team, we know we can make a deep run (in Copa America). Just to come out here and have a good response after last game, it's very important that we all feel very confident and ready for the tournament."

Match stats

USMNT 1-1 Brazil

Shots: 12 - 25

Expected goals: 0.96 - 1.63
Possession: 39% - 61%
Corners: 0 - 9

Pulisic is ready for Copa America

With his goal direct from a free kick in the 26th minute tonight, Christian Pulisic has now scored against four different CONMEBOL opponents is his USMNT career: Bolivia, Brazil, Chile and Venezuela.

He's the third American to score against four CONMEBOL nations, joining Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan.

The US will be hoping he adds a few more countries to that list in the upcoming Copa America...

Turner channels Keller against Brazil

Getty Images

Matt Turner had a fantastic performance tonight, making 11 saves against Brazil. That's the most by an American goalkeeper since Tim Howard made 15 against Belgium in the 2014 World Cup.

Turner's performance conjures memories of Kasey Keller's against Brazil in 1998, when he made 10 saves to lift the US to their only win against the nation.

Perfect response to Colombia blowout

That is a big response by the USMNT after the disaster against Colombia. A much, much better performance overall, from back to front.

Historic result for USMNT

The US had played Brazil 19 times before tonight, losing 18 of those matches while winning just one.

That means tonight's match is the first ever draw between these two nations, while also just the second time the US have avoided defeat against Brazil.

Late chances for Brazil!

90+6' USMNT 1-1 Brazil

Vinicius Jr runs into two US defenders and wins a free kick. Not sure about that call.

Pereira uses the free kick to curl a shot on goal, but Turner does well to punch it clear.

Brazil have a corner and nearly score from it, but Vinicius Jr gets his contact all wrong on the goal line!

US defense maintaining poise

90+4' USMNT 1-1 Brazil

Martinelli gets to the US byline and fires a cross into the box, but Ream calmly cuts it out and rolls it out to Moore on the wing. Moore bides his time and waits for Martinelli to foul him in an attempt to win the ball back, alleviating the pressure and getting the US closer to the finish line.

FIVE minutes added on

90+1' USMNT 1-1 Brazil

We're into five minutes of stoppage time here. For the two huge chances the US have had to take the lead in the second half, Brazil look the likelier side to grab a late winner at the moment. The US would do well to get out of here with a morale-boosting draw.

Chances at both ends

88' USMNT 1-1 Brazil

Chances all over the field, as Pulisic fires a shot across the face of Brazil's goal that doesn't miss the far post by much, and Turner makes decent saves on Endrick and Vinicius Jr.

Brilliant distribution by Turner

82' USMNT 1-1 Brazil

Turner makes a crucial claim at the back post as Brazil had several players lining up to slam home the cross.

He slings the ball out with a long throw to Balogun, who has acres of space in front of him down the left flank. He has Pulisic making a supporting run but fails to beat his nearest defender.
