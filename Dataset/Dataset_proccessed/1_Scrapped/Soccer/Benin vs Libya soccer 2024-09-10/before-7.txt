Can Benin Find Redemption Against Libya?
Defensive Struggles on Both Sides: Both Benin and Libya have shown defensive fragility in their recent outings. Benin have only kept two clean sheets in their last 11 matches, while Libya have failed to secure a clean sheet in seven consecutive matches. This trend strongly suggests that defences will be breached during the upcoming clash.
Steve Mounie’s Influence: Benin’s attack largely revolves around Steve Mounie, who averages two shots on target per game. Despite Benin’s struggles against Nigeria, Mounie remains a significant threat to Libya’s defence. His aerial ability and finishing make him a player to watch as Benin seek a vital victory.
Libya’s Scoring Consistency: Libya have been able to score in most of their recent matches, netting in six of their last seven games. While their defence has been suspect, their ability to find the back of the net, even when playing away, has kept them competitive in most matches. This scoring consistency will be crucial as they look to avoid defeat against Benin.

Both Teams to Score @ 6/5

Reasoning
Both teams to score is a strong bet, given Benin's attacking threat through Mounie and Libya’s defensive struggles. Libya's scoring capability and Benin’s defensive vulnerabilities suggest goals at both ends.

The upcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier between Benin and Libya promises to be an intriguing encounter as both teams seek their first win of the campaign. Taking place at the Stade Felix Houphouet-Boigny on Tuesday, this match offers both nations an opportunity to right the ship after disappointing starts. Benin come into the match off the back of a humbling 3-0 defeat to Nigeria, and their confidence will be low as they look to regroup. Meanwhile, Libya also failed to secure maximum points in their opening game, drawing 1-1 with Rwanda, and they will be equally hungry to break their winless run. Both teams have yet to find their stride in the competition, which adds even more intrigue to what should be a closely contested match.

Neither side has looked particularly sharp in recent matches, but their respective strengths and weaknesses might set up an exciting game. Benin’s defence was exposed in their defeat to Nigeria, but they will be hoping for a more cohesive display against a less formidable Libyan attack. On the other hand, Libya have been struggling to keep clean sheets and will likely focus on improving their defensive organisation. Both teams are desperate for points in this qualifier, and this urgency should make for an open, attacking game.

One of the most promising bets for this fixture is both teams to find the back of the net. The reasoning behind this prediction is rooted in the weaknesses both sides have shown defensively, as well as their offensive capabilities. Benin, despite their struggles, are capable of creating chances, particularly through players like Steve Mounie and Junior Olaitan, both of whom are dangerous in front of goal. Mounie, in particular, remains their key man, with his two shots on target per game showing his effectiveness, even in difficult matches. Against Libya, who have conceded in each of their last seven games, Mounie and his teammates should have opportunities to get on the scoresheet.

Libya’s recent form also supports the prediction that both teams will score. They have failed to keep a clean sheet in their last seven matches, and even though their defence has been porous, they’ve managed to find the net in nearly all of those encounters. With a creative forward line featuring players like Ahmed Krawaa, they are more than capable of troubling a Benin defence that has been far from solid. Benin’s record of just two clean sheets in their last 11 matches further underlines the likelihood of Libya breaking through at least once.

Furthermore, Benin’s recent form in AFCON qualifiers paints a picture of a team that concedes often but also scores. In their last nine qualifiers, Benin have only kept one clean sheet, but crucially, they have only failed to score once in their last five AFCON matches. This suggests that while their defensive vulnerabilities are evident, their attacking potential remains a significant threat to a shaky Libyan backline.

As Emmanuel Nwankwo from BettingTips4You.com summarises: “With both sides struggling to keep clean sheets, but each possessing enough firepower to score, this match looks set for goals at both ends. Benin’s defensive frailties combined with Libya’s ability to create chances make this a strong bet.” Given the defensive struggles of both teams and their respective attacking talent, backing both teams to score seems the most logical outcome.

When considering a correct score prediction, the analysis of both teams’ current form points towards a closely fought match with Benin just edging it. Libya’s attacking capabilities will likely trouble Benin, but the home side should have enough quality to come away with the win, especially considering Libya’s poor defensive record. Benin’s attack, spearheaded by Steve Mounie, should be able to capitalise on Libya’s leaky defence, while the Mediterranean Knights will likely find a way to breach Benin’s own inconsistent backline.

Benin have managed to score in most of their recent matches and their ability to break down defences, particularly at home, could be the deciding factor. Libya, on the other hand, are unlikely to go down without a fight. They’ve scored in six of their last seven matches and will surely test Benin’s defence. However, the home side’s overall quality, especially in attack, makes a narrow 2-1 victory the most plausible outcome.
