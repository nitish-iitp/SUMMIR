Following their dominant 3-0 win against Benin Republic in the first 2025 Africa Cup of Nations AFCON qualifier, the Super Eagles of Nigeria are set to face Rwanda in their second qualifier. The match will be played at the Amahoro Stadium in Kigali on Tuesday, September 10, 2024, at 2:00 PM Nigerian time.

In their first match, Nigeria’s goals came from Ademola Lookman, who scored in extra time, followed by Victor Osimhen’s second goal, and Lookman again, who completed a brace. Meanwhile, Rwanda drew 1-1 with Libya in their opening qualifier, with Nshuti Innocent scoring the equalizer for Rwanda.

Nigeria and Rwanda have met five times in international football, with Nigeria winning two of those encounters and three matches ending in draws. Rwanda has yet to claim a victory against the Super Eagles.

Editorial

As Nigeria prepares for their second AFCON 2025 qualifier against Rwanda, confidence will be high following their convincing 3-0 victory over Benin Republic. The Super Eagles’ performance was a showcase of their attacking prowess, with Ademola Lookman and Victor Osimhen leading the charge. However, Rwanda, buoyed by their draw against Libya, will be eager to challenge Nigeria on their home turf.

Nigeria’s consistency and ability to seize opportunities will be key in maintaining momentum as they aim for a second win. With Rwanda determined to earn their first victory over Nigeria, the Super Eagles must remain focused and avoid complacency. This match is crucial not only for qualification but also for building the team’s confidence ahead of tougher challenges.

Rwanda, though underdogs, should not be underestimated, especially when playing at home. They have shown resilience and tactical discipline, as evidenced by their performance against Libya. Nigeria, however, will aim to control the game from the start and capitalise on any weaknesses in Rwanda’s defence.

This match is another step in Nigeria’s journey to reclaim their status as African champions. By learning from each game and staying grounded, the Super Eagles have the potential to secure a place in AFCON 2025 with a strong qualifying campaign.
