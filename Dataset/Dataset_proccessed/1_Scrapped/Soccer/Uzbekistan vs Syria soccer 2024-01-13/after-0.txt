With one championship already started and the other one starting today, we take a look at today’s matches in the respective tournaments.

Hosts Ivory Coast will be in action against Guinea-Bissau in the opening match of the AFCON 2023. These two teams are a part of Group A along with Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea.

Jean-Louis Gasset’s team entered the tournament after a 5-1 win over Sierra Leone in the warm-up match. The likes of Jeremy Boga, Franck Kessie, Seko Fofana, Jonathan Bamba and a few other names will lead the charge of the host nation.

Guinea-Bissau, on the other hand, lost 6-2 to Mali in an international friendly. They are the lowest-ranked team in the group and need to play their best football if they want any points from this group.
