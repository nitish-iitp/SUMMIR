Asian Cup 2024: Australia, Uzbekistan are at World Cup level but India can test them, says Sunil Chhetri (PTI Photo)

In Short
Sunil Chhetri admits Australia and Uzbekistan are levels above Indian football team
Sunil Chhetri, who is 39 years old, will be featuring in Asian Cup for the third time
Sunil Chhetri said that India's current squad do not fear facing top teams

Sunil Chhetri, the ageless goal-scoring skipper of the Indian football team, openly admitted that India's group-stage opponents Australia and Uzbekistan, in the upcoming Asian Cup are "a couple of levels" above them. However, Chhetri also highlighted that this will provide the Indian team with an opportunity to test their caliber against these teams at the World Cup-level.

"It's a massive tournament for us, purely because we get to rub shoulders with the best in Asia. Teams like Australia and Uzbekistan are probably of the World Cup level, so you can test yourself against them," Chhetri said about India's Asian Cup preparation.

The 39-year-old featured in the Indian team in the 2011 edition of the Asian Cup, when they suffered a 4-0 defeat to Australia. But, Chhetri suggests that the current team has a much better understanding of top-tier teams, like Australia, as compared to the 2011 Indian team.

"We did not have much knowledge of the Australian team back then. Not when compared to the minute details we have now", Sunil Chhetri added about facing Australia in the Asian Cup.

Chhetri believes that India's last few World Cup qualifiers and international friendlies have given the squad the chance to compete against several top teams. He suggests that these games have kicked out the "fear factor" from within the players.

"With this familiarity, the fear factor goes out. I must admit, of course, that they are extremely good. They're a couple of levels above what we play in the ISL, but at least we know what we're up against." Chhetri further said.

The skipper gave a brief insight into how diligently the Indian team has been preparing for the Asian Cup. Chhetri mentioned that the team has been watching their opponents' game style against other teams and even individual player-wise performances in their respective leagues.

"We've watched their friendlies against Palestine and Bahrain, we know which leagues their players are in, and individual clips on them," said Chhetri.

The Indian skipper's goal-scoring record in international matches is no secret to the football world, and it only gets highlighted further when his tally of four goals in his six matches at the Asian Cup comes into the conversation.

However, Chhetri's 2024 Asian Cup will be different from the ones before as he walks into the tournament as a 39-year-old, which is much beyond the prime-age of a footballer.

The Indian football team were drawn into Group B of the Asian Cup alongside Australia, Uzbekistan and Syria. The Blue Tigers will kick off their 2024 Asian Cup campaign against Australia on January 13, 2024.
