After an underwhelming and unconvincing opening game of CAF Africa Cup of Nations qualification, Chad are now facing up to the champions of the continent beginning the defence of the title, Ivory Coast.

CHAD PREVIEW: A WEAK CHAD SIDE

Under the management of former assistant coach Kevin Nicaise, the Chad national football team are currently world number 178 in the FIFA rankings and are one of the weakest sides in the group stages of AFCON qualification

Their opening game of qualification saw them share a goalless draw against Sierra Leone the other day. That game was played in the neutral venue of Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Complex in Monrovia in Liberia.

IVORY COAST PREVIEW: THE QUALITY OF THE IVORIANS

Earlier this year, the Ivory Coast managed to win the 2023 CAF Africa Cup of Nations despite it appearing their elimination at the group stage was inevitable with Emerse Fae taking over the team mid-way through the tournament.

The Ivorians have started qualification for the 2025 CAF Africa Cup of Nations in convincing and impressive fashion, too, with a comfortable 2-0 defeat of Zambia in which Jean-Philippe Krasso notched a second-half brace.

CHAD TEAM NEWS: NO CHANGES NEEDED

Chad have quite a weak squad so weren’t expected to make too many changes but they were quite solid the other day so there is no real need for them to make too many adjustments.

PREDICTED XI (5-4-1): Allahbatnan; Mbogo, Ngouyamsa, Abderamane, Tchouplau, Osee; Allarabaye, Yeo, Damba, Hiver; Mouandilmadji

UNAVAILABLE:

IVORY COAST TEAM NEWS: NO NEED TO CHANGE

After an impressive performance against Zambia the other day, the Ivorians are expected to name an unchanged side for this one with a fully fit and available squad for this one.

PREDICTED XI (4-3-3): Fofana; ingo, Agbadou, Ndicka, Operi; Diallo, Seri, Kessie; Diakite, Guessand, Adingra

CHAD VS IVORY COAST PREDICTION

Whilst Chad were solid enough against what is an improving Sierra Leone side that will fancy their chances of challenging Zambia for second spot in this group, this is now a major step up against Les Elephants. Their run to glory earlier this year appeared fortunate but the Ivorians have started to improve even more with a few changes to their best eleven made by Fae. A fairly comfortable and convincing Ivory Coast victory would appear a good bet for this one.

CHAD VS IVORY COAST TIP: IVORY COAST TO WIN TO NIL
