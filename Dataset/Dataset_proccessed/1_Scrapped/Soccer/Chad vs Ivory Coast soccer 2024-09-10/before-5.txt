Can Chad Defy the Odds Against In-Form Ivory Coast?
Ivory Coast’s Dominance in Possession
Ivory Coast dominated their opening match against Zambia with 69% possession, significantly higher than Chad’s 36% against Sierra Leone. This disparity indicates that the Elephants are likely to control the tempo of the game, forcing Chad to defend deep for long stretches.
Chad’s Struggles in Front of Goal
Chad managed only 1 shot on target in their last match, despite firing off 19 shots in total. This inefficiency in attack will be a major concern against an Ivorian defence that kept a clean sheet in their 2-0 win over Zambia. Chad’s lack of clinical finishing may once again let them down.
Ivory Coast’s High-Volume Attack
Ivory Coast produced 22 shots in their last outing, 7 of which were on target. With players like Jean-Philippe Krasso and Simon Adingra in top form, they are likely to trouble Chad’s defence throughout the game. Their 12 corners per game also demonstrate their ability to create pressure through set pieces.
Best Bet


Ivory Coast -1 to Win @ 3/5

Reasoning
Ivory Coast -1 on the handicap is a strong bet, given their dominant attack, Chad’s defensive struggles, and the significant gulf in quality. Ivory Coast’s possession control and Chad’s limited threat support this prediction.
Odds subject to change



	

As the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers roll into their second matchday, Chad will be looking to secure their first victory in Group G as they face off against the reigning champions Ivory Coast at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium. The Elephants come into this fixture in fine form, unbeaten in their last nine matches across all competitions and eager to continue their winning streak. Chad, on the other hand, will aim to build on their goalless draw against Sierra Leone in their opening fixture, though they face a steep challenge against a formidable Ivorian side.

Chad’s first match in this qualification campaign saw them hold firm against Sierra Leone in a game that lacked cutting-edge finishing from either side. However, their resilient defensive display was a marked improvement from their poor run in the recent World Cup qualifiers, where they finished bottom of their group. Despite these struggles, Chad are unbeaten in their last three AFCON qualifiers, including a noteworthy aggregate win over Mauritania earlier this year.

Ivory Coast, conversely, began their campaign with a convincing 2-0 victory over Zambia. After a goalless first half, Paris FC’s Jean-Philippe Krasso scored twice in quick succession, cementing his role as one of the most dangerous forwards in the competition. With the Elephants currently riding high on a wave of momentum, they will aim to further solidify their place at the top of the group by dismantling a Chad side that has struggled for consistency.

The best bet for this match is Ivory Coast -1 on the handicap. Given the current form of both teams and the considerable gap in quality, backing the Elephants to win by at least two goals offers a solid opportunity. Ivory Coast are coming off the back of a confident 2-0 victory over Zambia, where they dominated possession and showed their clinical edge through the in-form Jean-Philippe Krasso. Meanwhile, Chad’s inability to score in their opener against Sierra Leone, despite creating a number of chances, highlights their struggles in the final third.

The rationale for taking the -1 handicap lies in Ivory Coast’s potent attack and Chad’s fragility against top-tier teams. With Ivory Coast averaging 22 shots per game and regularly getting into dangerous positions, they will likely overwhelm Chad’s defence, which has conceded heavily in their past fixtures against stronger opposition. Furthermore, Ivory Coast have not conceded in their last two matches and have kept a solid defensive structure, which reduces the risk of Chad grabbing a surprise goal.

Chad, who managed just 36% possession in their draw with Sierra Leone, will once again find themselves chasing the ball against an Ivory Coast team that excels at controlling the tempo. The Elephants, averaging 69% possession, will force Chad deep into their half, making it difficult for the hosts to launch any meaningful counter-attacks. With this in mind, a two-goal margin seems achievable for Ivory Coast, making the -1 handicap a strong betting option.

As BettingTips4You.com expert Emmanuel Nwankwo notes: “Given Ivory Coast’s dominance in possession and Chad’s lack of attacking threat, a two-goal margin is well within reach for the reigning champions.”

Correct Score Prediction: Chad 0-2 Ivory Coast

Based on both teams’ recent performances and statistical trends, a 2-0 win for Ivory Coast appears to be the most likely outcome. While Chad have shown defensive resilience, particularly in their draw with Sierra Leone, they remain vulnerable to teams with superior technical and tactical quality. Ivory Coast, with their array of attacking options, including Jean-Philippe Krasso and Simon Adingra, should have enough to break down Chad’s defensive line, but Chad’s recent defensive form suggests they may avoid a heavier defeat.

The 2-0 scoreline reflects Ivory Coast’s controlled but efficient style of play. In their opening match against Zambia, the Elephants dominated possession but were patient in creating clear-cut chances, only finding the net after the break. This approach is likely to be mirrored against Chad, who will sit deep and attempt to frustrate their more accomplished opponents. With Chad averaging just 9 clearances per game and conceding very little in terms of big chances, Ivory Coast may need time to find their rhythm in the final third.

Though Chad have conceded only 1 goal in their last three AFCON qualifiers, their overall defensive fragility remains a concern, especially against a side as potent as Ivory Coast. The Elephants are unlikely to let the hosts off lightly, but Chad’s recent defensive improvements suggest they can avoid an embarrassing scoreline.
