UEFA Euro 2024: Group E Focus
11 June 2024Jon The Blogcentric

Before I dive into reviewing the Group E teams, I’ll say it’s interesting when UEFA did its Euro draw, it did the draw before the three playoff berths had their teams decided. This is not the first major tournament to do so. Both the men’s World Cup of 2022 and the women’s World Cup of 2023 also had draws before playoff teams were decided. This must be a new thing to do draws before playoff teams are decided. One of the three playoff teams will be here in Group E.

So here is my look at Group E. Interesting note is that Ukraine shares its border with two other nations in this group:

-Belgium (3): For a long time, the world has been dazzled by the Red Devils. Starting back in 2014, Belgium went through their greatest era ever showing teamwork like never before and leading the nation to a third-place finish at the 2018 World Cup. Unfortunately, they choked in the Group Stage at the 2022 World Cup. Soon after, Eden Hazard, Toby Alderweireld and Dries Mertens retired from the national team and Roberto Martinez was sacked as coach.

Belgium’s success comes in waves. There’s a period when they’re one of the best and there’s a period where they slump. Their new coach Domenico Tedesco will assure the team isn’t heading into the slump phase. Despite a lot of retirees since Qatar 2022, veterans like Romelu Lukaku, Kevin DeBruyne, Axel Witsel and Jan Vertonghen will be in Germany. Since their World Cup disappointment, they have not yet lost a game. They’ve had wins to Estonia, Azerbaijan and Germany. They’ve had a win and a draw to both Sweden and Austria as well as draws to England and the Republic of Ireland. Euro 2024 is the opportunity for Belgium to redeem itself and possibly even chase their first-ever Euro win.

-Slovakia (48): It’s tempting to call the Sokoli an underdog team. Slovakia have only been to one World Cup back in 2010. This is their third consecutive Euro. Surely, they want to do better than their best-ever Round of 16 finish from back in 2016. It won’t be easy ever since their B status in the UEFA Nations League fell to a C.

The team is coached by Italian Francesco Calzona. The irony being Italy was the defending World Cup champions in 2010 but Slovakia ended all chances of Italy qualifying for the Round Of 16 with a 3-2 win! The team has stars like defender Peter Pekarik, and midfielders Juraj Kucka and Ondrej Duda. Play in the last year and a half has been off and on. They’ve had wins over Iceland, Wales and Bosnia-Hercegovina. They’ve had a win and a draw to Luxembourg, a draw to Norway and lost to Portugal. Germany is the opportunity for Slovakia to show Europe what they’re made of and possible deliver a surprise or two.

-Romania (46): It’s been a lot of difficulty for the Tricolorii to establish themselves in world football. Right after Communism was overthrown in Romania, their football came alive with three World Cup appearances in the 1990’s and even progressing past the Group Stage for the first time. Now it’s a struggle. Their last World Cup qualification was for 1998. Their last win of a Euro game was in 2000 despite participating in 2008 and 2016. Romani is hoping to get their reputation back after moving up to the B status in the Nations League.

Since 2022, the team has been coached by Edward Iordanescu. Their top players include midfielders Nicolae Stanciu, Razvan Marin and forward George Puscas. They’ve had a win and a draw against Belarus, Switzerland and Israel. They’ve also had draws to Bulgaria, Liechtenstein and Northern Ireland and a loss to Colombia. Germany is the stage to show the world what the current Romanian team is made of.

-Ukraine (22): A war can sometimes hurt a nation greatly, or a war can inspire a pride in a nation like no other. The Blue and Yellow is one team that knows how to play strong even as their country is going through a devastating war. The war caused a delay in playoff games for the qualification for the 2022 World Cup. It was postponed until June of that year, but Ukraine won over Scotland and then lost to Wales in the last match needed.

The Ukrainian team is managed by Serhiy Rebrov who played in Ukraine’s first and only appearance at the World Cup in 2006. Top players include defender Mykola Matviyenko and midfielders Taras Stepanenko and Andriy Yarmolenko and forward Roman Yaremchuk. In the last year and a half, Ukraine has delivered wins against Iceland, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Moldova and North Macedonia. They’ve drawn against Germany, had a draw and a loss against both Italy and England, and lost to Poland. You can bet Ukraine is ready to play hard and do better than their quarterfinal finish from the last Euro.

My Predictions: For this group’s qualifiers, I predict they will be Belgium and Ukraine. Slovakia will have enough points for third but not enough to get a wildcard qualification.

EURO 2024 MASCOT: ALBART

Euro 2024’s mascot is a teddy bear named “Albärt” whose name was voted on by the general public.

World Cup 1974 mascots Tik and Tak are tacky by today’s standards. World Cup 2006 mascot Goleo was confusing because a lion is more associated with The Netherlands or England instead of Germany. For Euro 2024, the mascot is an anthropomorphic teddy bear with a full football uniform named “Albärt.” He was introduced at the Germany vs. Colombia game in June 2023 but was unnamed at first. After his introduction, a public poll was released to choose his name. Choices included “Albärt”, “Bärnardo”, “Bärnheart” and “Herzi von Bär”. The winning name was revealed on July 5, 2023 with “Albärt” receiving 32% of the votes.

And there you go. That’s my look at Euro 2024 Group E and a look at the Euro 2024 mascot. That means only one group left to review! It is catching up fast!
