Lithuania and Romania face-off on Tuesday in UEFA Nations League action.

Darius and Girenas Stadium is set to host the exciting mid-week matchup between home side Lithuania and visiting nation Romania on Tuesday in UEFA Nations League action. The tournament has got off to a thrilling start so far in the first couple matchdays of the 2024 edition. In League A, reigning champion Spain was unable to break the deadlock against a formidable Serbian national team. The Spanish side did dominate in terms of ball possession (74 percent) as has been the case for years now, but couldn’t convert its 21 shots and five on target into any goals.

Spain then bounced back on matchday two to take a dominant 4-1 victory. Joselu, Ferran Torres, Fabián Ruíz and Robin Le Normand all got on the scoresheet to get la Furia Roja into the win column.

Meanwhile, last year’s runner-up France also got off on the wrong foot on matchday one, losing to fellow powerhouse Italy 3-1. Bradley Barcola scored the French team’s lone goal, while Federico Dimarco, Davide Frattesi and Giacomo Raspadori got the Italians on the board.

Portugal looks like an early favorite after winning both of its matches in September. The first was a 2-1 finish over Croatia, where Diogo Dalot and Cristiano Ronaldo secured all three points with their strikes.

The Portuguese found another 2-1 victory on matchday two over Scotland, thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes and Ronaldo again.

The action continues on Tuesday when Lithuania and Romania face-off at Darius and Girenas Stadium to continue matchday four of the competition.

Regional restrictions may apply.
