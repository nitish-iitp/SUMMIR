Amery Middle School is being recognized nationally. The middle school was one of 356 schools in the nation awarded the Blue Ribbon Award, given to schools with high overall academic achievement. In Wisconsin, Amery is just one of eight schools chosen for the prestigious award and one of 50 middle schools nationwide.

“The Department of Education names Blue Ribbon Schools, and it's the highest award a school can get,” said Tom Bensen, Amery Middle School Principal. “It was pretty exciting to have been nominated for one. So basically, there are specific requirements that you have to meet to be nominated, and that's to be a top academic performing school. And then also have narrow learning gaps.”

Amery was nominated for the award because of its progress in significantly narrowing the learning gaps between different groups of students. In education, typically, students with special needs or struggling economically will have a gap from the general student population. As those students get older, the gap widens. But not at the Amery School District. They have done the opposite by closing those gaps and helping to foster a growth mindset.

Each year, schools across the state get a report card from the Department of Public Instruction. The ratings are based on academic performance, student growth, and student growth for the bottom 25% of kids. They also take into consideration other factors like attendance and scores. Based on that information, the state has scores for each school’s progress. From the DPI report card, Amery Middle School was ninth overall; it had the fifth-highest and highest math growth in Wisconsin.  A couple of years ago, Amery also had the highest level of English proficiency. 

Year after year, the district has proven to be one of the best in the state, and the state has nominated it for the Blue Ribbon Award. 

“I know that our system is working pretty well, and our kids are responding to what we do,” said Bensen, “And so I think over time, we've been a school that's significantly exceeded expectations after the state requirements year after year. Eventually, the state took notice and nominated us for the award. And then we got a notice from the United States Department of Education that we've been nominated.”

Although the middle school is being recognized, it is a district-wide award. By the time the students reach middle school, they will have been through elementary and intermediate schools, setting a good foundation for their education. And that only continues when they reach the high school level. 

Tom Bensen and Kate Weisenbeck were the two who submitted the over 20-page application for the district to be recognized for the award. The two will head to the nation’s capital in November to accept the award. The night will be an excellent opportunity for them to network with other top-performing schools nationwide to see what has worked well for them and share ideas. Besides the award, the two will be given a flag to fly and displayed at the Amery School District to show off the prestigious honor. 

“Middle school's a tough age to begin with. And they're going through all kinds of changes and growth,” said Bensen, “It's a very tough time for most kids. And to see that our kids are achieving really good success compared to the other schools around us and the schools in the country now, to see that our kids are some of the top performers, is a really good thing. So we know that they're really responding well to what we're doing here.”
