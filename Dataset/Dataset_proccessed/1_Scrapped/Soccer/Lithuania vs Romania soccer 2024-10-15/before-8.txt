Continuing their pursuit of promotion in the UEFA Nations League, Kosovo and Cyprus meet at Pristina City Stadium on Tuesday evening.

Separated by three points in the League C Group 2 standings, the hosts sit second after winning at the weekend, while their visitors trail behind following a heavy home defeat.

Kosovo left Kaunas with maximum points on Saturday, beating Lithuania 2-1 to post back-to-back wins in Group 2, with Lille winger Edon Zhegrova and Ermal Krasniqi of Sparta Prague scoring either side of half time.

The hosts reduced their advantage in the 84th minute, following a glaring error by goalkeeper Amir Saipi, who then redeemed himself by making a crucial late save.

As a result, Kosovo still occupy second place in the table, three points behind leaders Romania, leaving them on course for a promotion playoff when the group stage concludes next month.

Head coach Franco Foda has now posted three wins from six since his arrival in February, and with home games against the group's bottom two still to come, the Dardanians will be confident they can climb up into League B.

Ranked 104th in the world by FIFA, Kosovo were well beaten in their opening fixture - a 3-0 defeat to Romania - but then ended a three-game losing streak by winning 4-0 in Cyprus last month; now they seek a repeat result on home turf.

Following on from that dismal defeat in September - their third straight Nations League loss to Kosovo within the space of three years - Cyprus failed to bounce back when returning to action at the weekend.

Three goals down before half time against Romania, they were ultimately beaten 3-0 by the Euro 2024 finalists in Larnaca, meaning they have now lost each of their last six competitive home matches by an aggregate score of 19-1.

At the halfway stage of their latest Nations League campaign, the nation sitting 123rd in FIFA's latest world rankings are third in Group 2 and still in some danger of relegation.

Lithuania are yet to pick up a point, though, meaning Sofronis Avgousti's side have a buffer between themselves and last place; and with second spot earning entry to the playoffs, promotion is not entirely beyond them.

However, Cyprus have conceded 11 goals in three meetings with Kosovo to date, and current form suggests they could struggle to keep a clean sheet in Pristina.

Kosovo will again be without all-time top goalscorer Vedat Muriqi on Tuesday, as the Mallorca striker - who took his international tally up to 28 by bagging a brace in last month's meeting with Cyprus - is still sidelined by a muscular injury.

In the absence of their attacking talisman, the hosts' attack should be led by Albion Rrahmani, most likely supported by Milot Rashica and Edon Zhegrova.

As Elvis Rexhbecaj must serve a suspension, Muharrem Jashari may come into central midfield, while Ipswich Town goalkeeper Arijanet Muric will hope to regain his place between the posts.

Meanwhile, Cyprus might make changes at the back, having conceded seven goals in their last two games - but their main man up front should remain the same.

AIK striker Ioannis Pittas is averaging over a goal every other game in this year's Allsvenskan, and he is expected to lead the line again, linking up with Hellas Verona forward Grigoris Kastanos.


Kosovo possible starting lineup:
Muric; Vojvoda, Am. Rrahmani, Aliti, Rrudhani; Jashari, V. Berisha; Zhegrova, Muslija, Rashica; Al. Rrahmani

Cyprus possible starting lineup:
Mall; Karo, Gogic, Laifis, Ioannou; Kousoulos, Charalampous; Loizou, Kastanos, Tzionis; Pittas



We say: Kosovo 2-0 Cyprus

Not only do Cyprus have a terrible record against their Kosovan counterparts, but they are also on a clear downward spiral.

Even in their star striker's absence, the hosts have momentum on their side and should beat opponents who routinely struggle to keep the back door shut.
