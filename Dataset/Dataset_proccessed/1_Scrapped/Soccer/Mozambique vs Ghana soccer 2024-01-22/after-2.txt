Another Africa Cup of Nations shock! Ghana effectively crash out of tournament after throwing away two-goal lead in stoppage time following incredible capitulation against Mozambique

Ghana were effectively knocked out of AFCON 2023 after they squandered a two-goal lead in stoppage time against Mozambique on Monday.

TELL ME MORE

It took Ghana star Jordan Ayew just 15 minutes to break the deadlock from the penalty spot after Mozambique full-back Infren Nanani brought down Joseph Paintsil inside the box. Despite an early opening goal from the Black Stars the first half was an evenly contested encounter.

The Mambas started the second half in the ascendancy as they looked desperate for an equaliser. They came close to restoring parity in the game within five minutes from kick-off, as Bruno Langa attempted a shot from inside the box. However, Ghana goalkeeper Richard Ofori did well to deny him from scoring.

Disaster struck in the 67th minute when Mohammed Kudus' goal-bound shot hit Reinildo Mandava's outstretched hand inside the box, resulting in a second penalty for the Black Stars. The Crystal Palace attacker once again took the spot-kick and doubled his team's lead.

With mere minutes remaining and with Ghana seemingly having sealed all three points, Andre Ayew accidentally handled the ball inside the box to give Mozambique an opening. From the resulting penalty, Geny Catamo pulled one back in the 91st minute.

Then, three minutes later, Reinildo made amends for his earlier mistake as he headed Shaquille Momad Nangy's corner into the goal to complete a dramatic capitulation for Chris Hughton's side. They effectively exit the tournament with two points from three games and minus one goal difference, but await the fate of other third-placed sides to have that confirmed.

THE MVP

Crystal Palace star Jordan Ayew showed great composure when taking the spot-kicks as his brace almost booked a knockout berth for his side - and deserved to do so. Ironically, it was his older brother Andre who helped Mozambique stage a come back after he accidentally handled the ball inside the penalty box in the injury time, giving them a way back into the matchup.

THE BIG LOSER

Ghana goalkeeper Richard Ofori committed the terrible mistake of conceding a late corner which resulted in the equalising goal. Under no pressure and with the ball harmlessly bouncing out for a goal kick from Mandava's shot, he tried to parry but instead fumbled the ball on for the fateful corner. Granted, Ghana's defending of the set piece which saw Mozambique equalise was less than satisfactory, but it could have been avoided altogether were it not for Ofori's attempted intervention.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Despite a spirited performance on Monday, Mozambique's AFCON journey effectively came to an end as they bowed out of the competition finishing last in their group. Ghana, on the other hand, finished third in their group and are staring at an early exit from the tournament, barring a minor miracle from other groups.
