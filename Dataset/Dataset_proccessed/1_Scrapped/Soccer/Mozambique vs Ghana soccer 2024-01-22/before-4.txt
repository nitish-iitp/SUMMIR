(Jan. 22, 2024) Missing multiple key contributors, the boys basketball team still found a way to pull out a 74-68 win Saturday at home against New Heights Charter School of Brockton, thanks to the Whalers’ bench and a dominant performance from Jack Halik.

Nantucket was without senior captain Jayquan Francis for the game, and fellow senior captain Carlos Aguilar went down with an injury in the first half. The Whalers’ other senior captain Halik picked up the scoring load, finishing with a team-high 27 points.
