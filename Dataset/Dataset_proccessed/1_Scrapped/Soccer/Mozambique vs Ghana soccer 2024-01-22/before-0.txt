AFCON 2023: Cape Verde Qualification and Ghana’s Chances of progress

The Black Stars of Ghana’s qualification to the Round of 16 hinges on a lot of factors that could either go their way in their group or in other groups.

Cape Verde, who are in Ghana’s group, secured qualification to the knockout rounds after beating Mozambique 3-0 at the Stade Felix Houphouet-Boigny in Abidjan.

The Blue Sharks of Cape Verde, in fact, would progress as group winners, with Ghana and Egypt, as well as Mozambique, fighting for the second automatic qualification spot.

For the Black Stars of Ghana, a win against Mozambique on Monday would brighten their qualification chances, either as the second-placed team or as one of the four best-ranked third-placed teams.

Yes, four teams with better point accumulation and goal difference who finished third in their respective groups would be selected to join the first two teams of every group to make the round of 16.

So, the Black Stars chances of qualifying for the next round look bright with a win against Mozambique, and an Egypt draw or loss could even lead to a second-place finish.

A draw for the Black Stars against Mozambique would see them finish third, and it wouldn’t be a good result but could still progress considering the outcomes of other group games.

The highly anticipated clash between Ghana and Mozambique would be played at the Olympic Stadium of Ebimpe in Abidjan on Monday, January 22, 2024.

http://www.ghananewsagency.org/
The Ghana news Agency (GNA) was established on March 5, 1957, i.e. on the eve of Ghana's independence and charged with the "dissemination of truthful unbiased news". It was the first news agency to be established in Sub-Saharan Africa. GNA was part of a comprehensive communication policy that sought to harness the information arm of the state to build a viable, united and cohesive nation-state. GNA has therefore been operating in the unique role of mobilizing the citizens for nation building, economic and social development, national unity and integration.
