THE FAVORITE TO WIN THE TITLE

Senegal, long the butt of jokes in Africa due to a lack of titles, has silenced the laughter in the last two years. After losing a final in 2019, their team was crowned champions of the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) in Cameroon, in addition to winning the African Nations Championship, the U17 CAN, the U20 CAN and the beach soccer CAN. Backed by the best generation in its history and talented youngsters, Senegal is at the top of African soccer and is aiming to retain its title. This outstanding performance has so far only been achieved by Egypt, Ghana and Cameroon.

Watch out for this Ghana player:

The player to watch for this match will be Jordan Ayew, the left winger is fundamental in his team's starting eleven, likewise, his great experience and skill together have allowed him to become a latent danger every time he takes the ball as he can dribble past defenders and get off a cross shot that ends up inside the net. ¡Amazing!

Must win

On the other hand, Ghana also comes to this game of the African Cup of Nations with the illusion of making a great performance and looking to fight for the three points to reach the playoffs where they can fight for the Cup. The Ghanaian team has historically given very good performances in this competition and the history of duels marks that the balance is tipped in favor of Ghana in this match, also, this national team stands out for having a great game that is based on retaining possession of the ball and achieve the generation of spaces to break the rival's nets, so they will surely be waiting for the pressure of Mozambique and at the first opportunity to break the defensive lines of the rival with a filtered pass.

Three points must be earned

Mozambique's national team will be looking for three points against Ghana, a team that arrives as the favorite to win this match, however, Mozambique will want to prove otherwise and give a blow on the table based on a good collective and individual soccer. Likewise, this team is characterized for having a great aerial game so they could use that in their favor and be able to get the three points against Ghana, which does not stand out for being one of the teams with good marking for the aerial game.
