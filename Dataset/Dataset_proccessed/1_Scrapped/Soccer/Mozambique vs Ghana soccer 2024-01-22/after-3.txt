Mozambique vs Ghana LIVE!

Mozambique scored two goals in the stoppage time to hold Ghana to a 2-2 draw in their Group B clash at the Africa Cup of Nations on Monday, a result that likely spells the end of the tournament for the much-fancied west Africans.

Two penalties from Jordan Ayew had Ghana comfortably ahead and looking well placed to finish second in the group behind Cape Verde, but a late rally handed Mozambique a share of the spoils. It was not enough for Mozambique, who finished bottom of the group, but only behind Ghana on goal-difference.

Two points from three matches is not likely to be enough for Ghana to qualify for the AFCON knockout rounds as one of four best third-placed finishers.

History repeats itself as Black Stars stunned by AFCON minnows

Thanks for joining in us tonight's AFCON blog.

History repeated itself as Ghana's exit from the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations was virtually sealed by a late 2-2 draw with Mozambique in Abidjan.

Jordan Ayew struck twice from the penalty spot to temporarily push the Black Stars above Egypt in Group B, who had fallen behind to Cape Verde in the other Group B game.

However, just as they did against Comoros two years ago, Ghana let the minnows back in and conceded stoppage-time goals to Geny Catamo's penalty and Reinildo Mandava's header which combined with Egypt's comeback win to surely send them home.

Recap the action with our match report!

How Ghana can qualify for AFCON last-16

Looking at the schedule for the third-placed teams, it is so nearly official.

Ghana will be out of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations unless three results go their way.

Cameroon MUST draw with Gambia then Morocco MUST beat Zambia by a certain scoreline and DR Congo MUST beat Tanzania.
