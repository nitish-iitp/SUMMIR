TO FIGHT FOR REGIONAL GLORY—Junior Flames
SHARE

By Mabvuto Kambuwe & Ronald Mpaso:

Junior Malawi national football teams have been handed tricky draws for the 2025 TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) Cosafa qualifiers.

The draw for the two tournaments took place in Maputo, Mozambique, yesterday.

Malawi’s Under-20 side has been drawn in Group C against South Africa, Comoros and Lesotho in the Afcon/Cosafa qualifiers slated for September 26 to October 6 in the Mozambican capital.

The junior Flames are expected to start preparations for the qualifiers on Sunday under the tutelage of Bob Mpinganjira.

The Mighty Mukuru Wanderers Assistant Coach helped the team to win the Four Nations Tournament at Silver Stadium in Lilongwe in March this year with victories over Zimbabwe and Kenya.

Football Association of Malawi (Fam) Technical Director Benjamin Kumwenda described the draw as tough.

“We are in a tough group but with good preparations, we can do well,” Kumwenda said.

Group A comprises hosts Mozambique, eSwatini, Zimbabwe and Botswana whereas Group B has holders Zambia, Angola, Namibia and Madagascar.

Overall winners of each group will advance to the semi-finals of the competition and will be joined by the best runners-up.

Meanwhile, the Malawi’s under-17 team has been drawn in Group A alongside hosts Mozambique, Lesotho and Angola.

The tournament is scheduled for December 5 to 15 in Maputo.

Council for Southern African Football Associations (Cosafa) also conducted a draw for the under-17 women’s championship which saw Malawi being drawn in Group B alongside holders South Africa, Namibia and Madagascar.

Cosafa Head of Competitions Timothy Shongwe expressed gratitude to Mozambique for accepting to host the three tournaments.

“We are very grateful for your hosting of our events. We are currently working very well with the Mozambican Football Federation in terms of putting together the U-20 and two U-17 competitions.

“I would like to pay tribute to the MFF for having afforded us this opportunity. These competitions are very important to our youths. We must expose them to international football before the senior team level to make their development path smoother,” Cosafa’s website quotes Shongwe as saying.

MFF President Feizal Sidat thanked Cosafa for giving Mozambique the opportunity to host the competitions.

“This moment is a symbol of the trust placed in us. By selecting Mozambique as host of these prestigious tournaments, Cosafa has shown deep confidence in our country, our federation, our government and our organising capabilities. For this season, I must thank Cosafa for this opportunity they have given our country. This goes beyond sport.

“It is a message of unity, cooperation and development for our youths, who are fundamental for building our football into the future. By hosting these tournaments, we show our commitment to growing football in our region. We are fully open to future opportunities to host more events and eager to support Cosafa in any way necessary,” Sidat told cosafa.com.
