The Central African Republic and Chad will battle for three points in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier on Wednesday. The hosts will be looking to build on the 4-0 victory they registered against Papua New Guinea in an international friendly during the last international window in March.

Christian-Theodor Yawanendji-Malipangou broke the deadlock in the 11th minute, while Tieri Godame added a hat-trick to inspire the rout.

Chad, meanwhile, came from behind to claim maximum points with a 2-1 away victory over Mauritius in the second leg of their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations preliminary qualification round. They went behind to Jeremy Villeneuve's 45th-minute strike. However, second-half goals from Charles Tchouplaou and Ousmane Hissein Hassan completed the comeback to help his nation advance with a 3-1 aggregate victory.
