Nicaragua are unbeaten in the fixture for over 11 years

Belize host Nicaragua at the FFB Field in Belmopan on Saturday for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. The sides have been drawn alongside Panama, Guyana and Montserrat in Group D.

Ranked 182nd in the world, Belize are looking to create history by reaching their first-ever World Cup tournament, but the road to qualification won't be easy. Their form has been patchy since last year, winning only thrice in nine games.

However, it includes a 3-0 win over Puerto Rico in March this year, their last official outing before this. Michael Salazar, Warren Moss and Felix Martinez all struck apiece for the Jaguars, who will be looking to build on this win and get their qualifying campaign off to a bright start.

Nicaragua, though, crushed Montserrat 4-1 in their first qualifer. Jaime Moreno's early opener was canceled out by Brandon Barzey, but Junior Arteaga, Jacob Montes and Harold Medina scored apiece later on to give their side a decisive victory.

Given their goal difference of +3, the Blue and Whites sit atop their group after the first round and will be buoyed by their performance on Wednesday. For the record, it was also their first win in five games.

Belize vs Nicaragua Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
There have been 13 clashes between the sides in history and the spoils are closely shared with five wins for Nicaragua and four for their rivals.
The Jaguar's last win over Nicaragua came in January 2013, a 2-1 victory in the Copa Centroamericana.
Nicaragua have won three of their last four games in the fixture.
Nicaragua's 4-1 win over Montserrat ended a run of four games without a win.
The Jaguars are unbeaten in both their games so far in 2024: a 1-1 draw and a 3-0 win over Puerto Rico in back-to-back friendlies in March.
Nicaragua are ranked 135th in the world, while their rivals are 47 places below them.
Belize vs Nicaragua Prediction

Nicaragua began their campaign on a stunning note and will enter the tie high on confidence. Keen to make it two wins from two, the Pinoleros could come flying out of the blocks, pushing their hosts on the back foot. The Jaguars won't go down easily, but may go down, nonetheless.

Prediction: Belize 1-2 Nicaragua
