AFRICA CUP OF NATIONS 2024
Africa Cup of Nations 2024

Twenty-four teams are competing for the continent's biggest prize in football at the 34th edition of the Africa Cup of Nations in Ivory Coast. Will Sadio Mané's Senegal defend their crown? All eyes will be on Morocco after their World Cup 2022 heroics, while the Ivory Coast are dreaming of winning a third title on home turf. The Egyptian king Mohamed Salah is still hungry for silverware with his country and nobody should rule out 2019 champions Algeria. Follow all the action on our daily show. Selina Sykes, Jean-Emile Jammine and Leo McGuinn from our sports desk are joined in the studio by Ruben Slagter and Thando Sibiya, while James Vasina will be following all the action in Ivory Coast. Tune in every matchday at 11:10pm Paris time.
