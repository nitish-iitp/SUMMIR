Liberia and Algeria lock horns in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers on Tuesday

Liberia and Algeria return to action in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers when they face off at the Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Complex on Tuesday. This will be the first meeting between the two sides since June 2021, when the Greens picked up an emphatic 5-1 victory in a friendly.

Liberia turned in a resilient team display on Friday when they fought back from behind to snatch a 1-1 draw against Togo in their group opener at the Stade de Kegue.

Kevin Denkey put Togo in front with a 78th-minute strike but teenage striker Williams Gibson netted in the second minute of stoppage time to hand the Lone Stars a share of the spoils.

Liberia have now gone five consecutive games without defeat across all competitions, a run which has seen them rise to third place in Group H of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

Meanwhile, Algeria turned in a solid team display in Thursday’s group curtain-raiser as they picked up a 2-0 win over Equatorial Guinea.

Following a goalless first half at the Miloud Hadefi Stadium, Houssem Aouar and Amine Gouri scored second-half goals to hand the Greens a deserved victory.

Algeria, who are 46th in the latest FIFA World Rankings, will be looking to secure a third competitive win on the bounce for the first time since June 2023.
