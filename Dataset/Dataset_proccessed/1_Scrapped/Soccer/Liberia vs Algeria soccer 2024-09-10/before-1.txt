It was a reasonable start to the group stage campaign for Liberia as they managed to share a 1-1 draw with Togo in their opening qualifier, whilst Algeria comfortably defeated Equatorial Guinea by two goals to nil.

LIBERIA PREVIEW: STEADY START

In their opening match of 2025 CAF Africa Cup of Nations group stage qualification, Liberia were held to a 1-1 draw against an evenly matched Togolese side at Stade de Kegue in the Togolese capital of Lome.

In that game, Togo, with an exciting front two that consists of Ihlas Bebou and Kevin Denkey, took a 78th minute lead via the latter forward before the Liberians then managed to equalise in second-half stoppage-time.

ALGERIA PREVIEW: PETKOVIC’S ALGERIANS

Under the management of former Switzerland boss Vladimir Petkovic, Algeria began their campaign with a comfortable and impressive defeat of Equatorial Guinea at Miloud Hadefi Stadium in Oran the other day.

The Algerians opened the scoring in that game in the 69th minute via former Olympique Lyonnais midfielder Houssem Aouar before a late strike from Amine Gouiri deep into second-half stoppage-time.

LIBERIA TEAM NEWS: LIKELY TO BE UNCHANGED

After a solid performance and result against Togo the other day and with no injuries or suspension concerns, there are not expected to be any changes for Liberia.

PREDICTED XI (3-4-1-2): Koulibaly; Swen, Kamara, Dweh; Freeman, Kenneh, Sangare, Teclar; Dorley; Sackor, Wilson

UNAVAILABLE:

QUESTIONABLE:

ALGERIA TEAM NEWS: AMOURA A DOUBT

After an impressive performance the other day, Algeria are expected to be unchanged for this one but forward Mohamed Amoura is an injury concern for the north Africans.

PREDICTED XI (4-2-3-1): Mandrea; Mandi, Tougai, Bensebaini, Hadjam; Bennacer, Zerrouki; Mahrez, Aouar, Benrahma; Bounedjah

UNAVAILABLE:

QUESTIONABLE: Amoura (Injured)

LIBERIA VS ALGERIA PREDICTION

Liberia showed themselves to be quite difficult to play against the other day as well as extremely resilient with a second-half stoppage-time equaliser. This time around, though, they are now facing a very strong Algerian side that are one of the favourites to go on and win the whole tournament next year. It would seem a fair and reasonable bet to suggest a comfortable Algerian victory for this one.

LIBERIA VS ALGERIA TIP: ALGERIA TO WIN -1 HANDICAP
