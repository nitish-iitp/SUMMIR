 Jamaica Edges Dominica 3-2 in Tense World Cup Qualifier

The Dominica Men’s Senior National Team nearly achieved a remarkable comeback in their World Cup Qualifying match against Jamaica at Windsor Park Sports Stadium on Sunday. Despite trailing by three goals, the team fought back but ultimately fell short, losing 3-2.

In their previous match, Dominica suffered a heavy 6-0 defeat to Guatemala. However, they appeared revitalized in front of their home fans and took an early initiative against Jamaica. Coach Ellington Sabin made one change to the starting lineup, with Audel Laville replacing Javid George. Laville made a strong impression from the start.

The game remained evenly matched until the 31st minute when Jamaica’s Shamar Nicholson scored, capitalizing on a defensive error to put his team in the lead. Jamaica extended their lead in the 43rd minute with a goal from Kaheim Dixon, making it 2-0 by halftime.

Dominica continued to fight in the second half but struggled to find the net. Jamaica added a third goal in the 80th minute, with Nicholson converting a penalty after a handball by Dominica’s Eskim Williams.

The home team found a resurgence late in the game. Substitute Javid George scored in the 83rd minute, assisted by a through ball from Savio Anselm. In the 89th minute, Troy Jules scored from a free kick, bringing the score to 3-2. Despite the support of the home crowd and continuous pressure, Dominica was unable to equalize before the final whistle.

Coach Ellington Sabin expressed pride in his team’s resilience and performance despite the loss. Team Captain Glenson Prince also commended the team’s effort and thanked the fans for their unwavering support.

Jamaica’s Assistant Coach, John Wall, acknowledged Dominica’s spirited fightback, noting the challenges posed by the weather and field conditions. He pointed out that the final score did not fully reflect Jamaica’s control during most of the game. Wall praised Dominica’s recovery following their heavy defeat to Guatemala, crediting them for their bounce-back mentality and the ability to engage the crowd.

The World Cup qualifiers will resume in June 2025, with Dominica looking to build on their promising performance against Jamaica.
