PHOENIX – Newly released records of the divorce of Ruben and Kate Gallego unearthed no major surprises despite Kari Lake, his opponent in the race for U.S. Senate, having publicly accused him for weeks of "hiding something bad."

The 465 pages made public Thursday by Yavapai County Superior Court cover everything starting with Ruben filing a petition to dissolve the marriage on Dec. 14, 2016 while Kate was pregnant with their child along with his motion to immediately seal the entire court file and record. They cover through the final divorce decree and parenting plan entered by Judge Joseph Goldstein on April 27, 2017.
