Turkey and Montenegro resume their UEFA Nations League campaigns when they square off at the Samsun 19 Mayis Stadium in Tekkekoy on Friday night.

While the hosts sit top of League B Group 4 with four points from two matches, the visitors find themselves rock bottom without a single point.

Since reaching the quarter-finals of Euro 2024 in the summer, Turkey have made an unbeaten start to their Nations League campaign, following up a goalless draw with Wales with a 3-1 home victory over Iceland.

Kerem Akturkoglu was the star of the show against Iceland as he scored a superb hat-trick in front of the Goztepe crowd, including a stunning second from long range, to help the Crescent-Stars climb to the top of League B Group 4 - albeit level with Wales on goal difference.

Vincenzo Montella has won seven of his 15 international matches during his 12-month tenure as Turkey boss and he is hoping to steer his side to successive promotions in the Nations League after they finished top of League C in the previous campaign.

Prior to last month's victory over Iceland, Turkey had not played on home soil since October of last year, but they do boast a strong record in front of their own fans, as they have posted seven victories in their last 10 home internationals.

Ranked 26th in the world by FIFA, Turkey have also never suffered defeat in four previous meetings with Friday's opponents Montenegro, winning their most recent encounter 2-1 on the road in a 2022 World Cup qualifier.

Montenegro have scored in each of their last three meetings with Turkey, netting five times in total, but they are yet to celebrate success over the Crescent-Stars, while they have suffered a dip in form in all competitions over the last four months of this year.

After winning their opening two games of 2024 - friendlies against Belarus and North Macedonia - the Brave Falcons have since suffered four consecutive defeats, including their opening two Nations League matches against Iceland (0-2) and Wales (1-2) last month.

Robert Prosinecki, who was appointed head coach in February, is tasked with turning Montenegro's fortunes around as they endeavour to avoid relegation from League B, as they did in the previous campaign when they survived by the skin of their teeth courtesy of goal difference.

Ranked 74th in the world by FIFA, Montenegro are seeking to avoid setting a new unwanted national record when they face Turkey on Friday; since becoming an independent football nation in 2007, the Brave Falcons have never lost five consecutive matches in a row in all competitions.

Turkey will be without first-choice goalkeeper Mert Gunok due to injury, so Ugurcan Cakir is expected to start between the sticks, while Dogan Alemdar, Caglar Soyuncu, Cenk Ozkacar, Ozan Kabak and Ismail Yuksek are also sidelined.

Baris Alper Yilmaz missed the victory over Iceland through suspension, but the Galatasaray striker is available for selection on Friday and is expected to start up front at the expense of Umut Nayir, who has not been called up this time around.

Brighton & Hove Albion's Ferdi Kadioglu has returned to the senior setup and is set to play at left-back, while the likes of Real Madrid's Arda Guler, Juventus' Kenan Yildiz and Inter Milan's 92-cap playmaker Hakan Calhanoglu are also in contention to start.

As for Montenegro, Preston North End forward Milutin Osmajic has been called up and is available for selection despite being handed an eight-match ban by the Football Association for biting an opponent last month.

Experienced forward Stevan Jovetic, who has earned 80 caps and is just seven away from becoming his country's all-time record appearance-maker, could replace Osmajic in the starting lineup, while Stefan Mugosa will also be pushing for a recall.

Milos Brnovic and Vladimir Jovovic are both set to continue in centre-midfield, while Lazio's Adam Marusic could begin at right-back if Driton Camaj is recalled to start on the right flank.


Turkey possible starting lineup:
Cakir; Muldur, Demiral, Bardakci, Kadioglu; Calhanoglu, Kokcu; Guler, Kahveci, Akturkoglu; B. Yilmaz

Montenegro possible starting lineup:
Mijatovic; Marusic, Rubezic, Vujacic, Radunovic; Brnovic, Jovovic; Camaj, Jovetic, Krstovic; Mugosa




We say: Turkey 2-0 Montenegro

Considering the results of both teams in 2024 and their starts in the Nations League, Turkey will be regarded as favourites to come out on top in this fixture.

Montenegro have kept only three clean sheets in their last 13 internationals and they may struggle to keep the hosts' fearsome frontline quiet on this occasion.
