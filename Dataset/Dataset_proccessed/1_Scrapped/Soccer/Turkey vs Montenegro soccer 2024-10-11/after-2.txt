UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE
TURKEY
MONTENEGRO

On Friday, October 11, 2024, Turkey will face Montenegro in the third round of the UEFA Nations League, League B. The match will take place at Samsun 19 Mayis Stadium in Samsun, which holds a capacity of 33,919 spectators. The game is set to begin at 18:45 GMT+0, with Daniele Chiffi from Italy officiating the game. This is a key match in the Nations League, where both teams are aiming to make significant progress in the tournament. Football fans can expect an exciting encounter as Turkey, fresh from their Euro 24 quarter-final success, will look to assert their dominance against a struggling Montenegro side.

Turkey, under head coach Vincenzo Montella, is in high spirits after their solid performance in recent months. Meanwhile, Montenegro, led by Robert Prosinecki, seeks to regain momentum after several defeats. As both teams prepare for this important UEFA Nations League showdown, it is essential to consider their recent form, squad news, and past encounters as part of the Turkey vs Montenegro prediction for today.

BETTING TIPS AND MATCH INSIGHTS

In anticipation of this crucial Nations League fixture, analyzing the recent form of both teams provides a clearer picture for the Turkey vs Montenegro prediction today. Turkey comes into this match having picked up four points from their first two games in the competition, including an impressive 3-1 victory over Iceland. Montenegro, on the other hand, has faced difficulties, losing their opening two games, including a disappointing 2-0 defeat against Iceland. When these teams last met, Turkey secured a 2-1 victory, and with Turkey playing at home this time, they will be confident of securing another win. The combination of Turkey’s strong home record and Montenegro’s recent struggles suggests that Turkey could be the stronger side in this matchup.

Turkey Results

Turkey has been in strong form recently, securing important results in both the UEFA Nations League and Euro 2024. Below is a summary of their last five competitive fixtures:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	W/L
09.09.2024	UNL	Turkey vs Iceland	3-1	W
06.09.2024	UNL	Wales vs Turkey	0-0	D
06.07.2024	Euro 2024	Netherlands vs Turkey	2-1	L
02.07.2024	Euro 2024	Austria vs Turkey	1-2	W
26.06.2024	Euro 2024	Czech Republic vs Turkey	1-2	W

Turkey has been largely consistent, with three wins, one draw, and only one loss in their last five games. Their ability to score multiple goals, especially at home, has been a key factor in their recent success. Defensively, they have shown resilience, and the squad appears well-rounded under Montella’s leadership.

Montenegro Results

Montenegro, by contrast, has struggled in their recent outings, losing four of their last five games. Below is a summary of their most recent competitive matches:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	W/L
09.09.2024	UNL	Montenegro vs Wales	1-2	L
06.09.2024	UNL	Iceland vs Montenegro	2-0	L
09.06.2024	Friendly	Montenegro vs Georgia	1-3	L
05.06.2024	Friendly	Belgium vs Montenegro	2-0	L
25.03.2024	Friendly	Montenegro vs North Macedonia	1-0	W

Montenegro’s form has been concerning, with only one win in their last five games. Their defense has been vulnerable, conceding multiple goals in several matches, and their attack has struggled to find consistency. This lack of form could prove problematic as they face an in-form Turkey side on Friday.

Turkey vs Montenegro Head-to-Head Results

The last five meetings between Turkey and Montenegro have been closely contested, with Turkey having the upper hand. Below is a breakdown of their previous encounters:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result
16.11.2021	World Cup Qual.	Montenegro vs Turkey	1-2
01.09.2021	World Cup Qual.	Turkey vs Montenegro	2-2
27.03.2018	Friendly	Montenegro vs Turkey	2-2
29.05.2016	Friendly	Turkey vs Montenegro	1-0

Turkey remains unbeaten in all of their competitive and friendly matches against Montenegro. However, Montenegro has managed to secure draws on two occasions, showing that they can challenge the Turkish side. Turkey will be aiming to continue their positive head-to-head record in their upcoming encounter.

Turkey vs Montenegro: Predicted Lineups

Below are the predicted starting lineups for the upcoming match between Turkey and Montenegro in the UEFA Nations League. Based on recent team performances and available players, these are the most likely starting elevens. Keep in mind that last-minute changes could happen due to injuries or tactical decisions by the coaches.

Turkey possible starting lineup:

Cakir (GK), Muldur (DF), Demiral (DF), Bardakci (DF), Kadioglu (DF); Calhanoglu (MF), Kokcu (MF); Guler (MF), Kahveci (MF), Akturkoglu (MF); B. Yilmaz (FW)

Montenegro possible starting lineup:

Mijatovic (GK), Marusic (DF), Rubezic (DF), Vujacic (DF), Radunovic (DF); Brnovic (MF), Jovovic (MF); Camaj (MF), Jovetic (MF), Krstovic (MF); Mugosa (FW)

Injured and Suspended Players

In this section, we’ll list the players from both teams who are unavailable for the upcoming match due to injuries or suspensions. This information is crucial for understanding the potential impact on the teams’ performance and tactics.

Team	Player	Reason	Position
Turkey	Mert Gunok	Injury	Goalkeeper
Turkey	Dogan Alemdar	Injury	Goalkeeper
Turkey	Caglar Soyuncu	Injury	Defender
Turkey	Cenk Ozkacar	Injury	Defender
Turkey	Ozan Kabak	Injury	Defender
Turkey	Ismail Yuksek	Injury	Midfielder
Montenegro	Milutin Osmajic	FA Suspension	Forward

Turkey will miss a number of key defenders, including Caglar Soyuncu and Ozan Kabak, which could affect their defensive structure. However, they have strong midfield and attacking options with Hakan Calhanoglu and Arda Guler. For Montenegro, although Milutin Osmajic is available despite his suspension from club matches, the possible absence of some experienced players like Stevan Jovetic in the future could affect their attacking choices.

Key Factors to Consider

As we approach this important Nations League matchup, there are several key factors to take into account for both teams. These factors could significantly influence the outcome of the game:

Turkey’s home form: Only one loss on home soil since March 2022;
Montenegro’s losing streak: Montenegro has lost their last four consecutive games;
Key players: Turkey’s young star, Arda Guler, is expected to play a crucial role, while Montenegro will rely on the experience of Stevan Jovetic;

Montenegro’s defensive struggles: Conceded nine goals in their last four games;
Motivation levels: Turkey is riding high after a strong Euro 2024 campaign, while Montenegro needs a morale boost after consecutive defeats;
Managerial impact: Vincenzo Montella has revitalized Turkey, while Robert Prosinecki is under pressure to turn Montenegro’s fortunes around.

As the match between Turkey and Montenegro approaches, there are several critical factors to consider when placing your bets. By analyzing key aspects such as team form, head-to-head statistics, and external influences like weather or pitch conditions, bettors can gain a strategic edge. Below are some expert tips that will help you make more informed decisions regarding the Turkey vs Montenegro clash.

Team Form: Turkey is riding high after a series of strong performances, while Montenegro has struggled recently with multiple losses. It’s essential to factor in the recent form of both teams as Turkey’s confidence could give them the upper hand.
Head-to-Head Statistics: Historically, Turkey has had the advantage over Montenegro, remaining unbeaten in their encounters. Reviewing these statistics shows a pattern that favors Turkey, which may continue into this match.
Home vs. Away Performance: Turkey has been particularly strong at home, suffering only one defeat on their home soil since 2022. This gives them a significant edge, especially against a Montenegro side that has struggled in away games.
Weather Conditions and Pitch: The weather can greatly influence gameplay. Keep an eye on the weather forecast in Samsun as heavy rain or unfavorable conditions could slow down the pace of the game, affecting both teams’ strategies and potentially leading to fewer goals.
Referee Influence: Italian referee Daniele Chiffi is known for strict officiating and giving out cards more frequently. This could lead to more cautions in a potentially intense game, especially with Montenegro trying to avoid another loss.
