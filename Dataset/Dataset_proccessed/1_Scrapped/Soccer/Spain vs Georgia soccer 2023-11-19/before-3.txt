Preview: Spain vs. Georgia - prediction, team news, lineups

Realistically requiring just a draw to ensure a first-placed finish in Euro 2024 qualifying Group A, Spain take to the Estadio Jose Zorrilla turf in Valladolid to face Georgia in their final preliminary match on Sunday.

La Roja comfortably dispatched Cyprus 3-1 in their penultimate fixture on Thursday, while Georgia were pegged back twice in an ill-tempered 2-2 draw with Scotland.

While both Spain and Scotland were already guaranteed to be present at Euro 2024 before a ball was kicked in Group A this month, there is still the small matter of confirming the section winner, as well as determining which teams will enter the coveted Pot 1 for the group-stage draw.

Spain did their prospects of achieving both goals no harm at all on Thursday evening, where they condemned Cyprus to an eighth defeat from eight qualification matches by virtue of a 3-1 success, which began with Barcelona wonderkid Lamine Yamal breaking the deadlock just five minutes in.

Mikel Oyarzabal and Joselu also got in on the act during a rampant opening 30 minutes from Luis de la Fuente's men, who were breached 15 minutes before the end by Kostas Pileas, but there would be no catastrophic Cypriot collapse for Spain as they strode clear at the top of Group A.

Thanks to their efforts of their upcoming opponents, Spain boast a two-point cushion over Scotland - who take on Norway on Sunday - and will be guaranteed to qualify in first place with a triumph this weekend, and a draw will most likely be enough too given their superior goal difference of +18 compared to +9 for Steve Clarke's side, whom they are level with on all head-to-head categories.

Taking the first step to restoring former glories with their Nations League success in the summer, the hosts are now on the hunt for an eighth successive victory in all tournaments against visitors who have little to play for, having already been confirmed as one of 12 playoff representatives.

There were no prizes for guessing who correctly led the Georgia charge against Scotland in midweek, as Napoli wing king Khvicha Kvaratskhelia breached Clarke's backline on two occasions, firstly crashing home at the near post before cutting inside and finding the far corner with panache.

However, Scotland came up with the required response to Kvaratskhelia's efforts on both occasions, as Scott McTominay's mishit shot trickled over the line before Lawrence Shankland headed home a dramatic late equaliser, although the former's post-game comments unsurprisingly stole the spotlight.

Labelling Willy Sagnol's players a "disgrace", McTominay blasted Scotland's opponents for "crying like babies" in a contest fraught with scuffles, fouls and bookings, but while Clarke's side are assured of a first-placed finish, Georgia still have a few bumps in the road to overcome.

The fourth-placed Crusaders have already made the playoffs on account of being the highest-ranked team in the third tier of the Nations League, offering hope of a first-ever major tournament appearance for the former Soviet nation, whose rapid rise has seen them go from League D to League B in the Nations League since the competition's inception in 2018.

However, Georgia head to Valladolid having been beaten in three of their last four away contests - including their last two Group A matches with Norway and Scotland - and September's visit of Spain to Tbilisi ended with Sagnol's side being obliterated 7-1 by the 2008 and 2012 continental champions.

The headline news from the Spain camp leading up to their win over Cyprus was the omission of Manchester City midfield screen Rodri, who was not risked against the minnows after reporting discomfort in training, and it is unclear whether he will be back in the fold against Georgia.

The same can be said for Valencia left-back Jose Gaya, who was known to have been suffering from a knee injury before linking up with the team, but goalscorer Oyarzabal sustained a hamstring injury towards the end of the first half on Thursday and will return to Real Sociedad early.

In-demand Athletic Bilbao starlet Nico Williams is a prime candidate to deputise for Oyarzabal, but his Basques teammate Unai Simon lost out to Arsenal's David Raya in the battle for the goalkeeping gloves on Thursday; whether that signals a changing of the guard long-term remains to be seen.

Georgia did not emerge unscathed from their meeting with Scotland either, as Levan Shengelia and Luka Lochoshvili were forced off within six minutes of each other in the second half, although Scotland perceived the latter's actions to amount to gamesmanship as he took an age to rise to his feet.

However, Shengelia was seen clutching his shoulder before having to be withdrawn, so the Panetolikos wing-back will surely not be risked given the tight turnaround; Irakli Azarovi is on hand to deputise.

By scoring a brace against Scotland, Kvaratskhelia became his nation's outright fourth-highest goalscorer with just 14 strikes in 27 matches, and the 22-year-old only needs 13 more to overtake Shota Arveladze and set a new record for his nation.


Spain possible starting lineup:
Simon; Carvajal, Le Normand, Torres, Grimaldo; Merino, Zubimendi, Ruiz; Torres, Morata, Williams

Georgia possible starting lineup:
Mamardashvili; Gocholeishvili, Kashia, Kvirkvelia, Kalandadze, Azarovi; Kvekveskiri, Chakvetadze, Kochorashvili; Mikautadze, Kvaratskhelia



We say: Spain 3-1 Georgia

Injuries may be rearing their ugly heads for De la Fuente's side, but the abundance of talent in the Roja reserves means that Georgia's sojourn to Valladolid should not be worthwhile one for Sagnol's team.

Finding the back of the net is never an issue for the Crusaders, but they have flattered to deceive on the road, and Spain ought to seal a first-placed finish in the group in style.
