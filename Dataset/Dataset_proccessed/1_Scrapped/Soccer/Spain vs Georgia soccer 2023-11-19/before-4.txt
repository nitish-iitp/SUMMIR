Arsenal headed into the international break on a bright note following victories over Sevilla and Burnley.

Despite many claiming the Gunners are yet to reach top gear, Mikel Arteta’s side look poised to compete for the Premier League title again, while progression into the Champions League knockouts now looks a formality.

The boss will be pleading for an injury-free break given his current absentees, and he’ll have 17 players away on international duty in November.

Thomas Partey, Jurrien Timber, Martin Odegaard, and Emile Smith Rowe are among those who won’t be featuring for their respective nations this month due to injuries, but Gabriel Jesus has been called up to the Brazil national team despite missing the five games that preceded the break.
