Preview: Senegal vs. Burkina Faso - prediction, team news, lineups
By Babafemi Busari
Published: September 5 2024 | 10:21

Senegal and Burkina Faso are set to clash this Friday in the opening round of the 2025 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers for Group L, with the match taking place in Dakar, Senegal.

The hosts' recent form positions them as clear favourites, but they remain cautious, having only won twice in five previous encounters with Burkina Faso.

Senegal enter this AFCON qualifier as one of the continent's most formidable teams, having qualified for the last five consecutive tournaments.

This impressive streak underscores their consistency and strength in African football during which they have built a reputation as a resilient and competitive team, often reaching the later stages of the tournament.

The hosts' recent form underscores their strength as a team, and their ability to secure a narrow 1-0 win over Mauritania in their latest World Cup qualifier highlights their capacity to grind out results, even in tough away matches. Indeed, that victory followed a series of strong performances which further showcased the team's resilience and overall quality.

However, despite their strong form, Senegal will be acutely aware of the need to maintain momentum as they return to home soil for this crucial qualifier.

In their last home game, they were held to a draw by Congo DR in the World Cup qualifiers, a result that was seen as a setback given their usual dominance on home turf.

That result serves as a reminder that even the strongest teams can falter, and it emphasises the importance of staying focused and not underestimating any opponent whilst also highlighting some vulnerabilities in their attack, which coach Aliou Cisse will be keen to address as they prepare to face Burkina Faso.

Burkina Faso have proven to be a tricky opponent in the past, and Senegal's record against them is less dominant than against other teams.

With the memory of past encounters in mind, Cisse's men will be aiming not just for a win, but for a convincing performance that sets the tone for the rest of their qualifying campaign.

The visitors come into this match in a difficult period, having not won a game in their last seven outings. This winless streak dates back to their first match at the last AFCON, where they secured a narrow 1-0 victory over Mauritania.

Since then, the Stallions have struggled to find their footing, managing only three draws in this period.

These draws include a 2-2 result at home against Sierra Leone, a 1-1 friendly away to Niger, and another 2-2 draw against Algeria in their second AFCON group stage match - a lack of victories which highlights the challenges they face in regaining their form and confidence.

Despite their recent struggles, the visitors have shown resilience in the past, qualifying for the last two AFCON tournaments, but their inconsistency has been evident, as they missed out on the edition before those two appearances.

Their qualification for AFCON is often marked by a blend of strong performances and occasional lapses, making them a team that can surprise but also falter unexpectedly.

For the Stallions, this match is more than just another qualifier; it is an opportunity to turn their fortunes around and make a statement in Group L.

With Senegal being the strongest team in the group, securing even a point in this match could be pivotal for Burkina Faso's chances of progressing.

The Stallions will be looking to capitalise on any weaknesses Senegal might show and hope to produce a disciplined and resilient performance. Their focus will likely be on tightening their defence, which has been vulnerable in recent matches, and finding ways to counter Senegal's attacking threat.

Team News

For Senegal, the absence of Al Nassr forward and all-time top scorer Sadio Mane is a notable loss, but the team remains well-equipped with attacking talent.

In Mane's absence, the spotlight will fall on players like Ismaila Sarr and Iliman Ndiaye to drive the attack.

With Nicolas Jackson's recent performances at club level, Senegal will be hoping his scoring and playmaking abilities will make a considerable impact in their match against Burkina Faso.

Jackson's impressive form for Chelsea is expected to translate into a significant boost for Senegal, as he seeks to shine on the international stage.

Edmund Tapsoba's defensive prowess will be vital in stifling Senegal's attacking threats, while Dango Ouattara's contributions up front will be pivotal in breaking down the hosts' defence and creating scoring opportunities.

The presence of Bertrand Traore adds another layer of potential threat for Burkina Faso. Known for his ability to both score and create goals from midfield, Traore's contribution will be crucial in providing the team with offensive dynamism and ingenuity.


Senegal possible starting lineup:
Dieng; F Mendy, Koulibaly, Niakhate, Jakobs; I Gueye, H Diarra, N Mendy; Diallo, Jackson, Dia

Burkina Faso possible starting lineup:
Nikiema; Ouedraogo, Tapsoba, Nagalo, Yago; Badolo, Banse, Ki; Ouattara, Traore, Bande



We say: Senegal 2-0 Burkina Faso

Given Senegal's strong form and their depth of attacking options, combined with Burkina Faso's recent struggles and defensive vulnerabilities, a simple victory for Senegal is likely.
