Senegal vs Burkina Faso
Preview
Tournament: 2025 CAF Africa Cup of Nations
Date: Friday, Sep 06
Kick-off Time: 07:00 pm GMT
Venue: Stade Me Abdoulaye Wade, Senegal

It’s time for the 2025 CAF Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers to begin, and 2021 winners Senegal are set to face Burkina Faso in their first game. Both teams are placed in Group L, along with Burundi and Malawi.

Senegal, one of the strongest sides in Africa are destined to be the favourites in the opener. They have a team that possesses good exposure and experience. Their past records in the 2021 version, where they clinched the trophy and the 2022 FIFA World Cup are also praiseworthy.

Burkina Faso is the underdog in this fixture. They have not won a single of their last five games, and have displayed a poor defence in the recent games. Even a draw would satisfy the traveling side.

Senegal vs Burkina Faso Prediction

Senegal national football team are the favourites to win the opening tie. The team has players with superior skills, exposure, and experience compared to the opponents. The added advantage of playing at the iconic stadium at home will act as a boost for them to take full points.

The Burkina Faso national football team are not having a good run in recent games. Facing heavyweights like Senegal might bring more misery to their confidence. They will look to stay solid and obstruct the hosts.
