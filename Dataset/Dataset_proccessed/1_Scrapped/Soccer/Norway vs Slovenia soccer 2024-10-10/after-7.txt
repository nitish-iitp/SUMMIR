Haaland becomes Norway's top scorer in win over Slovenia
0:52
Should Norway be reaching major championships with their squad?

ESPN FC's Craig Burley believes Norway have a very talented squad and should be reaching major tournaments.

Norway striker Erling Haaland wrote more footballing history on Thursday, scoring twice in a 3-0 Nations League win over Slovenia to become his country's leading international scorer with 34 goals.

Captaining the side in the absence of the injured Martin Ødegaard, Haaland embraced the extra responsibility, but once again it was his goals that grabbed the headlines.

He drilled home the opener in the seventh minute after Jan Oblak could only parry Antonio Nusa's stinging shot into his path to go level with Jorgen Juve, the last of whose 33 international goals came against an Austrian amateur international side in 1934.

Haaland could have broken the record early in the second half, but he flashed a header high over the bar, and fellow forward Alexander Sørloth made it 2-0 to Norway after Slovenia defender Vanja Drkusic's attempted clearance rolled into his path.

Known for his direct, powerful style, Haaland spent much of the early part of the second half trying to tee up his teammates, but in the 62nd minute Sørloth served him a perfect pass and he buried it with a trademark left-foot shot to move to the top of Norway's scoring charts.

Haaland's 34th goal came in his 36th international, nine fewer than Juve.

The 24-year-old Manchester City striker turned up all over the field, heading clearances in defence and orchestrating their attacks as Norway put in one of their most complete performances in years in front of their home crowd.

Norway, who have not qualified for the finals of a major tournament since Euro 2000, top League B Group 3 with seven points, three ahead of Austria and Slovenia, with Kazakhstan bottom on one point.
