Erling Haaland smashes 90-year goalscoring record with brace in Norway win

Manchester City goal machine Erling Haaland has become the highest-scoring male Norway player in history thanks to his brace in their 3-0 win over Slovenia in the UEFA Nations League.

The former Borussia Dortmund and Red Bull Salzburg starlet came into the October international break sitting on 32 goals from just 35 outings, already putting him second in the all-time men's Norway charts behind Jorgen Juve.

Juve managed 33 goals in 45 games for Norway between 1928 and 1937 - scoring for the last time for his country in 1934 - but Haaland matched his record in nine fewer games when he opened the scoring in the seventh minute of the match.

Not content with simply equalling Juve's record, the 24-year-old registered goal number 34 for his country just past the hour mark, capping off a 3-0 win after Alexander Sorloth had also made the net bulge.

With 34 goals in just 36 matches for his national team, Haaland is now sitting pretty at the top of Norway's men's all-time scoring list, although he still has some way to go before he breaks the overall record.

Indeed, nine female players have scored more goals for Norway than Haaland, who needs another 32 strikes to catch women's top scorer Isabell Herlovsen (67) and become the outright record holder male or female.

Two players on the women's top 10 list - Ada Hegerberg (47) and Caroline Graham Hansen (46) - are still active for Norway, but Haaland will break the overall record with ease if he continues scoring at the same rate.

The Premier League Golden Boot winner has averaged 0.94 goals per game in a Norway shirt, meaning that he is on track to score 68 goals in just 73 matches for his country.

Thursday evening was one of celebration in more ways than one for Haaland, who hinted on social media after the game that he will soon become a father with partner Isabel Haugseng Johansen.

Norway's three-goal victory leaves them top of League B Group 3 with seven points from their opening three games, and the Scandinavians are back in action away to Austria on Sunday evening.

What other records has Haaland broken?

Still only 24 years of age, Haaland could have another 15 or so seasons of goalscoring ahead of him, but the Citizens attacker has already cemented his name into club and country annals.

With 36 goals in his debut top-flight campaign for Man City, Haaland broke the single-season Premier League record, while also totalling 52 in all tournaments, a new record for a Premier League player.

Last season, Haaland also reached 100 goals in Europe's top five leagues in record time, taking just 103 appearances to hit that landmark, 30 fewer than previous record holder Ronaldo Nazario.

Furthermore, the 24-year-old managed 50 Premier League goals in just 48 games - also a tournament best, while also netting nine times in his first four top-flight games of this season, another unprecedented feat.
