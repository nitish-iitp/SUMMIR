Preview: Austria vs. Kazakhstan - prediction, team news, lineups

Both seeking their first win of this season's UEFA Nations League, Austria and Kazakhstan convene in Linz on Thursday evening.

Trailing three points behind the leading pair in League B Group 3, the two teams will be eager to claim victory and ease fears of relegation.

Faced with two away fixtures to kick off their campaign, Austria first claimed a point in neighbouring Slovenia then travelled to Norway on the Nations League's second matchday.

Ralf Rangnick's side had lost just three times in 14 competitive games upon arriving in Oslo; however, despite Marcel Sabitzer hauling them level after conceding an early goal, they ultimately left empty-handed following Erling Haaland's late winner.

Although they impressed at Euro 2024, Austria had previously been demoted from League A, and an instant return to Europe's top tier was the target for a talented squad.

Having finished their last Nations League campaign with a run of one point from five games, they last tasted success in the competition back in June 2022, beating Croatia 3-0 on that occasion.

Das Team have now made a slow start this year, so making the most of home advantage during this month's double-header could help turn things around.

After hosting Kazakhstan - who they last met in World Cup qualifying 12 years ago - Austria must try to reverse September's result against an ambitious Norway side that boasts plenty of firepower.

In four previous meetings - which all took place across two years, just over a decade ago - Kazakhstan have never got the better of Thursday's hosts, against whom they are yet to score a single goal.

Following promotion from the third tier in 2022, the Hawks played their first match in League B of the Nations League last month, when they hosted Norway and picked up a point by holding out for a goalless draw.

That continued a clear upward trend, after posting six wins from 10 in European Championship qualifying before missing out in the playoffs, where they were well beaten by Greece.

Their potential route to Euro 2024 was secured by winning promotion from League C - with two wins over Slovakia helping the Kazakhs to top their group with 13 points - but they come into these October internationals on the back of a comprehensive defeat last time out.

Stanislav Cherchesov's side were beaten 3-0 by Slovenia in Ljubljana, with RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko bagging a hat-trick to leave Kazakhstan on one point from two games so far. As things stand, they sit fourth in the table and are in danger of automatic demotion.

In addition to captain David Alaba, who remains on the road to recovery following his serious knee injury, Austria boss Ralf Rangnick will be without several other defenders for both Nations League matches.

While Kevin Danso is back in training - having been cleared to play, several weeks after a move to Roma collapsed when his medical discovered a heart problem - he will stay with Lens.

Furthermore, Leeds United's Maximilian Wober must undergo knee surgery, having been sidelined since Austria's draw with Slovenia last month. Therefore, Venezia centre-back Michael Svoboda has been called up for the first time, and Marco Friedl returns after more than two years away.

Joining a forward department led by veteran striker Marko Arnautovic, Blackburn Rovers attacker Andi Weimann - who has scored three times for his club this season, including a 'Goal of the Month' winning strike against local rivals Burnley - is also recalled.

Meanwhile, Kazakhstan's squad is mainly home-based, but wide-man Bakhtiyor Zaynutdinov plies his trade with Besiktas, Ramazan Orazov represents Silkeborg in Denmark, and star striker Abat Aymbetov is on the books of Adana Demirspor.

The latter registered three goals both in Euro 2024 qualifying and the last edition of the Nations League, so the visitors will hope he can help them score for the first time this season.

Stanislav Cherchesov's side - who convened for a training camp in the Austrian city of Krems last week - are again captained by Askhat Tagybergen from central midfield.


Austria possible starting lineup:
Pentz; Posch, Querfeld, Lienhart, Prass; Seiwald, Laimer, Sabitzer; Schmid, Arnautovic, Baumgartner

Kazakhstan possible starting lineup:
Shatskiy; Bystrov, Marochkin, Alip, Kasym, Vorogovskiy; Orazov, Tagybergen, Zaynutdinov, Samorodov; Aymbetov



We say: Austria 3-0 Kazakhstan

Although they have shown signs of improvement, Kazakhstan still occupy 109th place in FIFA's world rankings and are yet to score a goal at League B level.

After making a lacklustre start in September, Austria should be sufficiently motivated to move through the gears and claim maximum points on Thursday.
