The daily New York wholesale price for large eggs averaged 312.6 cents per dozen in February, according to the most recent USDA Livestock, Dairy and Poultry Outlook report.

Daily prices increased steeply in late January and early February as inventories of large table eggs declined. 

Daily prices held steady at 332 cents per dozen February 8th through the 20th before falling again as inventories recovered. 

Large-egg inventory totalled 723.2 thousand cases on February 26th. 

Daily New York prices for that week averaged 256.6 cents per dozen. 

Based on recent price data, the first-quarter projected average price was adjusted down to 250 cents per dozen, while the outlying quarterly projections are unchanged at 160 cents per dozen in the second quarter, 145 cents per dozen in the third quarter, and 165 cents per dozen in the fourth quarter. 

The projected annual average price for 2024 is 180.0 cents per dozen, down 12.4 cents from the 2023 average.
