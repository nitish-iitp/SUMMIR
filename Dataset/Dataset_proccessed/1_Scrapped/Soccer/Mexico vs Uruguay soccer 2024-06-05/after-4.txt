Uruguay beat Mexico, 4-0, behind a hat trick from forward Gabriel Nuñez in front of a large and rowdy crowd at Empower Field at Mile High in Denver on Wednesday night.

The match was played as an international friendly as both countries prepare for the Copa América tournament, which kicks off on June 20. Uruguay controlled the game the whole way, scoring seven minutes into the match and adding two more goals in the first half.

Nuñez, who plays for Liverpool F.C., bagged his third goal just four minutes into the second half. Facundo Pellistri (11) added a first-half goal and second-half assist. The crowd, almost entirely made up of Mexico fans, did not respond positively to the blowout loss. The game was ultimately ended in the 89th minute after several fans invaded the pitch and fights had broken out in the crowd. Players left the field as beer flew through the air.
