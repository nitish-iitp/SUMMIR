Núñez scores hat trick, Uruguay thrash Mexico ahead of Copa América

A hat trick from Liverpool forward Darwin Núñez led Uruguay to a 4-0 victory over Mexico on Wednesday in a preparation match for the 2024 Copa América.

Held at Denver, Colorado's Empower Field at Mile High, the exhibition kicked off with relentless pressure from Uruguay in the early stages of the game.

By the seventh minute, the South Americans quickly took charge after Nuñez found the back of the net after a short scramble that followed a cross from Nahitan Nández.

"I'm really happy with the result because the team has worked very well," said Nuñez. "For us, it wasn't a friendly match, we came here with the mentality of playing a good match and winning it"

Although Mexico midfielder Roberto "Piojo" Alvarado tested the net after his shot rocketed off the crossbar in the 13th minute, Uruguay would soon continue to increase their pressure.

Lethal with counters and plays in transition, manager Marcelo Bielsa and his men consistently confounded the opposing Concacaf backline.

In the 26th minute, Uruguay added a second goal after Brian Rodríguez slotted the ball over to Facundo Pellistri, who then found the back of the net from close range.

Failing to halt much of what Bielsa was throwing at them, Mexico would later allow a third goal late into the 1st half.

Through another dangerous counter, Nuñez connected with Maximiliano Araujo, before receiving the ball back and scoring in the 44th minute to make it 3-0 in Uruguay's favor.

"The result was misleading in the first half, Mexico could have scored and the game would have been different," Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa said. "When the gaps in the field are big, it's easier to play well."

The South Americans continued their dominance after the halftime break. By the 49th minute, Nuñez earned his hat-trick after tapping in a cross from Pellistri on the right flank.

Frustrated by the performance of El Tri, the majority of Mexico's crowd in Denver then marred the game in the stands after officiating temporarily paused the friendly in the 54th minute due to instances of an infamous homophobic chant.

On the field, despite tactical changes from Mexico manager Jaime "Jimmy" Lozano, the Concacaf side could do little to alter the result.

In the 80th minute, substitute Alexis Vega did well to test Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet through a powerful freekick, but still remained scoreless after his shot was saved.

With Uruguay sitting back and defending in the dying minutes, the South Americans were able to cement their 4-0 win at the final whistle.

"I think we learned a lot from this match, because of the result and because of the opponent," said Lozano.

"They surpassed us in counterattacks. I think they took advantage of that. We knew that it was a team that pressed hard and came out quickly when they recovered the ball."

Following Wednesday's friendly, Uruguay will begin their preparation for the 2024 Copa America, which will take place in the U.S. and kick off on June 20. At the tournament, Uruguay have been placed in Group C with Panama, the U.S., and Bolívia.

Mexico will face Brazil in a friendly on June 8 at College Station's Kyle Field in another preparation match ahead of the Copa América.

The Conmebol and Concacaf tournament will start on June 20 and Mexico are in Group B with Ecuador, Venezuela and Jamaica.
