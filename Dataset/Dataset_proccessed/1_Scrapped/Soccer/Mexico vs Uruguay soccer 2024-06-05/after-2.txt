A new selection to CONCACAF?

May 13 of this year marked a milestone in the history of Greenlandic soccer, as the Greenland Football Federation officially announced its application to join CONCACAF. Despite being a territory of Denmark, Greenland opted to seek membership in CONCACAF rather than UEFA. This choice underlines their determination to open up new opportunities on the international soccer scene.

He does not close the doors to the national team

Javier Aguirre, after his departure from Mallorca, does not rule out the possibility of returning to Mexico to support the National Teams. However, he assures that he is not thinking of taking 'Jimmy' Lozano's place, but that his intention would be to support the coach in El Tri's upcoming matches. Aguirre also mentioned that, should he receive an offer, he would discuss it with his wife Silvia, who would make the final decision.

Will the falcon Valverde fly?

From birdie to hawk, the truth is that when we talk about Uruguay, we must talk about Federico Valverde, two-time Champions League champion, heir to the “8” in Real Madrid and future great midfielder and captain of the Uruguayan national soccer team. Federico Valverde is one of those players that makes the difference because his great offensive and defensive skills make him an important element in the midfield capable of breaking the parity on the board when he wants to.

The litmus test for Santiago Giménez:

For this commitment, the player to follow will be the player who is the best Mexican player in Europe at present, Santiago Giménez, striker of Feyenoord and also of the Mexican national team. With the change in the call-up, everything looks like Santiago will take over the starting lineup and start to carry the Tricolor's offense, which so badly needs a killer in the penalty area like “Bebote”.

The 90 minutes of a great match will be played here.

The venue chosen to host this international friendly match will be the Empower Field at Mile High, located in the city of Denver, Colorado, which is the current home of the Denver Broncos, a team that plays in the NFL. The stadium opened on September 10, 2001, replacing the old Mile High Stadium, which had been the home of the Broncos since 1960. Interestingly, this is one of the stadiums where it has been a challenge for athletes to play since it is known for its altitude, as it is located one mile above sea level, which can affect the players' performance and the spectators' experience. It has a capacity to hold 76,000 spectators.

This is what we can expect during these 90 friendly minutes.

Let's place ourselves in the context of this commitment, Mexico receives Uruguay as part of the preparation of both clubs towards the start of the Copa America 2024, in U.S. territory, although with Mexican feelings, since something is certain and no matter where the national team plays, there will always be fellow countrymen supporting the tricolor team and even more if it is in the United States where many Mexicans live. This could be the moment to judge Jaime Lozano's work, since it will be the first time we will see the players of this generational change that took place during the last call-up and even though the game against Brazil is still to come, It can be assured that this match will be a test of fire but from the Uruguayan side, this match will be useful for the Charrúas to measure what kind of teams they will face on the CONCACAF side because in recent years Canada, the United States and Costa Rica have grown a lot and could surprise the CONMEBOL teams.

This was the last game of Mexico's national team

The last time we saw Mexico play was against Bolivia in a friendly match held in Chicago with the intention of preparing for the Copa America, however, it was not possible to see in action all the selected players corresponding to the tricolor mayor since for that game, the selected U-23 players directed by Ricardo Cadena were assigned to use it as preparation for their debut in the Maurice Revello Tournament against the French national team, However, the Mexican team left a good taste in their mouths as they showed a good control of the match against Bolivia, having a lot of chances to score but not very convincing, however, we cannot judge Jimmy Lozano's work yet as the real test will be now when they face the Uruguayans with the players that will be present in the Copa América 2024.
