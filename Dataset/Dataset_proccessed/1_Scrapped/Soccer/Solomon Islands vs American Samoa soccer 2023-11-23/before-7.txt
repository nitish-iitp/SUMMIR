Solomon Islands Vs American Samoa 1x2 Fixed Odds

Fixed Odds is also commonly known as 1X2 or singles. It is a popular betting option for English and Americans.

1 - Odds for Home Win X - Odds for Draw Outcome 2 - Odds for Away Win

All soccer bets for Fixed Odds (1X2) apply only to the full 90 minutes play of match results unless otherwise stated. This includes injury time goals but not extra-time (ET) score and golden goal or penalty shoot-outs.

Should a match be abandoned before 90 minutes play then it will be declared void. The goals scored and match result will not be counted.

Solomon Islands Vs American Samoa Asian Handicap Betting

Asian handicap betting is the most popular way of betting on football in the Far East by the Asians. It offers great value to the bettor and is potentially less risky than traditional fixed odds (1x2) betting. You must either select the favoured team to overcome a handicap (framed in goals) or oppose the favourite with the handicap.

There are only two possible selections in Asian handicap betting, home team win or away team win. Asian Handicap betting thus eliminates the draw option used in normal multiples (1x2).

The greater the difference in ability between the teams involved in the match, the more goals you would expect the favourite to win by and the bigger the handicap will be. The underdogs will therefore be given a head start, a handicap, (of 0.5, 1 ball, etc.) by the favourite.

The favourite has to overcome the indicated handicap, and will have it taken away from its final score. The handicap for the favourite is preceded by a minus (-).

You bet either over or under the goal-line. Where the total number of goals equals the goal-line, stakes are refunded. For instance, you bet on Total Goals Over 2, but the match ended 1-1 in full time, you do not lose or win here, so your stakes are refunded.
