WHAT HAPPENED?

The news of De Jong's withdrawal from the Dutch squad came immediately after Monday night's 4-0 win over Iceland in the final warm-up game before heading to the tournament.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

De Jong has missed most of the last three months, barring 45 minutes in El Clasico against Real Madrid on April 21, due to a troublesome ankle problem suffered in Barcelona's 0-0 draw with Athletic Club in early March. The 27-year-old was still named in Ronald Koeman's Euro squad in the hope he would be fit in time for the tournament, but that has not been the case.

WHAT DE JONG SAID

Taking to Instagram, De Jong said: "I'm sad and disappointed that I won't make it to the European Championship. We've been doing a lot of it the past few weeks, but my ankle needs more time unfortunately. It's a dream and greatest honour to represent our country in a final tournament. Wearing the orange shirt, singing the Wilhelmus and feeling the support of the entire country. But now I will, like the entire orange legion, cheer for our team from the sidelines. Let’s go, boys."

WHAT NEXT FOR DE JONG?

All De Jong really can do at this point is focus on recovering in time for the 2024-25 season with Barcelona. Summer training will begin in July, with the available squad heading to the United States on tour near the end of the month.
