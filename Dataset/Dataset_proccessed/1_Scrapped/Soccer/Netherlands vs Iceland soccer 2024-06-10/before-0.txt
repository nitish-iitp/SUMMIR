Dara Murphy, former vice president of the centre-right European People’s party, and former Irish European affairs minister described the exit polls in Germany, France and Austria were “dark results for Europe particularly in the second largest member state”.

But he said it now behoved the EPP, the liberals, socialists, Greens and others to stop “playing games” and properly pull together against the far right.

“I think any of us who are pro-European and pro-democracy have to be saddened by it to be honest,” he said.

“On the other hand, you still see a significant bloc in the centre. If you include the Greens, we have well over 450 MEPs who will be returned,” he added.

“There is now a huge responsibility in a way to reduce the games, because we now face a proper opposition in the far right. We have been voted to do a job and we have to do that. And I have been heartened at how clear the EPP has been to say they would not in any shape or form work with the far right.”

He was speaking at the EPP celebrations at the Stanhope Hotel in Brussels.

High turnout in Germany
Kate Connolly

Voter participation in Germany for the European election was between 64 and 65%, the highest ever level for this election since reunification. This compares favourably with the turnout across the EU which was 51%.

In 1994, 60% of eligible Germans cast their ballots. Thereafter, the level fell to around just 40 to 50%. Five years ago, turnout was 61.4%.

The highest ever participation was 65.7% in 1979, the first ever European election, but this only involved voters in West Germany.

Manfred Weber, the German MEP and leader of the centre-right European People’s party, said his group is now the “stabilising” force in Europe, following the rise of the far right in Germany, France and Austria.

The EPP counts 13 prime ministers in its group including the Polish, Greek and Irish leaders, and is currently projected to get 181 seats in the European parliament.

Weber said “voters are not opting for this extreme right positioning. In France and Germany that is a domestic situation, but we are increasing our seats and that is helping us stabilise the centre.”

“The left has no legitimacy any more, people voted for the centre right and that is good news for Europe,” he said.

He was speaking at celebrations for the EPP at the Stanhope hotel in Brussels.

Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president and lead candidate for the centre-right European People’s party (EPP), has just addressed the party faithful at the Stanhope elections, greeted to roars of “five more years, five more years” as she took to the stage.

“We had a fantastic campaign, we were determined, we were united, we made it and now we won the European elections,” she said.

“This is a good day for the EPP,” she shouted to applause. “We won the elections.”

“First of all I want to thank the voters who trusted us their vote and counted on us,” she said.

Von der Leyen told her campaigners to enjoy the night but from tomorrow it was “work” to deliver to voters across Europe.

What citizens want is a Europe that delivers.

As from tomorrow, I will start building a broad coalition for a strong Europe.

And together with others we will build the bastion against the extremes on the right and on the left. pic.twitter.com/fy6RINoKFl
