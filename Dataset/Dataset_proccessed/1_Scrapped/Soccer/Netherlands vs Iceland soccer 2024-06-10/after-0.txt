TELL ME MORE

With the Dutch ranked seventh in the world and Iceland ranked 72nd, the mismatch was pretty clear from the early stages. Xavi Simons put Oranje into a deserved lead midway through the first half, turning in from close-range after Denzel Dumfries headed the ball across the face of goal. It was clear that Iceland had little left in the tank after inflicting a shock defeat on England and Virgil van Dijk scored the second from a corner straight after half-time, although the visitors wound up hitting the post from distance via the fingertips of Bart Verbruggen. There was no danger of any sort if comeback when Memphis brilliantly found substitute Donyell Malen with a pass over the top, while Memphis had a would-be fourth ruled out by VAR for a handball earlier in the move. Wout Weghorst had the ball in the net in stoppage time that was initially flagged offside, but VAR came to the rescue this time and overturned the decision in favour of a goal.

THE MVP

Memphis Depay didn't have a great end to the club season with Atletico Madrid, playing only sparingly after a muscle injury ruled him out for several games across April and into May. There was a big hope that he'd be able to get a full 90 minutes in his legs before the Euros, after an hour against Canada last time out. And while that wasn't quite the case, he still played 84 minutes and looked the most consistent source of danger, well worth his assist and probably deserved a goal.

THE BIG LOSER

Teun Koopmeiners is coming into the Euros off the back of an outstanding club season with Atalanta, finally primed to play a significant role after not getting off the bench at the last continental championship and limited to bit-part status at the 2022 World Cup. But a groin injury suffered during the warm-up here, forcing him to drop out of the lineup before kick-off, was not the way he would have wanted to prepare.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Keen to improve on a disappointing last 16 exit at Euro 2020, failing to qualify for Euro 2016 and going home at the Euro 2012 group stage, the Dutch begin their 2024 campaign against Poland in just six days' time. The lineup Ronald Koeman chose on Monday was probably just two players shy of his strongest team, bearing in mind Koopmeiners' late withdrawal and Frenkie de Jong's ongoing battle to be fit.
