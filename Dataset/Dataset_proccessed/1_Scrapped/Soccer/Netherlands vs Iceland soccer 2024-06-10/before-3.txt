BOOKMARK

Taylor Swift has recently confirmed a new way for fans to buy tickets for The Eras Tour at Wembley Stadium in London.

The 34-year-old hitmaker is currently in Scotland, with the singer gearing up to perform her final show in Edinburgh this evening after two sold-out shows left fans gobsmacked by the sensational show she puts on for them. But soon enough, Taylor will be back in the capital city, with London Swifties inching closer to the hitmaker arriving.

Travelling down the country a little after she wraps up her Scottish shows this evening, Taylor will take to the stage in Liverpool to perform at Anfield Stadium for three nights (June 13, 14, 15). Moving onto Wales a couple of nights later, Taylor will then perform one show on June 18 at the Principality Stadium.

Mere days later, Taylor will then perform another trio of shows at London's Wembley Arena on June 21, 22, 23, before heading further afield throughout Europe. But Taylor won't stay away from UK soil for too long, with her due back in the capital for a further five sold-out shows in August on 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

But if you've not managed to score the hottest tickets of the decade just yet, fear not, because Taylor recently revealed a way fans can buy tickets for the London show on June 23. It was announced during the week that if Swifties order ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ on any format (via Taylor's official UK store website) before 10:00am BST on 10/6/24, they can be in with an opportunity to win access to buy up to 2 tickets to attend the show on Sunday 23rd June 2024.

54, and haven't listened to pop since the 80s so haven't heard any of your music. Not one single song. I am now intrigued enough to think about Spotifying your catalogue. I'm grateful you make so many young folk happy with your work. That matters.

Saw you on Edinburgh, mly daughters love you and your music and I have to admit that I am too💜 Your show was amazing, but 3.5 hours a night is going to take it out of a person, I just hope she is being taken care of on her down days and has a holiday and a break after Eras tour is complete 💜

Winners will be selected at random by 10:00am BST on Wednesday 12th June 2024 and notified by email with details on how to purchase. Tickets available will be Seated P1 and £170.00 plus booking fees.

There are other ways to buy last-minute tickets though. Although official tickets were released and quickly sold out back in July 2023, there are still ways to secure tickets via various resale websites. Platforms like viagogo and Vivid Seats offer fans the chance to snag tickets for Taylor Swift's upcoming gigs for a little over £300.

How to buy Taylor Swift Eras Tour tickets

Taylor Swift fans looking at resale tickets for the upcoming Eras Tour in the UK can purchase them from from a number of online retailers right now.

Sites such as viagogo and Vivid Seats allow fans to buy resale tickets from other fans. However, it is important to note that many event promoters say tickets should not be resold after initial purchase and will not be valid for admittance to gigs.

Fans attending live events with tickets acquired through resale websites are advised to double-check the ticket terms and conditions at the point of sale - such as Ticketmaster or Live Nation - to ensure a smooth live event experience. Tickets could be voided if they were found to be bought second-hand. As a result, fans are buying at their own risk.

With that said, viagogo also commented: “viagogo is a regulated marketplace where fans have the freedom to buy and sell tickets to their favourite live events, safely and securely, backed by a guarantee.”

VIVIDSEATS - Buy Taylor Swift resale tickets right here

SEATGEEK - Buy Taylor Swift resale tickets right here

TICKETMASTER - Buy Taylor Swift resale tickets here

Although the above sellers, including viagogo and Vivid Seats, are not "official" retailers, they do have a number of strict terms and conditions in place to keep ticket buyers and ticket sellers safe.
