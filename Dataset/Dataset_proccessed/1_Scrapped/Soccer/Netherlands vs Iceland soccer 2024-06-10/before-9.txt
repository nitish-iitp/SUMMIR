<image:caption>The new owner will have to repaint the interior, which remains bright pink. Neighbours in the street in Toton, Nottinghamshire, are pleased the house will be occupied once more after being empty for 14 months, but all agree that 'No one will live up to Kathy!'</image:caption>

<image:caption>The house comes with a novel carpeted kitchen. Mrs Platt, who lives with her husband Syd, 95, told MailOnline how her family had reluctantly toned down the luminous landmark.

<image:caption>Always mix old with new. A contemporary lamp from Julian Chichester works well with vintage woven baskets hung as artwork in Ireland’s home. ‘On the table are a Wedgwood box from the late Queen’s coronation, found at Shepton Mallet market; my mother’s glass-etched bowl and a modern coffee mug used as a vase,’ she says.</image:caption>

<image:caption>Love Island viewers were left bewildered after Ronnie Vint (pictured) pulled Harriett Blackmore (pictured) for a very flirty private chat, and later left Jess White fuming with a 'cringe' speech</image:caption>

<image:caption>The semi-professional footballer, 27, didn't hold back from telling the bombshell he is interest in her, calling their sexual chemistry 'crazy' - despite being coupled up with Jess, 25 (pictured)</image:caption>
