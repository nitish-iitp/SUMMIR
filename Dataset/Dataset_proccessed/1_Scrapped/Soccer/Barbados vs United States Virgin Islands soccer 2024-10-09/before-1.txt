DR MOONILAL DEMYSTIFIES BUDGET PROCESS FOR UWI STUDENTS
...AS A SHINING product of the University of the West Indies, St Augustine Campus, stalwart Member of Parliament Dr Roodal Moonilal never shirk dedicating time to return to the lecture room to share his magna cum laude academic learning, vast knowledge and extensive experience to successor generations of tertiary education students at the institution.
So yesterday (Tuesday) bright and early morning, having reached home the previous night after sitting through Monday's five-hour plus budget presentation in Parliament, Dr Moonilal hopped into his vehicle and headed for the St Augustine Campus. He makes it his business to be punctual.
He was invited to deliver a guest lecture to a joint class of UWI students pursuing a Level 3 Course in Public Administration and Public Policy Analysis. 
There he was promptly at 9:00 am in the designated UWI classroom, fully primed and prepared to engage in an interactive knowledge transfer journey with the 30 attendees.
Topic of his lecture: The Role of the House Of Representatives And The Finance Committee in Policy Making With Special Reference To The National Budget.
Dr Moonilal nailed it with a well prepared comprehensive slide presentation and accompanying engaging explanation of the step by step process involved in the annual budget cycle.
The appreciative students could hardly have been happier trickling out of the room after the well-received session, feeling far more empowered with valuable practical knowledge gained.
For Dr Moonilal, Tuesday's entertaining guest lecture was another refreshing opportunity in a continuous process of fulfilling his dharma (duty) and lifelong pledge to educate others. He cherishes interacting with students.
Moreover, he believes he owes that much and more to the younger cohorts as a debt of gratitude to the UWI Campus, which played a mighty pivotal role in his own academic journey.
He congratulated Head of Department and Lecturer in International Relations, Department of Political Science, Dr Indera Rampersad for her excellent work in equipping students to take up the mantle of leadership in the critical area of policy making and international relations.
