I haven't found any threads comparing these 2 yet. Wonder if there just aren't many people who have had time behind the vision pro.

I'm in the market for a new chassis to replace my PRS-TCS. The distance from grip to trigger is just too big for my hands. I'd like to go with chassis over stock for added adjustability also. This will be used for PRS.

At first glance they look very similar. The buttstocks are different and I do like the adjustable bag rider on the vision. Price wise is very similar here in Canada. Vision is 10% more. Not sure its enough to make a difference, but MDT also has a wicked black friday sale that I could have some luck in this year making it a little cheaper. I like how the Vision is ambi, seeing as I'm a lefty, and if I decide to sell it for whatever reason I have a bigger market to sell to. I'll most likely be adding accessories to it as well, like a control bridge or weights.

Wondering what people think about the differences between the 2 and if one was a clear winner (for those who have handled both).

I have a Vision and will be purchasing the Pro soon for another build.

On the Vision I replaced the grip with an MDT Elite because I have little girl size hands and it’s a very adjustable grip. The Pro seems to already have a good vertical grip.

The Pro also has a shorter minimum length of pull though I put Visions latest butt pad hardware on mine (it come with the Pro) and a 1/2” Kickeeze goes right on.

The Vision is very solid, stiff, and dead to recoil. It doesn’t ping or need rubber dampeners.

I also very much like the adjustable bag riders and the easy adjustable LOP and comb.

Also, the Vision is beautifully machined and Gulf Coast Precision who imports and sells them have been super to deal with.

I do not want to speak ill of MDT. They are a great company, I have a number of their products, and they represent on SH. All good. I have not shot an ACC Elite so I have no opinion on it and can’t compare.

My very good friend, @GBMaryland , had an ACC and sold it and replaced it with Vision. Perhaps he will come on here and give a comparison.

I’m sure both are top drawer chassis that would serve you well.

Cheers.

I mean at some point, a competition chassis is a competition chassis. They are more or less identical in terms of features, adjustment, price, add-ons, etc. Hell they even look similar.

Don’t make this more difficult than it needs to be.

Pick the one you like more. Admit it, you do like one more.

I have a vision and it is fantastic. If I were in the market I would buy the vision pro. Lots of little improvements over the original vision.

Having both side by side there are things I like about each, but overall the like the Vision Pro despite some minor niggles.

Vision Pro pros:

Full length bridge that’s cheaper than 3x MDT bridges
7075 series aluminum equivalent
More adjustable magazine fitment
Adjustable bag rider
Available folder
Vision Pro cons:

Must purchase folder if you use a bore guide to clean
Minimum LOP with folder is still more than I’d want
Adjustable mag latch design is more fiddlefucky than MDT and the lock screw is inside the trigger guard

Supposedly not with the Pro though certainly true with the initial model. On the Pro, they extended the groove under the comb to allow you to get a bore guide in straight. The riser for the comb…on both versions, is offset to allow you to slip a guide in but I suppose you may have to take the comb off which is dead simple.

Did you get your pro yet and found it to still be problematic in this regard?

Nah you can get a ROD through there. Definitely not the guides I have though.

When we can get together I’ll bring a couple of bore guides and see if any of them fit.

Well, like I said..either the pic is misleading or the issue is bore guide specific. The pic looks like you can see the entire chamber diameter. May have to take the comb off but that’s trivial and I have to take the comb off and lower the riser on my JAE’s also.

Look forward to seeing it and checking it out.

Yes, I think that was clear. I’d love to see it and try a couple of more standard type guides in it vs the biggest bore guide in the known universe.   

This is of keen interest to me before I order a Pro which is kind of imminent.

Lack of clearance for a guide is my main bitch about the regular 700 Vision and putting a folder on it…and then needing the thinnest Kickeeze pad made in order to reclaim some of the minimum LOP…was quite annoying.

Now per their write up, the Pro has a shorter minimum LOP to start with, may make this a non-issue an a folder is nice to have if it doesn’t cause me LOP issues. But this is the source of my concern and why I’m keen to try to fit a more common type of bore guide and see if it’s a problem.

You running 6.5 CM in it or???

It’s got the 6.5CM action in it right now, but my custom AW mags don’t fit so I might drop the 6GT in it long term since I can use the Gray Ops 6GT mags. Need to buy more plain AWs or see if Gray Ops comes out with a .308 extended AW mag.

Text me and I’ll make some time to come visit you.

Having both and shooting both I really like these two chassis’s. I do slightly prefer the Vision Pro but would be happy with either one of them.

Roger that…we don’t need to do this on the open forum. I’ll get with you tomorrow and see your availability.

Well, it turns out that if you don’t use a PMA bore guide (largest known to mankind lol) a bore guide fits just fine.

First tried this type which is thin. This is a pic from BoreTech but the same item is sold under many other brands



Fit just fine, ran a rod down the bore and it wasn’t touching the bore walls. Nice and smooth.

Then I tried a Delrin guide similar to this and it too fit straight plumb and true. Ran a rod again, no contact



Just thought a little clarification was in order.

P.S. - I found the one I used...it was this one from 21st Century Innovation (was 21st Century Shooting) which is a very nicely made Delrin guide and is a bit sizable itself. Fit fine. I have a few things from John at 21st and I'm quite happy with them. Nice outfit IMO.



Cheers

I suppose I should mention I’m running a CDG with a bolt thickness bore guide so those skinny 0.69x bolt guides might just fit a clonier 700, but the girthy bolt guides won’t fit if they’re long enough to hit the hump in the buttstock.

That's the one I use too, would be quite the oversight by vision to not even be able to fit one of those in to clean

lol..the need to be right is indeed quite a burden.

Yes, we already established your problem was in trying to run your PMA guide is wider and probably longer. Biggest bore guide know to man…I should copy write that. lol

But my Rem 700 Delrin guide in your CDG in my garage fit nice and snug and you saw me run a rod down with zero touching of the bore.

I use the same guide in a Seekins HAVAK and it has a very wide bolt body.

Cheers

Yes, but I still think it looked cocked to me. Might be an illusion because of the hump.

And yes. Hotdogs down hallways, we get it.

Well, in fairness Vision did have an idiotic oversight with their OG butt stock the top of which only had a short groove to facilitate bolt removal. I had to put a folder on to get any guide in the chamber. This was corrected in the Pro by extending that groove. But a folder is nice in any case.

At the time we were trying bore guides on his Pro, we also verified they did reduce the minimum LOP by an inch which makes adding a folder for stumpy short guys like me acceptable.

Cheers

Another minor pro/con depending on whether you’re Satan’s child or not:

Because the chassis is ambidextrous the water line at the rear of the action quite low for bolt handle and safety clearance, which I find visually unappealing.

I'm a spawn of satan. Honestly though, looks aside, I don't know why more chassis aren't ambi. Starting to see more that are. Maybe I feel it's a good thing because I'm a lefty but ambi chassis don't sell as well to righty's as a result of the way they look?

If you go with the MDT Premiere, be sure to get the night vision bridge. The chassis forend has a lot of very noticeable flex in it. They may have resolved this with the Elite, but I don't have one to compare.

I have a premiere setup to be a super heavy chassis for a 300PRC. It feels very similar to my AT-X which is part of why I like it.

Just an update, someone bought my PRS-TCS last night, so I couldn't wait to see if there were any deals to be had with MDT for black friday. Pulled the trigger on a vision pro with the full length forend cover. Should receive it in a week.

I just got my Samson for comparison and I’ll probably sell it to end up with another Vision Pro.
