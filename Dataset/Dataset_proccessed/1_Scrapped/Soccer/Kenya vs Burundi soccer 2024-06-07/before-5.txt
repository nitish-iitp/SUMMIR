Malawi will witness a football feast with three Fifa World Cup qualifying matches scheduled for Lilongwe within six days from this Thursday, June 6, 2024.

The hosts, the Flames, welcome Sao Tome in a Group H duel on Thursday at Bingu National Stadium, a venue visiting Kenya will use the following day to entertain Burundi in a Group F encounter.

The Harambee Stars’ next game will be against reigning African kings, Ivory Coast, at the same Lilongwe venue on June 11, 2024 whereas the Malawians will then be on the road to Malabo for a dance with Equatorial Guinea.

Kenya are unable to play the World Cup qualifiers at home as their stadiums are undergoing major renovations as they prepare to host the 2027 Africa Cup of Nations finals.

Kenya Football Federation has since thanked the Football Association of Malawi for accepting to entertain the Harambee Stars.

“Football Kenya Federation extends its deepest gratitude to the Malawi Football Association, the Malawi people and all stakeholders, including Government officials and fans, for their support and participation in these significant matches,” the federation for Kenya wrote in a statement.

The Harambee Stars arrived in Lilongwe on Sunday, June 2, 2024 at 8:30 am local time whereas Burundi will jet in on Wednesday, June 5, 2024, at 12:50 local time.

Last year, Ethiopia also used the Lilongwe stadium to host Egypt in a qualifier for the Africa Cup of Nations.
