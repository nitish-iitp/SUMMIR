UKRAINE DOMINATES MOLDOVA IN FRIENDLY MATCH IN CHIȘINĂU

11.06.2024 20:59

On June 11, the Ukraine national team played a friendly match in Chișinău against Moldova as part of their preparation for Euro 2024.

Today, the blue-yellow squad conducted a final rehearsal before the upcoming tournament, which starts for them on the 17th. Previously, Serhiy Rebrov's team faced Germany (0:0) and Poland (1:3), and now they traveled to Moldova. Compared to the previous game, only Mykolenko and Sudakov retained their places in the starting lineup.

In just the 2nd minute, our team opened the scoring — Matviyenko headed the ball forward, and Yaremchuk capitalized on a defensive error to score under the crossbar. The Ukrainians continued to dominate, with the next chance falling to Yaremchuk, who failed to beat the goalkeeper in a counter-attack. Later, Roman created an opportunity for Tsygankov, who shot over the target.

In the middle of the first half, Mykolenko suffered an injury and was replaced by Zinchenko. The Ukrainians continued to create chances, with notable attempts from Matviyenko and Shaparenko. In the 43rd minute, our team scored again — Tsygankov finished off a brilliant combination with Sudakov.

At halftime, Yaremchuk was replaced by Dovbyk, who soon found the net after a through pass from Sudakov. Shortly after, Railean made a double save from Mudryk and Konoplia's shots. In the 54th minute, Sudakov played a one-touch pass with Dovbyk and scored Ukraine's fourth goal. The Moldovans responded with a wayward free-kick from Stine.

The game's pace slowed down afterward, and towards the end, the hosts pushed forward. In the 76th minute, Postolachi forced Lunin into action. Kleshchenko missed from a rebound after a set-piece, and later Kaymakov's shot was on target. In injury time, Baboglo missed a chance following a corner. The final score was a 4:0 victory for Ukraine.
