Ukraine will wrap up their Euro 2024 preparations when they travel to Chisinau for Tuesday's friendly with Moldova.

The European Championship participants will be targeting a confidence-boosting win, while the visitors will be looking to clinch a third consecutive victory.

Moldova would have been encouraged by their efforts in qualifying despite failing to secure a first major tournament appearance.

The Tricolours collected 10 points to finish in fourth spot in Group E, representing an improvement from the three points that they picked up in Euro 2020 qualifying.

Moldova will also be pleased with the fact that they have avoided defeat in the three friendlies that have taken place since losing their final qualifier to Czech Republic.

In the March international break, Serghei Clescenco's side played out a 1-1 draw with North Macedonia, before easing to a commanding 4-0 victory over the Cayman Islands.

The Tricolours returned to action with an impressive result in Thursday's game against Cyprus as they fought back from 2-1 down to record a 3-2 victory.

Having built confidence in their last few outings, Moldova will now attempt to spring a surprise and claim their first-ever win over Ukraine.

The visitors are preparing to appear at a third consecutive European Championships after sealing their ticket to Germany via the playoffs.

Ukraine fought back from a goal down to beat Bosnia-Herzegovina in the semi-final stage, before they repeated the feat to record another 2-1 win in the playoff final against Iceland.

Serhiy Rebrov's side returned to action with a hard-fought goalless draw in Monday's away clash against Euro 2024 hosts Germany.

However, any confidence gained from that result may have been quashed by Friday's 3-1 defeat to Poland, with Ukraine conceding three goals inside the opening half-hour in Warsaw.

After losing for the first time since September 2023, the Blue and Yellow will be keen to return to winning ways before they focus their attention on the Euro 2024 group stage, where they will face Romania, Slovakia and Belgium.

Ukraine have won three of their previous five games against Moldova, including a 1-0 win in their most recent meeting in September 2014.

Moldova goalkeeper Dorian Railean could be given the chance to impress after having to watch his country's last two matches from the bench.

Clescenco could be tempted to make a couple of changes to his outfield players, with Victor Mudrac and Oleg Reabciuk pushing for starting spots.

As for the visitors, Andriy Lunin is expected to come into the side after enjoying a successful domestic campaign, having helped Real Madrid win three pieces of silverware.

Rebrov is expected to make several more changes, with the likes of Ilya Zabarnyi, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Mykhaylo Mudryk and Viktor Tsygankov all in contention to start.

After starting Dovbyk against Poland, Rebrov will have to decide whether to his first-choice striker another run out or give Roman Yaremchuk the chance to start Tuesday's friendly.


Moldova possible starting lineup:
Railean; Craciun, Mudrac, Posmac; Reabciuk, Baboglo, Rata, Cojocari; Ionita, Motpan, Nicolaescu

Ukraine possible starting lineup:
Lunin; Konoplya; Zabarnyi, Matviienko, Mykolenko; Malinovsky, Brazhko; Tsygankov, Sudakov, Mudryk; Yaremchuk




We say: Moldova 0-2 Ukraine

Moldova have put together a positive run of results, but we think that their three-game unbeaten run will come to an end when they face a Ukraine side who will be determined to clinch a confidence-boosting victory ahead of Euro 2024.
