How to watch the Friendlies match between Rep. Ireland and New Zealand, as well as kick-off time and team news.

On the back of shambolic defeats, Ireland prepares to host New Zealand in an intriguing International Friendly.

Ireland rounded-off a wretched Euro 2024 qualifying campaign with a defeat against Netherlands as Wout Weghorst's strike in the first half was enough for La Oranje to secure all three points. With just two wins from their eight games, Ireland were met with a disastrous end dumping them out of the competition as they look to wrap up the international break with a victory against New Zealand.

In the year 2023, New Zealand have managed just one victory that came back in March against China and since then the side have been on a run of three defeats and one draw in the calendar year. Back-to-back defeats against Australia and Greece have put the visitors in a spot of bother as they'll be looking to add more misery to a modest Irish outfit.

Here, GOAL brings you everything you need to know about how to watch, including TV channel, streaming details and more.
