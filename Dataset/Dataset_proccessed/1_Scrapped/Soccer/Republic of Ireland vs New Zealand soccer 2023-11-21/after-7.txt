FT: Republic of Ireland 1-1 New Zealand

That's all for tonight on a match of goodbyes for the Republic of Ireland.

James McClean has definitely said farewell, and it certainly seems like Stephen Kenny will follow suit after that emotional interview.

We'll have to wait and see about his future, but he has spoken of his pride at managing his country.

You can read Matt Gault's report from the Aviva Stadium here.

Thanks for joining us and see you soon!

'It's been a privilege'

FT: Republic of Ireland 1-1 New Zealand

Stephen Kenny, speaking to RTE: "There may not be the appetite for that [pleading his case to the FAI] and I respect that. Sport is ruthless and in international management people get impatient, and I understand that.

"You want to qualify for tournaments and I wanted to qualify, so I understand that. We'll have to see, of course. I've just had amazing support from Keith Andrews and John O'Shea and all the staff. It's been an amazing journey. First with the Under-21s and the last three years with the senior team. It's been a privilege."

Stephen Kenny, speaking to RTE: "No, nothing could ever [give him the same pride or satisfaction]. Irish supporters have been incredible, home and away. Full stadiums at home and big crowds have travelled away.

"Because there has been such a rebuild we have had our setbacks, and I know that, but it's amazing to know every single one of those players in the dressing room - they are an incredible group of people.

On if it was an emotional dressing room: "It was, yeah. I'm privilege to get to know and be part of their journey and their international career."

Kenny emotional on his future

An emotional Stephen Kenny, speaking to RTE on not knowing his future: "Listen, that's the way it is and I've no complaints. I've spoken to the players about that. It may well be my last match. I think that's been well documented.

"If it is then so be it. I've had the privilege of managing my country. It's been a huge privilege to see this group grow. When you see the depth of talent in the group I think they are really capable of having a really strong Nations League campaign in Group B."

Stephen Kenny, speaking to RTE: "We made nine changes because we have depth of talent, and that is what we built. We wanted to give everyone an opportunity in a game like this, and that was it. We wanted to win the game but we wanted to utilise the players who have been loyal over the years.

"It was an unusual game to say the least. We missed a couple of really comfortable chances to win but we could have lost it as well. That's the way it was tonight."

Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny, speaking to RTE: "New Zealand played well, to be fair to them, and we didn't play well in the second half. I take responsibility for that. I played Andrew Omobamidele, he's only been playing recently, so players get tired. He's a brilliant player, a great prospect and you can see why Nottingham Forest paid £11 million for him.

"I played players who have been in and out of their club team but they have been part of this journey for the past couple of years. Some players got their debuts tonight."

James McClean, speaking to RTE: "It was special and I've never had a doubt about the support I've got in this stadium. It's been absolutely phenomenal from the moment I stepped onto the pitch in 2012. They've been top class and it's a shame we couldn't end on a win.

"I won't dwell on that. I enjoyed the night for what it was. There was a few special moment made tonight."

If he is content with his decision to retire: "It is over. Like I've said, for whatever reasons I am calling it a day I think it is the right time. I've no regrets. People have been saying I would have been teared up or been emotional or been crying, but I look back on it with so much happiness. There's no need to cry or get emotional. I've lived an absolute dream and loved every minute. I've had the time of my life."

Wales will have to navigate the play-offs in March to reach Euro 2024 after missing out on automatic qualification following a fiery draw at home to Turkey.

Wales needed to beat Group D winners Turkey and hope Croatia dropped points at home to Armenia and, for much of Tuesday night, it seemed like Robert Page's side would fulfil their part of that equation as Neco Williams fired them in front in the seventh minute.

But Croatia's victory over Armenia meant even a Welsh win would not have been enough and, to make matters worse, Turkey equalised midway through the second half thanks to a controversial penalty scored by Yusuf Yazici.

Referee Matej Jug's decision to award the spot-kick was harsh on Wales captain Ben Davies, who barely touched Kenan Yildiz, and the hosts' sense of injustice was particularly intense because of the referee's rejection of three Welsh appeals for penalties in the first half.

Just this style of play just doesn't seem to suit our lads.

There is a way to win games of football and there's ways to lose and I think we don't help ourselves, we don't give ourselves a platform.

It just hasn't been good enough. We were all desperate for Stephen Kenny to mould this Irish team into a footballing team and it just hasn't been able to happen.

We've just banged this drum for so long now and I think again we need to cut our cloth accordingly, and play a much different style of play.

We are coming up against New Zealand who are 103rd ranked in the world and we haven't been able to open them up.

We scored quite a lucky goal and they have looked the better team. We have lost the ball needlessly in the middle of the pitch under very little pressure so, for me, it's pretty much more of the same.

Mikey Johnston, speaking to RTE: "I'm happy to be on the pitch and contributing. I had a bit of fun out there and enjoyed myself. We wanted to get the result but it wasn't meant to be.

"The boys have been amazing. We've probably had the toughest group out of anyone, when you look at it. We've had France, the Netherlands and Greece are no mugs either. We knew we had to win games and we didn't but I think there are so many positives to take from this group."

'Really poor effort from Ireland tonight'

Pat Fenlon
Speaking on RTE Radio 1 Extra

A poor performance all round, from start to finish.

What can we say? We have seen this all before and again, it's just been devoid of a real shape and a way of play. To not to create too many chances against New Zealand at home is poor fare.

To be fair to them, New Zealand were the better side, they probably should have won the game. They had enough chances in the second half and Travers made a couple of good saves.

Really poor effort from Ireland tonight.
