Egypt host Cape Verde on Friday

Egypt welcome Cape Verde to the Cairo International Stadium for a 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on Friday. The home side have not been in action since sharing the spoils in a 1-1 draw away to Guinea Bissau in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier in June 2024.

They went behind to Mama Balde's 42nd-minute strike but drew level through Mohamed Salah's 70th-minute equalizer.

Cape Verde, meanwhile, claimed maximum points with a 1-0 home win over Libya in a World Cup qualifier in June. Diney Borges' 10th-minute strike proved to be the difference between the two sides.

The Blue Sharks will turn their focus to the start of their quest to qualify for the 2025 AFCON in Morocco. They have been drawn in Group C of the qualifiers alongside Mauritania, Bostwana and Egypt.

Egypt have made a bright start to their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign and hold a four-point advantage in their quest to make it to the Mundial. The Pharaohs will be keen to keep this fine form going as they kick-start their sojourn to make it on the plane to neighboring Morocco next year.

Cape Verde have made a massive leap in African football over the last decade and held their own in the sole meeting between the two sides.

Egypt's games tend to be high-scoring. We are backing the home side to claim a narrow win with goals at both ends.
