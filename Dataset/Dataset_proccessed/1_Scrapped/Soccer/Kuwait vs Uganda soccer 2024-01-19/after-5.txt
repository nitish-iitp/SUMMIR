Match Preview: Kuwait vs Uganda Cranes
Practice Match
Kuwait vs Uganda – 7 PM

The Uganda Cranes will lock horns with Kuwait in an International Friendly game that will be played at Cairo International Stadium in Egypt.

The Cranes' 22-man squad in Egypt is made up of only local-based players who will have the assignment to upset the Kuwait side.

Uganda goes into this game with the upper hand since they are 44 places above Kuwait who are ranked 136th according to FIFA.

In an interview with the Daily Monitor, Bright Stars forward Nelson Senkatuka revealed that Paul Put has made it clear that he wants them to play a certain way.

“He wants us to press high, to use the ball more and keep possession,” Senkatuka noted.

“The Coach will do well, we just have to trust the process and allow him to do his job,” he added.

The only time Uganda played Kuwait was back in 1989 Islamic Peace Cup and the game ended in a one-all draw.

The game will give a chance to the local-based players to prove Paul Put how good they are ahead of the World Cup Qualifiers and CHAN preparations that will be held later this year.
