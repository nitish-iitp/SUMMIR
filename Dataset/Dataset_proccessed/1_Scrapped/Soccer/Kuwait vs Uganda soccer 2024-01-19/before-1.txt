WHAT HAPPENED?

The former Liverpool captain, who joined ex-Reds star Steven Gerrard in the Middle East after completing a £12 million ($15m) move during the summer of 2023, is reportedly looking for a way out of Saudi Arabia a matter of months after accepting a new challenge.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

His family are said to have found it difficult adjusting to life outside of Europe, leading Henderson to make a push for the exits. According to the Daily Mail, Al-Ettifaq have no intention of bowing to those demands before the January window closes.

DID YOU KNOW?

Ajax have confirmed that they would be keen on taking Henderson, with the Eredivisie club’s interim boss John van’t Schip telling reporters: “I can confirm the club and Henderson are talking. He has to deal with his club now.” Serie A giants Juventus have also been credited with interest.

WHAT NEXT FOR HENDERSON?

Al-Ettifaq are reluctant to sanction a loan move as they would still need to cover part of Henderson’s lucrative contract, and there is no chance of that deal being ripped up. With that in mind, the England international may have to stay put until at least the summer.
