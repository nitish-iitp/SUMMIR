Spain will compete in the first of two Euro 2024 warm-up matches when they face neighbours Andorra in Wednesday's friendly at Estadio Municipal Nuevo Vivero.

La Roja are looking to claim their first win of the calendar year, while their opponents will have their work cut out to make the scoreline a respectable one.

Luis de la Fuente is preparing to take charge of his first major international tournament after replacing Luis Enrique following Spain's last-16 exit at the 2022 World Cup.

The 62-year-old can be pleased with his efforts so far, having seen his side clinch the 2022-23 UEFA Nations League trophy and secure Euro 2024 qualification with seven wins and just one defeat.

La Roja will be dreaming of replicating the sort of success that saw them win back-to-back European Championships in 2008 and 2012, but before they can start looking too far ahead, Spain will have to progress from a tricky group which contains Italy, Croatia and Albania.

Prior to their tournament opener against Croatia, Spain will compete in a couple of friendlies, facing Andorra in Badajoz before travelling to Mallorca for Saturday's clash with Northern Ireland.

They will be looking to build up a head of steam after their eight-game unbeaten run was ended by March's 1-0 defeat to Colombia.

Spain then went on to play out a thrilling 3-3 draw with Brazil at the Santiago Bernabeu, leaving them at risk of going three consecutive games without a win for the first time since the 2022 World Cup.

In contrast to their heavyweight opponents, Andorra endured a disappointing qualifying campaign, finishing bottom of Group I after mustering just two points from 10 matches.

The Tricolors returned to action in March as they played out a 1-1 draw with South Africa before being edged out in a close-fought encounter against Bolivia.

Although they were competitive in those two fixtures, Andorra have gone 15 matches since they recorded their most recent win in a UEFA Nations League game against Liechtenstein in September 2022.

Even the most ardent of Andorran supporters will be aware that their chances of ending their wait for a win in their second-ever meeting with Spain are all but zero.

However, they hope to make it a closer scoreline than the 4-0 defeat that they suffered in their only previous head-to-head meeting in June 2006.

Having named a preliminary 29-man squad for Euro 2024, De la Fuente is likely to name an experimental XI for Wednesday's contest.

The Spain boss could present Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya with the chance to make his fifth international appearance, while there may be places in the backline for Jesus Navas, Pau Cubarsi, Robin Le Normand and Marc Cucurella.

Barcelona's Fermin Lopez and Real Betis' Ayoze Perez are also in line to make their international debuts against Andorra.

Aymeric Laporte is set to be on the bench following his late arrival from Saudi Arabia, while it remains to be seen whether Nacho, Dani Carvajal or Joselu will have a role to play after helping Real Madrid win the Champions League on Saturday.

As for Andorra, Berto Rosas, Marc Vales and Iker Alvarez have returned to the setup after being absent in the March international window.

Vales is expected to feature in a back five alongside Moises San Nicolas, Max Llovera, Christian Garcia and Joan Cervos.

The lonely task of leading the Andorran line could fall to Cucu, who scored on his most recent international start against South Africa earlier this year.


Spain possible starting lineup:
Raya; Navas, Cubarsi, Le Normand, Cucurella; Rodri, Zubimendi; Oyarzabal, Fermin, Ferran; Perez

Andorra possible starting lineup:
Alvarez; San Nicolas, Llovera, Vales, Garcia, Cervos; Alaez, Guillen, Vales, Pujol; Cucu



We say: Spain 4-0 Andorra

Although De la Fuente could leave a number of regular starts on the bench, we still believe that Spain will showcase their supreme quality advantage to ease to a routine victory over the nation ranked 125th in the FIFA World Rankings.
