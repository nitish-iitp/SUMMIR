CHEYENNE — The top-ranked Cheyenne Central boys soccer team remained perfect on the young season, picking up a 3-0 shutout win over crosstown rival Cheyenne East on Wednesday afternoon at Riske Field.

After a rocky start, the Indians scored three goals in a 12-minute span to take control of the game. It proved to be enough of a cushion to secure the win.
