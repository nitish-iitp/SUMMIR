Copa America Quarterfinal Predictions

Argentina vs. Ecuador: This is the opening quarterfinal. Argentina will be without Lionel Messi due to injury, but they still boast a strong attack. Ecuador will be aiming to exploit this and cause an upset. Although they might miss Messi, their overall squad depth should see them through.

Prediction: Argentina wins 2-0.

Venezuela vs. Canada: An intriguing matchup between an underdog Venezuela and a well-drilled Canadian team. This could be a David vs Goliath battle with Canada favored but Venezuela determined to prove themselves. Canada’s experience and organization might be too much for Venezuela.
