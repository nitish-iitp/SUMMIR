The Copa América quarter finals are set to start this week at the same time as the EURO 2024. Argentina will face Ecuador, an undefeated Venezuela plays Canada, a strong Uruguayan team meets a struggling Brazil, and Colombia looks to beat their Panamanian neighbors. If you're looking to stream the Copa América with a subscription, there are plenty of options for you to choose from. However, if you want to watch the matches without signing up for a standalone streaming service, a VPN is a good alternative—but it won't be totally free, either.

To watch the upcoming Copa América games using a VPN, head over to Sportitalia, which is streaming all of the Copa América matches in Italy. Yes, you might not be physically in Italy, but that's where a VPN comes into play. Express VPN is our favorite VPN for bypassing geo-blocking restrictions. It will run you $12.95 per month, $9.99 per month for six months, or an annual plan for $8.32 per month. VPNs are useful beyond just streaming these matches, so you may find that a month or two of the subscription price is worth it—if not, don't forget to set yourself a reminder to cancel before you're charged more than you expected.

Once you have ExpressVPN, open the app and go to Sportitalia on the same device (you'll probably need your browser to translate to English unless you speak Italian), and you'll be able to watch the Copa América matches there.
