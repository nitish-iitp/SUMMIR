Argentina continue the defence of their Copa America crown when they face Ecuador in a quarter-final clash at the NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.

The reigning champions have enjoyed a perfect start to the tournament, progressing from the group stage with a 100 per cent record and three clean sheets to boot.

Lautaro Martinez has emerged as Argentina's main man in the USA, with the Inter forward scoring four of their five goals, including a brace in their 2-0 defeat of Peru last week.

Selección head coach Lionel Scaloni was able to rest the likes of Lionel Messi and Alexis Mac Allister for that match so he should have a fresh squad ready to tackle the knockout rounds.

Ecuador, who scraped through to the last eight on goal difference after collecting four points from their three games, face an uphill task to progress to the semi-finals as they have not beaten Argentina in their last seven meetings.

RadioTimes.com has rounded up everything you need to know about how to watch Argentina v Ecuador on TV and online.
