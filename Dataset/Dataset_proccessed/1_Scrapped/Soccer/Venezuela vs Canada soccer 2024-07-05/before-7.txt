What? No extra time if level after 90?  Is this U12 football tournament rules?

There will be a good showing of Venezuelan fans for this game, if today's match in Austin was any indication:

They're okay.  But they are beatable.  

This is very much a winnable game for us.

Please work on penalties this week boys. I hate going out that way.

Also feel kind of bad for Piete. One of our most capped players of all time, gets minutes in friendlies, qualifiers,etc.. but has never gotten a minute in either of 2 major tournaments. To be honest was a bit surprised he didn't replace Osorio in stoppage time when Miller came on last game.

Piette and some others will get minutes when we are up 7-0 late against Argentina in the semis.

WHAT, AIR-CONDITIONING??? 

...you mean, Dallas can deliver on what Qatar only deceptively promised? Texas is the promised land for 2026 final?

Yes, good point, but there is going to have to be a better reason (in his mind) for Marsch to bring him on.

If no extra-time, this will be unlikely. I just explained this to my Argentine friends here who forgot about the Copa rules with that particular event that happened in late 2022.  I am going to go to a bar here in Mendoza on Thursday just to look at the confused looks on people's faces after the 90+ for immediate penalties if it is a draw.

Yes because the game could go into penalties and in a penalty shootout it could go either way. I just hope and pray it doesn't come to that.

Qatar had air conditioned stadiums. Maybe even too chilly.

Those were open-air that were "air-conditioned" temporarily. This is an indoor NFL stadium that's been operational for quite a while.

I love that we get to play in Dallas especially at AT & T Stadium at Jerry World because out of all the stadiums 🏟 in this Copa America, AT & T is by far the best atmosphere to play in

Not to beat a dead horse, but...that there is no water slide chute. That one is at Lusail pitch side, but they all had something similar. The stadium seating A/C was certainly a mixed bag.

The stadiums in Qatar were freezing at night.  The AC vents were underneath the seats.

Texas also has that town that breaks the record for amputees due to gout.

Must be a bummer not to be able to show your kids how to walk in quicksand.
