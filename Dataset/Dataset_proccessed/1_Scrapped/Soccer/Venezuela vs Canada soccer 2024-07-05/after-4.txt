Another day of the Copa América knockout round ended with another penalty shootout.

Canada and Venezuela went into the end of stoppage time even at one goal apiece, meaning the match had to be decided by penalties a day after a penalty shootout thriller between Argentina and Ecuador.

Ultimately, Canada came out on top to continue a successful first appearance at Copa América.

After the win, here's a look at the updated bracket, a recap of the match and the upcoming schedule.

Canada was knocking on the door very early in the first half, and it finally found the game's first goal in the 12th minute after a perfectly placed cross found Jacob Shaffelburg, who put it in the net from a few feet out.
