Manchester United will be represented on the senior international stage by 15 players this month.

Several of Erik ten Hag’s players are involved in international qualification matches for the UEFA Nations League.

World Cup qualifiers, for the 2026 edition of the tournament, are taking place in South America, while Africa Cup of Nations qualifying is also under way.

Goalkeepers Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana have been called up by Turkey and Cameroon respectively, with the former not needing to travel far for the opening game of the campaign, against a Wales side now managed by Craig Bellamy.

Onana will help his nation kickstart their AFCON qualification campaign under experienced coach Marc Brys, who took charge of his first matches in June earlier this year.

Also set for AFCON qualification action is summer signing Noussair Mazraoui, who has been selected for Morocco, and Amad, with the in-form winger earning a recall to Ivory Coast’s squad.

Fellow new additions Matthijs de Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee are in the Netherlands squad, whose schedule includes a high-profile meeting with Germany.

We have double representation in a further three international squads, with Harry Maguire and Kobbie Mainoo selected by interim England boss Lee Carsley for games against Republic of Ireland and Finland.

Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot are in the Portugal squad, as they face Scotland and former team-mate Scott McTominay, while Alejandro Garnacho and Lisandro Martinez will be in action for Argentina.

Reds fans will also have chance to see Manuel Ugarte play for the first time since his move from PSG was confirmed, as he is in Marcelo Bielsa’s squad for qualifiers against Paraguay and Venezuela.

Argentina and Uruguay are currently first and second in the South American standings, with six of 18 games played and the top six sides automatically qualifying for the next World Cup, which is being played across the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Young midfielder James Scanlon will be aiming to add to his Gibraltar caps tally, when they take on Andorra and Liechtenstein.
