The team is eager to end a prolonged winless streak that has plagued their 2024 season. Gibraltar's most recent result was a historic 0-0 draw with Wales in a friendly held in Portugal, halting a 13-match losing streak. Despite this positive development, Gibraltar's last goal came in November 2022 against Andorra, highlighting their ongoing struggle to find the back of the net. Having finished rock-bottom of their Euro 2024 qualifying group and relegated from League C of the Nations League, Gibraltar is looking to the upcoming League D fixtures against Liechtenstein and San Marino to secure much-needed victories. This friendly offers a vital opportunity for Gibraltar to build confidence and aim for a long-awaited win.




In contrast, Andorra is also in search of a morale-boosting result as they prepare for the new Nations League season. The Tricolors have had a challenging year, with their last win dating back nearly two years to a match against Liechtenstein. Recent friendlies saw Andorra suffer defeats to Northern Ireland and Spain, conceding a total of seven goals without scoring. They finished at the bottom of their Euro 2024 qualifying group, with only two points from ten games, and were unable to escape relegation from League D in the last Nations League campaign. Under the guidance of former goalkeeper Koldo Alvarez, Andorra’s squad is eager to turn their fortunes around. Facing Gibraltar, who are ranked 34 places below them in FIFA’s world rankings, presents a prime opportunity for Andorra to break their winless run and gain momentum heading into the new Nations League campaign.
