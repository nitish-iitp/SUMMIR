Lebanon square off against Tajikistan in an international friendly at the Bukit Jalil Stadium in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday.

The two teams are competing along with Malaysia and the Philippines in the 43rd edition of the Merdeka Tournament - a quadrennial friendly tournament held in Malaysia to commemorate their Independence Day.

We say: Lebanon 1-2 Tajikistan

There is little to separate these two nations and a closely-fought contest is set to be played out in Kuala Lumpur, but we are backing Tajikistan to edge this one as they did in their previous meeting seven months ago.

Both looking to sharpen their tools ahead of ASEAN Championship action in December, Malaysia and the Philippines will clash at Bukit Jalil National Stadium for a friendly match on Wednesday night.

The Harimau Malaya suffered the disappointment of missing out on the next stage of World Cup qualification this year, and the same can be said for the Azkals.

We say: Malaysia 2-0 Philippines

Boasting a better record in 2024 and home advantage, Malaysia should be confident of recording a friendly success over the Philippines on Wednesday night.

As was the case with their most recent victory over Chinese Taipei in June, we are expecting Harimau Malaya to win this contest by two clear goals.

Gibraltar vs. Andorra (Wednesday, 5.00pm)

In preparation for upcoming UEFA Nations League campaigns, Gibraltar and Andorra meet for a friendly fixture on Wednesday evening.

Both sides are still seeking their first win of 2024, and their encounter at Europa Sports Park offers a rare chance to taste success.

We say: Gibraltar 0-1 Andorra

After a defeat and a draw in two previous meetings, Andorra can record their first win over Gibraltar. While neither side is accustomed to scoring, the Tricolors' defence is less leaky than their hosts', which may make the difference.
