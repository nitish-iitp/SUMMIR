Gibraltar meet Andorra in a friendly

Gibraltar will invite Andorra to Europa Sports Park in an international friendly on Wednesday. Both teams will begin their UEFA Nations League campaign later this month and will take this match as an opportunity to warm up for the same.

The hosts have endured a 14-game winless run in all competitions and have failed to score in these games as well. Interestingly, their last win across all competitions was registered against The Tricolours in a friendly in 2022. Los Llanis last played Wales in a friendly in June, which ended in a goalless draw.

The visitors are winless in their last 17 games in all competitions. They have suffered losses in three of their four friendlies in 2024 and in their previous outing, they lost 2-0 to Northern Ireland.

Gibraltar vs Andorra Prediction

Los Llanis saw their losing streak ended after 13 games in June as they played out a goalless draw against Wales in a friendly. Nonetheless, they were unable to break their goalscoring drought and will hope to return to goalscoring ways here. Julio César Ribas has named a 23-man squad for this match, headlined by Liam Walker, who is the country's most-capped player.

Tricolors have scored just once in four friendlies this year and will look to improve upon that record. Koldo Álvarez has also called up 23 players for this match. They have failed to score in their two meetings against the home team, which is a cause for concern.

Considering the current form of the two teams and goalscoring struggles, a goalless draw will likely ensue.

Prediction: Gibraltar 0-0 Andorra
