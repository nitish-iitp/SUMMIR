West Indies won the toss and decided to field against fellow tournament co-hosts United States in their Group 2 match of the Super Eight in the ICC Men’s Twenty20 World Cup tonight at Kensington Oval.

Both teams have made two changes to their line-up with Shai Hope and left-arm pacer Obed McCoy, replacing injured Brandon King and Romario Shepherd for the Caribbean side, and Milind Kumar and Shadley van Schalkwyk, replacing Shayan Jahangir and Jasdeep Singh for the Americans.

Both teams lost their opening match in the Super Eight – South Africa beat the United States by 18 runs on Tuesday at the Vivian Richards Cricket Ground in Antigua, on the same day that England beat West Indies by eight wickets at the Daren Sammy Cricket Ground in St Lucia.

It is the first time that West Indies and the United States will meet in a T20I International.

Teams:

WEST INDIES: Rovman Powell (captain), Johnson Charles, Shai Hope, Nicholas Pooran (wicketkeeper), Roston Chase, Sherfane Rutherford, Andre Russell, Akeal Hosein, Alzarri Joseph, Gudakesh Motie, Obed McCoy.

Coconut Water

How do you feel about the recent price increase in coconut water?

Understandable given rising costs.

Disappointing but expected.

Unreasonable and too expensive.

I don't buy coconut water from vendors.
