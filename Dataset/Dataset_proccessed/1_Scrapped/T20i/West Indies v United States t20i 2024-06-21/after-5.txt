Despite losing the wicket of Johnson Charles for 15, West Indies chased down the target in just 10.5 overs. Hope smashed 82 runs off 39 balls while Nicholas Pooran scored 27 runs. For USA, Harmeet Singh scalped the only wicket. Earlier in the match, Roston Chase and Andre Rusell scalped three wickets each as West Indies bundled out USA for 128. (Scorecard | Points Table)

Right then, that is it from this one-sided affair where West Indies thrashed the USA to stay alive in the World Cup. Next up, it is another big clash as two Asian rivals, India and Bangladesh go against each other. That will begin at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT), but as you know, you can always join us early for all the build-up. Until then, cheers and goodbye!

Shares that South Africa should be a very good game. Ends by adding that it’s special to play cricket in Barbados as the fans always turn up to support them.

!

Aaron Jones, the captain of the USA says that it was a tough game for them. Adds that they thought 170-180 would have been a good score against West Indies. Mentions that losing wickets in the middle overs didn't help them and while defending, they tried to pick up early wickets but it didn't happen. Says that they will reflect on this and then come back stronger in the next match against England and reckons that will be a good game. Ends by saying that the fans have been fantastic, and it was good to see a lot of support for them here.

Presentation Time...

!

Not much to say about the bowling effort of the USA as they have taken a pelting at the hands of the home team here. Harmeet Singh picked up the only wicket that fell, but they did not have any answer to the onslaught from Shai Hope who smashed it all around the park. Earlier in the game, the USA posted a below-par score. Andries Gous top-scored with 29 while a few batters chipped in with some cameos. Roston Chase and Andre Russell both picked up three wickets each while Alzarri Joseph got two and Gudakesh Motie chipped in with one as well.

!

West Indies knew that they not only needed to win but also to chase this down quickly to improve their NRR. Johnson Charles struggled once again but Shai Hope was absolutely superb in the Powerplay and made sure that they fully utilized the field restrictions. He registered one of the fastest fifties in this World Cup, but Charles holed out trying to up the ante. Nicholas Pooran joined in and continued to attack as they didn't really have any other option. Both of them went hammer and tons and finished the game off in a blink of an eye. Hope remained unbeaten on 82 off just 39 balls and fittingly hit the winning runs as they chased this total down with just over 9 overs left.

!

WEST INDIES KEEPS THEIR WORLD CUP HOPES ALIVE! They have done it in some style as well thrashing the USA here in Barbados. The fans have got their money's worth to see their home team perform in this manner. The Windies have also improved their NRR above South Africa which boosts their chances further given that they beat the Proteas in the next game.

SIX! BOOM! Shai Hope finishes it in the most emphatic fashion! Pitched full, around off. Hope clears the front leg and pumps it over long-off for a maximum. West Indies have chased this down inside 11 overs with 9 wickets in hand. A thumping win for the Men in Maroon.

FOUR! THUMPED! Pitched full and in the slot on off. Pooran tonks it back over the bowler for a crunching boundary.

Drinks! It is a matter of time now before West Indies finishes this game. They have done extremely well to get to this position and this will boost their NRR massively. USA needs something miraculous to happen to get back in this game and it looks like their hopes of making it to the semis have faded away. Also, Saurabh Netravalkar to bowl after the break.
