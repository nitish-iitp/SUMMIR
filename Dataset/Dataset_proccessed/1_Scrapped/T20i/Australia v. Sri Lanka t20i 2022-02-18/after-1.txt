Adam Gilchrist believes Justin Langer would be the right man to take over as England’s head coach after his ugly divorce with Cricket Australia earlier this month.

Langer was eager to stay on-board long-term having won the Ashes and men’s T20 World Cup while bending to the demands of players to be more hands-off.

Nonetheless, he was still only offered a six-month renewal, which he turned down.

Gilchrist called labelled the saga as “pathetic” while Shane Warne said it was an “absolute disgrace” as players sought a coach with a more collaborative and calm approach.

Langer’s exit coincided with mass changes within the England set-up with coach Chris Silverwood given his marching orders after the summer’s heavy 4-0 Ashes loss.

Speaking Barmy Army podcast The Shackles Are Off, Australia legend Gilchrist backed former teammate Langer to take over the role, but only when the time is right.

“I get the feeling that doing it straight away... it just might be a bit soon,” Gilchrist told the podcast. “He’s been hurt — you don’t need to be Einstein to work that out.

“I don’t think he’s going to be short of opportunities, so he needs to work that out.

“I don’t say this in a provocative sense, but I do look at the set up at the moment with England and think, ‘geez he would be a good fit’.”

Gilchrist said it would be “awesome” to see Langer working with Ben Stokes, who he says has a similar work ethic to Langer.

He added: “It would be intriguing to see what could grow and develop and sprout from that.

“And Joe (Root) as captain I think would benefit from a figure like Justin alongside him.’

Langer is one of the names under consideration by the ECB to take over from Silverwood.

Interim managing director Andrew Strauss confirmed earlier this month that Langer was in contention.

“I know him well,” Strauss said. “On the surface, he’s done a very good job of things with the Australian cricket team. So I wouldn’t rule him out.”
