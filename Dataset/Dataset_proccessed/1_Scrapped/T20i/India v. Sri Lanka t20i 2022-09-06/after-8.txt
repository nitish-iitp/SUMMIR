India vs Sri Lanka (IND vs SL) T20 Asia Cup 2022 Highlights: The 9th match of Asia Cup 2022 saw a face-off between Team India and Team Sri Lanka at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. The third match of the Super 4 stage that began at 7.30 pm IST saw India’s Super Four campaign ending with big victory by Sri Lanka.

While Sri Lanka might be in high spirits after defeating Afghanistan in their last match, Team India will be entering the grounds after losing the last game against Pakistan. In the nail-biting match on Sunday, Pakistan won by five wickets and avenged their defeat against India in the first group game.

After a poor start, Team Sri Lanka showed its might in the following matches. It successfully chased two massive totals – 184 in the group game against Bangladesh and 176 in their first Super 4 match against Afghanistan. On the other hand, Team India started off well after registering a win against Pakistan in their group match and then defeating Hong Hong in the second game. Its last match against Pakistan did not go very well for them and the team lost its first Super 4 match.

India vs Sri Lanka Asia Cup 2022 match pitch report:

The Dubai International Cricket Stadium’s pitch is of little to no assistance for the spinners. However, it acts well for seam bowlers in the early half of the game and provides adequate bounce. Owing to the short straight boundaries, batsmen do make the most of it.
