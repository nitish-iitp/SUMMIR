Madushanka was pumped up along with the other Lankan players. He bowled a fullish delivery that swung into the middle and Virat Kohli went for the big heave across the line but missed it completely. The ball went on to shatter the stumps and this was a big blow to India.

This was Virat Kohli's first failure in the ongoing Asia Cup as the star batter had scored two successive fifties in the T20 tournament before the Sri Lanka game. Fans were certainly not impressed after Kohli fell for a four-ball duck.

Kohli was the second Indian batter to depart after KL Rahul failed to get going against the Sri Lankan bowlers after Dasun Shanaka won the toss and opted to bowl first against India in their Asia Cup Super 4 match on Tuesday.

Rahul departed cheaply once again after getting trapped plumb in the front by spinner Maheesh Theekshana on Tuesday, 6 September. India were pushed back early in the game by Sri Lanka's bowling attack, who hit with two quick wickets inside the powerplay. There were no changes for Sri Lanka, while India made one change, bringing in R Ashwin in place of Ravi Bishnoi.

Teams:
India: Rohit Sharma (c), KL Rahul, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant (w), Deepak Hooda, Hardik Pandya, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh.

Sri Lanka: Dasun Shanaka (c), Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis (w), Charith Asalanka, Danushka Gunathilaka, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Wanindu Hasaranga, Chamika Karunaratne, Maheesh Theekshana, Asitha Fernando, Dilshan Madushanka.
