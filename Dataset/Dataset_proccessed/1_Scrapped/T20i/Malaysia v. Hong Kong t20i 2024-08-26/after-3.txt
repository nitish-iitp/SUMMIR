Saracens confirm Owen Farrell successor who will ‘lead this club into its next chapter’

Maro Itoje is unveiled as Saracens' new club captain.

Saracens have announced that England international Maro Itoje will be their new club captain for the 2024/25 season as he takes over the coveted job from Owen Farrell.

The second-row is handed the honour and is a popular appointment after impressing for the team ever since he made his debut in 2013 and before that in the academy.

Itoje recently inked a new long-term contract at StoneX Stadium and he will lead the club on and off the field following the recent departure of star Farrell to Racing 92.

84 England caps

The 29-year-old already has 181 Saracens appearances to his name and will no doubt hit the double century in the near future, with his time in black being very successful.

Making his Sarries bow aged 19, Itoje has gone on to claim an LV= Cup success, the Premiership five times and the Champions Cup three times during his playing career.

He was also named 2016 European Player of the Year and is a three-time World Rugby Player of the Year nominee, with 84 caps for England and two tours for the Lions.

“I am extremely humbled and honoured to be asked to captain this special club. I have been here since I was 14 and it has been an amazing journey,” said a thrilled Itoje.

“I love this club and I feel that we are in a very exciting place with the talent and the people here, the energy we have and the direction we are going.

“The great thing about team sports is I won’t be doing it alone, we have lots of leaders in this group and together we can create something really special.”

Director of rugby Mark McCall is delighted to have Itoje as skipper and is looking forward to working more closely with a player he feels has “Saracens in his DNA”.

“You don’t come across many people like Maro. From his early days in our academy, at 14 years old, we all knew we were witnessing the development of someone special,” he said.

Will Saracens win the Premiership next season?
Yes
No

“He is the epitome of a Saracens player: fiercely dedicated to his craft, kind and compassionate to his teammates, and diligent in pursuing his education and charity work away from the field. He has always led by example.

“Maro has Saracens in his DNA, and we are delighted he will captain the team and lead this club into its next chapter.”

Saracens kick off their Premiership season with a trip to Gloucester on September 21.
