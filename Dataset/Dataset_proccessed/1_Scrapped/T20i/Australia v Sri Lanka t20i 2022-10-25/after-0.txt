In Short
Stoinis scored the fastest ever T20I fifty by an Australian
The Australian all-rounder brought up his fifty in just 17 balls
Australia boosted their NRR by chasing down Sri Lanka's 158 run target in 16.3 overs

Marcus Stoinis brought Australia's T20 World Cup campaign back on track with a thundering half century against Sri Lanka on Tuesday, 25 October. Stoinis broke the record of the fastest-fifty scored by an Australian, surpassing David Warner's 18-ball innings. Stoinis brought up his record in just 17 balls against Sri Lanka in the Super-12 stage of T20 World Cup. The Perth-born gave Australia a much needed breather in their T20 World Cup campaign where the defending champions sinked to a 89-run defeat against New Zealand in their opener.

Stoinis, who came into the tournament not scoring a lot of runs said that he was quite nervous during the 158-run chase because a lot of his family and friends stayed here.

"Once I got in, the plan was to keep going. To be honest, I was really nervous today being at home in Perth, lot of family and friends here. So, I was really nervous going into it, but really happy that we ended up putting up a clinic there," the all-rounder said.

Stoinis' blitz came at a time when Australia were really struggling. Captain Finch had not timed a single ball and Glenn Maxwell had departed after playing a 12-ball cameo. Stoinis said that the wicket was very good and he had felt fresh after coming in from a short break right ahead of the T20 World Cup. The all-rounder was selected as the man of the match for his 59* off 18 balls.

"Mentally I was nice and fresh having some time off with this side strain, it's been sort of plaguing me on and off for a while now, but so far so good. We played here the other day against England and it was a beautiful wicket. This did look like it was doing a bit more especially with the new ball, but it's a beautiful ground and probably the best ground in Australia if not the world with the technology and lighting going on here and my home crowd, it's a beautiful wicket. We wrapped this game up and look forward to playing England at the MCG (on Friday). They are obviously a very good team, so we will do our homework again, rest up get on the flight tomorrow go on from there," Stoinis concluded in the post match presentation.
