COMMENT BY WI PRESIDENT RICKY SKERRITT
ON THE POOR RESULTS OF THE WEST INDIES TEAM
AT THE 2022 WORLD CUP
"I am deeply disappointed with the performance results of our team in Australia and I appreciate the sense of utter frustration that is being experienced by many. The ongoing inability of our batsmen to prevail over opposing slow bowling continued to be an obvious weakness in Australia, and untimely shot selections seem to be deeply embedded in the T20 batting culture of our senior team.
However, I want to assure stakeholders that a thorough postmortem will be carried out on all aspects of our World Cup preparation and performance, and that solutions will be found in keeping with WI's strategy to improve the quality and sustainability of cricket on all fronts, and in all formats.
West Indies cricket is bigger than any one individual or event, and continues to need the input and support of all stakeholders.

He should have been gone months ago

 
brians_da_best 2022-10-21 16:12:19 

We have a tour to australia starting in not too long. In very curious to see what remedial action is planned

 
Narper 2022-10-21 16:14:56 

Let him just shut his skunt up or resign

It will be business as usual

CWI is a private entity.

Lemme tell Skeritt in pellucid terms: "at this point in time, your neck is not worth saving."

This was a total disaster and all heads responsible for this fiasco must be on the chopping block.

Enough is enough.

 
azadtnt 2022-10-21 16:22:48 

CWI don't have the guts, courage, funding, and the willpower to do anything. It's the same old status quo and words to put a bandaid over the current situation.

 
brians_da_best 2022-10-21 16:24:51 

These comments are even more annoying. And make me even more angry

 
carl0002 2022-10-21 16:56:04 

He should have finished with ...

..and I hereby resign, effective immediately, along with the stupid Directors that brought me here to destroy Dave's legacy. They should have known better. I am also taking Simmons with me, as he has done nothing but sleep and get fat on the job.


Regards,

Ricky Skerrit

Yes

No need for post mortem, from the selected players, many predicted this outcome, as selectors appear to have conceded the tournament, long before it even started with the omission of Allen, Russell and Hetymeyer, regardless of off-field it problems, then they left out Cotterell from the team that played Ireland, and could not buy a wicket, that’s not playing to our strength.

Hetmeyer refused selection. Missed his flight twice. What else is needed to think that the man didn't want any part of the world cup.
Got to say I admire the man though. If its one thing the former premadonnas realized was that, no matter what you been doing over the last 4 years, when it come on to worldcup, thats the time to reconcile and come back into the fold. Then you fake some made up controversy after the WC and disappear for the next 4, or 2 years towards the latter part of the premaddonna age.

But Hetmeyer... no sah, WC don't phase him at all. WC money is good money and not even that phase Hetmeyer.

As for Russell, the less said the better.

Dumb fact along with his supporters. Supporters not dumb just gullible. For the life of me I cannot see what they saw in the retard dotish incompetent Skeritt and his motley crew. They are pathetic. RIP WI cricket under their watch.

Let the Gnashing of teeth begin.

 
jnaveen 2022-10-21 21:04:38 

They should hire Lara as batting coach. Who better to teach how to play spin than Lara?

 
powen001 2022-10-21 21:11:01 

In reply to jnaveen

What makes you think Lara would make a good coach?

show writing and evidence please

What makes you think Lara would want anything to do with those jackasses?

Forget Russel and Hetmeyer. Allen omission was inconceivable.

People have short memories

Lara was RUN out of cricket and a choice few on here heralded the awful treatment of the genius that was Lara for us.

He was not perfect and the poor saps did not have a CLUE how to treat and partner properly with him...but let me not digress...and just say.

THANKS AGAIN!! 

 
kazakman 2022-10-22 23:27:08

How many postmortems will be carried out on the corpse that is West Indies cricket? Empty Skillet, you are the problem. It is you who killed off West Indies Cricket. Kindly vacate the premises so that we can do a post mortem on your inept, incompetent and feckless administration.

You rough on the man player.

Normally your words are measured.

Remember the tales of Skillet as manager in Sri Lanka, huh

You want him gone like yesterday

In reply to buds
Yep. We all know what a fine player of spinbowling Allen is. We would have shown those fools how to work the ball around on the ground to take advantage of those expansive spaces in the huge outfield instead of trying to hoick the ball over cow corner as if they are playing at Warner Park

In reply to Walco
Its time these lazy incompetent directors take some blame for the mess they continue to cause in WI cricket. It is their back room dealings and knuckle head deals that continue to foist these incompetent people upon the cricket. There has to be a better way to hire a president than these back stabbing, deal making with devil machinations, that are not in the best interest of cricket but on upholding their positions of power. Skillet alone is not to be blamed. He didn't put himself there. Everyone of those directors that voted for him should leave with him. How can any of those directors look at the way the cricket is now and say that its better now, than when he took over and if its not the case they should have to give account for the $hit that they help create to this point... and as such they need to go.

So on this occasion I will be calling on the directors who assist in him being there to resign with the coach and take Skillet with them, as we cannot rely on their expertise to find the right person for the job.
