Australia fast bowler Mitchell Starc on Tuesday, October 25 warned Sri Lanka batter, Dhananjaya de Silva, for leaving the crease early during their T20 World Cup 2022 Super 12 match in Perth. Starc gave more than one warning to Dhananjaya who seemingly backed up early during his partnership with opener Pathum Nissanka.

Mitchell Starc warned Dhananjaya twice in the 5th over of the innings but did not attempt the run-out at the non-striker's end. Notably, after the end of the over, Starc continued to chat with Dhananjaya as drama unfolded at the new Perth Stadium.

Starc came up with a fiery spell with the new ball in the powerplay as Sri Lanka batters Nissanka and Dhananjaya were extra cautious in the powerplay after they lost in-form Kusal Mendis early.

Notably, this is not the first time Mitchell Starc has warned a player for backing up a bit too much at the non-striker's end. Starc was involved in a war of words with England captain Jos Buttler during a T20I match earlier in October after he claimed that the star batter was leaving the crease early. Buttler denied the allegation but Starc kept chirping at the England skipper.

In fact, Starc was slammed for making Deepti Sharma reference while warning Buttler during a rain-affected T20I in Canberra.

Starc was caught on the stump mic, saying: "I am not Deepti, but I might do it. Doesn't mean you can leave your crease early."

Starc made the 'Deepti' reference at a time the India women's cricket team's all-rounder run-out of England cricketer Charlie Dean in an ODI at Lord's earlier this year left the cricket fraternity divided. Quite a few England cricketers brought in the Spirit of Cricket debate while questioning Deepti running out Dean at the non-striker's end for backing up before the ball was delivered.

Former India all-rounder Hemang Badani had slammed Starc, saying Starc was well within his rights to choose to warn the non-striker and not run him out but he crossed a line by referring to Deepti.

"Grow up Starc. That’s really poor from you. What Deepti did was well within the rules of the game. If you only want to warn the nonstriker and not get him out that’s fine and your decision to make but you bringing Deepti into this isn’t what the cricket world expects of you," Badani said on social media.
