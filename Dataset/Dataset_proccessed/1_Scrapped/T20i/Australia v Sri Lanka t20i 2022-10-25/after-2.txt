That’s it from me today, thanks for your company. We’ll be back early tomorrow UK time for England’s clash against Ireland and then again on Friday for the big one between England and Australia at the MCG. Until then, goodbye!

Marcus Stoinis is Player of the Match for his batting ballistics:

To be honest I was really nervous today being at home in Perth with lots of family and friends here. Mentally I was nice and fresh having some time off with this side strain, but I felt good. We played here the other day against England and it was a beautiful wicket. It’s a beautiful ground, probably the best ground in Australia if not the world. We’ve wrapped this game up and look forward to playing England at the MCG. They’re obviously a very good team so we’ll do our homework again, rest up, get on our flight tomorrow and then go from there.”

Finch speaks:

Kudos to Australia’s captain – he’s out there talking to the tv folks.

Obviously my innings was unusual. It was poor. I just couldn’t hit the ball. But I thought the way that we approached it with the bat was fine. We knew the first four or five overs with the ball, especially with Kumara nipping it around - it was seaming a long way there - so if we could get through that none or one down then it was going to be really important to set up the back end of the innings. It would’ve been nice if I could’ve kicked on earlier and made the chase a bit easier but all in all it was pretty clinical.

Australia get over the line in style then, boosting their net run rate and setting things up nicely for Friday’s clash with England.

The form of their captain will be a concern though.

Australia win by 7 wickets (with 21 balls remaining)

Job done! Stoinis pongoes his sixth six into the crowd to leave Aaron Finch with two to get to secure the win. Finch, fittingly, mistimes a booming drive but gets enough bat on it to see it land over the infield and the batters run the two needed for victory.

16.24 CEST

16th over: Australia 146-3 (Finch 28, Stoinis 53) This match will henceforth be known as the Marcus Stoinis game. He spanks three more sixes off Theekshana to go to the fastest T20I fifty for Australia! He has 53 from just 17 balls. Australia owe this (near certain) victory to him. Finch’s innings at the other end has been a marked contrast but that’s for another day. Australia will take the points and move on. Their run rate will improve significantly thanks to Stoinis too.

15th over: Australia 126-3 (Finch 27, Stoinis 34) Absolutely Brutal batting from Marcus Stoinis! The big fella - shoulders wider than a chest-freezer - obliterates Hasaranga for 6,4,6! Majestic hitting. Incredible power. Stoinis roars with adrenaline and probably some relief. The pressure eases on Australia. This never happens to Hasaranga either, he’s gone for some serious tap today – 53 runs from just three overs.

14th over: Australia 107-3 (Finch 26, Stoinis 16) Back to back boundaries for Stoinis off Shanaka, both edges that squirt away past the keeper. Very handy for Australia.

16.11 CEST

13th over: Australia 97-3 (Finch 25, Stoinis 7) Stoinis joins his captain at the crease and plays a clever ramp wide of the keeper for four to keep Australia ticking. Sri Lanka need to keep taking wickets. Finch is still there too.

WICKET! Maxwell ct Sub (Bandara) b Karunaratne 23 (Australia 89-3)

WOW. wow. Wow. Sri Lanka’s sub fielder Bandara goes from zero to hero in a matter of seconds… first he juggles a catch off Maxwell, spilling a tough chance at the fourth attempt. Maxwell then smears a length ball into the deep and seems to hold the pose – certain it is going for six. That man Bandara leaps to take the catch and then pulls of a landing inches from the rope that Olga Korbut would’ve been happy with. What a catch. Maxwell is dismayed but has to go.

How about that for balance on the boundary rope!? 👌

12th over: Australia 88-3 (Finch 23, Maxwell 23) Kumara back into the attack and he’s cranking up the speedometer. Maxwell looks troubled by the short ball, Kumara wraps him on the gloves with a lifter. OUCH! Maxwell is hit. A nasty blow that seemed to ricochet off his shoulder and into the side of his helmet. He stumbles away and removes his lid. The ground holds its breath. Ah, thankfully he seems to be ok. The medics check him over and he’s going to continue. Just two runs off the over.

11th over: Australia 86-2 (Finch 23, Maxwell 22) Sri Lanka fight back in quiet fashion, Theekshana sends down dot after dot. Just one off the over from a leg side wide. Australia need 72 from 54.

10th over: Australia 85-2 (Finch 23, Maxwell 22) A huge over for Australia! NINETEEN runs blitzed from it! Maxwell nails Hasaranga straight for a six down the ground and then plays his version of a reverse-hit to pick up four more behind square. Six more! Maxwell is turning it on in Perth, Hasaranga is getting some serious tap. Game on!

WICKET! Marsh ct Rajapaksa b Dhananjaya 18

Aaron Finch smashes a six off Dhananjaya, that’s the first one he’s hit that made a nice sound from his blade. That’ll make him feel a bit better too. A single brings Marsh on strike and he is OUT! A big heave doesn’t have the legs and is snaffled in the deep by Rajapaksa.

Glenn Maxwell is the new man at the crease and he ain’t messing about, clearing his front leg and hoiking a four off his first ball.

9th over: Australia 66-2 (Finch 21, Maxwell 5)

8th over: Australia 53-1 (Finch 13, Marsh 18)Here we are and here we are and here we go. Hasaranga comes into the attack. This is the game right here. Australia counter attack, Marsh gets Australia’s FIRST boundary off the bat – rocking back and pulling Hasaranga through mid-wicket. SIX! Marsh then plays a thumping lofted drive that thunks into the sight screen for a maximum. The over goes for fifteen runs, not what Sri Lanka ordered from their star man.

7th over: Australia 38-1 (Finch 11, Marsh 5) DROP! Dhananjaya lures Mitch Marsh into a big heave-ho and the ball skews off his bat but is shelled by Hasaranga as he ran back to take the catch. Could be costly. Eeesh! Marsh tries another giant yahoo and fails to connect properly again, this time the ball lands safe, just plooping over the infield. Five off the over, the pressure cooker turns up a notch on the Aussies. The required rate creeps up to nine an over.

6th over: Australia 33-1 (Finch 9, Marsh 2) Karunaratne serves up a juicy full bunger to Finch who drives in the gap but doesn’t time it, he’ll be grateful to pick up three runs and get off strike. Marsh gets a single to bring his cap’n back on strike. A HUGE appeal as the ball seems to smash into Finch’s back leg… NOT OUT. The review shows it going over the top. Finch again appearing to be beaten for pace though, this has been a real struggle for him so far. Powerplay done.

Aaron Finch to Richard Illingworth over stump mic: "Happy to take any ideas if you know how to hit that"

WICKET! Warner ct Shanaka b Theekshana 11 (Australia 26-1)

Warner goes! Caught smartly in the covers by Shanaka off Theekshana’s first delivery. Warner throws back his head and howls in anguish. An Australian Werewolf in… Perth.

Theekshana looks very tidy, picking up a wicket and going for just two runs in his first over. Mitch Marsh is the new man.

5th over: Australia 26-1 (Finch 5, Marsh 1)

4th over: Australia 26-0 (Warner 11, Finch 4) No boundaries in the first three overs for Australia and quite a few alarms, mainly for Finch who it has to be said looks woefully out of nick. Kumara rips deliveries through him, one of which runs away for four byes and another thuds into his torso.

The ever-neutral Colum Fordham gets in touch on the emails:

“Hi Jim,

Sri Lanka are putting up quite a good fight of it and for us England-supporting “neutrals”, it would be wonderful if they could set a decent total that seriously challenges the hosts. But I think (fear) that Australia, despite their mixed body Language, will come good after their shambolic outing against the Kiwis.”

Time will tell Colum. I’m not so sure.

3rd over: Australia 22-0 (Warner 8, Finch 4) Karunaratne into the attack, he spears one into Finch’s pads and goes up for the lbw but the ball was sliding down. Decent wheels though. A wild wide is followed by another in-ducker that Finch chops down past his stumps, looks like the Aussie captain is being beaten for pace. Warner picks up two with a jab to leg. In other news, I’ve just been delivered a cornish pasty from my beloved, it’s the size of a house brick! Nevertheless a good OBO friendly snack. Chomp and type.

2nd over: Australia 12-0 (Warner 4, Finch 2) Lahiru Kumara is going to bring the pace from the other end. He starts by slamming down five wides down leg. Gah. Kumara soon has Aaron Finch in all sorts of bother though, cutting the ball back sharply three balls in a row to leave the Aussie skipper hopping and looking uncomfortable. Finch manages to get a spawny inside edge past the stumps to get off strike. A probing over. Sri Lanka are well up for this.

1st over: Australia 6-1 (Warner 4, Finch 1) Oh no! Fernando pulls up after his fifth ball, grimaces and walks straight from the field. Dhananjaya comes on to finish the over and fires down a dot. Only six from the first but a disastrous start for Sri Lanka.

Here we go…

This could be a tricky and nervy chase for Aus after they were unable to blast out SL. They gave it a red hot crack chasing England in Perth a few weeks back but that wasn’t a case of #T20WorldCup survival. Interesting match! #AUSvSL

20th over: Sri Lanka 157-6 (Asalanka 38, Karunaratne 14) Sri Lanka get TWENTY off the final over! Cummins gets the double-teapot out as he can’t quite believe what is happening out there. Asalanka pulled him for four to square-leg before slotting a half volley for a majestic SIX! Stand and deliver stuff! A bye and a wide raises the mercury further before the final ball is toe-ended through the covers only for Captain Finch to dive over the ball, turning to see it trickle away for four more! Finch smacks the pitch with anger. Sri Lanka are in this and there’s pressure on the home side here. A tricky target against Sri Lanka’s slippery spinners.

19th over: Sri Lanka 137-6 (Asalanka 26, Karunaratne 10) Decent penultimate over for Sri Lanka a they eke their score upwards and frustrate the Aussies. Starc sends down five wides and a no ball and is picked off by the scampering batters. One over to go, 150 the target?

WICKET! Hasaranga ct Wade b Hazlewood 1

Hazlewood returns and goes for seven runs but picks up the wicket of Hasaranga – a toe edge is gobbled by Wade. Karunaratne arrives and immediately hooks Starc away fine for four. Two overs to go, what can Sri Lanka post that will make the Aussies sweat under lights?

18th over: Sri Lanka 126-6 (Asalanka 25, Karunaratne 4)

17th over: Sri Lanka 119-5 (Asalanka 25, Hasaranga 1) Hasaranga is the new man, he’s at the non strikers end as Asalanka smears Cummins through cover for four. The big man does not like that but Asalanka and Hasaranga are trying to smash runs off every ball now to get this Sri Lanka total to something competitive. Eight runs from the over.
