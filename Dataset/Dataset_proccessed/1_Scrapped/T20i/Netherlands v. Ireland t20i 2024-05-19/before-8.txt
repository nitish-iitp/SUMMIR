Mumbai Indians vs Lucknow Super Giants Commentary
7:13 PM IST Right then, that's it from the coverage of this game. The Indian T20 League will continue on 19th May, 2024 when Bengaluru will be locking horns against Chennai in match number 68 of this season. This game holds significant importance in the league as it will confirm one team's place in the playoffs. The first ball will be at 7.30 pm IST (2 pm GMT), but you can join us early for the build-up. Until then, take care and goodbye.
7:12 PM IST Nicholas Pooran is the Player of the Match for his knock of 75 runs off just 29 balls. He says he had to do his job and it was good. He says that he likes batting in powerplay as well but he likes to bat in any order and that's his strength. He adds that he is blessed with batting and he enjoys batting. Mentions that the World Cup is near and they will be looking forward to that and playing together.
7:08 PM IST KL Rahul, the skipper of Lucknow, says that they are very disappointed, as at the beginning of the season, it felt like they had all bases covered and a few injuries happened to such guys that it really hurt the team and the batters couldn't come together often. He mentions that he is happy for the Indian pacers, that the franchise has invested a lot of time and energy, and that the likes of Mayank Yadav and Yudhvir Singh were sent to South Africa for training as well. He recognizes that he isn't sure about opening in T20 cricket and it is a season where he has learned a lot about his batting and what the team wants. On Nicholas Pooran, he says that ideally they would want him to bat higher but given the set-up of the team, Pooran needed to be slightly down the order as Marcus Stoinis was batting at number 3.
6:57 PM IST Krunal Pandya is in for a chat. He says that it was a tough season but it feels good to end with a win. Adds that fielding is more related to fitness and the boundary save felt good. Ends by saying that it would have been great to get a shot in the playoffs but he is happy to finish on a high.
6:56 PM IST Hardik Pandya, the captain of Mumbai, says that the season has been quite difficult as they didn't play quality cricket. Adds that it is a professional world and as professionals, you need to come out and give it your best but as a group, they weren't able to play their best cricket. Mentions that it is difficult to make out what went wrong in this game as it has been a similar story throughout the season and will now look forward to the next season.
6:54 PM IST Presentations coming up...
