<image:caption>Kate Langbroek (pictured) has revealed she finds the 'gender gap' when it comes to glamour to be unfair.

<image:caption>Kate says her male co-stars on The Project, which include Waleed Aly, Hamish Macdonald, Sam Taunton and Michael Hing, can make less effort than the women as they don't spend much time being glammed up.

<image:caption>Kate has empathy for women who appear on breakfast TV. 'I do think of that when I see the sisters who do morning TV: you know, Sylvia [Jeffreys] or Nat Barr...
