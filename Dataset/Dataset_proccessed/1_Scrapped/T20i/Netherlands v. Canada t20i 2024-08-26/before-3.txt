The Jacques Léglise Trophy – 2024 Preview & Results
Posted on 19/08/2024 by Golf Bible

24th August 2024

Continent of Europe won the 47th Jacques Léglise Trophy match against Great Britain & Ireland (GB&I) by 12.0 points to 10.0 at West Lancashire G.C. in England.

In a worrying trend for the home side it was the Continent’s fifth consecutive victory and sixth in the last eight contests.

“You just have to take your hat off to Pierre (Relecom) and the Continent of Europe – they played cracking golf” said GB&I captain Chris King.

Viggo OLSSON MÖRK (EUR) was Europe’s star performer winning all three of his games. Neo BERG (SWE), Nils-LEVI BOCK (GER) and Hugo LE GOFF (FRA) were also unbeaten for the victors.

Henry STYLES (ENG) won both of his Singles for GB&I.

Saturday Singles 

GB&I won the Day 2 Singles 5.5-3.5 but the damage had been done for the home team in the morning Foursomes.

Saturday Foursomes

Continent of Europe took control of the Jacques Léglise Trophy match by winning all four Foursomes games this morning. GB&I were only able to take one of the games to the 18th in a disappointing performance.

Arthur CARLIER (FRA) and Dominic MCGLINCHEY (SCO) were rested for Europe and GB&I respectively by their captains.

Now leading GB&I 8.5-4.5 Europe need to win just three of the 11 Singles this afternoon to win the Trophy outright, with 2.5 points being good enough for them to retain it via a tie as the holders.

Friday Singles

Due to strong winds from Storm Lilian and a four hour delay in play the Day 1 Foursomes were cancelled and the decision was taken to play nine Singles during the afternoon.

Europe and GB&I earned 4.5 points each to hopefully set up an exciting finale to the 2024 Jacques Léglise Trophy at West Lancashire G.C. tomorrow.

Last week’s Boys’ Amateur champion Viggo OLSSON MÖRK (SWE), Neo BERG (SWE) and Nils-Levi BOCK (GER) all picked up wins for Continent of Europe.

For GB&I Sebastian DESOISA (GIB), Henry STYLES (ENG) and Oscar LENT (ENG) picked up full points.

19th August 2024

The 47th Jacques Léglise Trophy match between Great Britain & Ireland (GB&I) and Continent of Europe will take place at West Lancashire Golf Club in England on Friday 23rd and Saturday 24th August. 

This annual match is contested by two nine-player under 18 boys’ teams. It is essentially a junior equivalent of the biennial men’s St. Andrews Trophy match also played between these two regions.

Having been dominated in the early years by GB&I the Continent of Europe have now won six of the last seven matches played since 2016.

Following consecutive wins at Aldeburgh G.C. in England (2019), Falsterbo G.C. in Sweden (2021), Blairgowrie G.C. in Scotland (2022) and Golf de Chantilly in France (2023) Europe will start as strong favourites to make it five wins-in-a-row. The 2020 match, which was due to be played at Blairgowrie, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

I will be updating this article with daily match reports once play begins.

Teams

The R&A have selected the following players to represent GB&I (WAGR’s at 14th August): –

Ben BOLTON 17 – England (WAGR #510)
Sebastian DESOISA 17 – Gibraltor (WAGR #549)
Daniel HAYES 17 – England (WAGR #526)
Monty HOLCOMBE 17 – England (WAGR #1,840)
Oscar LENT 15 – England (WAGR #472)

Charlie RUSBRIDGE 16 – England (WAGR #639)
Henry STYLES 18 – England (WAGR #986)

Reserve: Harry COX 17 – England (WAGR #1,819)

Monty Holcombe played for GB&I last year at Golf de Chantilly.

Wales’ Chris KING, Chairman of The R&A’s GB&I Boys’ Selection Committee & Captain, will take charge of the team for the fourth time.

The 2024 Continent of Europe team, selected by the European Golf Association, consists of: –

Giovanni BINAGHI – Italy (WAGR #446)
Nils-Levi BOCK – Germany (WAGR #1,072)

Oscar COUILLEAU – France (WAGR #302)
Lev GRINBERG – Ukraine (WAGR #195)
Hugo LE GOFF – France (WAGR #201)
Viggo OLSSON MÖRK – Sweden (WAGR #1,963) – 2024 Boy’s R&A Amateur champion
Scott WOLTERING – Netherlands (WAGR #945) – 2024 Boy’s R&A Amateur runner-up

Lev Grinberg and Hugo Le Goff returns for the Europeans having played last year.

Louis Klein from Czech Republic (WAGR #243) was originally selected but has had to withdraw due to injury.

Europe will be led for the first time by Non-Playing Captain Pierre RELECOM of Belgium. He has big shoes to fill as his predecessor Joachim FOURQUET of France won all four of the Jaques Léglise Trophy matches that he captained.

Format

The Jacques Léglise Trophy match is played over two days.

Four foursomes games are played each morning.

Singles are then played in the afternoon; eight on Day 1 and nine on Day 2.

As there will be 25.0 points to play for each team will require 13.0 points to claim an outright victory.

Venue

The match is being played at West Lancashire Golf Club, near Liverpool in England.

The championship course plays to 6,973 yards and a par of 72.

West Lancashire was founded in 1873 and has hosted the Women’s Amateur Championship, SP Qualifying for The Amateur Championship, the Girls’ Amateur Championship, the U18 Boys’ Carris Trophy, the  R&A Junior Open and Regional and Final Qualifying for The Open over the years.

This will be the 15th time that England has hosted the Jacques Léglise Trophy match.

Previous Matches

An international junior match was first played between 1958 and 1966 with GB&I winning all nine of them.

After a break it was re-instated to the amateur calendar in 1977 as the Jacques Léglise Trophy. Jean-Louis Dupont donated the new trophy in memory of Jacques Léglise, a former President of both the French Golf Association and the European Golf Association. Léglise was also a past French amateur champion and national team captain.

Since becoming the Jacques Léglise Trophy GB&I have won 29 of the matches with the Continent of Europe claiming 16 victories with the 2015 match tied. Eleven of Europe’s wins have been in away matches.

Originally played in a single day the match moved to two in 1996.

Introduction

156 players will contest this year’s Open Championship which will be played at Royal Troon G.C. on 18-21 July 2024.

The majority of the field will be made up of exempt players; recent major champions, winners of prestigious professional events and leading players in the OWGR and International Federation Ranking.

The remaining players have had to qualify either via The Open Qualifying Series or Regional and Final Qualifying.

28 places were allocated to The Open Qualifying Series. The leading 1-3 players, not already exempt, at 12 professional tour events in 10 countries played in 2024 have earned these spots.

A further 16 spaces were also given over to Regional and Final Qualifying. Regional Qualifying was played on Monday 24th June 2024 and Final Qualifying took place on Tuesday 2nd July 2024. Players competing in Regional Qualifying played for the opportunity to play in Final Qualifying while the latter presented the final gateway to The Open.

This article focuses on Regional and Final Qualifying for The 152nd Open and in particular the performances of the amateur golfers seeking to earn a spot in the Championship.

________________________________

Final Qualifying

Final Qualifying took place over 36 holes at Burnham & Berrow, Dundonald Links, Royal Cinque Ports and West Lancashire on 2nd July 2024.

There were 288 players competing, 72 at each site, including 66 amateurs.

A number of amateur and professional players were exempt directly into Final Qualifying based on their past playing achievements. The rest of the field was made up of players who had come through Regional Qualifying.

A minimum of 16 places in The Open were guaranteed by The R&A. Any ties for the last qualifying place in each event were broken by a sudden-death play-off. Some Reserve spots were also decided at these events.

5 amateurs namely Dominic Clemons (ENG), Matty Dodd-Berry (ENG), Luis Masaveu (ESP), Jaime Montojo Fernández (ESP) and Liam Nolan (IRL) were successful in Final Qualifying.

No amateur or professional came through both Regional and Final Qualifying this year.

Here are some details on the four Final Qualifying events with a summary of all of the amateur competitors; their routes to this stage and their results on the day: –

2024 Amateur Exemptions

Seven amateurs have earned exemptions into The Open through their recent performances: –
2023 Mark H. McCormack Medal Winner – Gordon SARGENT (USA)
2023 Asia-Pacific Amateur Champion – Jasper STUBBS (AUS)
2024 Latin America Amateur Champion – Santiago DE LA FUENTE (MEX)
2024 African Amateur Championship NEW FOR 2024 – Altin VAN DER MERWE (RSA)
2024 Amateur Champion – Jacob Skov OLESEN (DEN)
2024 European Amateur Champion – Tommy MORRISON (USA)
2024 Open Amateur Series Winner* – Calum SCOTT (SCO)

*The Open Championship Amateur Series was introduced by The R&A in 2023. It offers an exemption to the player who gains the most WAGR points in the St. Andrews Links Trophy, the Amateur Championship and the European Amateur Championship events (as long as they didn’t win the Amateur or European Amateur Championships which meant they were already exempt).

The 2023 U.S. Amateur Champion Nick DUNLAP (USA) turned Pro in January 2024 after he won the American Express Championship at La Quinta. This decision meant he gave up his Open exemption.

Low Amateur Silver Medal

The Silver Medal is awarded to the leading amateur in The Open Championship who completes 72 holes. Bronze Medals are awarded to all other amateurs who complete 72 holes.

The Open Championship – 2023 Regional & Final Qualifying
Posted on 25/06/2023 by Golf Bible

23rd July 2023

THE 151ST OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP

Christo LAMPRECHT (RSA) shot a 74 (+3) in the final round of The Open Championship.

His +11 72-hole total lifted him two places on the final leaderboard to 74th.

Whilst his aggressive strategy off the tee worked in the opening round it came off the rails as he continued with it for the remainder of the Championship. In the final analysis he only hit 15 out of 56 fairways.

Nevertheless as the only amateur to complete the 72 holes he duly collected the Silver Medal at the prize presentation.

He is the first South African to collect this prize and the first Amateur champion since South Korea’s Jin Jeong in 2010 to complete this ‘double’.

ROUND 3 SCORES

Christo LAMPRECHT (RSA) shot a 5-over 76 in the third round to fall to 76th place, last of the players who made the cut.

Hopefully he can finish strongly tomorrow before collecting the low amateur Silver Medal at the prize giving.

ROUND 2 SCORES

Friday generally proved to be a very difficult day for the six amateurs competing at Hoylake.

Christo LAMPRECHT (RSA) shot a 79 (+8) in Round 2, 13 shots worse than his opening effort. His aggressive “bomb and gouge” strategy finally caught up with him today as the wind picked up and his putter went cold. Fortunately his 145 (+3) tied 62nd 36 hole total saw him make the cut on the mark. As the only amateur to do so he is now all set to become the first South African winner of the Silver Medal prize.

Jose BALLESTER‘s (ESP) 73 and 74 was the most consistent effort from the group but +5 was only good enough for tied 85th and two shots too many to progress to the weekend.

Mateo FERNANDEZ DE OLIVEIRA (ARG) produced the best amateur round of Day 2 with a 72 but ultimately missed the cut in tied 102nd.

Tiger CHRISTENSEN (GER) finished in tied 125th on +9 but battled hard today for a creditable 74.

Alex MAGUIRE (IRL) +10 finished tied 129th. After a disappointing back nine he had to settle for an 80; a shame after should a good round yesterday.

Harrison CROWE (AUS) has played a reasonable amount of links golf over the last two summers but has simply never taken to it. It was therefore no surprise to see him shoot 76 and 80 for a +14 total and a tied 148th finish.

25th June 2023 (Last updated 4th July 2023)

This article focuses on Regional and Final Qualifying for the 151st Open Championship and in particular the performances of the amateur golfers seeking to earn a spot in the final field.

You will find below an Introduction to this year’s Open Championship, followed by a discussion on Final Qualifying, which was played on 4th July 2023, then a report on the fifteen Regional Qualifying events, which were played on 26th June 2023.

Introduction

156 players will contest this year’s Open Championship which will be played at Royal Liverpool G.C. on 20-23 July 2023.

Five amateurs have earned exemptions into The Open through their prior performances: –
The 2022 Asia-Pacific Amateur Champion – Harrison CROWE (AUS)
The 2023 Latin America Amateur Champion – Mateo FERNANDEZ DE OLIVEIRA (ARG)
The 2023 Amateur Champion – Christo LAMPRECHT (RSA)
The 2023 European Amateur Champion – Jose BALLESTER (ESP)

Alex MAGUIRE (IRL) won the 2023 Open Championship Amateur Series. This new exemption was given by The R&A to the player who gained the most WAGR points in the St. Andrews Links Trophy, the Amateur Championship and the European Amateur Championship events (as long as they didn’t win the Amateur or European Amateur Championships which meant they were already exempt).

The 2022 U.S. Amateur Champion Sam BENNETT (USA) turned Pro at the end of the recent U.S. college season foregoing his Open exemption.

The 2022 Mark H. McCormack Medal (WAGR) winner Keita NAKAJIMA (JAP) 2022 turned Pro in September 2022, thus losing his place in the field too. However, he subsequently qualified as a pro through his 2nd place finish at The Open Championship Series Japan event on 25th-28th May to get back in.

The majority of the field will be made up of exempt players; former major champions, winners of prestigious professional events, leading players in the OWGR and the handful of amateurs listed above.

The remaining players in the field have had to or will have to qualify either via The Open Qualifying Series or Regional and Final Qualifying.

34 places have been allocated to The Open Qualifying Series. The leading 3-4 players, not already exempt, in the top 8-12 at 15 professional tour events in 10 countries played in 2023 secure these spots.

A further 19 spaces have also been given over to Regional and Final Qualifying. Regional Qualifying was played on Monday 26th June 2023 and Final Qualifying on Tuesday 4th July 2023. Players competing in Regional Qualifying were playing for the opportunity to play in Final Qualifying while the latter presents the actual gateway to The Open.

Low Amateur Silver Medal

The Silver Medal is awarded to the leading amateur in The Open Championship who completes 72 holes. Bronze Medals are awarded to all other amateurs who complete 72 holes.

FINAL QUALIFYING

Final Qualifying took place over 36 holes at four venues across Great Britain on 4th July 2023.

There were 288 players competing including 79 amateurs.

A number of amateur and professional players were exempt directly into Final Qualifying based on their past playing achievements. The rest of the field was made up of players who had come through Regional Qualifying.

19 places in The Open have been guaranteed by The R&A. Any ties for the last qualifying place in each event will be decided by a sudden-death play-off. Some Reserve spots will also be decided at these events.

Here are some details on the four venues with lists of all the remaining amateur competitors and their routes to this stage: –

REGIONAL QUALIFYING

Regional Qualifying took place over 18 holes at 15 venues across Great Britain and Ireland on 26th June 2023.

Any professional or amateur with a handicap index no higher than 0.4 (scratch) or a WAGR listing of 1st-2,000th during 2022-23 could enter Regional Qualifying subject to paying the entry fee.

Over 1,900 players teed it up in Regional Qualifying with 839 of these being amateurs.

117 qualifying places were allocated to the 15 venues by The R&A with 36 of them being picked up by amateurs.

In due course a number of Reserves from Regional Qualifying will also be promoted to the four Final Qualifying event fields. 32 amateurs earned Reserve spots and will now have their fingers crossed that other players drop out of Final Qualifying in the coming days.

Here is a summary of the 15 Regional Qualifying events focussing on the leading amateur performances:-

THE OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP

156 players will contest The 149th Open Championship at Royal St. George’s G.C. on 15-18 July 2021.

The following eight amateurs will be competing at this year’s Open: –

Exemptions
The Amateur Champions for 2020 and 2021 – Joe LONG (ENG) and Laird SHEPHERD (ENG)
The European Amateur Champions for 2020 and 2021 – Matthias SCHMID (GER) and Christoffer BRING (DEN)
The Mark McCormack Medal (WAGR) winners for 2019 and 2020 – Cole HAMMER (USA)
The Asia-Pacific Amateur Champion 2019 – Yuxin LIN (CHN)
The Latin America Amateur Champion 2020 – Abel GALLEGOS (ARG)

The U.S. Amateur Champions for 2019 and 2020, Andy OGLETREE (USA) and Tyler STRAFACI (USA), have both turned Pro thus foregoing their exemptions. 2020 McCormack Medal winner Takumi KANAYI (JAP) also turned Pro in September 2020 thus missing out on a visit to Kent.

Final Qualifying
Sam BAIRSTOW (ENG) was the only amateur to come through the Qualifying process.

Sam was exempted into Final Qualifying as one of the leading 10 WAGR ranked players as at Week 2021/21, not otherwise exempt. He then finished tied 2nd at St. Anne’s Old Links after rounds of 63 and 69 (-13) to secure one of the three places on offer at each venue.

Low Amateur Silver Medal
My focus now moves onto the race amongst the above amateur players in the Championship itself for the low amateur Silver Medal.

For more information on this prize you may like to take a look at this article – ‘The Open Championship’s Silver Medal’.

QUALIFYING

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic The R&A introduced a revised Qualifying format.

Most amateur golfers entered the competition at Regional Qualifying, although some were exempted in to Final Qualifying and a lucky handful the Championship itself.

This article follows all of the AMATEUR GOLFERS through The Open Championship 2021 Qualifying events. Information on the Final Qualifying events is at the top of the page with reports on the earlier Regional Qualifying competitions below that.

FINAL QUALIFYING

The same four venues used for Regional Qualifying were used for Final Qualifying which took place on Tuesday 29th June with 36 holes of stroke play golf played by each competitor.

282 players, made up of Regional qualifiers and other exempt players, contested the four competitions. There were 79 amateurs competing; 62 came through Regional Qualifying with the other 17 being exempted into this stage.

All of the Regional qualifiers had the advantage of staying at the same course they played last weekend.

12 players, 3 from each event, were guaranteed places in The Open Championship through Final Qualifying. 

Here are the four FINAL QUALIFYING events with all of the AMATEUR ENTRIES and their exemptions and results noted.

The Open Championship – 2019 Regional Qualifying
Posted on 18/06/2019 by Golf Bible

24th June 2019

Results Update

50 amateurs progressed out of a total of 150 players at the 13 Regional Qualifying events held today.

9 of the competitions were won or co-won by an amateur player.

A further 24 amateurs have reserve status. Based on previous years I anticipate at least 10 of these will ultimately progress to Final Qualifying too.

Final Qualifying will be held over 36 holes at Notts (Hollinwell), Prince’s, St Annes Old Links and Fairmont St. Andrews on Tuesday 2nd July. The three leading players at each of theses events will advance to the Open Championship to be played at Royal Portrush G.C. on 18th – 21st July.

__________________________________________

24th June 2018

Regional Qualifying for the 2018 Open Championship will take place tomorrow at 13 courses across Great Britain and Ireland.

The qualifying venues are Alwoodley, Berwick-Upon-Tweed, Burhill, County Louth, Fairhaven, Frilford Heath, Kedleston Park, Minchinhampton, Northamptonshire County, Panmure, Sandy Lodge, West Lancashire and Wildernesse.

This is the point at which most amateur golfers enter the competition, although some are exempted in to Final Qualifying and a lucky handful the Championship itself.

Format

18 holes of stroke play golf will be played by each competitor in Regional Qualifying.

Field / Qualifiers

At the time of writing 1,213 players have entered Regional Qualifying with 384 being amateurs.

In addition to male and leading women professionals male amateurs need to have a scratch playing handicap or to have been ranked in the Top 2,000 of the WAGR between 1st January and 1st June 2018 to be eligible for entry. The cost is £150 per player.

The number of qualifying places available at each of the 13 venues is linked to the number of players starting at each course and will be confirmed during the day.

Any ties for the last qualifying places in each competition will be resolved by a hole by hole play-off at the end of play.

Reserve places, in case of subsequent withdrawals from Final Qualifying, will be decided by a card countback, if necessary, from each Regional Qualifying competition.

Final Qualifying

Final Qualifying will be held over 36 holes at Notts (Hollinwell), Prince’s, St Annes Old Links and The Renaissance Club on Tuesday 3rd July.

Here is a list of the amateur exemptions for Final Qualifying: –
Playing members of the 2017 Walker Cup Trophy Teams.
The Amateur Champions 2013-2017.
The US Amateur Champions 2012-2016.
The International European Amateur Champions 2012-2016.
The 2017 English, Scottish, Irish and Welsh Amateur Champions, from the respective closed Amateur
Championships.
The runners-up in each of the 2018 Amateur Championship and 2017 European Amateur Championship, the 2017 US Amateur Championship and the 2017 European Amateur Championship.
The leading 10 WAGR ranked players, not otherwise exempt as at WAGR Week 21.
The Boys Amateur Champion 2017.
The 2017 Latin America Amateur Champion and runner(s)-up.
The 2017 Asia-Pacific Amateur Champion and runners(s)- up. This is only applicable if the entrant has not played in the 2018 OQS Singapore (SMBC Singapore Open).

The above are only applicable if the entrant concerned is still an amateur.

The three leading players at each of theses events will advance to the Open Championship to be played at Carnoustie Golf Links on 15th – 22nd July.

As always 156 players will contest The Open, with the majority of these being exempted into the field.

Amateur exemptions directly into The Open Championship include: –
The Amateur Champion for 2018 – Jovan REBULA (RSA)
The U.S. Amateur Champion 2017 – Doc REDMAN (USA)
The European Amateur Champion for 2018 – To be played 27th – 30th June.
The Mark H McCormack Medal (Men’s World Amateur Golf RankingTM) winner for 2017 – Joaquin NIEMANN (CHL)
The Asia-Pacific Amateur Champion 2017 – Lin YUXIN (CHI)

The above are only applicable if the entrant concerned is still an amateur. Redman and Niemann have both turned Pro in 2018 thus foregoing their exemptions.

For more information on the Low Amateur prize at The Open Championship you may like to take a look at an article I wrote earlier this year – ‘The Open Championship’s Silver Medal’.
