AFG vs AUS Scorecard
Afghanistan vs Australia Commentary
4:23 AM IST Right then, Afghanistan have just pulled off a Trans-Tasmanian double in this World Cup and just like the Kiwis, they might have just sent the Aussies packing as well but there's still a lot of cricket to be played. Next up is a Group 2 clash in the Super Eight stage with the USA taking on England at the Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados on Sunday, 23 June. That game will begin at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT) but you can join us a lot sooner for the build-up. Till then, take care and goodbye!
4:22 AM IST Rashid Khan, the victorious skipper of Afghanistan says that it is a massive win for them. Adds that they came close in the previous two World Cups, and it feels great to finally get the better of the Aussies. Tells that he is very happy with the performance of his team, and they learned from their mistakes which helped them a lot. Mentions that they knew 140 was going to be a good score but they could not finish as they hoped. Says that the opening partnership was important as the wicket became difficult towards the end. Further adds that it is the beauty of this team as they have a lot of all-rounders who can chip in, and Gulbadin Naib stepped up in this game, and Nabi also picked up a crucial wicket early on. Ends by saying that this is a big victory for them, and now they will focus on the next match as they have all the chances to make it to the semis.
4:16 AM IST Mitchell Marsh, the captain of Australia says that the opposition got 20 runs too many and they played a really good game of cricket. Adds that a lot of teams have bowled first throughout the tournament and they were happy to bowl first. Mentions that it was an off night for them in the field and they have to own it. Adds that they knew what to expect coming into this game and they were outplayed by Afghanistan. On their clash against India, he says that he is looking forward to it and they just need to win and will be focused on it.
4:11 AM IST Gulbadin Naib is the Player of the Match for his match-winning spell with the ball. He says they have waited a long time for this and it is a great moment for the team and the entire nation. Adds that the wicket was not easy to bat and they took a few things from the first innings which worked for them. Tells that he is happy that Rashid Khan trusted him and says that it was a complete team performance and everyone played their part. Mentions that they have played some good cricket in this World Cup as they beat New Zealand in the group stages and now they have finally beaten Australia which is a great achievement for their cricket. Further adds that they can now rest and then focus on the next game against Bangladesh.
4:10 AM IST The Presentation ceremony...
4:10 AM IST Earlier in the game, Mitchell Marsh won the toss and opted to bowl first on a pitch where most people thought that batting first was the way to go. It was a gritty effort from the Afghanistan openers as they put on a 100-plus stand to set things up for their side. Both Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran reached their fifties but got out soon after and the middle order just wasn't able to kick on from the get-go. Adam Zampa was yet again very consistent for Australia and Pat Cummins made history by picking up hat-tricks in consecutive World Cup matches. Mohammad Nabi managed to drag Afghanistan close to the 150-run mark with a boundary off the final delivery and that gave them a bit of impetus. In reply, Australia's top order misfired and they were left chasing the game and eventually, they ran out of steam.
