T20 World Cup winners in 2021, the Australians had a disappointing campaign in 2022 as they failed to qualify for the semifinals. This time around, though, they have looked an imposing unit.

After a couple of nervy moments in their tournament opener against Oman, they recovered to post 164 and secure a 39-run victory. They followed that up with a complete performance against arch-rivals England, to win by a similar margin, 36 runs. Australia went on to steamroll Namibia after bowling them out for 72, before successfully chasing 181 against a spirited Scotland outfit.

Their Super Eights group sees them placed with three Asian sides in India, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Along with the Men in Blue, they are the favourites to progress to the semifinals but the other two sides are more than capable of turning one or both of these two over.
