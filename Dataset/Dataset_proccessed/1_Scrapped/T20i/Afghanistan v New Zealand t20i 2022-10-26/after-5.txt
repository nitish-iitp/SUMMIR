The ICC’s decision not to use Melbourne’s Marvel Stadium as a back-up venue for the T20 World Cup has come under fire after Australia’s game against England was washed out on Friday night.

The blockbuster clash was abandoned without a ball being bowled, with rain spoiling the party at the MCG.

The umpires and captains inspected the pitch and sodden outfield before the rain returned, prompting the game to be called off.

It was the fourth match of the tournament to be abandoned without a result.

Melbourne’s wild weather also saw the earlier game between New Zealand and Afghanistan at the MCG abandoned.

It was a frustrating outcome for Australia and England in particular, who were both desperate for a win after losing games to New Zealand and Ireland, respectively.

The T20 World Cup has been heavily affected by rain, prompting discussion about whether Marvel Stadium, which has a roof, should have been set aside as an emergency venue for the tournament.

“This is what happens at this time of year and the beginning of summers,” England coach Jonathan Trott said.

“The frustrating thing is there’s a stadium down the road that has a roof so you can play cricket there. We could have had lots of cricket. But it does mean the tournament is unpredictable with lots of must-win games coming up.”

Marvel Stadium, which has a capacity of 53,000, is the home ground of the Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash, but the venue has hosted just 12 international matches in its history and none since 2006.

“It’s tough. Afghanistan have had two games washed out in a tournament where you potentially play only five matches,” England captain Jos Buttler said.

“It’s frustrating for all of us. Is there something you could look at – I don’t know if you could elongate the tournament, for example?

“The umpires had some big concerns about the conditions and rightly so. The outfield was very wet and there were some areas inside the 30-yard circle that weren’t fit to play.

 “We all want to play cricket but it has to be safe and it certainly wasn’t. The right call was made. We play an open-air sport and the elements are a huge part of what makes it unique.

“It’s a shame tonight, especially for everybody involved.

“Australia against England at the MCG in a must-win match is as big as it gets in your career.

“They’re the games you want to be involved in, no matter whatever the result is going to be.” You don’t know how often those opportunities will come around.”

Australian coach Andrew McDonald said the first choice for cricket in Melbourne should always be to play matches at the MCG.

“Everyone wants to play at the MCG, you can’t predict the weather. There’s probably no better place you’d want to be playing than the MCG,” he said.

The washout means Australia must win its remaining two games against Ireland and Afghanistan, improve its net run rate and hope England loses to New Zealand.

New Zealand, England, Ireland and Australia are locked on three points while Sri Lanka is on two points in Group 1.

New Zealand and Sri Lanka, who will take on one another in Sydney on Saturday, both have a game in hand.

“I’m not sure what the perfect format is,” Buttler added.

“It’s quite a ruthless format as it stands, which we know and accept. But if multiple games are affected by the weather, it doesn’t give a true reflection of how you’d hope the tournament would play out.”
