Zimbabwe secured another all-time men's T20I record in their T20 World Cup Qualifier match against The Gambia today (October 23), taking victory by 290 runs.

That margin of victory is a record for a men's T20I, beating the previous record of 273 runs set by Nepal over Mongolia last year. It also smashed Zimbabwe's biggest-ever win in a men's T20I, which they set yesterday (October 22), beating Rwanda by 149 runs.

The margin of victory against The Gambia was secured by an extraordinary batting performance, which saw them post 344-4 - the biggest-ever total in a men's T20I. Sikandar Raza was the star of the show with a player-of-the-match winning 133 off 43 balls. Brian Bennett, Tadiwanashe Marumani and Clive Madande also made half-centuries. That total blew the previous highest of 314-3 (also set by Nepal against Mongolia) out of the water.

In response, The Gambia had no real chance, and were bowled out for 54. Only No.10 batter Andre Jarju reached double figures, with Richard Ngarava and Brandon Mavuta taking three wickets apiece.

The match continues a blistering run for Zimbabwe in the tournament, which will determine two nations who will progress to the Africa Regional Qualifier, with the Full Member side forced to pass through the lowly event due to their failure to qualify for the 2024 T20 World Cup. They scored 286-5 against Seychelles in their opening match, with the Seychelles only able to reach 18-2 before rain curtailed their chase in the seventh over. That was followed up by a match against Mozambique, in which Zimbabwe bowled Mozambique out for 56 and chased the required runs in five overs. They scored 240-8 against Rwanda before bowling them out for 91 yesterday.

Up next, Zimbabwe will face Kenya tomorrow (October 24) in their final match of the competition.
