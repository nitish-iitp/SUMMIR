New Zealand vs Pakistan 5th T20I: Pakistan managed to clinch a consolation victory as they defeated New Zealand by 42 runs in the fifth and final T20I match at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Sunday, January 21.

This was Pakistan's first victory in the shortest format under Shaheen Afridi's captaincy as they bowled the hosts out for just 92 runs while defending the 135-run target.

However, the Blackcaps would be very happy with the 4-1 series win, having won the first four matches convincingly.

The visitors bowled brilliantly to help the team finish the series on a positive note, with the all-rounder Iftikhar Ahmed leading the charge with the ball in hand.

Iftikhar put up a show with the ball and ended up taking three wickets for just 24 runs in his quota of four overs.

He got great support from his fellow bowlers with skipper Shaheen and Mohammad Nawaz taking two wickets each.

Zaman Khan and Usama Mir also picked up a wicket each as Pakistan wrapped up the game with more than two overs remaining.

Despite chasing a low target, the Blackcaps never picked up momentum as they lost the first wicket in just the second over of their innings.

They kept losing wickets at regular intervals as no batter managed to reach even the 30-run mark with Glenn Phillips being the highest scorer with 26 runs in 22 balls.

Earlier, Pakistan after opting to bat first, too had a disappointing outing with the bat, having lost the opener Haseebullah Khan for 0 in the first over of the match.

Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam added 53 runs for the second wicket before the latter was dismissed by Ish Sodhi for 13 runs in 24 balls.

Rizwan added another 35 runs for the third wicket with Fakhar Zaman as they aimed for a huge stand to provide the momentum heading forward.

The partnership was broken by Tim Southee who picked up his second wicket by dismissing Fakhar for 33 runs in just 16 balls with the help of four sixes and a four.

There were no further promising partnerships after that as the visitors only managed to post 134/8 in their 20 overs.

Rizwan was the top-scorer with 38 runs to his name in as many balls.

Tim Southee and Matt Henry picked up two wickets each whereas Lockie Ferguson and Ish Sodhi were brilliant too and got as many wickets.

The Blackcaps will now prepare for their home Tests series against South Africa whereas Pakistani players will be in action soon in the T20 league PSL.
