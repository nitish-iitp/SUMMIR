COMMENTRY
Right then, that is it from this game and this series as well where Pakistan managed to get a consolation win while New Zealand takes the series 4-1. Next up for the Kiwis is a two-match Test series against South Africa. The first Test will start on 4th February, Sunday at 3.30 am IST (10 pm GMT, Previous Day). The Pakistani players, on the other hand, will join their respective teams in the different T20 leagues that are going on at the moment. Until next time, cheers and goodbye!
Finn Allen is the PLAYER OF THE SERIES for his incredible batting displays throughout the five games.
Iftikhar Ahmed is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his brilliant match-winning spell.
Presentation Time...
Earlier in the game, Pakistan posted a total that did not look like a winning one, but their bowlers proved us wrong. Mohammad Rizwan anchored the innings, but it was really the quick-fire cameo from Fakhar Zaman and late blows from Abbas Afridi took them to that score. For New Zealand, except for Mitchell Santner every other bowler chipped in with a couple of wickets each. While chasing, the Kiwis had a forgettable outing with the bat as they could not even cross the 100-run mark in this chase.
Pakistan, on the other hand, will be extremely happy with their bowling effort as they finally got things right in the series. Mohammad Nawaz set the tone with an early wicket while it was an incredible catch from Haseebullah Khan to get rid of the dangerous Finn Allen. Their spinners were excellent especially Iftikhar Ahmed who got the chance to bowl for the first time in this series and picked up three wickets. Nawaz ended up with two while Usama Mir and Zaman Khan chipped in with one each. The fielding and catching was excellent as well and they never let the batters settle in. It was the skipper Shaheen Afridi at the end who wrapped things up by picking up the last two wickets on consecutive deliveries to ensure the win for his side.
New Zealand lost Rachin Ravindra quite early on as he failed to make the most out of his return to the side. Finn Allen looked good for his 22 with a few lusty blows, but he too perished soon after. Just as when it looked like Tim Seifert and Will Young were steadying things for them, the latter got dismissed trying to improve the scoring rate. However, that started a collapse for them as they went from 53/3 to 72/8 in double quick time. All the hopes were on the shoulders of Glenn Phillips, and he did put up a fight for some time, but couldn't get any support from the other end and failed to get his side over the line this time around. It was too much to ask for the tail-enders and ultimately they fell short by 42 runs.
PAKISTAN AVOID THE WHITEWASH! They leave New Zealand with this solitary win which is also the first for Shaheen Afridi as skipper of his country. The Men in Green also get their first win in their last eight T20Is and will be a bit relieved and will look to build on from here. New Zealand will be disappointed as it was a perfect chance for them to make it 5-0, but they made a complete mess of it.

OUT! BOWLED'EM! Shaheen Afridi seals the deal in style and Pakistan wins by 42 runs. Afridi bowls a pinpoint yorker at the base of the middle stump as Ferguson backs away for the slog and he misses completely as the ball rattles into the stumps. Pakistan avoids the whitewash and Shaheen Afridi gets his first win as the skipper of the T20 side.
Lockie Ferguson is the last man in.

OUT! CAUGHT! Shaheen Afridi gets the big wicket of Glenn Phillips and surely the New Zealand hopes are buried now. Bowls it short and around off. Glenn Phillips goes for it and pulls it to the cow corner region. Abbas Afridi runs around at the boundary, puts in the slide, and hangs onto a terrific catch. New Zealand lose their ninth as Glenn Phillips makes the long walk back.
