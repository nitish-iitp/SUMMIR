Here are the Pakistan player ratings for the 2023/24 T20I series in New Zealand that they lost 1-4.

Saim Ayub – 3/10
39 runs @ 9.75, SR 130, HS: 27 | 8 catches

Saim’s arrival forced Pakistan to split the Babar Azam-Mohammad Rizwan pair at the top. He started well with an eight-ball 27 but failed three times after that. It is important for Pakistan to not abandon the idea, for the style of batting involves risk-taking. Gets an extra point for setting a new Pakistan record for most catches by a non-wicketkeeper in a series of any length.

Mohammad Rizwan – 5/10
184 runs @ 46.00, SR 131, HS: 90*, one 50 | 1 catch

Some runs for Rizwan, nearly half of which came in one innings where he faced more than half the balls Pakistan played in the innings for ninety not out and New Zealand won with 11 balls to spare.

Babar Azam – 6/10
213 runs @ 42.60, SR 142, HS: 66, three 50s

Babar adapted decently in a new position, though questions over his intent remain. None of his fifties came in a winning cause.

Fakhar Zaman – 7/10
126 runs @ 25.20, SR 166, HS: 50, one 50

Fakhar continued with his stupendous form, getting off to rapid starts four times in five matches. His most violent onslaught came in the second T20I, but no less was the 16-ball 33 in the only match Pakistan won, for which he was named Player of the Match.

Mohammad Nawaz – 7/10
50 runs @ 25.00, SR 179, HS: 28 | 3 wickets @ 34.33, ER 8.58, BBI: 2-18

Coming into the side in the third match, Nawaz played two breezy cameos, and was excellent in the final match – particularly with the new ball – to finish with 2-18.

Sahibzada Farhan – 3/10
20 runs @ 10.00, SR 125, HS: 19

Farhan’s 14-ball 19 in the final T20I helped Pakistan reach an ultimately decisive 134-8. He failed in the other match he played.

Iftikhar Ahmed – 3/10
44 runs @ 8.80, SR 86, HS: 24 | 3 wickets @ 8.00, ER 6.00, BBI: 3-24

Iftikhar failed on all five occasions he came out to bat, but earns a couple of points for his 3-24 in the final T20I, the only time he bowled in the series.

Azam Khan – 1/10
22 runs @ 7.33, SR 116, HS: 10 | 0 catch

Three failures for Azam in the series. Eight matches into his career, he is yet to go past ten. However, that Twenty20 strike rate of 145 should earn him a longer rope.

Shaheen Shah Afridi – 6.5/10
39 runs @ 13.00, SR 122, HS: 22 | 9 wickets @ 19.22, ER 8.94, BBI: 3-34

A chastening experience for Pakistan’s new T20I captain. He bowled well, but was often let down by his teammates in a constantly changing attack.

Aamer Jamal – 1/10
23 runs @ 23.00, SR 153 | 1 wicket @ 97.00, ER 12.12, BBI: 1-42

Jamal’s terrific form in the Test series in Australia did not spill over here. Both his cameos came too late to make an impact.

Usama Mir – 3/10
2 wickets @ 55.50, ER 9.25, BBI: 1-21

Mir started the series poorly before finishing it on a good note, picking 1-21 from his four overs in the fifth match.

Haris Rauf – 5/10
7 wickets @ 23.00, ER 10.61, BBI: 3-38

Fast, incisive, but expensive, Rauf bowled well in bursts. If his numbers look bad, it is because of the third match, where Finn Allen took him for five sixes and two fours in an eight-ball phase.

Abbas Afridi – 7/10
23 runs @ 11.50, SR 177, HS: 15* | 5 wickets @ 16.20, ER 9.00, BBI: 3-34

An injury forced Abbas out of the third and fourth matches. He bowled well in the first two, claiming five wickets, while the six-ball 15 not out in the low-scoring fifth match earns him a point.

Mohammad Wasim Jr – 2/10
1 wickets @ 59.00, ER 8.42, BBI: 1-35

Picked for the third and fourth matches, Wasim Jr had two ordinary outings.

Zaman Khan – 4/10
2 wickets @ 35.50, ER 7.88, BBI: 1-4

Zaman bowled well in phases in his nine overs without being exceptional.

Haseebullah Khan – 0/10
0 run

Haseebullah made a three-ball duck on his T20I debut, his only outing.
