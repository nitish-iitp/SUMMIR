Pakistan captain Shaheen Shah Afridi emphasized the significance of preventing a whitewash series loss to New Zealand, expressing his satisfaction with the team's 42-run victory in the fifth and final Twenty20 International on Sunday.
Facing some formidable spin bowling from Pakistan, the Black Caps collapsed, managing only 92 runs in their pursuit of the tourists' total of 134 for 8, despite being considered favorites.

Although Pakistan conceded the series 4-1, Shaheen was content that his inaugural captaincy concluded with a triumph, especially after the team struggled in the initial four matches.

While acknowledging the series as a crucial opportunity to build momentum for the T20 World Cup in June, Shaheen emphasized the importance of avoiding a clean sweep, as losing all five matches would have been a setback for the team's morale.
"Today's game was very important for us. We needed that as a unit to step forward," Shaheen said. "In the first four games, there were a lot of collapses, as a fielding unit, as a batting unit, but I think today we played as a team and we needed that win."



"It's not easy for any team to come here. And I think our mind is on the (T20) World Cup. We're just checking out every spot for every player and giving chances to youngsters."
Part-time off-spinner Iftikhar Ahmed, bowling for the first time in this series, delivered a standout performance, achieving career-best figures of 3 for 24 against a depleted New Zealand batting lineup that registered its second-lowest T20 total on home turf.
Only opener Finn Allen (22) and Glenn Phillips (26) managed to surpass the 20-run mark as Pakistan secured the final eight wickets for a mere 39 runs.
Left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz also contributed effectively with the new ball, capturing 2 for 18, while Shaheen Shah Afridi took 2 for 20.


New Zealand, without the services of three key batters — Kane Williamson (sidelined due to a knee injury), Devon Conway (absent due to Covid-19) and Daryl Mitchell (rested) — struggled in their batting performance.
Captain Mitchell Santner acknowledged their subpar chase, revealing that it exposed some vulnerabilities in the team's approach.
"We've looked pretty good batting first and defending but, looking at today, we may need a bit of work chasing," he said. "In a chase like that, we talk about taking it as deep as we can and we didn't do that.
"But all in all a pretty good series. There were good signs, different guys stepping up at different times and that's what you want."
Earlier, it seemed that the home team had positioned themselves well for a series whitewash with another display of disciplined bowling.
Seamers Tim Southee, Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson each secured two wickets, complemented by spinner Ish Sodhi.
In his opening maiden over, veteran Southee (2 for 19) dismissed debutant Haseebullah Khan and later returned in the 13th over to eliminate the threatening Fakhar Zaman, who had swiftly scored 33 off 16 balls.
The top-scorer, Mohammad Rizwan, exited shortly after, having contributed 38 runs off 38 deliveries.
Looking ahead, New Zealand are set to face a two-Test home series against South Africa, while Pakistan's upcoming international fixtures involve a series of five T20s at home against New Zealand in April.
