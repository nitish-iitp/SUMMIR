England without A TEAM players like Butler, bairstow, stokes and morgan still trash west indies in their own backyard.

Simmonds must go.

Motie played one game for west indies and had the best bowler figure and best economy on a runs truck pitch yet they dropped him.

Is something missing with phil simmonds.

check the bowling economy for the 3rd T20 vs pakistan.

Why they persist with hayden walsh, His stats is not so good recently.

Royston chase bowling and batting is not up to par recently.

I am very surprise that west indies selectors are not even giving Hemraj a look in.

Guy did well in the cpl recently and did well in the few games he played in abu dhabi t10 recently.

West indies poor results over the past 2 yrs leaning towards a pollard/simmonds dismissal.

Especially since they cannot even beat an English B team in them own yard.
