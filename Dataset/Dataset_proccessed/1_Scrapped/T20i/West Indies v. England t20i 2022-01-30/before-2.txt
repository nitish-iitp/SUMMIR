										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For West Indies Cricket team Head Coach Phil Simmons, one thing is clear. &#8220;The two guys out in the middle control things, and the situation controls how the two guys will play, and the messages that are sent back inside.&#8221; He was speaking ahead of the fourth T20 International in the Betway series against the West Indies at Kensington Oval in Barbados. The West Indies are leading the series 2-1 and a victory on Saturday would see the West Indies walking away with a series win. The fifth and final game takes place on Sunday 30th January 2022 at the same venue. </p>



<p>In previous press conferences, the Coach lamented the failure of his players to apply in matches, what was worked on during practice. For the match on Wednesday 26th January, Simmons was pleased with how the batsmen approached the game between overs 7 and 10 and and that they tried to reduce the loss of wickets during that period. The way that Rovman Powell and Nicholas Pooran approached their innings, was also commended by Simmons. Century-maker Powell scored a magnificent 107 off 53 balls, for a strike rate of 201.88. Vice Captain Pooran contributed 70 off 43, batting at number 3. </p>



<p>What&#8217;s his message to the team ahead of Saturday&#8217;s match? &#8220;For us to continue improving in our situation awareness and play how we see it,&#8221; said Simmons.&#8221; He went on to say that &#8220;our improvement in batting is determined by how well we assess the situations we are in. The wicket may not be as good as this one, but then we have to adjust.&#8221;</p>



<p>Click below for an excerpt of the press conference held on 27th January 2022, where I posed questions including the system of ensuring players know what they should be working on, when they are not in the West Indies team set up.  <strong>Video credit: CWI Media</strong></p>

<p>Cricket fans were kept on the edge of their seats during last Sunday&#8217;s second Betway T20 international between England and the West Indies. After the home team had steam rolled the visitors in the first match on 22nd January, England came out blazing when they batted first, after Captain Keiron Pollard again won the toss</p>



<p>In this first video, Nicholas Pooran talks about the second Betway T20I versus England. The series has been split 1-1, so Wednesday&#8217;s game will be an important one to forecast the series result. </p>

<p>In the second video, Pooran talks about the lesson of lower order batsmen Akeal Hosein and Romario Shepherd not giving up. The pair put on 79 runs for just 29 balls to take West Indies to an unlikely score of 170-8, after they were teetering on 103 for 8 in the 16th over. </p>

<p><strong>Shimron Hetmyer Audio | 2nd Colonial Medical Insurance ODI</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.cricketinterviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/CWI-Media-WIvENG-2019-02-22-Shimron-Hetmyer.mp3"></audio><figcaption>Shimron Hetmyer</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>BRIDGETOWN, Barbados –</strong> West Indies batsman Shimron Hetmyer spoke to members of the media following the second Colonial Medical Insurance One-Day International against England. The 22-year-old made his fourth ODI century as the Windies won by 26 runs at Kensington Oval to level the five-match series 1-1.</p>



<p><em>Catch highlights on&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href="https://www.windiescricket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.windiescricket.com</a></em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><em>– brought to you by Suzuki</em></p>



<p>The home side made 289-6 off their 50 overs and then bowled out the visitors for 263 off 47.4 overs. Hetmyer made 104 not out off just 83 balls with seven fours and four sixes. It was his fourth century in the last 11 months – the others: 127 against United Arab Emirates in Harare in March, 2018; 125 against Bangladesh in Guyana in July, 2018; and 106 against India in Guwahati in October, 2018.</p>



<p>In the second half of the match, left-arm pacer Sheldon Cottrell took a career-best 5-46 off nine overs to mark a successful return to the Windies colours. He was well supported by captain Jason Holder, who had 3-53 to spark celebrations among the appreciative home crowd at the historic venue.</p>



<p>Hetmyer shared a vital partnership of 76 for the fourth wicket with left-hander Darren Bravo, who made 25. Earlier Chris Gayle made 50 off 63 balls with four sixes to record his 50<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;half-century in ODIs.</p>



<p>“It was a wonderful day for me and the team and I feel really pleased with my performance, which helped the team to win and level the series. We are on a rise as a team and we just want to take it step by step, stage by stage,” Hetmyer said.</p>



<p>“I started slowly and Bravo was quite helpful to me in guiding me. We played well as a team today … we batted well and batted deep. Then the bowlers did a fantastic job with the ball … special congrats to Cottrell for the way he bowled. It was great to see him do such a great job with the new ball and then come back and finish off the innings.”</p>



<p>The two teams now travel to Grenada for the third and fourth Colonial Medical Insurance One-Day Internationals at the Grenada National Stadium on Monday and Wednesday.</p>

<p> West Indies captain Jason Holder spoke to members of the media after the end of the first Test of the Wisden Trophy Series at Kensington Oval in Barbados on Saturday January 26, 2019. </p>



<p>Apart from congratulating Roston Chase on his 8 wicket haul, Holder reflected on his own performance. </p>



<p> “It was a really good match for me personally. To come back the way I’ve come back I’m really pleased. I have put in a lot of hard work over the last couple of months trying to get myself back to full fitness. I’ve had a lot of emotion bottled up for a long time. We still have a long way to go. One Test match doesn’t make a summer. We’ve been in this position before, so lots of hard work to be done. We ticked a few boxes in this test match but it’s a matter of turning up in Antigua and doing the same,”  </p>

<p>Holder, the highly-rated allrounder, was named Player-of-the-Match due to his majestic 202 not out from 229 balls in the second innings which helped to set England a target of 628 to win. He also held three catches in the slips and took two wickets in the England first innings of 77 all out.</p>
