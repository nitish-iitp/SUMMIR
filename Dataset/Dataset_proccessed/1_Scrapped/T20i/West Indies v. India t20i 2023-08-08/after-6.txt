Final battle at Providence could see fireworks from T20 stars 

 Aug 08, 2023  Sports

West Indies vs. India 3rd T20I at Providence (West Indies lead 3 match Series 2-0)

Kaieteur Sports – With the series lead of 2-nil for the West Indies, today’s final match in Guyana could be a firecracker as both CPL and IPL stars from the respective teams look to provide one last round of high quality cricket for the Guyanese fans.

West Indies players have a practice session at Providence yesterday.

Today’s encounter could be used as a way to see more of the West Indies’ young talent playing more freely come this match.

Also with the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) just around the corner, Shimron Hetmyer, Romario Shepherd, Brandon King, Nicholas Pooran, Rovman Powell to name a few, will be keen on gathering as much form as possible, especially with their contributions throughout this series.

Outside of King, who could show up today given the advantage of winning the series already, the aforementioned core most notably Pooran, fresh off a fifty, will want to sign off with a bang.

West Indies will also want their bowlers to continue in the same vein, with fast-bowlers Shepherd, Alzarri Joseph and left-arm spinner Akeal Hosein scything through India’s batsmen in the last game, with veteran pacer Jason Holder being the leader of the young pack.

India on the other hand, could easily see the series at 2-1 should the likes of Shubman Gill, Ishan Kishan, Captain Hardik Pandya, Sanju Samson and their star from game 2, Tilak Varma, accept the result of the series and play freer, Windies could be in for a battle.

Pandya already showed glimpses of his devastating batting skill while Gilla and Samson failed but could turn up the heat with no pressure to play for while Kishan who had quickfire 27 in the last match, will want to continue his form at the top of the order.

Bowling will be key for both teams today and Pandya already demonstrated is adaptability to Guyana by leading his team’s bowling with 3 wickets in the previous outing.

Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled caused a number of problems and will support his skipper alongside spin twins Axar Patel and Yuzvendra Chahal.

Today’s match bowls off at your 1030h.
