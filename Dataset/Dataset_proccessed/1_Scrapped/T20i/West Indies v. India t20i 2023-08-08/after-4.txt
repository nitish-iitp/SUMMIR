PROVIDENCE, Guyana (AP) — Suryakumar Yadav hit a 44-ball 83 after both India openers were out early to pace the visitors to a seven-wicket win over the West Indies on Tuesday in the third Twenty20 match.

The hosts still lead the five-match series 2-1 ahead of the final two matches on Saturday and Sunday in Lauderhill, Florida.

West Indies captain Rowan Powell won the toss and decided to bat as his side scored 159-5, with Brandon King top-scoring with 42 and Powell adding an unbeaten 19-ball 40.

India replied with 164-3 in often steady drizzle at Providence Stadium in the second innings which did not stop play.

After India openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (1) and Shubman Gill (6) were out before the fifth over, Yadav, the world’s No. 1 T20 batter, hit 10 fours and four sixes. Tilak Varma (49 not out) was batting when the winning runs were scored.

Kuldeep Yadav led the India bowlers with 3-28 while Alzarri Joseph had 2-25 for the West Indies.

Powell estimated his side was 10 or 15 runs short.

“It was a pretty good wicket. The start we got, it was something we asked for, but we lost way in the middle,” Powell said. “We have a few days to sit down and relax and come back.”

Suryakumar Yadav was named man of the match.

“It was really important to be myself in the power play,” he said. “We’ve (he and Varma) batted for a long time now. We both understand each other.”

In the second T20, the West Indies survived a late scare to beat India by two wickets with seven balls remaining after the home side won the opener by four runs.
