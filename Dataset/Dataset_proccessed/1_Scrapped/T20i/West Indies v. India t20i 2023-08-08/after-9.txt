BYBEN SOUTHBY

India are still in the T20 International series thanks to a crucial win over West Indies where Suryakumar Yadav made history as the second-fastest player to hit 100 T20I sixes. India won the third T20I by seven wickets on Tuesday to keep their series chances alive, where Yadav blasted 83 runs off just 44 balls to equal Chris Gayle’s record. The fourth T20 match will take place on Saturday.
