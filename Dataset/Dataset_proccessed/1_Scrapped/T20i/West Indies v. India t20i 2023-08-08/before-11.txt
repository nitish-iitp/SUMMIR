Defending 150, the West Indies bowlers – Romario Shepherd (two wickets), Jason Holder (two wickets), and, Obed McCoy (two wickets) – did well to restrict India to 145/6.

While in the second T20I India batted first but could not go on to post a challenging total despite a maiden fifty from Tilak Varma. Varma’s gritty knock helped his side to reach a modest total of 152. Defending 153, the Indian bowlers did well to pick up two early scalps in the first over itself, however, they were unsuccessful in their bid to stop West Indies batter, Nicholas Pooran, who slammed a crucial knock of 67 runs and continued his brilliant run of form from the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2023.

A good bowling effort from Indian bowlers saw West Indies losing eight wickets at the score of 129. However, tail ending batters, Akeal Hosein and Alzarri Joseph held their nerves to take their team over the line as West Indies won the game by two wickets. For India, their pick of the bowlers were Hardik Pandya and Yuzvendra Chahal, who bagged three and two wickets respectively.
