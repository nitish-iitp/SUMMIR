India vs West Indies 3rd T20I Live score: SKY has blazed a half century in just 23 balls

India vs West Indies 3rd T20I Highlights: Suryakumar Yadav was back to his belligerent best as India stayed alive in the series with a seven-wicket win over the West Indies in the third T20I here on Tuesday. West Indies skipper Rovman Powell's whirlwind 40 not out off 19 balls pushed the hosts to 159 for five after Kuldeep Yadav (3/28) stemmed the flow of runs in the middle overs. Debutant Yashavi Jaiswal (1) and Shubman Gill (6) got out cheaply in run chase before Suryakumar came up with a special 83 off 44 balls to help India gun down the target in 17.5 overs. Tilak Varma (49 not out off 37) was happy to play second fiddle to his senior Mumbai Indians teammate in their 87-run stand. Tilak missed his second straight fifty in his debut series as skipper Hardik Pandya (20 not out off 15) hit the winning six. West Indies lead the five-match series 2-1 with the next game to played in Lauderhill, Florida, on Saturday.

IND vs WI Live score: India win by 7 wickets!

Pandya wins it with a six.The series is alive and it is largely thanks to the MI boys. Tilak Varma, who is walking back with Shai Hope discussing what seems to be the bat he is using, is unbeaten on 49 off 37. Suryakumar Yadav earlier hit 83 off 44. Pandya, meanwhile, has finished unbeaten on 20 off 14. India keep the series alive and it is the kind of dominant batting performance that hasn't really been seen in this series and indeed, for much of the limited overs leg of this tour apart from the third ODI.
