The 10th edition of the Caribbean Premier League is scheduled to begin on 1st September 2022 (IST), with the defending champions St Kitts & Nevis Patriots taking on Jamaica Tallawahs in the curtain raiser. The tournament this year will run longer than it normally does and will finish on the 1st of October at Providence Stadium in Guyana. Trinbago Knight Riders, the brother franchise of Kolkata Knight Riders, are the most successful franchise in the competition, with four trophies to their name. Meanwhile, Jamaica Tallawahs won it twice, just like Barbados Royals, the brother franchise of Rajasthan Royals.

Coming to the format of the tournament, all six teams will face each other twice, and the top four teams of the league will qualify for the playoffs. For a change in the rules, the top two teams of this year will play Qualifier 1, while the third and fourth teams will play the Eliminator. The loser of qualifier one and the winner of the Eliminator will battle it out in Qualifier 2 to play the winner of Qualifier 1 in the finals. This is the exact same format as how IPL is being played in India.

The tournament will be taking place across four venues. From 1st September to 5th September, Warner Park at St. Kitts will organize all the games. St. Lucia will then take over from September 7th till September 12. Trinidad will then host from September 14 to 19 and Guyana from the 21st of September till the finals on 1st October.
