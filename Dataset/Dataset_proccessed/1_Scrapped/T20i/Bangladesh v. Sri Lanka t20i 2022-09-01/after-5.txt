Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh, Asia Cup 2022 Highlights: An extraordinary game of cricket ended with Sri Lanka beating Bangladesh by two wickets with four balls to spare.
Dasun Shanaka and Kusal Mendis put Sri Lanka on top and they ended up winning by two wickets.&nbsp;

Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh, Asia Cup 2022 Highlights: Sri Lanka have come back from their batting debacle against Afghanistan to complete their second highest T20I chase of all time. They were helped to a certain extent by the number of extras that Bangladesh bowled, although Shakib Al Hasan's side were quite brilliant in nearly every other department of the game in Dubai. Kusal Mendis was the highest scorer for Sri Lanka having made 60 off 37 balls while captain Dasun Shanaka made 45 off 33 balls. Their partnership put Sri Lanka on top in a game in which momentum swung both ways on a number of occasions

SL vs BAN Live: SIX! 100 up for Bangladesh!

Afif takes on the long boundary and clears it with ease. Hasaranga bowls to his pads, whips out a sweep and the ball goes sailing over deep square leg. 

Sep 1, 2022 8:28 PM IST
Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh Live: BOWLED HIM! SHAKIB GOES!

Ripper from Theekshana. Shakib has been making room for himself throughout the innings and Theekshana gets that ball to turn just a little bit. Ball crashes on to the middle stump and Shakib seems absolutely livid with himself for that. 

Shakib Al Hasan b Theekshana 24 (22), Bangladesh 87/4 in 10.4 overs

SL vs BAN Live: Bangladesh 85/3 in 10 overs

Talk about entertainment! The momentum has shifted one way to another already in these first 10 overs, at the end of which, it is with Bangladesh thanks to their captain Shakib Al Hasan. He is on 23 off 20 balls and he has Afif Hossain at the other end with 6 off three.

Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh Live: FOUR AGAIN!

Same shot from Shakib, maybe a little more close to fine leg but it doesn't matter, it runs to the boundary anyhow. Shakib starting to look more assured now. 

Sep 1, 2022 8:21 PM IST
Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh, Asia Cup live: FOUR! 

Very first ball of the 10th over from Karunaratne and Shakib moves across and scoops it between the keeper and fine leg. 6000 T20 runs for Shakib. 

Sep 1, 2022 8:19 PM IST
Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh Live: FOUR! Class from Shakib

Pitched at leg, Shakib makes room and goes over short extra cover. That races to the boundary. Right after that, Shakib sends Bangladesh to panic stations, trying a big mow down the ground. It had no distance on it but it was too much distance for long-on to cover as well and he is safe. 

Sep 1, 2022 8:14 PM IST
SL vs BAN Live: OUT! Mushfiqur falls!

That is a huge wicket, what a delivery from Chamika Karunaratne to get it as well. Back of a length jagging way, Mushfiqur tries to stay in the line of the ball, ends up getting an outside edge to the wicketkeeper.

Mushfiqur c Mendis b Karunaratne 4 (5), Bangladesh 63/3 in 8 overs

Sep 1, 2022 8:07 PM IST
Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh Live: OUT! Miraz falls!

Wanindu Hasaranga makes the difference, big cross-batted slog from Miraz and he loses his stumps. 

Mehidy Hasan Miraz b Hasaranga 38 (26), Bangladesh 58/2 in 6.5 overs

SL vs BAN, Asia Cup 2022 Live: FOUR! Miraz setting the field on fire

The field is in and so Miraz has settled in outside the inner circle. Bouncer from Madushanka and Miraz slashes at it, goes well over the infield and reaches the boundary. He is on 36 off 22 now, Bangladesh are 53/1 in 5.4 overs. What a start. 

Sep 1, 2022 7:54 PM IST
Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh Live: SIX! What a shot from Miraz!

A scoop while hardly bending down straight over the wicketkeeper's head. Miraz has been sent in to get that pinch-hitting start, he is doing exactly that at the moment. He is on 24 off 16 now.
