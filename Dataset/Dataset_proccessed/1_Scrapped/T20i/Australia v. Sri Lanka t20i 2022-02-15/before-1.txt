Australia has been left sweating on another injury scare ahead of its tour of Pakistan, with fast bowler Michael Neser unable to see out Queensland's 50-over game against New South Wales on Monday.

Key points:
Michael Neser was selected in Australia's 18-man squad for the tour of Pakistan
Sean Abbott and Mark Steketee are on standby to replace Neser if he can not take his place
Steve Smith suffered a concussion playing for Australia's T20 side on Sunday

Neser bowled only two balls in the rain-affected match before pulling up with a side strain. 

Neser was selected as part of the 18-man squad for the Test series in Pakistan, which begins on March 4, but will now need further assessment to see if he can take part in that series.

This injury came just 24 hours after Steve Smith suffered a concussion while fielding for Australia's T20 team against Sri Lanka at the SCG.

Smith has pulled out of the final match of that series, but is expected to be okay for the Pakistan Tests.

Neser made his Test debut in the second Ashes Test this summer in Adelaide, but spent most of the summer travelling in a supporting role with the Australian team.

Sean Abbott and Mark Steketee are both on standby according to Australian selector George Bailey, and could be called upon should Neser be unable to travel.

A number of Australian internationals played in the match at the Gabba, which was reduced to 24 overs aside due to bad weather.

Marnus Labuschagne made 15 and Usman Khawaja 7, while Mitch Swepson took 1-31 from his five overs.

NSW chased down the revised target of 101 to win with 18 balls and five wickets to spare.
