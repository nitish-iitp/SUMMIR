Australia quick Mitchell Starc bowled one of the worst deliveries you will ever see in international cricket during his side's T20I clash with Sri Lanka.

During the 18th over of Sri Lanka's innings, Starc attempted to bowl a slower ball, but the ball slipped out of his hand and sailed past wicketkeeper Matthew Wade towards the boundary.

The ball went so high and wide that it was given as a no-ball by the umpires and cost Australia five runs.

Speaking on commentary, former Australia fast bowler Brett Lee compared the delivery to the infamous wide Steve Harmison bowled with the first ball of the 2006-07 Ashes series.

"I was going to say it was Steve Harmison-like, but it wasn’t even that," Lee said. "I don’t reckon I’ve ever seen a ball go that wide while I’ve been commentating."

Speaking to Fox Sports, Glenn Maxwell was much more diplomatic, saying: "It wasn't his finest ball of the night, but it is starting to get really dewey out here.

"It has been quite hot and can get a bit sweaty as well and hopefully it’s a sign that it’s going to be hard for the Sri Lankan’s to hold onto the ball as well. There is a bit of moisture around and you can forgive him for doing that."

However, Maxwell did joke that Starc may be on the receiving end of some jokes from his teammates.

He said: "I can tell you right now that that is definitely coming up in conversations. I think we’re done with net sessions as well this series so you don't have to worry about Starcy bowling to you in the nets any more.

"So you can bring it up as much as you want without any repercussions coming back at you."

Ultimately, Australia won the T20I by six wickets, with Kane Richardson named player of the match after taking 3-21.
