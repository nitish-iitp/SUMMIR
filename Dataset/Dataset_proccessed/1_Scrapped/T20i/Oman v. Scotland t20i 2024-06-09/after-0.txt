Scotland have made an impressive start to their campaign. Their tournament opener was washed out due to rain but they gave a good account of themselves against defending champions England having scored 90/0 in 10 overs before weather had the final say. In their second clash though, Scotland defeated Namibia by five wickets to take the top spot in Group B before being replaced by Australia.

They are up against Oman now, a team that has lost both their matches so far. They faced Namibia first and lost in a Super Over. Australia then defeated them relatively comfortably by 39 runs.
