PAK vs NAM Live Score T20 World Cup 2021

Pakistan vs Namibia T20 World Cup 2021 Highlights: Pakistan have qualified for the semi-finals in the 2021 T20 World Cup with a comprehensive victory over Namibia in the Super 12. After opting to bat, Pakistan put 189/2 on the board as openers Babar Azam (70) and Mohammad Rizwan (79*) put on a second 100+ partnership in the Super 12 stage, adding 113 runs for the first wicket. Mohammad Hafeez also played an important cameo towards the ending stage of the innings, remaining unbeaten on 32 off just 16 balls. In the chase, Namibia were restricted to 145/5 in 20 overs. David Wiese (43*) was the top-scorer for the side, while Hasan Ali, Imad Wasim, Haris Rauf and Shadab Khan took a wicket each....Read More

Wiese with significant contribution again

Wiese has once again been key to Namibia in this game, even as the side has failed to go past the winning mark. After being the most economical bowler (1/30 in four overs), Wiese is currently on 29, as Namibia attempt to minimise the losing margin.

One over remaining. Namibia 128/5. Target: 190

Nov 2, 2021 10:52 PM IST
Smit departs

JJ Smit is taken aback as Haris Rauf takes away the pace, deceiving the batter with a slower one. Smit, who had already committed to the shot, fails to adjust as the ball goes sailing in the air.

It doesn't find the distance and Fakhar Zaman takes an easy catch on mid-on.

Namibia 111/5 in 17 overs. Target: 190

83 needed off 24 deliveries

The Pakistan supporters are roaring at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium as the side is cruising to a semi-final spot in the 2021 T20 World Cup. Only four overs away from the final-four!

Nov 2, 2021 10:36 PM IST
4 down

Williams now departs. In a bid to up the ante, the batter had no choice but to go for the big hits.

Shadab finally get a breakthrough!

Namibia 101/4 in 15 overs. Target: 190

Nov 2, 2021 10:28 PM IST
Erasmus dismissed!

Shaheen dropped Erasmus in the previous over, but Shadab Khan makes no mistake as he takes an easy catch at cover to send the Namibian captain back. Imad Wasim takes his first wicket.

Namibia 84/3 in 13 overs. Target: 190

Nov 2, 2021 10:26 PM IST
Shaheen drops Erasmus

Erasmus charges down the track but mistimes a length delivery. He goes straight over bowler's head and almost instantly realises that he will be caught. However, Shaheen drops the catch near the long-off boundary.

Namibia 78/2 in 12 overs

Nov 2, 2021 10:22 PM IST
1 run of 11th over

An excellent over from Haris Rauf straight after the drinks break. Craig Williams all at sea against Rauf's seething pace, as he fails to connect four of the six deliveries in the over. While one got a bottom edge and was deviated to Williams' stumps, the batter finally found a connection on the last ball for a single towards cover.

Namibia 71/2 in 11 overs

Nov 2, 2021 10:14 PM IST
Namibia 70/2 in 10 overs

A couple of boundaries from Gerhard Erasmus as Namibia breach the 7 rpo rate at the halfway mark of the innings. Pakistan were 69/0 at the same stage, but Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan steered a tremendous recovery, with a special cameo from Mohammad Hafeez as well.

Can Namibia repeat the same and pull out an upset?

Nov 2, 2021 10:10 PM IST
Wicket no.2!

Stephen Baard is run-out on a run-a-ball 29. A lack of communication between the two batters. Craig Williams screamed his lungs out towards Baard to go back to his crease, but the batter seemed to be in his own zone as he turned to return for a second.

Namibia 55/2 in 8.4 overs 

Nov 2, 2021 10:07 PM IST
50 up for Namibia

Namibia bring their 50 in the 9th over of the innings. Craig Williams slams a six off Mohammad Hafeez to take the side past 50.
