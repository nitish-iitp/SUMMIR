SA vs BAN T20 World Cup 2021 highlights

SA vs BAN Highlights T20 World Cup 2021: Temba Bavuma played a captain's knocks as South Africa knocked off the 85-run target 13.3 overs to beat Bangladesh by 6 wickets. Mahedi Hasan cleaned up Quinton de Kock after Taskin Ahmed got rid of Reeza Hendricks. Taskin struck again to remove Markram and send tremors down the South African camp. Anrich Nortje finished things off with a double strike as South Africa bowled Bangladesh out for 84. Tabraiz Shamsi got two wickets in the middle to send Bangladesh into a deeper hope. Anrich Nortje and Dwaine Pretorius came to the party after Kagiso Rabada dismissed Naim Sheikh, and Soumya Sarkar in successive balls and then removed Mushfiqur Rahim for a duck. South Africa captain Temba Bavuma won the toss and had no hesitation in opting to bowl first. South Africa are fielding an unchanged side while Bangladesh have made two changes. Shakib Al Hasan is injured and Mustafizur Rahman is resting. ...Read More

Dussen departs

Nasum to Dussen: OUT! He wanted to finish it off in this over and in the process ended up skying one. A brilliant catch running backwards by Shoriful, tells you that there is no shortage of effort from Bangladesh's side. SA, however, need only 5 runs to win this mattch handsomely.

All too easy for SA now

Nasum to Bavuma: FOUR! Streaky! Short and outside off, Temba Bavuma hangs back and looks to cut. The ball goes off the outside edge towards third man for a boundary.

Bavuma hits another four

Sarkar to Bavuma: FOUR! Mid on was up in the circle and Bavuma was fully aware of that. He used Sarkar's length delivery to just lift it over the in-field and get an easy boundary. South Africa marching along now.

Bavuma on the charge

Nasum to Bavuma: SIX! What a shot from Bavuma. He may be of short stature but that doesn't mean he lacks power. Nasum dragged it short and Bavuma was very quick to transfer his weight to the backfoot and pull it away deep into stands. First six of the South African innings and there's their fifty up. 

Nov 2, 2021 6:02 PM IST
Bavuma breaks the shackles

Taskin to Bavuma: FOUR! Brilliant from the South African captain. Slightly overpitched from Taskin, perhaps looking for that extra swing but this time Bavuma was up to the task. He drove it on the up but after he had covered the swing with a good stride. 

Nov 2, 2021 5:54 PM IST
Taskin removes Markram

Taskin to Markram: OUT! Taskin Ahmed gets his second. Aiden Markram is out for a duck. It was a fast delivery which swung away and Markram, trying to drive on the up, gets an outside edge. Bangladesh are not making it easy for South Africa. They are South Africa 33/3, chasing 85 to win.

Nov 2, 2021 5:49 PM IST
Mahedi cleans up de Kock

Mahedi to de Kock: OUT! Mahedi Hasan has the last laugh. He cleans up de Kock after being hit for two fours.  South Africa 28/2, chasing 85 to win

Nov 2, 2021 5:45 PM IST
De Kock on the attack

Back-to-back boundaries for de Kock. He has decided to take the attack to Bangladesh off-spinner Mahedi Hassan and it has worked so far. 

Nov 2, 2021 5:41 PM IST
Dussen joins the party

Shoriful to Dussen: FOUR! Silky touch there from Dussen. Shoriful just strays down the pads and enough for Dussen to just use his wonderful wrists to work it pas the inner field and into the boundary. 

Nov 2, 2021 5:39 PM IST
De kock gets a boundary

Taskin to de Kock: FOUR! Pulled away with disdain. You can't bowl there to de Kock. Taskin tried to mix it up with a bouncer but he didn't get the line right and de Kock smacked it past fine leg to collect his maiden four. This should take some of the pressure off. SA 16/1 after 3 overs.
