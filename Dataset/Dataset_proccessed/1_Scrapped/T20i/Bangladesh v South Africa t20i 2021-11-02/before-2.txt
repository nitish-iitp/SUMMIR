IND vs NZ Highlights T20 World Cup 2021.

India Vs New Zealand Highlights: New Zealand registered their first win of T20 World Cup 2021 as they romped home to an eight-wicket win against India in Dubai. After being put in to bat, India lost Ishan Kishan and KL Rahul, both their openers, inside the Powerplay. While Trent Boult got the better of Kishan (4), Southee sent Rahul packing on 18. India then reached 41-3 after 8 overs as Ish Sodhi dismissed Rohit Sharma for a run-a-ball 14. India then lost Virat Kohli to Sodhi on 9 before Adam Milne cleaned up Rishabh Pant on 12. India could only score 73/5 after 15 overs. Eventually, courtesy of a few late boundaries from Hardik Pandya (23) and Ravindra Jadeja (26 not out), India posted 110/7 in 20 overs. Boult ended with a three-wicket haul. In response, New Zealand got to 44/1 after 6 overs in their Super 12 match in Dubai. Jasprit Bumrah sent Martin Guptill packing on 20 and just when India looked like putting on the breaks, Daryl Mitchell began to attack and find the boundaries. After 10 overs, NZ posted 83/1. Bumrah, in his final spell, outfoxed Mitchell with a slower delivery as he dismissed the Kiwi batter on 49 to deny him his maiden 50. However, skipper Kane Williamson helped the team over the line with 8 wickets and 5.3 overs to spare.

That's all, thank you so much!

Well, long story short; India never turned up and New Zealand. There is no other way to describe this heavy defeat for India. As for the Kiwis, they showed signs of confidence during the Pakistan game and today, they got the job done and how. We will back tomorrow with the live coverage of another Super 12 game.

Until then, this is Shivansh Gupta signing off. Goonight. CIAO!

India vs New Zealand: Kane Williamson, the winning team, speaks

"There's always planning going into game, but this was a great performance against a side that puts up a fight. The surface wasn't easy to find rhythm on, and the way the openers came out really set things up for the chase. It's just about adapting to the conditions as well as we could. The way the spinners kept applying pressure was commendable and it was a complete performance. We play against strong teams all the time, and there are match-winners in every side, and we commit to our brand of cricket and today was a good example of that. Ish is an outstanding white-ball bowler, and he's very experienced in playing T20 cricket, having played in different leagues all over the world"

India vs New Zealand: Virat Kohli, the losing team, speaks

“We weren't brave enough when we entered the field, but NZ sustained that pressure. Every time we took a chance, we lost a wicket. It's most often a result of hesitation of whether you should go for a shot or not. When you play for India, there are loads of expectations. We are watched, people come to the stadium and everyone who plays for India needs to embrace that and cope with it. We haven't done that in these two games, and that's why we haven't won. We have to be optimistic and positive and take calculated risks. We have to disconnect from the pressure and continue with our process, and play a positive brand of cricket. There's a lot of cricket to play in the tournament.”

Ish Sodhi is the player of the match. He says: “I am usually big on pre-match prep, with this bubble life we haven't been able to see the ground until the day we come to the ground. The wicket here was one we had to adapt to pretty quickly. It was very different to what we played in Sharjah. The boundary sizes were very different. A big part of our game is using the bowl spin bowlers in the middle.”

Just 28 needed from 60 balls. Can Bumrah bring some life in this content before the imminent result?

For now, the answer is no. NZ are 89/1 after 11 overs, need 22 runs from 54 balls.

Oct 31, 2021 9:58 PM IST
Shardul Thakur is brought on and he takes a pounding

It's going to be a walk in the park for the Kiwis from here on.

Can Shardul, who has knack of picking up wickets, do some damage?

SIX! Just as I was typing this, Mitchell decided to swat the short ball over deep square leg for 6. 

FOUR! SLAPPPPED! A nothing delivery from Thakur. A rank, non-lethal half tracker. No one in the cow corner to save 4 and that allows Mitchell to collect 4 more. 

FOUR! WHHHHACKK! EXHIBITION BATTING FROM DARYL! Thakur overcompensates himself. Goes full and into the slot. Mitchell backs away a little, clears the front leg and hammers the ball past a wide mid-off.

NZ are 83/1 after 10 overs.
