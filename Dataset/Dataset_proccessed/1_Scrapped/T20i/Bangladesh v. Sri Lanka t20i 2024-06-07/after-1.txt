T20 World Cup 2024 Highlights: Bangladesh beat Sri Lanka for the first time in the history of T20 World Cups. The Tigers won the game by 2 wickets in what turned out to be a thrilling chase of 125 by 2 wickets and 8 wickets to spare.

Sri Lanka were 8 down and had an outside chance to maintain their winning streak against Bangladesh. But Dasun Shanka bowled a full toss in the 18th over which Mahmudullah smashed for a six to bridge the gap between a win and Bangladesh.

Earlier, Rishad Hossain produced a brilliant spell of leg-spin as Bangladesh fought back to restrict Sri Lanka to 124-9 in their Group D T20 World Cup match at Grand Prairie on Friday.

Sri Lanka made a fast start, rattling their way to 53-2 in six overs and they  progressed to 100-3 after 14 overs with Pathum Nissanka’s 47 from 28 including eight boundaries (one six).

But then the 21-year-old Rishad struck twice in successive balls to totally change the momentum of the innings.
