Bangladesh Vs Sri Lanka, T20 World Cup Highlights: BAN Withstand Batting Collapse, Win Cliffhanger By 2 Wickets

The 15th match of ICC T20 World Cup 2024 was a low-scoring thriller in which Bangladesh trumped Sri Lanka by two wickets at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas on Saturday, June 8. The Najmul Hossain Shanto-led Bangla Tigers restricted the Lankans to 124 runs in the first innings. They began the chase well but nearly made a royal mess of it, losing five wickets for just 24 runs. But Towhid Hridoy (40 off 20), Litton Das (38 off 36) and Mahmudullah (16 not out off 13 balls) helped Bangladesh get over the line in the 19th over.

What Captains Said At Toss

Wanindu Hasaranga: We don't mind batting first. We are going with two genuine fast bowlers and two genuine spinners, two seam bowling all rounders. It depends on the match situation on where I come out to bat.

Najmul Hossain Shanto: We expect some seam and swing early on. The top four have been doing a lot of hard work in the last few days. It (the pitch) looks a bit dry.

 8 Jun 2024, 06:07:55 am IST
Nissanka Away With Boundary 

Play gets underway, and Pathum Nissanka is off the mark in breezy fashion with a pick-up towards midwicket for a one-bounce four. Tanzim Hasan Sakib has the ball.

 8 Jun 2024, 06:24:34 am IST
Kusal Mendis Gone, But Runs Continue To Flow

Taskin Ahmed gets rid of SL opener Kusal Mendis, but the boundaries continue to flow in the powerplay as the Lankans are at 40 for 1 after 4.2 overs.

Nissanka Falls After Quickfire 47

Pathum Nissanka (47 off 28) has to walk back to the dugout without a fifty to his name, as Mustafizur Rahman has him caught at mid off. Sri Lanka are three down for 70 runs after nine overs.

 8 Jun 2024, 07:01:14 am IST
De Silva, Asalanka Rebuild

Charith Asalanka and Dhananjay de Silva are at the crease for Sri Lanka, and trying to rebuild after the fall of the dangerous Pathum Nissanka. SL are at 85 for three after 12 overs. The match is evenly poised as of now.

Rishad Hossain Picks Two In Two

Rishad Hossain dismisses Charith Asalanka and SL skipper Wanindu Hasaranga off successive deliveries as the Lankans lose half their batting line-up inside the 15th over. The run rate, too, has dropped below seven RPO.

SL End Up With Below-Par 124 For Nine

Tanzim Hasan Sakib concedes just seven runs and sees the back of Angelo Mathews in the 20th over, as Bangladesh limit to a 124-run total. Looks like an eminently achievable target; we will find out soon.

 8 Jun 2024, 08:04:40 am IST
BAN Rocked Early

Dhananjaya de Silva and N Thushara send back Soumya Sarkar and Tanzid Hasan respectively in the first two overs to jolt Bangladesh straight away.

Litton Das Looking To Stabilize BAN Innings

After the early wickets, Bangladesh wicketkeeper-batter Litton Das is trying to settle things down with the bat in their chase of SL's 125-run target. The Bangla Tigers need 76 runs off 72 balls with seven wickets in hand.

 8 Jun 2024, 09:02:46 am IST
Tigers On Course In Chase

Bangladesh now need 30 runs off 42 balls and with the experienced Shakib Al Hasan alongside Litton Das, the match is Bangla Tigers' to lose from here.

 8 Jun 2024, 09:18:14 am IST
BAN Lose Das, Shakib

Just when it seemed like Bangladesh were running away with the match, Sri Lanka send back both Litton Das and Shakib Al Hasan to make things interesting. The Bangla Tigers need 14 runs from 18 balls now, with four wickets in hand.

 8 Jun 2024, 09:31:30 am IST
It's All Happening!

Nuwan Thushara takes two wickets off two balls, Mahmudullah smacks Shanaka for a six, two wickets in hand and three runs to get. A bonafide thriller unfolding in Dallas, Texas.

 8 Jun 2024, 09:40:24 am IST
Mahmudullah Takes BAN Home 

A frenetic finish ensues. Two to get off seven balls, Mahmudullah scampers across for a quick single. Direct hit and he was gone. The throw misses, however, and overthrows result. Bangladesh win the cliffhanger of a contest by two wickets.

What POTM Rishad Hossain Said

Rishad Hossain is the Player Of The Match for his three-wicket spell (3/22). Here is what he had to say after Bangladesh's win: "I tried my best and stuck to my strengths. I was trying to keep it normal for the hat-trick delivery and was keen on executing a good ball."

 8 Jun 2024, 09:58:58 am IST
What Losing Captain Wanindu Hasaranga Said

Wanindu Hasaranga: "We started really well in the first 10 overs but in the middle overs we batted badly. Bowling is our strength. If we had got 150-160 we could have won with our bowling attack. The batters let us down in both games. We still have two games and we will try to do our best. Maheesh (Theekshana) and myself are the two main spinners and we have to attack."

 8 Jun 2024, 10:00:22 am IST
What Winning Captain Najmul Hossain Shanto Said

Najmul Hossain Shanto: "Happy with the way everyone played. Run chase wasn't easy but we didn't bat well to be honest. Pitch was pretty good. Litton (Das) showed his skill today. (Towhid) Hridoy the way he played that over it helped us. Happy for the crowd and I hope they will come again and support us."
