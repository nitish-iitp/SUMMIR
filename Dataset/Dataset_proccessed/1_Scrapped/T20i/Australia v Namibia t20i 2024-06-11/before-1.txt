Sri Lanka faces Nepal in the T20 Cricket World Cup.

The 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup is underway, co-hosted by the United States and the West Indies. This is the ninth time this event has been staged. In 2022, Australia hosted this event, with England defeating Pakistan to win the tournament. We’re currently in the group stage of the tournament, with Tuesday featuring a Group D match between Sri Lanka and Nepal. Neither team is currently in position to advance to the Super 8, though there’s still time, especially for Nepal if it can get a win here. Nepal lost to the Netherlands by six wickets in its only match so far, while Sri Lanka has lost both of its contests, falling to South Africa by six wickets and Bangladesh by two wickets.
