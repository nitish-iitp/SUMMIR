!

The captain of Australia, Mitchell Marsh says that it was a great bowling performance and with the help around, it was a complete bowling effort. Feels that it is very important to qualify for Super 8 as early as possible. Hopes to win against Scotland and go into the Super 8 with good momentum. Lauds Adam Zampa for his effort and says that the team is lucky to have him. Adds that Zampa loves the big stages and delivers under pressure. Ends by saying that they have got their families here and with the wind around, they are enjoying it.

The captain of Namibia, Merwe Erasmus says it was a tough game. Adds that they were outplayed. Mentions a big side like Australia will expose you if you aren’t there mentally. Mentions they tried to fight fire with fire but that did not happen. Ends by admitting they weren’t good enough.

!

Adam Zampa is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his brilliance with the ball. He says that it is a nice feeling to get the win and qualify for the Super 8 stage. Shares that the ball has been coming out of his hand nicely. Adds that he is being encouraged by the captain to pick wickets in the middle phase.

Time for the presentation ceremony...

!

Namibia were just overpowered. They were no match for the Aussies. 72 was just never going to be enough but they’ll be happy they got a wicket but overall, they’ll be very disappointed with their performance.

!

A comprehensive win then for the Aussies and they have sealed their progression to the next round. This result was never in doubt once they bowled Namibia out for a low score, it was just a matter of how quickly they scored the runs and they have done it in no time. The openers came out all guns blazing and wanted to get on with it quickly. David Warner fell but Travis Head continued with Mitchell Marsh. The two continued to attack and in the end, they helped their side get over the line.
