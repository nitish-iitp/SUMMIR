Australia captain Mitch Marsh stops just short of saying that his side will rest players in their final group B match against Scotland, with progress to the Super Eight stage already assured:

“It was a great performance from our bowling team. It was a beautiful wicket, a bit of swing out there, but a professional performance. It’s great to qualify for the Super Eight. We get really busy after the game against Scotland so we will try to manage it. But hopefully we can win that and then move into the Super Eight.”

Namibia captain Gerhard Erasmus says the gap between the top and his side was all too apparent against Australia:

“You can’t sit back against the best in the world. That is one thing we learned tonight. The skill gap is there but you can close that by fighting fire with fire. We did not do that and a good side like Australia will expose you if you are not willing to mentally step up to their level on a particular day.”

Adam Zampa is player of the match for taking four for 12 off his four overs, while becoming the first Australian men’s bowler to reach 100 wickets in T20Is.

“I bowled a couple of pies tonight to get some wickets, that happens though.” Zampa said. “But the ball feels like it’s coming out well and I’m being encouraged to take wickets through the middle [overs].”

Australia skipper Mitch Marsh didn’t seem to notice too many of the pies that Zampa suggested he was throwing down.

“If you look at his career over the last four, five years, he’s probably our most important player in terms of how we structure up,” Marsh said. “He loves the big moment, loves the pressure. That comes with experience. He’s bowling beautifully at the moment and we’re lucky to have him.”

Australia win by nine wickets!

The Australia top order were barely tested as David Warner gave them a flying start with 20 runs off eight balls, then Travis Head took over to blast an undefeated 34 from 17.

Captain Mitch Marsh didn’t have to raise a sweat as he partnered Head to the 73-run target while amassing 18 off nine balls for himself. He finished the job with a four, six, four onslaught even before the end of Australia’s powerplay.

Namibia were always unlikely to be able to defend such a modest total against the explosive Australia batting line-up, which chased it down in only 5.4 overs to send another warning shot across the Caribbean.

It is the second fastest victory in men’s T20 World Cup history in terms of balls remaining, as Australia still had 86 up their sleeve.

Australia have climbed to the top of Group B and are now through to the Super Eight stage with one more match to play against Scotland.

5th over: Australia 60-1 (Head 34, Marsh 4) Travis Head looks frankly unstoppable here as he smacks three boundaries from the over. The first is a ramp shot over point taken off middle stump, then next when picking up Trumpelmann’s slower ball to go over mid-on. Another slower ball to end the innings almost claims the crucial wicket, as Head swings hard but misses it in flight.

4th over: Australia 47-1 (Head 22, Marsh 4) Namibia skipper Erasmus brings himself into the attack with Australia off to a flyer. Head shows him little respect with a slog six over cow corner, but Erasmus fights back with five dot balls giving Namibia some much-needed respite.

3rd over: Australia 41-1 (Head 16, Marsh 4) Australia blast 19 off the over as they race to within 32 runs of their target after only three overs. Ben Shikongo has no answers to Head’s onslaught, the Australia opener firstly using the pace of the ball to guide it to third man for four. The next ball was barely outside off but Head is untroubled and sends it over the rope at mid-off, then with Shikongo looking rattled the ball drops too short and the left-hander finds another four through mid-wicket. Marsh joins the fun once finally getting on strike, with a casual boundary over mid-off to get off the mark.

2nd over: Australia 22-1 (Head 1, Marsh 0) Four, four, six and out as Warner punishes anything that is even a touch wide but then holds out trying to hit down the ground. Warner’s first shot races through cover to the boundary, the next is the best yet as it glides closer to mid-off. The six comes over square leg as Wiese drops too short and Warner leans back to put it away. The Namibia pacer gets his revenge next ball but Warner was never likely to hang around with such a small target in play.

WICKET! Australia 21-1 (Warner c Trumpelmann b Wiese 20)

Warner looked to be a man in a hurry as he blasted 14 from the first three balls of Wiese’s over, but then mis-timed a straight drive to find Trumpelmann at mid-on. The ball came off the toe of the bat to end an all too brief but blistering knock from the veteran left-hander.

1st over: Australia 7-0 (Warner 6, Head 1) Hit and run from Warner and his opening partner Head is almost gone without facing a ball. Warner drops the ball at his feet on the off-side and sets off immediately, Head is a touch slow to respond and the diving throw goes just wide of the stumps with the Australia batter well short of his crease. Trumpelmann bowls out a tame over which includes a brash shot from Warner through extra cover for the first boundary of the innings.

While it will take a remarkable turnaround for Namibia to win from here, we at least have a game on in Antigua while the Sri Lanka and Nepal clash in Florida has been abandoned due to rain.

Both sides take their first point of the tournament but the result leaves Sri Lanka needing other results and weather to fall their way, as well as inflicting a heavy defeat on Netherlands.

South Africa are now the first team through to the Super Eight stage, though Australia are likely about an hour away from joining them.

It was a ruthless display from the Australia bowlers as they started well with early wickets then didn’t let up from there. Josh Hazlewood dismissed the two openers, and Pat Cummins also made an early breakthrough, but it was Adam Zampa that did the most damage to finish with four for 12.

The leg-spinner tore through the middle order to press home Australia’s advantage that leaves them chasing a modest target of 73.

Namibia were on the ropes as soon as they lost wickets in the third, fourth and fifth overs, with Gerhard Erasmus the only batter to pass 10. The skipper took 17 balls to get off the mark but finished on 36 from 43 which included four boundaries and sweetly-timed six. He protected the strike well late in the innings to ensure Namibia at least have something to bowl for but it is hard to see Australia being troubled from here.

WICKET! Namibia 72 all out (Shikongo c David b Stoinis 0)

Stoinis picks up his second of the over as Ben Shikongo looks to work a straight delivery to the leg-side. The No 11 gets a leading edge and Tim David dives low to take the catch not far over the bowler’s head. Jack Brassell is the undefeated batter on two.

WICKET! Namibia 72-9 (Erasmus c Maxwell b Stoinis 36)

A change of pace gets Erasmus as he looks to play the ball down the legside but skies it to Glenn Maxwell charging in off the rope. It took a low catch on the run to end the Namibia skipper’s fighting knock that has at least made a game of the clash with Australia.

16th over: Namibia 70-8 (Erasmus 36, Brassell 2) Erasmus smacks Cummins for six over mid wicket. He gave himself plenty of room to get under a shorter ball and put it away with relative ease. The skipper works the ball around and allows Brassell to face the last ball while handing back the strike for the next over as Namibia add some respectability to the scoreboard.

15th over: Namibia 60-8 (Erasmus 27, Brassell 1) It took Erasmus 17 deliveries to score his first run but he has now added 26 from 20 since then. A boundary comes from a rare misfield by Australia as Hazlewood misreads the ball at fine leg. Erasmus deserves all the credit for the four off the last ball of Ellis’s over, deftly guiding it to third man.

14th over: Namibia 51-8 (Erasmus 19, Brassell 0) The Namibia skipper is putting the foot down now as he risks running out of partners before they reach 20 overs. A neat dab through cover picks up a couple, but the shot of the over goes beyond extra cover and drops just inside the rope for four. Hazlewood is done now as well, finishing with two for 18.

03.45 CEST

13th over: Namibia 43-8 (Erasmus 10, Brassell 0) Zampa finishes with four for 12 from his allotted overs, giving up a few runs as Trumpelmann lets loose but also claiming two more wickets. The Australia leg-spinner truly is at the top of his game and looms as their key weapon for the remainder of this tournament.

WICKET! Namibia 43-8 (Scholtz b Zampa 0)

Zampa wraps up a mouth-watering spell with a cracker. His wrong un’ pitches outside off and Scholtz swings wildly without reading the turn as the ball jags back into the off-stump.

That takes Zampa to 100 T20I wickets as he becomes the first Australian men’s bowler to reach the landmark.

Trumpelmann thwacks Zampa for the first six of the innings over mid wicket but is out next ball trying much the same shot. The second pull shot lands safely in Maxwell’s hands and Zampa has his third.

12th over: Namibia 36-6 (Erasmus 10, Trumpelmann 1) Erasmus has played a composed knock so far but seems to finally be keen to move the score along. The skipper finds two outside off although he was fortunate the ball landed just wide of Marsh at mid off. Another skied shot drops safely for a single off Ellis.

11th over: Namibia 33-6 (Erasmus 7, Trumpelmann 1) Zampa can trouble the best batters in the world and he is making light work of the Namibia middle order. He picks up the wicket of Wiese with a wrong ‘un, then shows off his variety with a flat and straight delivery to the new batter Ruben Trumpelmann, followed by one given plenty of flight to Erasmus. The leg-spinner is in his groove and has two for five with one over to come.

10th over: Namibia 27-5 (Erasmus 6, Wiese 1) Cummins returns to the attack in the last over before drinks. Erasmus plays perhaps the best shot of the innings, as he steps back and whacks the Australia quick between mid off and cover for a boundary - just the third of the innings. Cummins goes to work on the line targeting middle and off stump but Erasmus and then Weise survive.

Namibia’s 27 is the second lowest score after 10 overs in a men’s T20 World Cup match.

9th over: Namibia 21-5 (Erasmus 1, Wiese 0) Zampa shows all the skills of the white-ball specialist that he is, first with a close call with Erasmus that Australia send upstairs for a review that shows the ball hit him outside the line. The Namibia skipper picks up his first run with a single after facing 17 balls, but that allows Zampa to strike to dismiss Green with a flat delivery that hardly moved.

WICKET! Namibia 21-5 (Green lbw b Zampa 1)

Adam Zampa traps Zane Green in front with a flatter delivery that the Namibia batter missed with a sweep. There was little question around that one as he carries through to the back leg, and the umpire raises the finger straight away.

03.17 CEST

8th over: Namibia 19-4 (Erasmus 0, Green 0) A fired up Nathan Ellis has joined the fun with a splendid start to the over that had Smit in trouble straight away. Zane Green is next in and finds a leg bye but Namibia are struggling to score let alone hold their wickets.

WICKET! Namibia 18-4 (Smit lbw b Ellis 3)

Nathan Ellis strikes in his first over the tournament and it is a cracking delivery that does it. The ball moves back off the seam to tie Smit in knots. The umpire signals not out but Mitch Marsh is the keenest to review, and it is the right call in the end with the replay showing the ball hit Smit high on the back pad but would have taken out the top of leg stump.

6th over: Namibia 17-3 (Erasmus 0, Smit 2) Stoinis is back on for the last over of the powerplay as Namibia are more focused on survival than fast scoring now. A rush of blood off the last delivery ends with a swing and a miss from Erasmus. That was close and a bit unnecessary from the skipper in this scenario.

5th over: Namibia 16-3 (Erasmus 0, Smit 1) Hazlewood’s consistently testing line and length has Namibia in all sorts. Bounce has been the pacer’s key weapon rather than finding much movement, but he almost finds a way through Smit’s defence with the last ball of the over as it nips back off the seam. A fantastic over and Hazlewood has two for 10 with one more to come.

Hazlewood and Maxwell combine again, this time to dismiss Michael van Lingen as Namibia are on the brink of collapse. The Australia pacer works his line outside off and van Lingen can’t help but dab at one that finds extra bounce and carries to Maxwell at backward point.

Davin tries to whack a flat batted shot back over Stoinis’ head but miscues and is fortunate that the ball falls safely for a single. Van Lingen punches an exquisite straight drive past Stoinis for another boundary, as Australia let Namibia off the leash early.

1st over: Namibia 7-0 (van Lingen 4, Davin 1) Some fine work from the ground staff means the start was delayed by little more than a minute.

Josh Hazlewood takes the new ball and has Michael van Lingen on the back foot immediately, as the opener joins Nikolaas Davin at the top of the order again. The Australia pacer loses his line and sends an erratic delivery down the legside but keeper Matt Wade gets a glove on it to knock it down and save three runs. A thick edge from the final ball instead picks up the first boundary of the game.

We’re about 20 minutes away from play getting under way in Antigua, but a wet outfield is causing a delay in Florida where Nepal and Sri Lanka are trying to get a game in. They might even have to resort to a five-overs-a-side match, which would be unfortunate for the teams but I suspect quite fun to watch.

Australia win the toss and elect to field first

Mitch Marsh calls “heads” and decides that Australia will bowl first.

“It looks like a nice wicket,” Marsh says, in ominous signs for Namibia.

Nathan Ellis in for Mitch Starc is Australia’s only change from the commanding win over England. “He didn’t quite pull up from the last match, so taking the safe approach there,” Marsh says.

Namibia have made three changes, while Gerhard Erasmus says they would have bowled first as well. The Eagles’ captain smiles at the idea of adding to the long list of upsets that have already taken place at this T20 World Cup.

Hello and welcome to live coverage of Australia and Namibia meeting in the 2024 T20 World Cup group stage match.

First ball at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua is 10:30am AEST (Tuesday June 11, 8:30pm local time).

Australia are flying high in Group B after a crushing victory over arch-rivals England although that followed a less convincing win over Oman in their tournament opener. A third consecutive triumph in the clash with Namibia would secure Mitch Marsh’s side’s progress to the Super Eight stage.

Namibia need an upset to keep their hopes of progressing to the next phase alive, after falling short against Scotland. But Gerhard Erasmus’ unpredictable side impressed in a thrilling Super Over victory against Oman that clinched Namibia’s first-ever win at a T20 World Cup.

The teams and toss will drop in about 15 minutes, but if you want to get in touch now or throughout the match, please email martin.pegan@theguardian.com or HMU on X / Twitter @martinpegan

Good luck to our Aussie men who take on Namibia today in game three of our @T20WorldCup campaign 🔥
