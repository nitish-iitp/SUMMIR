AFG v PNG Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024:

Afghanistan vs Papua New Guinea, T20 World Cup 2024: THREE WINS ON THE TROT FOR AFGHANISTAN, AND THEY OFFICIALLY LEAPFROG INTO THE SUPER 8s! A well-deserved one for the men in blue. Humbling Uganda in their first game, and then decimating the Kiwis in their second, and now defeating Papua New Guinea convincingly. Quite a dream run for them.

On the hunt for their third win, Afghanistan started off cautiously with openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran sizing up the conditions. Gurbaz didn’t let the loose deliveries go unpunished, finding a boundary and a six, but Zadran fell cheaply for a duck. Gurbaz too departed soon after trying to be extra aggressive, leaving Afghanistan struggling early at 11/2. However, Gulbadin Naib and Azmatullah Omarzai steadied the ship with a crucial partnership, ensuring the required rate never became a burden. Azmatullah Omarzai, after a sedate 13 perished but Gulbadin Naib held his end well staying unbeaten on 49, and with Mohammad Nabi’s contribution of 16 runs, they cruised through comfortably in the end.

We are back for Afghanistan’s reply. The two umpires make their way out to the centre as do the two Afghan openers. Assad Vala leads his troops out to the middle soon after. Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran will open the innings for Afghanistan. Alei Nao will start with the new ball for Papua New Guinea. Let’s play…

… THE RUN CHASE …

Right then, the Afghan bowlers have done their job, and it is up to the batters now to knock off the target of 96 runs and help Afghanistan book their place in the Super 8 stage. The Afghan openers, Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran, have done the heavy lifting so far, setting strong foundations for their team. Papua New Guinea will feel that if they remove the openers early, they can put pressure on the rest of the batting unit, which has not been tested yet.

Naveen-ul-Haq is in for a chat. He says it is an honour to play for the country and is delighted to achieve the milestone of 50 T20I wickets and says to achieve this feat in in the World Cup is very special. On being asked about the target, he says they can’t say anything about it as it is a funny game, and is hopeful that the batters chase it down.

As many as 4 run-outs occurred in the Papua New Guinea innings in what was yet another disappointing batting display. However, PNG will take heart from the fact that they were able to get close to 100, considering that they were 50-7 at one point in time. They started off on the wrong foot as a lackadaisical piece of running resulted in the departure of their skipper, Assad Vala. It went from bad to worse and after losing 5 wickets in the Powerplay, PNG were always playing catch up from there. There was no respite for the Oceania side after the Powerplay but having that said, Kipling Doriga and Chad Soper did well to keep the Afghan spinners at bay for a fair bit. Just as a steady stand was starting to build, a mix-up resulted in the downfall of Soper. Kipling Doriga held one end up and batted sensibly with the lower order to tick along. His 38-run stand with Alei Nao, the second-highest partnership for PNG in this tournament gave them a bit of hope. However, after Doriga fell, they were unable to maximize the back end of the innings.

Not the most clinical bowling effort, but Afghanistan get the job done eventually! The Afghan bowlers were way off from their usual standards, conceding as many as 25 extras. They will need to address these lapses and tighten up their performance if they want to continue their strong run in the tournament. Afghanistan were gifted an early breakthrough in the form of a run out and after that, the Afghan pace duo took over. As he has done in the competition so far, Fazalhaq Farooqi made the new ball count, yet again, striking off successive deliveries in his second over. Naveen-ul-Haq struck twice as well in his opening spell to pile the misery on PNG early on. While Rashid Khan was not at his best, Afghanistan were able to keep the squeeze on through Noor Ahmad and were even helped by some ordinary running by the PNG batters. They faced stiff resistance first from Chad Soper and then from Kipling Doriga which resulted in the PNG innings lasting longer than Afghanistan would have hoped to.

AFG v PNG Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Victory for Afghanistan

Chad Soper to Gulbadin Naib: SIX! Gulbadin Naib finishes the game off in style! Afghanistan are through to the Super 8 stage! Chad Soper serves it right in the slot, on off, Gulbadin Naib picks up the length early and goes down town. Gets more height than distance but gets enough bat on to clear the long on fielder who ran across to his left. Naib celebrates by flexing his muscles and it is all smiles in the Afghan camp.

AFG v PNG Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Naib Hits a Maximum

AFG v PNG Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024

Chad Soper to Mohammad Nabi: An appeal for LBW, but turned down! Assad Vala, the PNG skipper opts for a review and challenges the on-field decision. Chad Soper bowls with a beautiful seam position and lands it around the middle and leg, Mohammad Nabi is a bit late to bring his bat down and looks to flick it away, but doesn’t connect and gets a ping on the front pad. UltraEdge shows no bat involved and Ball Tracker shows that the impact is outside leg. A review burnt by PNG here.

AFG v PNG Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Big Wicket for PNG

Norman Vanua to Azmatullah Omarzai: OUT! CASTLED! Not much Azmatullah Omarzai could have done there. Norman Vanua steams in from over the wicket and attacks the stumps with a length delivery, angling in, on middle and leg, Azmatullah Omarzai shapes up to push it back past the bowler with a straight bat. The ball keeps very low and sneaks under the bat to rattle into the stumps. Vanua roars in delight as he gets his first wicket of the game.

13:57 IST
AFG v PNG Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: 50 up for Afghanistan

Norman Vanua to Gulbadin Naib: FOUR! Short and punished! Way too short from Vanua, Gulbadin Naib gets on the back foot and fetches the pull from outside off. Drags the shot to the left of mid-wicket for a boundary.

Soper bowls it on a back of a length with an upright seam, on middle and leg, Gulbadin Naib has a swipe across the line but gets a leading edge that goes in the air towards backward point.

Kipling Doriga has just put down a sitter! Alei Nao continues from over the wicket and lands it on a length, that nips away with the angle, Gulbadin Naib plays it inside the line of the ball anticipating it to come a bit closer at him but takes the outside edge that flies straight towards the right of the keeper. Kipling Doriga dives to his right but juggles in the end, eventually shelling the catch. How costly would this prove to be for PNG? Only time will tell.

AFG v PNG Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Rahmanullah Gurbaz Perishes

Alei Nao to Rahmanullah Gurbaz: OUT! BOWLED’EM! Swing and a miss and Gurbaz falls too. Alei Nao bowls a conventional fuller-length delivery, moving a shade back into the batter from off, Rahmanullah Gurbaz skips down the track looking to hoist it over the leg side but tries to hit it too hard and ends up losing his shape completely. As a result, the bal sneaks through the inside edge and breaks into the stumps.

AFG v PNG Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Ibrahim Zadran Goes for 0

Semo Kamea to Ibrahim Zadran: OUT! YOU MISS I HIT! Afghanistan lose the first wicket and Semo Kamea and all the PNG players are ecstatic. And again, a beautiful seam position, tailing into the leg stump line from middle, on a fuller length, Ibrahim Zadran stays leg side of the ball and goes for a heave across the line but the ball stays a bit low on the bounce and skids through quickly beating the batter’s inside edge and dismantles the furniture. A duck for Ibrahim Zadran.

JUN 14, 2024
13:24 IST
AFG v PNG Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024

Alei Nao to Ibrahim Zadran: FIVE LEG BYES! OH DEAR! PNG just cannot afford these silly errors. On the back of a length, on the stumps, Ibrahim Zadran gets it off the thigh pad towards backward point and sets off for a leg bye. The fielder picks up and has a shy at the striker’s end but no backup leads the ball to the deep. The mid on fielder chases the ball and cuts it before the ropes and throws it to the keeper’s end where the keeper also fails to collect it cleanly. The ball rolls behind the wickets and by the time, the batters cross for five leg byes.

Fazalhaq Farooqi to Alei Nao: OUT! IN THE AIR AND TAKEN! Fazalhaq Farooqi gets his third and he is on a roll here. Pitches it short of a good length, and skids through quickly as well on the bodyline. Alei Nao attempts to pull it but plays it way too closer and gets cramped up for room. Hence, the ball slices off the willow’s bottom half, and spoons up in the air towards long on where Rashid Khan takes a good catch. PNG are 9 down now.
