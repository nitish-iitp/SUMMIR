10.43pm And on that note, it's time to sign off. The tables will be updated shortly, but with a NRR of +0.60, compared to Netherlands' +0.15, Sri Lanka know that a win on Thursday will suffice to take them through.

Tomorrow, it's another thriller in prospect, with West Indies needing their own bounceback against high-flying Zimbabwe, as well as Ireland and Scotland in a British Isles tussle. From Miller, Madushka and Thilak, thanks and goodnight!

Rizwaan: "We thought it was a decent score, we could have done better in the first half but kept them under check. Karthik is a special bowler. We play in 45 degrees in the UAE, so this is different, but we have to find a way. Our batsmen couldn't get going, so we have to work on our skillset and come back better in the next match."

Shanaka: "I thank the crowd for coming all the way from Melbourne. We were disappointed with 150, we could have ended up with 180-90, the tone was set up front but myself and Danu didn't click in the middle. We focus on the win only, so once Chameera and Hasaranga got going it wasn't going to be easy for them. Nissanka's focus is to bat through the innings, he is outstanding, that is his focus and I am pleased for him."

And on Chameera, "hopefully, I think everything will be fine'...

The Player of the Match is Pathum Nissanka. "Along with Kusal, he managed to get a good partnership, and the other batsmen helped him," he says, via a translation. "He's happy to have played an innings like this in a World Cup, and thanks the crowd for coming along."

10.28pm The Asia Cup champions are up and running in the World Cup. They were walloped by 55 runs against Namibia in their opening game, but a 79-run win tonight has laid a marker and put the Netherlands on notice ahead of Thursday's final round of games, in spite of their current two from two record. Progress to the main event is back in Sri Lanka's hands, thanks to Pathum Nissanka's cool half-century, and a stellar bowling display led by Dushmantha Chameera and Wanindu Hasaranga. Chameera's injury is a worrying blow, however.

For UAE, they will have the eternal memory of Karthik Meiyappan's hat-trick, while Aayan Khan's 19 from 21 was a gutsy effort from a talented 16-year-old.

Theekshana to Junaid Siddique, OUT

Hacked through the line, Nissanka seals the contest with a comfortable take at long-on!

Sameer: "Livingstone will now be eyeing to get past that 109 mark" Indeed... he blazed one out of the Gabba the other night, which was quite something!

16.6
1
Shanaka to Junaid Siddique, 1 run

Down the pitch, inside-edged past the stumps. Well, it may have been the last rites, but not for this innings. Watch this space for Dushmantha's tournament prospects..

16.6
1w
Shanaka to Junaid Siddique, 1 wide

Banged in short, too short

Chameera has pulled up in his run-up... hobbling a touch near the crease... and he's leaving the field! That's a desperate sight... doesn't look at all promising, especially with a must-win coming up on Thursday!

16.5
•
Chameera to Junaid Siddique, no run

Slower ball again, stops on the batter, outside off, prodded to backward point

16.4
•
Chameera to Junaid Siddique, no run

Quicker delivery, lifting outside off, through to the keeper

16.3
•
Chameera to Junaid Siddique, no run

Another massive wind-up, misses out! Pace off this time, and nearly loses his middle stump

16.2
6
Chameera to Junaid Siddique, SIX runs

Clobbered over the main stand! That is vast! Swinging into the pads, utterly banjaxed over deep midwicket! And that new ball has lasted precisely one delivery before being dispatched! Junaid flexes his guns, as well he might! 109 metres! Gosh

Is this a ball change? Could be... no messing from the third umpire

16.1
2
Chameera to Junaid Siddique, 2 runs

Thumped with power back past the bowler! Have some of that! Attacking the stumps and met with a lusty swipe through long-off!

Right, here comes Dushmantha for his final over. This could be the last rites...

Theekshana to Junaid Siddique, 1 run

Bottom-handed biff, out to deep cover

15.5
•
Theekshana to Junaid Siddique, no run

Back of a length, twists past the outside edge, through to the keeper

15.4
•
Theekshana to Junaid Siddique, no run

Skids through into the pads, a big appeal but probably missing leg as Siddique swings through his pull. They've gone for the review regardless... every run helps in this margin of victory... clipping the outside of leg stump. Fair decision

Prashanth BC: "Now not many people giving Dutch a chance from here but It will definitely be not easy for Srilanka to beat the Men from Netherland. " Indeed... they will put up more of a fight than this innings, you suspect

15.3
4
Theekshana to Junaid Siddique, FOUR runs

Best shot of the innings! Right up to the blockhole, Siddique blazes a wristy backfoot drive, on the up and through the covers

15.2
1
Theekshana to Zahoor, 1 run

Low full toss, outside off, chopped to the on-side

Hasaranga ends with 3 for 8, and it could have been even better...

14.6
W
Hasaranga to Aayan Afzal Khan, OUT

Best to bypass the fielders! Tosses up the googly, lures the flat wipe, dismantles the stumps. A valiant knock from the young Aayan, but just one to go now...

Aayan Afzal Khan b Hasaranga 19 (21b 1x4 0x6 33m) SR: 90.47
14.5
1
Hasaranga to Junaid Siddique, 1 run

Another wild wipe, another missed chance! Long-on and long-off can't reach a murderous mow, high into the floodlights. Vandersay made the running, but it was probably Rajapakse's catch

14.4
1
Hasaranga to Aayan Afzal Khan, 1 run

Back to a more conventional trajectory from his bowling arm, clipped to the on-side

14.3
•
Hasaranga to Aayan Afzal Khan, no run

Skims through flat once more, outside off, and chopped to gully

14.2
1
Hasaranga to Junaid Siddique, 1 run

Heaved high in the air, and dropped at deep midwicket! Vandersay the sub makes a mess of a regulation take!

14.1
•
Hasaranga to Junaid Siddique, no run

Malinga vibes from Hasaranga! Skiddy, round-arm, back of a length, beats a baffled batter!

Hasaranga with a chance to shut this game down in his final over
