Sin Prisa Gaming takes home VALORANT Champions Tour also known as VCT Ascension Pacific 2024 trophy by defeating BOOM Esports.

Sin Prisa Gaming has claimed victory at VCT Ascension Pacific 2024, emerging as this year’s champion after an intense matchup against BOOM Esports. Over 2,000 fans witnessed Sin Prisa Gaming lift the trophy at Britama Arena on 29th September 2024 after defeating BOOM Esports with a scoreline of 3-2. 

With this win, Sin Prisa Gaming from Korea will be the 12th team to join the VCT Pacific league next year. VCT Pacific is one of four international leagues in the VCT (VALORANT Champions Tour) ecosystem that provides a method for teams to qualify for premier-level global VCT tournaments, Masters and Champions. 

“This year’s Ascension Pacific has been nothing short of spectacular. From thrilling matches to the incredible home crowd energy, I could not be happier with how the event turned out. I want to extend sincere congratulations to Sin Prisa Gaming who fought so hard for this well deserved victory. We have already seen such passionate support from our fans in Korea, and I am more than delighted to welcome another team from Korea into VCT Pacific.” said Jake Sin, Head of VALORANT Esports, APAC at Riot Games.

“To all the other teams, I hope you are still very proud of your performance. Ascension Pacific could not have happened without you. And to our fans who tuned in to watch the action, as well as our Indonesian community who showed up to cheer our finalists in person, thank you! We are only able to hold these events because of you. I hope you are just as excited as I am for the 2025 season coming up next year!” Jake continued

Held in Jakarta, Indonesia, VCT Ascension Pacific 2024 brought together 10 regional teams from Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Oceania, Philippines, South Asia, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan/Hong Kong and Malaysia/Singapore for a thrilling 8-day tournament. The event offered one team a chance to ascend to international league status where they will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the very best teams in the APAC region.

Apart from enjoying a series of highly competitive VALORANT matches, on-site fans were also treated to a number of special activations during the finals weekend.
