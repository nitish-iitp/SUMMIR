The Government and people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago extend greetings to the Muslim community on the celebration of the festival of Eid-ul-Fitr. These greetings are also from members of my own family and myself, as Prime Minister.

On this public holiday, the rest of the population joins in various ways, sharing and respecting the joyous traditions of its Muslim brothers and sisters.

We share, too, in your traditions of gratitude to Allah, and recognise your expressions of thanksgiving, communal sharing of meals, and generous gifts of charity to the less fortunate.

Trinidad and Tobago is a land of religious diversity and traditions, and it is praiseworthy that we can share with you as you recognise the omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence of an infinitely loving God.
