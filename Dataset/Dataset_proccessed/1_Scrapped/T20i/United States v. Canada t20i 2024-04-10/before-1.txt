Eid-ul-Fitr 2024 moon sighting highlights: Amid cloudy weather and upcoming total solar eclipse, Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE could sight Shawwal crescent moon. Eid on April 10
Summary

During the total solar eclipse tonight, the sun will briefly get completely cloaked by the moon and will be aligned with the Earth in a straight line, leading to darkness during the daytime in several countries, as the moon will block the sun completely and a result of this, the sighting of the Shawwal crescent moon to mark the end of Ramadan 2024 and beginning of Eid-ul-Fitr may be delayed until April 09, 2024. The sun will remain cloaked for a total of four minutes, during which its enigmatic outer layer will be illuminated.

Since the Middle East, USA, UK, Canada etc started fasting on March 11, 2024, the Supreme Court in Saudi Arabia had called on all Muslims throughout the Kingdom to sight the new crescent moon on the evening of Monday, Ramadan 29, 1445 Hijri, corresponding to April 8, 2024, that would mark the end of Ramadan and the onset of the month of Shawwal. The Shawwal crescent moon was not sighted by the Muslims in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Turkey, Iran and other countries in the Middle East on April 8 evening, after breaking the Ramadan fast at maghrib or evening payers hence, chand raat there will be on Tuesday, April 09 and the day of Eid-ul-Fitr will be celebrated the next day i.e. on April 10, 2024, indicating that Muslims will observe a 30-day fast this Ramadan instead of 29 days.

As per Indian time, the total solar eclipse on April 08, 2024 will take place from 9:12pm to 2:22am, in between which, Muslims across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, USA, United Kingdom, UAE, Qatar and in other countries were gearing up to sight the crescent moon of Shawwal that will mark the end of Ramadan 2024 and the day of Eid-ul-Fitr this year as it is celebrated on the first day of Shawwal, the tenth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, after the sighting of the new moon or crescent moon. It is a major Islamic festival where "Eid" means "celebration" and "Fitr" means "breaking of the fast" and is celebrated by Muslims worldwide but the exact date of the festival varies each year, as Islam follows a lunar calendar that is based on the sighting of the new moon and this year, Ramadan was expected to get over on Monday, April 08 with a treat for sky gazers and celestial body lovers since the new moon occurring on April 08 was anticipated to be seen with a total solar eclipse in specific locations on Earth.

Eid-Ul-Fitr 2024: Shawwal crescent moon sighting in the United Kingdom

With the edges of western Europe slated to experience a partial eclipse tonight, some areas in the British Isles - mostly western Scotland and Ireland - will be able to see part of the moon moving in front of the sun but although the new moon will become visible as a dark circle silhouetted against the blazing surface of the sun, it is the first slim crescent forming around the moon's edge that observers must report before Eid-ul-Fitr 2024 is declared. According to Birmingham Mail, Midlands-based moonsighting expert Dr Zahid Nawaz said, "There is a total solar eclipse on Monday, April 8, which will impact the visibility of the Shawwal crescent moon this year. This impacts only those countries who attempt to sight the crescent. However, those who follow astronomical calculations will also be impacted as the moon sets before sunset on Monday."

Eid-Ul-Fitr 2024: Shawwal crescent moon sighting in US

The United States Naval Observatory reportedly stated, "The sighting of the lunar crescent within one day of new moon is usually difficult. The crescent at this time is quite thin, has a low surface brightness, and can easily be lost in the twilight. Generally, the lunar crescent will become visible to suitably-located, experienced observers with good sky conditions about one day after new moon. However, the time that the crescent actually becomes visible varies quite a bit from one month to another. Naked-eye sightings as early as 15.5 hours after new moon have been reliably reported while observers with telescopes have made reliable reports as early as 12.1 hours after new moon."
