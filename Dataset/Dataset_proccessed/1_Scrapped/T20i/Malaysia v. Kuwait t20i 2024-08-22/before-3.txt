The Africa Qualifier for the 2025 Under-19 Women’s World Cup has been expanded into a two-leg tournament, scheduled to begin with the Division 2 fixtures from the 21st to the 27th of August 2024, in Kigali, Rwanda. From an overview of its history and format to broadcasting details, squads, and the schedule, here’s everything you need to know about the Under-19 Women’s T20 World Cup Africa Qualifier.

All you need to know about Under-19 Women’s T20 World Cup Africa Qualifier | Squad, Schedule, Live Streaming

The inaugural Africa Qualifier, held in September 2022 in Botswana, was the precursor to the 2023 Women’s Under-19 World Cup. Eight teams from across the continent competed, with Uganda, Namibia, Botswana, and Sierra Leone constituting Group 1, while Tanzania, Rwanda, Nigeria, and Malawi made up Group 2. Uganda and Tanzania topped their respective groups, advancing to the playoffs unbeaten. In the semifinals, Tanzania continued their winning streak against Namibia, while Rwanda handed Uganda an upset. Rwanda went on to claim the title by defeating unbeaten Tanzania in the final.

For the 2024 edition, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has introduced a two-leg qualification process, enabling participation from 8 to 14 teams. The first leg, Division 2, scheduled from August 21 to 27, will feature Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, and Mozambique in Group A, while Group B will include Eswatini, Ghana, Malawi, and Sierra Leone. The finalists from Division 2 will advance to Division 1, where they will join Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe later this year to vie for a spot in the 2025 Under-19 Women’s World Cup.

Format:

Division 2 of the Africa Qualifier will follow a round-robin format, where each team will face every other team in their group once. The top two teams from each group will advance to the semifinals, while the third and fourth-placed teams from both groups will compete in the 5th and 7th place playoffs. While the semifinal winners will progress to the final, there will also be a third-place play-off to determine the overall rankings.
