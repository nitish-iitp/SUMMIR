Ex-Pakistan cricketer Tanvir Ahmed is known for his controversial statements, against both Indian and Pakistani cricketers. This time, Tanvir has launched a brutal attack on his country's legendary fast bowler Waqar Younis.

Recently, Pakistan released the legspinner Abrar Ahmed and the allrounder Kamran Ghulam from its squad for the Test series against Bangladesh. The decision of the team management clearly indicates that Pakistan will be going with an all-pace attack for the first Test at Rawalpindi starting on August 21.

The release of Abrar Ahmed was a huge surprise given he was selected as the lone spinner in the squad. Tanvir Ahmed was visibly shocked at this decision and lambasted Waqar Younis, who recently joined the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in his new role.

Tanvir Ahmed brutally slams Waqar Younis for releasing Abrar Ahmed and Kamran Ghulam

Tanvir took to social media and slammed Waqar Younis for releasing both Abrar Ahmed and Kamran Ghulam ahead of the first Test against Bangladesh. He accused Younis of destroying Pakistan cricket.

"Dekha ap logon ney ye waqar younis or selection commeette ki waja say Abrar Ahmed or kamran ghulam ko test matches say farigh kardiya against bangladesh rahi sahi jo pakistan ki cricket ha ye waqar younis barbad karey ga," Tanvir posted on X (formerly Twitter).

Pakistan prepares to go for an all-pace attack in a home Test

Abrar Ahmed and Kamran Ghulam have been released from the squad to play for Pakistan Shaheens in the series against Bangladesh A. Both the players have been released to provide them sufficient game time instead of sitting on the bench during the first Test at Rawalpindi. Both the players will be available for the second Test in Karachi.

The release of both these players leaves Pakistan with limited spin bowling options for the first Test. Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, and Mir Hamza are likely to play. One of the other fast bowlers in the squad is likely to get a nod now. Agha Salman will play the role of a frontline spinner.

Tanvir Ahmed accuses Waqar Younis of further

Tanvir Ahmed did not stop here and even accused Waqar Younis of having problems with him during his playing days.

"Ye waqar younis ko takleef hoi jab main southafrica k tour par select howa tha ye hain humarey name k legend," Tanvir posted on X.

Tanvir Ahmed has been embroiled in controversies before as well. He has posted controversial statements against legendary India offspinner Harbhajan Singh as well. Recently, he even challenged India to come to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy 2025.
