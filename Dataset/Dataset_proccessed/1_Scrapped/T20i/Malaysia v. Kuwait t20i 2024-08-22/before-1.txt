Pakistan ready for a fresh start against Bangladesh at home

This series marks Pakistan's first assignment following their disappointing performance in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024, where they failed to make it to the super-8 round and faced a lot of criticism for their below-par performance across the format.

Now, the Pakistan cricket team is looking for a fresh start with the home Tests against the Tigers. With this Test series against Bangladesh, the Pakistan team will be starting their 2024-25 season, and the former Test captain Babar Azam is not leaving any stone unturned to make an impactful comeback.

The stylish right-handed batter has been slammed for being unable to put up the performance according to stature, and he is now certainly eager to yet again prove his mettle as one of the best batters of the modern era in the upcoming Test series against Bangladesh at home.

Babar Azam kicks stumps in anger as Pakistan prepares for Bangladesh Tests

Meanwhile, a video is doing the rounds on social media, where angry Babar Azam left many stunned with his antics during the Pakistan team’s practice session. Babar, after edging a delivery while attempting a risky shot away from his body, has expressed his frustration by kicking the stumps in anger.

The delivery was a good length and pitched around off-stump. Babar Azam, without moving his feet, tried to drive the ball aggressively and ended up with a thick outside edge. The bowler, pleased with his delivery, celebrated the moment, while Babar’s unexpected reaction raised questions about his ethics.

In the viral video, Babar can be seen angrily kicking off the stumps during his nets session. After being got better by the star pacer Shaheen Afridi, Babar couldn’t control his anger and furiously threw his feet on the stumps, with one stump slipping out of the nets, and one support staff handed the stick to him and he placed its place to resume his practice again.

Babar set to bat at No.4 in the Rawalpindi Test against Bangladesh

Notably, Babar has so far represented Pakistan in 52 matches and amassed 3898 runs at an average of 45.86 and a strike rate of 54 with 9 centuries and 26 fifties to his name in Test cricket. Meanwhile, Babar is set to bat at number four in the first Test against Bangladesh, as reported by Geo News.

Sources also revealed that Abdullah Shafiq's position as an opener remains secure, with captain Shan Masood slated to bat at number three against Bangladesh. It is also being said that batter Muhammad Hurraira is likely to make his debut in the first Test against Bangladesh in Rawalpindi.

On the other hand, the pitch is expected to favor bowlers, and Pakistan is likely to go with three 4 pacers, Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Khurram Shahzad, and Mir Hamza, in their bowling attack for the Rawalpindi Test.
