Players to watch out:
Georgia Redmayne

The 30-year-old keeper-batter, from 107 outings in the Women’s Big Bash League (WBBL), a premier T20 competition, has accumulated 2,436 runs at an average of 25.64 and a strike rate of 105.45. Georgia, from 10 outings in the recently concluded 100-ball tournament, accumulated 229 runs at an average of 28.62, with a highest score of 66*. Given her experience and form, she can be relied upon to lead the scoring.

Amanda-Jade Wellington

The 27-year-old keeper-batter, from 133 WBBL outings, has scalped 149 wickets, including the best of 5/8, while maintaining an economy rate of 6.61, and is also more than handy with the bat. Amanda-Jade has been in good form lately, and in The Hundred 2024, she scalped 10 wickets from 9 outings, maintaining an economy rate of 7.35. She can be banked upon to deliver with both the bat and ball.

The 30-year-old all-rounder, in T20Is, from 80 outings, has amassed 1,145 runs at a strike rate of 135.18, while from 65 bowling innings, she has taken 35 wickets with an economy rate of 6.82. Chloe, in her most recent campaign, The Hundred, struck a few wickets and followed up her string of starts with scores of 47* and 55 to cap off the season.

Recently, in a T20 campaign, while Erin managed only 75 runs from 8 innings, she compensated with the ball, taking as many as 16 wickets from 9 outings. She is a seasoned campaigner and can deliver all-round efforts.
