All you need to know about Women’s Caribbean Premier League 2024 | Squad, Schedule, Live Streaming

Since its inaugural season, the WCPL has featured the same three teams – Barbados Royals, Guyana Amazon Warriors, and Trinbago Knight Riders – who will all be in action for the 2024 season.

In the four-match inaugural season, the Knight Riders clinched the title with a 10-run victory over the Royals in a low-scoring final. In the 2023 edition, the tournament expanded to seven games. However, the defending champions, with only one win, failed to make back-to-back finals appearances, while the Royals finished one step better, claiming the championship by narrowly defeating the Warriors by 8 runs in a high-scoring chase.

Although the number of games has been very few, all teams have made final appearances, reflecting the competitiveness of the tournament, which is also evident from several close matches.

Format:

The tournament will follow a double round-robin format, with each team playing the others twice, thus playing four matches apiece. A win will earn two points, and an abandoned or no-result match will award one point. These points will contribute to the basis for qualification to the Final, featuring the table toppers.

Squads:

Barbados Royals – Hayley Matthews, Chinelle Henry, Afy Fletcher, Aaliyah Alleyne, Rashada Williams, Shabika Gajnabi, Cherry Ann Fraser, Trishan Holder, Qiana Joseph, Djenaba Joseph, Naijanni Cumberbatch, Chamari Athapaththu, Amanda-Jade Wellington, Laura Harris, Georgia Redmayne
