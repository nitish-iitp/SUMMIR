CHE vs RR Dream11 Pitch Report of MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai

Surface Nature – Neutral Surface  

Average Score – 164 Runs

Fast vs Spin on Venue (Last 10 matches)

Fast Bowler (87 Wkt) = 74%
Spin Bowler (30 Wkt) = 26%

Usually, teams score around 165 runs in the first innings at MA Chidambaram Stadium. But we think a good score will be a bit higher in this game. The pitch will help spin bowlers, and scoring quickly in the middle of the game might be challenging.
