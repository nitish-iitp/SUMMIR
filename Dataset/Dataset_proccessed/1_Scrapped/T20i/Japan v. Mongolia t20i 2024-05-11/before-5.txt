Mongolia's tour of Japan continues with the fifth T20I, which will be played at the Sano International Cricket Ground on Saturday, May 11, 2024. The game is a part of a seven-match series, which will conclude at the end of the week on May 12. (More Cricket News)

The hosts lead the series 2-0, ahead of match 4. The first two T20Is saw Japan posting humongous victories, while the third game did not produce a result. The hosts simply dismantled the Mongolia batting line-up in the first two matches to complete crushing wins.

In the first clash, the visitors were bowled out for a mere 33 runs while chasing Japan's target of 200 runs to suffer a 166-run defeat. Left-arm spinner Charles Hinze was the wrecker-in-chief, taking four wickets for only four runs off 16 balls. Sabaorish Ravichandran (54 off 24 balls) and Wataru Miyauchi (72 off 54) struck half-centuries for the home team.

Japan further asserted their dominance in the second T20I, shooting out Mongolia for a measly total of 12 runs. This was the second-lowest total in T20I history, behind Isle of Man's 10 in 8.4 overs against Spain last year.

The hosts were powered by Sabaorish Ravichandran's 39-ball 69 to put up a total of 217/7 in 20 overs. Mongolia, in response, were able to bat for just 8.2 overs. If not for three extras, their total would have become the lowest in the history of T20Is. Furthermore, Japan's 205-run win in the second encounter was their biggest margin of victory in terms of runs in T20ls, beating a 180-run win against China.
