COMMENTRY
Right then, that is all we have from this game. The action in the T20 World Cup however, will continue on 28th October as Australia will take on Sri Lanka in Dubai for game number 22. That match starts at 6 pm local time (2 pm GMT) but the build up will start earlier. Do join us for that one. Till then, cheers!
The winning skipper, Gerhard Erasmus says, they are obviously delighted to get another win in the World Cup. Mentions the boys did well and executed the plan to get over the line. Adds they will take good momentum from this game. On being asked about the plan in the break, he says, they speak more before the game and then on the field they aim to back themselves. Adds, the celebrations will be quite big this time as well.
The losing captain, Richie Berrington says, that they were 20-30 runs short. Mentions that it was pretty hard to recover after the first over. Tells that they needed a partnership to get going and Cross and Leask played really well but could not get going. Adds that they don't have time to thing about it too much and they will just focus on their next game and put this loss behind. Ends by saying that they will take their learning from this game and come back stronger in the next game. On Kyle, he says that he is resting now and they will have to check if he is fit and available for the next game.
Ruben Trumpelmann has been awarded the MAN OF THE MATCH for his exceptional figures of 4-0-17-3! He says, it is a great result for the team. Mentions the preparation has been good in the past few days and he enjoyed his time out in the middle. It’s the World Cup, so why not. Adds that he uses swings upfront and it paid off really well. Ends by saying, it’s a good win and the boys will surely celebrate it.
... PRESENTATION ...
Earlier in the day, Gerhard Erasmus won the toss and put Scotland into bat. His decision was complimented straightaway by Ruben Trumpelmann who picked up three wickets in the very first over. This set the tone for the innings and Namibia restricted their opponents to 109. The Namibian openers put a few runs on the board and after some hiccups along the way, JJ Smit finished things off in style and Namibia have two points on board. It's time for the presentation ceremony...
Scotland almost pulled the rabbit out of the hat but there just weren't enough runs to defend. The pacers started off nicely with the ball, allowing no room to the Namibian batters to get ahead in the game but managed just one wicket in the Powerplay. Once Zane Green fell, the Scottish spinners started to pile on the pressure. Michael Leask was the pick of the bowlers as he picked up a couple of wickets and Mark Watt and Chris Greaves picked up a wicket each. Scotland took the game into the final over and this shows character. They lose their second game in a row but won't be disappointed with their bowling effort.
Namibia have been missing from the biggest stage of cricket for the past 18 or so years and here they are now, in the Super 12 of the T20 World Cup and they have just won their first match. The total to chase down was a low one but it's always the totals that require around run-a-ball that play with the mind and that's what happened to Namibia but a few partnerships here and there and a flourish in the end means Namibia continue their red hot streak. Craig Williams and Michael Van Lingen started off slowly but got some runs on board. It was JJ Smit down the order who made the difference with a 32-run cameo and David Wiese supported him well.
Just for a moment it looked like Namibia were going to crumble under pressure but they have kept their cool and have bagged their first ever win in the main draw of the T20 World Cup and also go on to win their third match on the bounce.

OUT! CAUGHT! Would you believe it? A full toss outside off, Jan Frylinck could have hit that anywhere in the ground but smashes it straight to the mid-wicket fielder. Calum MacLeod takes the simplest of catches. Namibia fans will have to wait a few more minutes for the celebrations.
