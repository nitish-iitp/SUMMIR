TAN vs MAW Match Preview:

Tanzania has unleashed a relentless onslaught, conquering all four of their matches to seize the top spot on the points table.

Meanwhile, Malawi has mirrored Tanzania’s perfection, securing four victories in as many matches. However, Malawi’s inferior net run rate or other tiebreaker criteria relegate them to second place.

The stage is now set for a thrilling showdown between these unbeaten powerhouses. As Tanzania and Malawi clash, only one can claim supremacy.
