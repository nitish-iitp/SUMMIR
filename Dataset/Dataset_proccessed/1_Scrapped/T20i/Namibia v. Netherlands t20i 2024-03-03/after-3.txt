Hong Kong’s cricketers face another stern test over the next 10 days, with a series of T20 internationals against Nepal and Papua New Guinea.

The tri-series at Tin Kwong Road Recreation Ground comes on the back of a one-day tournament involving Malaysia and Canada, and the East Asia Cup against China and Japan.

Simon Willis’ side go into the competition having beaten Qatar on Friday in the super over of the decider of their three-match T20 series in Doha.

Nepal, meanwhile, are in the middle of a T20 competition of their own at home, where they are hosting Namibia and the Netherlands.

PNG are returning to the city for the first time since the South China Cup and West Pacific Cup in 2018.

The tournament will begin with Hong Kong taking on Nepal on Saturday for the Hong Kong Men’s T20I Series Friendship Cup, which officials said was “a one off match to celebrate the relationship” between the two cricket associations.
