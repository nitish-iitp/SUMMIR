Homecoming and Captaincy: Hardik Pandya’s Return to Mumbai Indians

Hardik Pandya’s return to Mumbai Indians for IPL 2024 marks a significant moment as he takes on the role of captain for the first time. Expressing gratitude for the love received from Mumbai fans, Pandya emphasized his connection with the city, where his cricket journey began. He highlighted the anticipation of his son witnessing him play in the IPL for the first time, indicating a personal milestone in his career.

Outlook on Records and Leadership Philosophy

Pandya shared his perspective on records, stating that he does not prioritize personal milestones and instead focuses on contributing to the team’s success. His leadership philosophy revolves around leading by example rather than chasing individual achievements. When prompted to deliver Amitabh Bachchan’s iconic dialogue, Pandya humorously embraced his role as captain with the words, “‘Rishte mein to hum tumhare captain lagte hai, naam hai Pandya.”
