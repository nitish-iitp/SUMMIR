9.55pm That's just about it from us tonight. Another remarkable contest of ebb and flow between England and New Zealand. But there's plenty more to come, starting with Australia versus Pakistan at the same time tomorrow, and culminating in the World Cup final on Sunday night in Dubai. Will it be third time lucky for New Zealand? You have to wonder... from Miller, Varun, Chandan and the team, thanks and goodnight!

Oh, and here's Sampath with a stat to see you into the night: "New Zealand chased down 57 runs in the last four overs, the most target runs successfully chased by any team in men's T20Is at the death overs (where we have BBB data). Previous most was 56 by Australia vs Pakistan 2010 and Zimbabwe vs Scotland 2021."

Chris Silverwood is speaking to Sky "It just shows this game is never over, we went through our plans but sometimes you have to take your hat off to certain people. Today just wasn't our day."

Rajiv: "Would love to hear what Neesham would say tthis. Love his sense of humour."

RDSS: "That's a full-circle of destiny right there. Luck favored England then with the overthrows. It favored a bit to NZ today with Bairstow catch and few missed run-outs . What a game! "

Mahesh Balaji: "Eng's fifth bowler bowled really well. The batters handled the last few overs brilliantly. Let's give credit where it's due (to NZ) even in the absence of dew."

Presentation time

Kane Williamson: "We've played each other on a number of occasions, knew it would be a great game of cricket, and really chuffed with the heart that was shown throughout that performance. Outstanding from Mitchell at the top, but cashing in on the match-ups [was crucial]. His character stood out today, an incredible knock, not done it a lot at the top of the order. T20 cricket is a game of small margins, depending on the surface, short side... can all be match-defining. We had wickets in hand which was really important. Neesham came out and hit the ball hard, and changed the momentum of the game. Ultimately the deciding factor."

As to the final: "The guys have been watching most of the games. It'll be a fantastic match, highly competitive. We know we have another challenge coming up and we'll chance our focus after tonight."

Eoin Morgan: "Full credit to Kane and his team, they outplayed us today, I can't fault anything that we've done tonight, we've fought hard and represented ourselves well, but come up short tonight. Incredibly proud of the guys. Hard to identify the key moments, they built up until they had to push the button, then came good. He held them at bay up to that point. It was a sluggish pitch and we struggled to hit sixes, a good indication it was two-paced. We posted a par score and felt in the game at the halfway side. To have the ability to hit sixes from ball one like [Neesham], full credit to him. I hope to be back, I am still offering enough, and I love playing in this changing room. Incredibly proud to be their leader."

Daryl MItchell is Player of the Match: "A bit of a whirlwind, nice to get the job done and move onto the big dance. Challenging, especially at the start. The way Devon Conway batted through the middle, and Neesh, really helped us. It's a game of momentum, we knew we needed one or two big overs, and the way he struck the ball from ball one... With what's going on in the world, for my dad to travel half way round the world and be here is pretty cool."

Thara: "Morgan will be regretting picking up Sam Billings. All he did was take a catch. Could have used an extra bowler today. " Hindsight is a wonderful thing...

Matt Roller has this gem, which I missed earlier, but you love some good match-up geekery, don't you? "Incredibly niche but: Conway is a rare left-hander in that he has a better record against balls that turn away from the bat than ones that spin in, evidenced by his strong inside-out game through the covers. That could be why Livingstone has bowled so many legbreaks to him, straying from his usual plan." So nearly the basis of his post-match piece, I'll bet. Back to the drawing board now!

9.33pm New Zealand are into their third World Cup final in four attempts! That was a ballsy display against the pre-tournament favourites, and it all comes down to that man Daryl Mitchell, with his All Black dad looking on. A huge hand too from the nearly man of 2019 Jimmy Neesham.... that dismantling of Chris Jordan turned the tide. England were up against it trying to defend in these conditions, but in truth the dew factor was not a huge deal tonight. Ultimately they suffered for a lack of options, in the absence of Tymal Mills, in spite of an immense spell from Liam Livingstone.

Chris Woakes looked to have given England the upper hand in the Powerplay, but they were reeled in, over by over, blow by blow. And well, it hasn't yet laid the ghosts of 2019 entirely ... that will have to wait until the final in Dubai on Sunday. But what a mighty team Kane Williamson has pulled together! Finalists in 2015, Finalists in 2019, Finalists in 2021. And a World Test mace in between whiles. These are the times of their lives.

18.6
4
Woakes to Mitchell, FOUR runs

Full toss, clawed through backward square! And that's the game for New Zealand!

One blow away now...

18.5
1
Woakes to Santner, 1 run

It's in the slot for Santner to have a swing, out through the leg side, on the bounce to deep midwicket

Santner on strike now... does he try to be the hero, or just keep it out?

18.4
1
Woakes to Mitchell, 1 run

Another bouncer, flapped off the eyebrows, doesn't get hold of it... but it's safely short of square leg

18.3
6
Woakes to Mitchell, SIX runs

Too short, and that'll be the game for New Zealand now! Flogged with fury, big levers extending through the stroke, high over midwicket for an 86metre six!

Phillips said they wanted to win with an over to spare... it's on now!

Usama: "Just for stats, England still 3 boundaries ahead on boundary count"... make that two!

18.2
6
Woakes to Mitchell, SIX runs

Slower ball again, and Mitchell makes no mistake! Rocking back, swinging lustily, up into the stroke, and over the ropes at long-on!

18.1
2
Woakes to Mitchell, 2 runs

Slower ball, toe-ended inches out of Woakes' reach, past the stumps, and they hustle for the second

Mind you... I think England got 20 from their final two overs ... Oh God, what's wrong with these two teams! Woakes will bowl the penultimate. Ironically, it was Jordan's 19th in 2016 final that coulda shoulda won it for England... big over again! So many big overs! It's all utterly vast!

Rashid to Neesham, OUT

Back of a length, a slap from Neesham... straight at Morgan in the covers! Another googly, wide line, Neesham's weight was going the wrong way, Morgan juggles it but clings on. A lifeline from Rashid's final ball... but has he turned the game too far for New Zealand?

James Neesham c Morgan b Rashid 27 (11b 1x4 3x6 18m) SR: 245.45

Shao: "Knock, knock, knock, who's this? "Its Super over,open the door please"."

17.5
1
Rashid to Mitchell, 1 run

Outside off, back of a length, cuffed into the off side. Just a single to allow England some room to breathe...

17.4
6
Rashid to Mitchell, SIX runs

Too short, and nailed high over long-on! That's power from Mitchell, rocking back on impact and lifting it high over the ropes! New Zealand are surging now!

27 from 15...

17.3
1
Rashid to Neesham, 1 run

Wrong'un, wide line, might have been called if it had been left... Morgan's shy goes wide, that would have been out!

17.2
6
Rashid to Neesham, SIX runs

Flambeed into the night sky! Down on one knee and mashed high onto the grass banks at midwicket!

17.1

Rashid to Neesham, no run

Back of a length, bashed down the ground, could have been a single but the non-striker concedes that he impeded Rashid, and they turn it down

Jordan will have to gulp it down and come again. Too late to throw Moeen an over now

16.6
1
Jordan to Neesham, 1 run

Better from Jordan, fired into the blockhole, and slapped behind square... another single. That's England's most expensive over of the tournament, and what a time for it!

Huge ball!

16.5
2
Jordan to Neesham, 2 runs

Pounded high through the line, same direction, less power... but Bairstow and Livingstone look at one another, and the ball plugs between both! Crumbs!

Can Jordan dig deep for England now. Still two balls!

16.4
6
Jordan to Neesham, SIX runs

Slower ball ... hacked high into the leg side... is this the moment... Bairstow rushes round at long-on, clings on, relays the catch as he falls over the rope... but he's not convinced he's completed it! Yep, his knee has hit the rope, and that's another six! A Boult moment in reverse?!

16.4
1w
Jordan to Neesham, 1 wide

Urgh... wide outside off. He's struggling to get out of this over ... Buttler is unamused... big balls coming up. In every sense!

16.3
4
Jordan to Neesham, FOUR runs

It was the off-stump line, but that's been carted, hard through long-on! Neesham is giving New Zealand a vital leg-up here!

Buttler has a word with Morgan, who has a word with Jordan. Fine leg is up and mid-off is back. Off stump line?

16.3
1w
Jordan to Neesham, 1 wide

Fired down the leg side from round the wicket, Jordan is trying to stay out of his arc, but that's a poor ball

16.2
2lb
Jordan to Neesham, 2 leg byes

Fired into the pads, leg-sided, but very full, and it takes the deflection to square leg. Buttler hurtles round, but not quick enough to cut off the second

Jp: "A bit late now obviously, and hindsight is a wonderful thing, but I'm surprised as to why NZ don't utilise Southee as a pinch hitter ? He's hit the most or 2nd most 6s in test cricket, he's either gonna do the job or get out quickly.... thoughts?" Not a terrible notion, but Phillips and Neesham can lump it too

16.1
6
Jordan to Neesham, SIX runs

Round the wicket, in Neesham's arc, and pumped over midwicket! Every bit as smoked as his Super over six... that's travelled a big distance!

Massive over, and it's left New Zealand needing more than two a ball hereon in. Jordan's back
