Wild scenes as Australia 'outclassed' by Afghanistan in shock T20 World Cup loss

Australia's blockbuster T20 World Cup clash against India has become a must-win after the Aussies suffered a shock 21-run loss to Afghanistan.

It was the first time Afghanistan had ever beaten the Aussies, having famously come close at last year's ODI World Cup before Glenn Maxwell saved the day.

When Adam Zampa holed out to Azmatullah Omarzai to end the match, wild celebrations were triggered.

"They've done it ... one of the great moments in Afghanistan cricket history," commentator Ian Smith said.

Former Australian Test skipper Ricky Ponting said the Aussies were "outclassed".

"It's magnificent to see. They've outclassed Australia, no doubt about it," he said.

"They posted a good total – we all felt it was a bit above par – but it's been their bowling, discipline and their efforts in the field that's been the difference."

To make the win even more surreal, an earthquake struck the ground right at the moment victory was secured.

Chasing 149 to win, Glenn Maxwell was the only Aussie batter to mount any kind of resistance on a turning St Vincent wicket.

Travis Head was first to go, when he was bowled by a ripper of a delivery from Naveen-ul-haq with just the third ball of the innings.

Naveen struck again in the third over when he drew skipper Mitch Marsh into a drive, but only holed out to mid-on.

When David Warner was caught trying to sweep Mohammad Nabi in the fifth over, the Aussies were reduced to 3-32.

With Marcus Stoinis down the other end, Maxwell looked to repeat his ODI World Cup heroics from last year, when he single-handedly carried the Aussies to victory by scoring 201 not-out.

Stoinis fell in the 11th over after a 39-run stand, but Maxwell continued to score freely down the other end.

He almost single-handedly reduced the equation to 41 from 33 when he fell to a stunning catch behind point for 59 off 41 balls.

It was at that point he Afghani players started to believe. Their intensity in the field lifted, and the Australians started to falter.

Having earlier put together a scrappy fielding performances, that panic started to creep into their batting.

The Australian tail is known for being among the best in world cricket, but survived several run out chances brought about by miscommunications between the wicket.

Somehow though the Aussies made it to the final over still needing 23 runs to win.

With virtually nothing to lose, Zampa took on Omarzai, but only succeeded in holing out to Nabi on the straight boundary to seal the win.

Coming into the match, Afghanistan had the most economical bowling line-up in the tournament.

Earlier, having won the toss and sent Afghanistan in to bowl, the Aussies put together one of their worst fielding displays in recent memory.

They grassed five chances – including one from David Warner that would've given Pat Cummins a double-hat-trick – leaked a stack of extra runs through misfields, and missed several run out chances.

But one they managed to hold on to three of them to give Pat Cummins his second hat-trick in as many matches, to become the first player to take two hat-tricks at T20 World Cups.

Afghanistan openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran put the Aussies to the sword, putting on 118 for the first wicket.

India effectively locked themselves into the semi-finals earlier in the day by beating Bangladesh.

Australia must now beat India on Tuesday (AEST) to ensure they make it through. Should they lose in a tight one, Australia must hope Bangladesh beat Afghanistan later in the day.
