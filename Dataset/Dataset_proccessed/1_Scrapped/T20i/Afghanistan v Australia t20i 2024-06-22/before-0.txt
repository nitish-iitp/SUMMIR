Australia triumphed over Bangladesh by 28 runs (DLS method) in the Super 8 match of the ongoing T20 World Cup 2024, held at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua.

The rain-affected game was halted when Australia, chasing a target of 141 runs set by Bangladesh, reached 100-2 in 11.2 overs. At that point, they were 28 runs ahead of the DLS par score, leading to their victory when the rain intervened.

The next fixture for Group 1 will see India take on Bangladesh on Saturday in Antigua.

The top two teams from each group will qualify for the semi-finals, making every match crucial in determining the eventual qualifiers.
