NEW DELHI: India advanced to the Super Eight stage as the top team in Group A with seven points from four matches. Canada, who had already been eliminated, finished with three points.
The United States' match against Ireland at the same venue was called off on Friday due to a wet outfield after continuous rain, which posed a risk of life-threatening flooding in South Florida.

As a result of the cancellation, Pakistan was eliminated, and the U.S. qualified for the Super Eight stage for the first time by securing second place in the group with five points.
Central Broward Park is set to host the last Group A match on Sunday, with Pakistan facing bottom side Ireland.

India will play Afghanistan in their first Super Eight Group One match on Thursday. The U.S., placed in Super Eight Group Two, will face South Africa on Wednesday.
Bangladesh successfully defended 106, the lowest total ever defended in the men's T20 World Cup, to beat Nepal by 21 runs on Monday (as per IST) at the Arnos Vale Ground, securing progression to the Super Eight stage of the tournament.

T20 World Cup 2024 Super 8 Qualified Teams:

Eight teams have secured their spots in the T20 World Cup Super 8s stage. India, USA, Australia, England, Afghanistan, West Indies, South Africa and Bangladesh have all advanced to the next round.



An exciting match is on the horizon when Afghanistan take on co-hosts West Indies in Group C. The result in this match will end the unbeaten run of one of these two teams before entering the 'Super 8s'.
