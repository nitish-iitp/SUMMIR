Team South Africa slipped to a 70-run defeat against Kenya in their second match of the African Games at the Achimota Cricket Oval on Monday.

Kenya’s win was set up by a half-century from Collins Obuya (58 off 47 balls; 7 fours, 2 sixes) and a five-wicket haul by 18-year-old spinner Aarnav Patel (5/15).

Kenya won the toss and opted to bat first and posted 141/6 from their allotted 20 overs before restricting South Africa to 71 all out with five overs to spare.

The defeat comes just 24 hours after an impressive 134-run win over hosts Ghana at the same venue.

Obuya’s knock proved the difference for the East African side, with Rakep Patel the next-best batter with 28 off 25 balls.

Heinrigh Pieterse (2/23) ended the pick of the bowlers, while Dylan Bester (1/21), Jason Raubenheimer (1/30) and Jesse Prodehl (1/42) provided support.

In reply, South Africa’s batters struggled as captain George van Heerden, who recorded his maiden T20 century against Ghana, finished the top-scorer on 22.

South Africa lost their first three wickets inside the powerplay with opening pair Maahir Joseph (12) and Pieterse (4) falling to the experienced Lucas Oluoch (2/10), before Lehan Botha was caught for one off Gerard Mwendwa (1/6).

Van Heerden and Keagan Lion-Cachet (16) then combined to provide some respite with a 36-run stand - the highest of the innings. But regular strikes curbed any possibility of building momentum as South Africa slipped from 55/3 to 71 all out within the space of 4.4 overs.

South Africa take on Uganda in their final Group A match on Wednesday.
