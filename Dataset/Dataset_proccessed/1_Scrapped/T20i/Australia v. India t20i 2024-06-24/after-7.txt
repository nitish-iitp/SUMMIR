Summary

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel helped India claw their way back in the middle overs after which Australia received a body blow with Travis Head falling to Jasprit Bumrah. Australia were limited to a score of 181/7 in reply to India's 205/5.

India vs Australia, T20 World Cup 2024 Highlights:

India vs Australia, T20 World Cup 2024 Highlights: Captain Rohit Sharma starred with a belligerent 92 off 41 balls as India beat Australia by 24 runs. Rohit's knock helped India get to a score of 205/5 in 20 overs. Australia gave the steep target a proper go, largely thanks to Travis Head sending the Indian bowlers everywhere in the first 10 overs of the Australian innings. David Warner fell to Arshdeep Singh in the first over in what could possibly be his last international appearance for Australia but that was followed by an 81-run stand between Head and captain Mitch Marsh which came in just 48 balls. Marsh fell to Kuldeep Yadav in the ninth over thanks to a sensational catch from Axar Patel after which Glenn Maxwell continued to put the pressure on the Indians for a while. However, Kuldeep and Axar helped India claw their way ahead in the middle overs, dismissing Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis respectively after which Head fell on 76 off 43 to Jasprit Bumrah in the 17th over. India eventually won the match and confirmed a spot for themselves in the semifinals while Australia could be knocked out if Afghanistan beat Bangladesh. ...Read More

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: 'We don't want to do anything different in the semis,' says Rohit

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024:
"Satisfying. We know the opposition and the threat they bring. As a team we did well, kept doing the things we needed to do. Gives us good confidence as a team. 200 is a good score but when you are playing here with wind being a big factor, anything can happen. But I think we used to conditions really well, and it was about individuals doing their job. If was about getting wickets at the right time. (On Kuldeep) We know the strength he has, but we need to use him when necessary. In New York, there were seamer friendly wickets. He had to miss out but we knew he had a big role to play out here. (On semi-final) We don't want to do anything different, play the same way and understand what each person has to do. Play freely and not think too much on what's lying ahead. Not think about the opposition. We have been doing it consistently, just need to continue. (On playing England in semi) It will be a nice match, nothing changes for us as a team."

June 25, 2024 12:17 AM IST
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: 'Come on, Bangladesh now!' says Marsh

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Disappointing. It happens in the game of cricket. In the course of 40 overs, there are a lot of small margins. India were the better team, Rohit is a class player. (On Head and Maxwell's batting) Gave us more belief than hope. In a run chase like that if you keep it at 10 an over, we are in the game. India's bowlers were too good though in the end. Come on, Bangladesh now!

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Rohit Sharma is the player of the match

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: An innings for the ages from the Indian captain. He has also taken his career T20I tally to 4165 runs, which he has become the highest run scorer of all time in the format. Again.

“That's what I have to do (in the powerplay), try and see what the bowlers are doing, play accordingly. They changed their plans and tried to bowl against the breeze. Needed to be smart, was just backing myself to do. You got to understand that bowlers are smart, they are not going to bowl into the breeze. I was thinking to hit everything that was possible. You can access all sides of the field, that is what I was trying to do. It has been a good wicket and you need to back yourself on good wickets, glad that it came off today. I told you that 50s and 100s don't matter to me. Need to put the bowlers under pressure, and you need big scores for that. I tried to access all sides of the field, not just one side.”

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: India beat Australia by 24 runs, qualify for the semifinals

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Just four runs in the last over and Australia can relax for some time before sitting down for the next game today (early morning tomorrow Indian time) and rooting with everything they have got for Bangladesh. If Afghanistan win that game at the Arnos Vale, it is curtains for the reigning WTC and World Cup champions. For India, it is pretty straightforward. They can now travel to Guyana where they will face England in a repeat of the 2022 semifinal on

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Australia need 29 to win from the last over

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: 10 runs off the 19th bowled by Bumrah. He finishes with figures of 1/29, easily his most expensive in this T20 World Cup. Now Hardik Pandya to bowl the last over.

IND vs AUS Live Score: Australia 177/7 in 19 overs

June 24, 2024 11:39 PM IST
India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: OUT! Tim David falls now

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Well David hits a four off the third ball of that over. Then Arshdeep misses the yorker on leg and goes wide. He reloads, misses the full toss on off and this time, David hits it straight down the ground for a six. Another full toss but this time David edges it straight to Bumrah at short third.

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: GONE! Arshdeep gets his second, Australia sinking

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Oh a brilliant catch by Kuldeep at short third man. Arshdeep bowls the first delivery of the 18th back of a length outside off, Head cuts hard but goes too fine. It was dying on Kuldeep though and he dives forward to his right to take the catch.

Wade c Kuldeep Yadav b Arshdeep Singh 1 (2)

IND vs AUS Live Score: Australia 153/6 in 17.1 overs

India vs Australia Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Stoinis reverse sweeps the first ball of the 15th straight into the hands of Hardik Pandya at backward point. That was hit with some venom, the ball bounces out of Pandya's hands but he takes it quite comfortably with the second attempt. A couple of very important wickets for India.
