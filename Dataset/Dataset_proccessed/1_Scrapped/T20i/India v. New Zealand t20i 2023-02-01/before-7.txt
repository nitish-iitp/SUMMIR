January 30, 2023
Cricchef

Here is the list of all the registered T20I Centuries for India. T20 cricket is a format of aggressive intent, especially for those batsmen who always want to hit a delivery for a boundary. In a T20 match where a team gets only 120 deliveries, and when an individual player registers a hundred a century in T20I cricket is a notable achievement.

Stats to Focus

Suresh Raina scored the first T20I century from India.

Rohit Sharma has the most T20I centuries, which is 5.

Rohit Sharma has the record for the joint-fastest T20I century in just 35 deliveries as a full-member nation player.

Team India lost all the games when Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, Suryakumar Yadav, and Ruturaj Gaikwad registered each of their respective 1st T20I Centuries.

Shubman Gill has the record of the highest T20I score by an Indian batsman which is 126 runs.

Yashasvi Jaiswal is the youngest Indian to score a T20I century.

Sanju Samson is the first Indian cricketer to register back-to-back T20I Centuries. Tilak Varma became the 2nd to do so.
