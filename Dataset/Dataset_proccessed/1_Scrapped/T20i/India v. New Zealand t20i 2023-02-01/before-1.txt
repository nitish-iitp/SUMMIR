A total of 30 overs were bowled by the spinners, the most by them in a T20I amongst the full members as the second match in Lucknow witnessed a spin fest in which team India managed to seal the deal by a margin of six wickets against New Zealand. With the series now level at 1-1, the action now moves to the third and the decider game on Wednesday, February 01, 2023, at the iconic Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.

Talking more about the Lucknow encounter, the BlackCaps batted first and posted only 99/8 on the board in their allotted 20 overs. Barring Shivam Mavi, all the other six Indian bowlers were amongst the wickets on a spin-friendly surface. In reply, the Kiwis managed to drag the clash into the final over as the hosts also struggled against the spin bowling of the visitors. Suryakumar Yadav kept his cool to remain not out on 26 off 31 and to level the series for his side.

The Men in Blue will be concerned about the T20 form of the opening pair of Shubman Gill and Ishan Kishan, especially with another talented player Prithvi Shaw warming the bench in the first two matches. For the tourists, Finn Allen hasn’t been able to live up to the expectations and would be hoping for a good score under his belt in the final game.

The stage is set for Hardik Pandya and Mitchell Santner’s side to win the decider and clinch the series at the magnificent cricket stadium in Ahmedabad. The home side will be looking to claim a win before facing Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy while the Kiwis head back home to lock horns with England and their Bazzball approach in a two-match Test series.
