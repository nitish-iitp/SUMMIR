Papua New Guinea takes on Uganda at the Providence Stadium in Guyana on Tuesday with both teams looking for its first win in the T20 World Cup.

TOSS UPDATE - PNG VS UGA

PREVIEW

PNG put up a strong show against the West Indies. The two-time champions were put under extreme pressure by PNG bowlers.

Even though the Assad Valal-led side lost, it will fancy its chances in the clash.

Meanwhile, debutants Uganda crashed to a 125-run loss to Afghanistan in their opener.

While their bowlers led by skipper Brian Masaba showed stomach for fight, the batters completely surrendered and their fielding was also found lacking.

The African nation would hope to improve on these to aspects and register its first-ever T20 World Cup win.
