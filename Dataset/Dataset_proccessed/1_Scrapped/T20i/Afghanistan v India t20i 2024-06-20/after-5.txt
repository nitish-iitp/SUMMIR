That's it from us.

Take a read of Jack Skelton's report and then join us at 01:30 BST for the other opening game in this Super 8s group, Bangladesh v Australia.

We'll have text and TMS commentary on that match, and if sleep is somehow more important you'll be able to catch up in the morning.

And if you're after a match at more sociable hours, England are back tomorrow at 15:30 BST against South Africa - should be a cracker.

Have a good evening.

'We could have executed smarter'

19:27 BST 20 June 2024

Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan: "We knew we'd be chasing 160-170 given it was against a bigger team. We could've done it had we executed smarter.

"My bowling has been coming out well, I struggled early in the IPL but I am hitting the right areas consistently, but it's the match result that matters most.

"We've enjoyed our cricket everywhere but our mindset is what matters. If the conditions are helpful, we'll use it depending on if it's a batting or bowling track."

'Everyone did their job'

India captain Rohit Sharma: "The last two years we've played T20s here, so we understand the conditions and planned accordingly. We adapted well and got 180, which was a great effort from the batters. We had class bowlers who defended it perfectly.

"Everyone came in and did their job, that's critical and we dwell on it. Suryakumar and Hardik's partnership was critical at that point, we needed someone to bat deep which they did.

"We know Bumrah's class and what he can do. Important for us to use him smartly regardless of conditions. He's willing to responsibility and he's been doing it for years."

On fielding three spinners: "We'll have to assess conditions, opposition and based on that we're open to make changes if required. We felt three spinners were good here, if it's seamer-friendly next time, we'll go with seamers."

Afghanistan were always going to be up against it chasing 182, and their odds got even longer after Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran fell cheaply within the first ten overs.

Their middle order got starts but none of them pushed onto the sort of significant score that might have put Afghanistan in contention.

Player of the match, India batter Suryakumar Yadav: "There is a lot of hard work and practice behind my batting. When I got into the game I'm very clear in my mind what I want to do.

"Rashid Khan is very difficult to pick, he's the best bowler in the world, you can't let him dominate, you have to be a step ahead. I managed to be on the right side today.

"You have to know the gameplan on these pitches. Keep the team first and be that way.

"When Hardik came in I told him to keep the same intent. I'm really happy that we managed to get above 180."

Arshdeep finishes with figures of 3-36, he was occasionally wayward but managed to clear up the final three Afghanistan wickets.

Bumrah was obviously the pick of the bowlers with 3-7, while Kuldeep Yadav picked up two wickets from his four overs.

All ten wickets were catches as Afghanistan swung for a formidable total.

India are a great unit. Their batting didn't quite fire but their bowling has.

Afghanistan have had a good run but today it was India's bowlers who put the breaks on them. It was too much and they couldn't cope, it became predictable.

Unremarkable end to the match here as Arshdeep sends down two off side wides.

Maybe Afghanistan can do it in extras? Only 48 runs to go.

This is a big defeat and they aren't doing a lot to dent the net run rate.

Can Bumrah finish the match?

Not on this occasion - but it's another tight over from the star seamer, with just a leg-bye coming from the final delivery.

Bumrah finishes with figures of 3-7 - formidable.

Takes the edge!

Arshdeep comes round the wicket to bowl to number elven Fazalhaq Farooqi and finds his bat, but the ball drops short of slip and rushes off to the boundary.

In and out by Naveen-ul-Haq, attempting a pull that he doesn't have room for and sending the ball skyward. Pant runs round to take the catch.

When Rashid Khan gets going he can take the game away from you. Afghanistan could've done with him being a bit more sensible but that's not the way he bats.

Khan c Jadeja b Arshdeep 2 (Afg 121-8)

On the stretch, lifting the ball into the hands of a fielder in the deep. I've written this post before.

Angled across the body of Rashid Khan by left-armer Arshdeep, his swing sends the ball skying to Jadeja at deep third.
