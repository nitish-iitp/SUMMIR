Even as the seventh (and final) league round matches are underway in the Elite Group of Ranji Trophy 2024, the second rung of India's premier domestic red-ball cricket tournament is ready for its summit clash. Hyderabad and Meghalaya, both of whom have earned a promotion to the Elite Group for the next season, will lock horns in the Plate Group final on Saturday, February 17. (More Cricket News)

The title meet will be played at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium, Hyderabad's home turf. The Tilak Varma-led side are two-time champions, and will be aiming to cap off a strong Plate campaign in style, with a title triumph.

Hyderabad advanced to the final on the back of an innings victory against Nagaland, while Meghalaya notched up an outright win over Mizoram in the semi-finals. The hosts have been unbeaten thus far, and will be the favourites going into the final. But cricket is a game of glorious uncertainties, and Meghalaya cannot be excepted from springing a surprise.
