Afghanistan recently played their final match of the Sri Lanka tour, making four changes to the playing XI.

One of the notable changes was the inclusion of wicketkeeper Ishaq Rahimi, who made an impact by scoring 16 crucial runs.

Despite the challenging conditions where no one was able to hit boundaries due to the ball reversing, Rahimi showed promise with his short stay at the crease.

In his brief innings of eight balls, he displayed his potential by confidently lapping a low full toss for a six.

Afghanistan has been facing challenges in finishing matches, not only in T20s but also in ODIs.

The team has struggled to find a player who can play improvising innings and take charge during crucial moments.

Ishaq Rahimi has shown glimpses of being able to fulfill this role, provided he is given consistent opportunities to showcase his skills and contribute effectively to the team’s success.

With his promising start and ability to handle pressure situations, Rahimi could potentially be the solution to Afghanistan’s finishing woes in both T20 and ODI formats.
