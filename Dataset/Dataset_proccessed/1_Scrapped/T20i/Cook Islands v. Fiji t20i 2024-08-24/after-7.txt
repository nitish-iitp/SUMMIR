Fiji
135/9 - 126/9
Cook Islands
Fiji won by 9 runs
Fiji vs Cook Islands Prediction

Fiji will enter this crucial match against Cook Islands in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup East Asia-Pacific Region Qualifier A with a significant challenge. They currently sit at the bottom of the table, with just 1 win from 4 matches and a concerning net run rate of -1.418.

Fiji's recent performances have been inconsistent, with only 2 wins in their last 5 T20Is, but they will be motivated by their previous 104-run victory over Cook Islands.

On the other hand, Cook Islands have been more successful in the tournament so far, winning 3 out of 4 matches, although their net run rate of -0.251 shows room for improvement. They will aim to maintain their position near the top of the table and will be focused on avenging their recent heavy defeat to Fiji.

This match will be an intense battle between two sides with contrasting momentum.

Taylor has consistently delivered, taking more than 1.5 wickets in the last 4 matches, showcasing his form and ability to trouble the opposition of their group.

The betting tip is...

Oscar Taylor Over 1.5 wickets.
