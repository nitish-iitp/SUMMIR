Highlights SL vs PAK Asia Cup 2022 Final: Sri Lanka beat Pakistan by 23 runs in the title clash to win their sixth ever Asia Cup title on Sunday. Chasing 171, Pakistan were bowled out for 147 in 19.6 Overs with Pramod Madushan taking four wickets and Wanindu Hasaranga taking three wickets. Mohammad Rizwan did score a fifty but couldn’t push up the scoring-rate and the pressure of scoreboard got to the Pakistan batters in the end.

Earlier, Pramod Madushan gave Sri Lanka an ideal start with wickets off successive deliveries as he got rid of Babar Azam and Fakhar Zaman inside the Powerplay. Pakistan scored 37/2 in six overs.

Bhanuka Rajapaksa had led a superb fightback to remain unbeaten on 71 as he guided Sri Lanka to a competitive 170/6. Put in to bat first, SL were in deep trouble after losing five wickets for just 58 runs before Rajapaksa and Wanindu Hasaranga joined forces for a solid recovery. Hasaranga departed on 36 but Rajapaksa completed his half-century to give his team a fighting chance at the title.

Pakistan captain Babar Azam opted to bowl first in the summit clash. Sri Lanka were unchanged for the final and put faith in the eleven that defeated Pakistan on Friday. On the other hand, Pakistan brought back Naseem Shah and Shadab Khan after benching them for the inconsequential final Super Four game. SL captain Dasun Shanaka said he would have bowled first as well underlining the vital role toss has played throughout the event.

Match Preview

It’s time. Two teams that started the tournament with defeats, contrasting ones at that, are today squaring up for one last time for the Asia Cup 2022 title. Sri Lanka were humbled by Afghanistan, and Pakistan lost a thriller to India at the start of the tournament. However, both the teams made terrific improvements as the event progressed and made it to the summit clash. For a neutral, the event has been engrossing. The Super Four stage saw India, Pakistan, Sri Lank and Afghanistan fighting tooth and nail to advance to the final. India, who were quite impressive in the group stage, slumped to two defeats before a signing off with a big win in the next round. Pakistan won two of their three matches while Sri Lanka won all three of their Super Four matches.

And the Dasun Shanka-led side have the psychological edge over Pakistan since they got the better of them in the last Super Four match on Friday. On the other hand, Babar Azam’s Pakistan will be hurt from the defeat and eager to bite back at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium tonight and thus setting the stage for what promises to be a thrilling finale.

SRI LANKA WIN THEIR 6th ASIA CUP TROPHY

A match to remember for Sri Lanka and their fans this one. They lost the toss. They were reduced to 58/5. In chase, Pakistan were 93/2 at one stage. However, the Dasun Shanaka-led side didn’t lose hope and kept fighting and denting Pakistan. First up, Bhanuka Rajapaksa scored an excellent 71 not out to push them to a competitive total of 170/6 in 20 Overs. It was his fighting knock that kept Sri Lankan innings from unravelling. And then Dilshan Madushanka bowled a forgettable first over in which he gave away 9 extras. But Sri Lanka started hitting back with two big wickets inside the Powerplay to get rid of Babar Azam and Fakhar Zaman, courtesy Pramod Madushan. However, a solid partnership followed between Mohammad Rizwan and Iftikhar Ahmed. Pramod returned to get rid of Iftikhar and broke the partnership. Rizwan though reached his fifty but was slow in his approach. And then Wanindu Hasaranga bowled a deadly over in which he took three wickets to all but seal the contest in Sri Lanka’s favour. Madushan finished with a four-wicket haul while Hasaranga took three wickets to add to his 21-ball 36 earlier with the bat. Pakistan were bowled out for 147 in 19.6 Overs as Sri Lanka became the Asian Cup holders for the sixth time in their history.
