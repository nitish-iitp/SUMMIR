Sri Lankan players celebrate with the winners trophy after their win in Asia Cup final against Pakistan

Pakistan vs Sri Lanka, Asia Cup 2022 Final Highlights: Sri Lanka beat Pakistan in a final that ebbed and flowed until the death overs of the latter's innings. Sri Lanka made it difficult for Pakistan to score throughout their 172-run chase and turned the screws in the last four overs. Wanindu Hasaranga, who had earlier scored a 21-ball 36 to bring the Sri Lankan innings back on track with Bhanuka Rajapaksa, took three wickets in the 17th over alone to all but finish off the Pakistani challenge. Earlier, Rajapaksa's unbeaten 45-ball 71, completely turned the tables on Pakistan. Sri Lanka ended up scoring 170/6 despite being 67/5 after the first 10 overs.
