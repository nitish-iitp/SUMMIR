What's the story

New Zealand speedster Lockie Ferguson floored the Irish middle-order with figures of 3/22 in the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup.

The right-armer was bowling serious pace, including a hostile 155 km/h delivery in his spell.

Ferguson's effort saw him restrict Ireland to 150/9, thereby garnering a 35-run win for the Kiwis and almost a spot in the semi-finals.

We decode his stats.

He averages a phenomenal 17.42, with a strike rate of 12.80.

Notably, Ferguson has already picked up 14 wickets this year at 18.07, while boasting an economy of 6.96.

Match

How did the match pan out?

Put to bat, the Kiwi openers stitched a prolific 52-run stand within the powerplay.

After a couple of setbacks, Kane Williamson (61) was joined by Daryl Mitchell, and the pair helped the Kiwis reach a commanding 185/6.

Meanwhile, Irish quick Joshua Little grabbed the headlines with a hat-trick (3/22).

Andrew Balbirnie's men showed intent but threw the towel versus tight bowling on offer.
