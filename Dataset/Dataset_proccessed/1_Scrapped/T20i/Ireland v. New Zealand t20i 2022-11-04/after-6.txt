NZ vs IRE Live: Pitch Report (Michael Atherton and Mel Jones)

"We are at pitch no. 5 at Adelaide Oval. This is fresh new pitch. 60-meter square boundaries. The biggest pocket is 83 meters at deep mid-wicket from the river end (for a right-handed batter) It is a dropping pitch these days, the pitch is hard but it is a fresh pitch. It is firm, nicely grassed, inviting short square boundaries, and runs to be had."
