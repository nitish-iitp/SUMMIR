Scientists have identified compressed gas within rocks as the trigger for the massive 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption, which caused significant tsunamis and global climatic impacts. The explosion released energy comparable to multiple nuclear blasts, debunking prior beliefs about underwater magma-seawater interactions.

For two years, scientists were perplexed by what could have triggered the 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai volcano eruption, which came to be considered one of the largest volcanic events in recorded history. The massive underwater eruption in the South Pacific Ocean led to the death of four people and injured many. However, recently a team of researchers from The Australian National University (ANU) revealed its main trigger.
In a bid to decipher the physical mechanism, the research team analyzed the seismic record during the event. Jinyin Hu, the co-author of the paper, explained that based on the findings, they can confirm that there was an explosion caused by gas-compressed rock trapped underneath a shallow sea, which released energy equivalent to “five of the largest underground nuclear explosions conducted by North Korea in 2017.”
The findings are a surprise, as they broke the common perception that such huge underwater explosions are caused by the interaction of hot magma with cold seawater. Dr. Thanh-Son Pham, another study author, said that the explosion pushed the water vertically, leading to tsunamis that reached as high as 45 meters at nearby islands. Using seismic waveform modeling, they also noticed a vertical force that pointed upwards during the event. This upward force was the Earth rebounding upwards as the water was uplifted. According to their research, the amount of water uplifted was enough to fill about one million standard Olympic-sized swimming pools.
The Hunga Tonga event was short in duration, but it was one of the best-instrumented events compared to other such events in the recent past. From satellite images to seismic sensors, the event was globally observed, with everyone using their best equipment to document it. The team emphasized that studying gas releases and micro-seismicity from volcanic sites can help scientists prepare for future events of this magnitude. Another event of the same magnitude happened back in 1991 at Pinatubo in the Philippines; however, the monitors and technologies were not advanced enough to document it.

The Tonga event caused significant destruction, with the tsunami reaching incredible heights and damaging buildings and other infrastructure along the coast, including underwater cables. However, the eruption also released ash and debris into the atmosphere, which had a significant impact on the global climate. Another study claimed that the water vapor and aerosols released into the atmosphere by the Tonga eruption had a cooling effect on the planet due to their ability to block sunlight.
