Japan have won all three of their games so far and are hence at the top of the table with six points. Philippines are in second place with two wins from three matches.

The winner of this six-team tournament will advance to the final qualifier for the 2026 T20 World Cup that takes place in India and Sri Lanka.

The Japan vs Philippines match is being live streamed on the FanCode app and website in India. It is not being telecast on any TV channel in India.
