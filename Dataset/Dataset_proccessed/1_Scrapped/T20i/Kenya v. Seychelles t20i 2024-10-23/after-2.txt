On Wednesday (October 23), Zimbabwe broke the world record for the highest score in a men's T20I, scoring 344-4 against The Gambia during a T20 World Cup qualifier.

In the ICC Men's T20 World Cup Sub Regional Africa Qualifier Group B match between the sides, Zimbabwe won the toss and elected to bat first at the Ruaraka Sports Club Ground in Nairobi, Kenya.

Zimbabwe smash world-record 344 against The Gambia

Zimbabwean openers Tadiwanashe Marumani and Brian Bennett got off to a flyer, scoring 49 in the first three overs and 92 in the first five, before Marumani was bowled by Andre Jarju in the sixth over for 62 off 19 balls. At the end of the Powerplay, Zimbabwe's score was 102-1.

No.3 Dion Myers continued where Marumani had left off, and by the time Bennett fell for 50 in the 10th over, they already had 143 on the board. At the halfway stage of the innings, it was 150-1.

It would only get worse for The Gambia, though. Zimbabwe skipper Sikandar Raza, who had come in in the seventh over, seized the initiative in the company of left-hander Ryan Burl. The pair took their side past 200 off 12.5 overs, meaning their last 50 runs had come in 17 balls.

Raza reached his half-century in the 15th over, off 20 balls. At the end of that over, the score was 228-4, and Zimbabwe looked on course to running the T20I record of 314 close.

Not only did they do that, but they blew past the record. The 17th over of the innings alone yielded 35 runs, as Raza laced four sixes and two fours, with a no-ball giving Zimbabwe some help. Raza's century came off 33 balls, in the 18th over, and his side became just the second team to score over 300 in a men's T20I.

18 runs came off the penultimate over as Zimbabwe went past the world record. In the final over, they added the icing on the cake by taking another 25 to finish on a scarcely believable 344-4. Raza remained unbeaten on 133 off just 43 balls, having hit seven fours and 15 sixes. Zimbabwe hit 27 sixes in all, as well as 30 fours.

Bennett's strike rate of 192.3 (50 off 26 balls) was the lowest among the six Zimbabwean batters, and each one of them managed to hit at least one four and one six. The Gambian bowling card cut a sorry figure as Andre Jarju, who went at 13.25 runs per over through his four-over spell, was the most economical. Musa Jobarteh ended up conceding 93 in his four, at 23.25 runs per over.
