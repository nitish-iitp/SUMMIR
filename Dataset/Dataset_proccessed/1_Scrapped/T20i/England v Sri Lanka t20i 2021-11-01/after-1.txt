World T20: Pollard’s thigh injury being assessed ahead of Sri Lanka clash

West Indies captain Kieron Pollard picked up a muscle injury to his left thigh against Bangladesh and will be assessed ahead of the side’s next World T20 game against Sri Lanka on Thursday.

Cricket West Indies Media on Monday announced: “Today is the squad’s first training session since that encounter. Pollard is training and being assessed by the medical staff, with the aim of being ready for the match against Sri Lanka on Thursday.”

On Friday, the 34-year-old Pollard walked off the field in the 13th over of the West Indies innings against Bangladesh, but returned later to smash the last ball of the inning for six runs that proved to be crucial in the context of the Caribbean side’s narrow three-run win.

West Indies, reigning champions of the tournament, are sitting in the penultimate spot on the Group One table with just two points. After heavy opening defeats to England and South Africa, they rebounded to register their first point against Bangladesh.

With a Net Run Rate in the negative, Pollard’s men would need to beat Sri Lanka on Thursday and Australia on Saturday and hope other results go their way to make it into the semi-final round.
