COMMENTRY
Right then. That's it from the coverage of this game. England are placed comfortably at the top of their group table with 8 points. While, this does not shut doors for Sri Lanka, mathematically they can still make it. The action continues on Tuesday in the Super 12s. It is a double-header, South Africa will take on Bangladesh at 2 pm local (10 am GMT), followed by a game between Pakistan and Namibia at 6 pm local (2 pm GMT). Do join us then. Cheers!
Eoin Morgan, the England skipper, is up for a chat. On being asked about the win, he says he is incredibly proud of the boys. They had to put up a great fight and Ali and Livingstone did really well with the ball after Mills got injured. Mentions, Sri Lanka pushed them more than the other teams and this was a tough win. Mentions, Buttler was outstanding with the bat, he possess the ability to change the game. Adds, he was enjoying himself in the middle and is the only aim was to build a partnership while he was out there.
Dasun Shanaka, the skipper of Sri Lanka, says that the bowlers have been good in the first 10 overs but not good enough in the back end. Says that he knew the dew factor will play in the second innings. Says their batters played well. Adds that this players have come along in the tournament and it will be very good for us in the future.
Jos Buttler wins the Man of the Match award for his exceptional hitting with the blade. He says that he was patient today and it was really tough at the start and Morgan and him just attacked at the backend. Adds that, they tried to settle in and then tried to each attack the shorter side and he enjoyed batting with Morgan today. Adds that at one point they were just thinking about getting to 120 so, 160 was always a bonus. Mentions that he just uses the same willow in the practice as well and picks up the one he likes. On his run out, he says that it was actually his favourite bit today and mentions that he was trying to guess where the bowler was going to bowl in that last over and got the six in the end to get to the milestone.
... PRESENTATION TIME ...
Earlier in the innings. It was Jos Buttler's knock of 101 runs which helped England to a really healthy score, which was 40 runs more than what they expected at the halfway mark. Later, Hasaranga got his team back into the game with the bat, but the Lankan effort fell short.
England started off brilliantly with the ball. It was an early run-out which got things started for England. Soon after, Rashid came into the attack and picked up two wickets in no time to put Sri Lanka on the backfoot straightaway. It was Chris Jordan then who got a breakthrough, to pile on the misery. Woakes and Livingstone leaked handful runs in the middle overs, both picked up a wicket each. In the death overs, it was the combination of Chris Jordan and Moeen Ali to take it over the line.
Sri Lanka got close to the finish line, but slipped out in the end. The Islanders got off to a sedate start. They lost three wickets inside the Powerplay in the form of Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Perera and Charith Asalanka. Fernando and Rajapaksa tried to build a stand but the former slipped out. After 15 over, Sri Lanka were 113 for 5. It was then Wanindu Hasaranga’s hitting which brought hope in the Lankan camp, but once he was departed. The wickets fell in a cluster and Sri Lanka ended up on the losing side. They did put up a good fight, but it was not enough to trouble the in-form English squad.
England bowlers continue their fiery attack inside the Powerplay. With this game the English Lions have taken 13 wickets in the Powerplay, they have been consistent with the ball throughout. They defended for the first time in this campaign and did it brilliantly. With this win, Morgan becomes the most successful captain in T20Is and England extend their winning streak to 4 on the trot!
