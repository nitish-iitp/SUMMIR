World T20: Buttler’s maiden ton keeps England perfect

England all but secured their place in the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup as Jos Buttler’s sensational century set up a tense 27-run win over Sri Lanka.

Chasing 164 after Buttler’s 101 not out, Sri Lanka required just 34 from 20 balls to end England’s unbeaten start to the tournament.

But, with England battling the dew and the loss of Tymal Mills to injury, Jason Roy and Sam Billings combined for a fine relay catch on the boundary to dismiss Wanindu Hasaranga for 34.

Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka, who put on 53 with Hasaranga, was brilliantly run out by a Buttler direct hit in the following over.

The final three wickets fell for three runs in seven balls as Sri Lanka were bowled out 137 in Sharjah.

It sealed England’s fourth victory from four games, one more comfortable than looked likely at times in both innings.

Buttler rescued an innings floundering at 35-3, reaching his maiden Twenty20 international hundred with a six off the final ball as England posted 163-4.

They remain top of Group One and, while Australia and South Africa could still join them on eight points, it would take an improbable swing of net run-rate for both sides to overtake them.
