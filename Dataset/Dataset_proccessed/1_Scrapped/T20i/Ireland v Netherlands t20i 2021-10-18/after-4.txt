India Vs England, T20 World Cup 2021 Highlights: India beat England by 7 wickets in their first T20 World Cup Warm-up Match in Dubai. Mohammed Shami shone with 3 wickets, while Ishan Kishan (70, retired not out) and KL Rahul (54) smashed blistering fifties at the top.
T20 WORLD CUP 2021 India Vs England Highlights.

India Vs England Live Score: In chase of 189, India got off to a dream start, as as a flurry of boundaries from Ishan Kishan and KL Rahul took India to 73/0 after 7 overs. Rahul got to his 50 off 23 balls but was dismissed off Mark Wood the very next ball. However, Kishan continued on his merry way as he brought up his 50 to set Indian on course to victory. In order to give Suryakumar Yadav some time in the middle, he decided to retire after scoring 70 off 46. Skipper Virat Kohli could only score 12. Rishabh Pant remained not-out on 29 as he took India over the line for a 7-wicket win with 6 balls to spare. Courtesy of blistering knocks from Jos Buttler (18) and Jason Roy (17), England raced to 51/2 by the end of the Powerplay. Both of them, however, were dismissed by India pacer Mohammed Shami. However, the twin blow did not affect World's No.1 T20I batsman Dawid Malan as he, in tandem with Jony Bairstow, continues to continue their side's onslaught. However, he was undone by a googly from Rahul Chahar on 18. Once again, the fall of wickets didn't matter as Liam Livingstone (30) and Bairstow put on 52 runs stand for the 4th wicket before the former was cleaned up with a yorker. England reached 130/4 after 15 overs. In the end, courtesy of a late flourish from Moeen Ali (43* off 20 balls) powered England to 188/5 in 20 overs. After winning the toss against Jos Buttler-led England on Monday, India skipper Virat Kohli opted to bowl. He also revealed that he will bat at no.3, while KL Rahul will open, saying "it's hard to look past him".

"Now that the sun has gone down, it should skid on a bit more. West Indies batted a bit slow, Pakistan did show that the wicket is getting better. Should be more runs than the first game."

Jos Buttler, captain England today, speaks at the toss

"Everyone is excited. Good to get together. Obviously, he (Morgan) is having a rest after those weeks in the IPL. Gives others a chance of exposure. I’m sure India are going to come hard at us, there will be a lot of intensity. Some have come from the IPL for us while many are coming directly from back home. It’s about adapting to the team roles. Pushing for places is important, it’s something that’s driven us over the last many years. There is a lot of competitiveness and it really drives the guys. It’s been healthy for us."

India vs England Live Score: Virat Kohli speaks at the toss

"We will bowl first. The idea is to create some energy and momentum as a team. We have played in different teams recently (in the IPL). We have had success in the past. So we want to create that same energy, fielding is the best place to start I reckon when eleven guys are together. The IPL is right up there in terms of level and competitiveness, but this is paramount. Indian cricket is the priority for everyone. That has to be case. Adapatability is what matters. People play different roles in their IPL teams. It's about adapting quickly to this team now, who plays where is what matters. We are pretty sorted in terms of how we are going to start in the first game. Outside of that we just want to give opportunity to guys in these games as much as possible. We will look to give game-time to most of them. Things were different before IPL, now it's difficult to look beyond KL Rahul at the top of the order. Rohit is a no-brainer. World-class player, he's been solid up front. I will be batting at 3. That's the only news I can give to start off (smiles)."
