IPL 2021 Final Highlights, CSK vs KKR: Chennai Super Kings beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 27 runs in the IPL Match Today in Dubai to lift their fourth Indian Premier League title.
IPL 2021 CSK vs KKR Highlights - Indian Premier League Chennai Super Kings vs Kolkata Knight Riders Final Match Today.

CSK vs KKR Highlights, IPL 2021 Final: It is title number four of MS Dhoni and Chennai Super Kings as they win the IPL 2021 title by beating Eoin Morgan-led Kolkata Knight Riders by 27 runs in the final in Dubai. In chase of 193, KKR openers matched their CSK counterpart. Venkatesh Iyer and Shubman Gill took Kolkata to 59/0 in just 7 overs. Iyer got to his fourth 50 but soon after, he was dismissed by Shardul Thakur. The CSK bowler struck again in the same over after getting rid of Nitish Rana for a golden duck. In the next over, Josh Hazlewood got the wicket of Sunil Narine (2) before Deepak Chahar removed Gill on 51. KKR were 5 down as Jadeja sent Dinesh Karthik packing on 9. Eventually, KKR were restricted to 165/9 in 20 overs, with Thakur picking three wickets. Ruturaj Gaikwad overtook Punjab Kings' skipper KL Rahul in the ‘Orange Cap’ race and provided a strong start to CSK along with fellow opener Faf du Plessis. By the end of the 8th over, CSK cruised to 61/0 against KKR in Dubai. Eventually, Sunil Narine provided the breakthrough by dismissing Gaikwad on 32. Du Plessis then brought up yet another 50, and with able support from Robin Uthappa, took CSK to 104/1 after 12 overs. The two brought up their 50-run stand before Uthappa was caught LBW by Sunil Narine. Eventually, du Plessis smashed 86 off 59 balls, missing the Orange Cap by 2 runs, to power CSK to 192-3 in 20 overs. Moeen Ali (37*) and Robin Uthappa (31) played handy cameos.

IPL 2021: THANK YOU SO MUCH! CURTAINS DOWN

Dear viewers, thank you so much for joining us tonight and throughout IPL 2021. Our entire, consisting of Shivansh, Aditya, Aritra, Karan, Aakash, and Yash, had a great time bringing you the live action through the live blogs throughout IPL 2021. We hope you enjoyed the coverage as well.

This is all we have for from you this season. Yes, we will be back for the next edition but there is a lot that is going to happen before that. 

And we begin with the ICC Men's T20 World Cup. 

So, see you there. Until then, it's goodbye! CIAO!

Once again, congratulations to CSK

Bravo and Jadeja speak next

Belief in the squad from management, owners. After last season was really disappointed. Owed it to the franchise, the fans to come up with a better performance. Don't get nervous (coming into a final). Have had good performance in different phases of the tournament. Faf and Ruturaj standout for us. To have these two guys scoring over 500 runs together. Experience beats youth anyday. Going to change the name from Mr. Champion to Sir Champion (Jadeja standing next to him). *breaks into song along with Jadeja*

Josh Hazlewood speaks to the broadcasters

"Fantastic. All the pictures on the wall of CSK. Full credit to the guys. Saved the best for last. Learning heaps. Such a senior team here, especially the bowling group. DJ been so helpful all the time. Little bit of downtime over the next week or so and then jump straight into the World Cup. Perfect preparation.

CSK vs KKR Live: Ruturaj Gaikwad speaks after the match

It is top of the moon feeling to win the orange cap and win the IPL. It is very very satisfying to win the IPL. It feels great. We didn't have a great season. Coming here, everyone believed and we are here. When you are performing well, you are confident on your lesser risk shots. You need to make sure you are there till the end.

IPL 2021: Moeen Ali speaks after the win

"Can't describe how I'm feeling. To do it with this franchise is great. He's got no weakness (on Gaikwad who's standing next to him). He's so calm. Has got every shot. Hopefully in the future will play for India. So calm and so clear in what they want to do. No changes. Could've been dropped a couple of games ago. It's such a grounded and humble team."

IPL 2021 Final: Shardul leaking runs 

Mavi hit 17 off Bravo. He is now facing Shardul Thakur

NO-BALL! AND FOUR! What's happening suddenly? A high full-toss above the waist height and Lockie Ferguson does well to pull the ball behind square for 4. MSD is not very happy

WIDE! There is a fair amount of dew and this time, the knuckleball slips off his hands

WIDE! What is actually happening? Another wide and Dhoni's isn't amused at all. He just needs to bowl straight and there is a perplexed look on everyone's face.

SIX! It's a rank half-tracker from Shardul and Lockie muscles it over from long on for 6. 

KKR are 162/8 in 19 overs.

Chennai Super Kings vs Kolkata Knight Riders IPL 2021 Live: Late fireworks from Mavi 

FOUR! Oh, hello! Where did that come from? Too little too late for KKR though. Wide yorker from Bravo, Mavi throws everything's he got it. The ball flies off the edge to third man boundary

SIX! Well, Shivam Mavi hasn't given up. Another wide yorker from Bravo. Mavi carves the ball over third man for six

SIX! OH MY MY! DO WE HAVE A LATE TWIST! Mavi can bat. This is a fantastic shot. Bravo now coming from around the wicket, bowls a full toss on Mavi's pads. The pacer flicks it over deep square leg for 6

He will keep strike

KKR are 145/8 in 18 overs.
