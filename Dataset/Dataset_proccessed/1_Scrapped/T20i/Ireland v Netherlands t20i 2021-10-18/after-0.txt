T20 World Cup: Irish bowler Curtis Campher has taken his first hat-trick in the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup, being held in UAE and Oman. He achieved this amazing feat during the match against the Netherlands in Abu Dhabi on Monday. He is the first bowler from Ireland to take a hat-trick in International cricket and the first bowler ever to pick 4 wickets in 4 balls in a T20 WC match. 

Curtis Campher picked up four wickets in four consecutive balls. He has become the third bowler in the world to do so in T20 Internationals. Sri Lanka's Lasith Malinga and Afghanistan's Rashid Khan were the only bowlers who have been able to achieve this historic feat before the Curtis. 

Rashid Khan took four wickets against Ireland in 2019 and Malinga, on the other hand has achieved the feat twice against New Zealand in 2007 & 2019. Speaking of bowlers who took a hat-trick in the T20 World Cup, Australia's Brett Lee achieved the feat against Bangladesh before Curtis did. 

Here Is The Video of Curtis Campher Hat-trick

Made this record during 10th over of innings:

Curtis Campher did this feat in the 10th over of the Netherlands' innings. He dismissed Colin Ackermann on the second ball for a personal score of just 11 runs. On the very next ball, he sent Ryan ten Doeschate back to the pavilion. He returned to the pavilion after losing his wicket to LBW on his very first ball.  

Curtis Campher becomes the first ever Ireland player to take a hat-trick in men's international cricket. With this, all full-member countries have at least one hat-trick to their name.#T20WorldCup #IREvNED

On Curtis Campher's fourth delivery, the ball once again hit the Netherlands' batsman's pad. However, Umpire Rod Tucker seemed to disagree with Campher and gave a 'Not-Out' decision. A decision review was then pleaded, where the hawk-eye view revealed that the ball would've hit the leg stump. With the overturning of this decision, Campher's hat-trick was completed. Curtis Campher's fifth ball struck Netherlands' batsman Wayne der Merv's bat and then hit the wickets. In this way, he picked up four wickets in four balls. 

The Netherlands' innings folded for 106 runs:

Batting first, Netherlands was able to score just 106 runs in 10 overs. With a personal score of 51 runs, Max O'Dowd became the highest scorer from the team. Apart from Curtis Camper, Mark Adair also took 3 wickets for Ireland.
