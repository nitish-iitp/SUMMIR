In an interview with radio host Siddharth Kannan, Minissha was asked if she had reservations about her previous relationship. “The reason why I would always shy away from wanting to date anyone from the industry, not just actors, was just this. Because there is so much temptation around all the time. I don’t want to say anything because there are a lot of people who are dating actors and it is not right to make a statement that will hurt somebody. But this was a decision that I took for myself and I would rather not. Because relationships, I feel, already are so difficult,” she said.

On being asked if she was cheated on by an actor, Minissha said, “In one relationship which I had with an actor, yes. But I think only because the personality of the person was such that they were a big flirt.”
