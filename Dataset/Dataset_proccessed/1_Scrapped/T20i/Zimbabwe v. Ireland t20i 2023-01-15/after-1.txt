COMMENTRY
Right then, that is all we have from a very entertaing T20I series. Zimbabwe have bagged the series 2-1 and we will now move to the ODI series. The first match of the three-match ODI series will be played on Wednesday, 18th of January and the action will start at 12.45 pm IST (7.15 am GMT). Do join us for the build-up of that game. Cheers!
Craig Ervine, the skipper of Zimbabwe says that this series win means a lot. Tells that especially the way they finished last year, they wanted to continue the momentum forward and he is glad that they did well here. Says that it was an opportunity for other guys to step up in the absence of seniors and they did that. Says that it is a nice feeling to chase down a total in a decider and and he feels that Burl batted brilliantly. Informs that Sean Williams will not be available for the ODIs with a fractured finger but adds that Raza and Ballance will be back for the ODI series.
Ryan Burl is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH AND PLAYER OF THE SERIES! Burl says that the kind of role he is playing in the team, he is trying to put Zimbabwe in good positions. Tells that it nice to remind the world about his batting and is happy to deliver a good performance. Tells that their fielding has been outstanding and feels that if they can stop some soft dismissals and improve their running, they can get better. He signs off by saying that he is proud of the series win.
Andy Balbirnie, the skipper of Ireland says that they left a few runs out there in the first half and adds that they knew that if they bowl well they can make the match out of it. Credits Burl and Ervine and says that they played well. Mentions that the team that have chased have won all three games but he is not sure that made the difference and feels that Zimababwe adapted better. Adds that in hindsight, it can be called a wrong decision of bowling left-arm spinner to Burl but it could have gone other way around too. Says that they will have Little, Stirling and Tucker back for the ODIs and hopes to do well in the ODI series.
Time for the Presentation..
Ireland, well, they played good cricket and kept themselves in the game right till the end. They recovered well with the bat after losing three wickets early and Harry Tector was the one who played a handy knock of 47 off 38 balls. They got over 140 and Tector once again was brilliant with the ball in the second half and gave away just 14 runs in his four overs and took a crucial wicket too to keep his team in the game. Barry McCarthy and Benjamin White got two wickets apiece but the move to bowl Dockrell against Burl in the 18th over turned out to be a game-changer as that over went for 19 runs and took the game away from the Irish. Overall, a good performance from Ireland throughout the series but it was not enough to take the trophy home.
This victory was set up by Zimbabwe with a disciplined bowling in the first half on a sluggish wicket. Their spinners were top-notch once again and seamers too did their job quite well. However, they needed to bat well to get to the target as the pitch was a bit tricky and it was their captain who decided to take the responsibility on his shoulders. He held one end up as other batters could not convert their starts into anything substantial though Innocent Kaia and Tony Munyonga made important contributions. However, the man who stole the limelight was Ryan Burl! He kept his cool even when Ervine lost his wicket in the 17th over and then smashed Irish bowlers all over the park on a wicker where even single runs were cheered by the crowd. He ended with 30 off just 11 balls and took his team to a memorable series victory here.
Zimbabwe have done it! They win the series and this Zimbabwean side under Craig Ervine continues to grow from strength to strength. Incredible scenes at the Harare Sports Club and we have wintessed a cracker of a decider and series here. Zimbabwean players are emotional and it shows how much this means to them, they have done it without Raza and Williams here and it really shows the depth and character of this team.
