EMI vs SJH Live Scorecard UAE T20 League, 2023: EMI vs SJH Match Preview:
Emirates Cricket Team Preview

Nicholas Pooran and Andre Fletcher are the other two hard-hitting West Indian players on the Emirates side.

Trent Boult, Imran Tahir, Samit Patel, Will Smeed, Jordan Thompson, Najibullah Zadran, Zahir Khan, and Fazalhaq Farooqui are in the squad of Emirates and the team looks quite well.

Sharjah Cricket Team Preview

Sharjah has Evin Lewis, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, and Dawid Malan at the top of the order and their rescues will be important for the fortunes of the team in the competition.

The all-round capability of Moeen Ali, Mohammad Nabi, and Chris Woakes will keep Sharjah in good stead.

Fast bowler Naveen-ul-Haq has impressed in his short international career and it would be interesting to see how he takes on the duty of leading the Sharjah bowling attack.

Chris Woakes is expected to take the new ball alongside Naveen.
