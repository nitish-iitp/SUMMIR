I'm surprised they didn't bat Adair a bit lower down.

Looks like a lot of white folk in the crowd again. A lot of trust has been rebuilt with ZC recently. Good to see people engaging with cricket again.

Tino saying Kenyon Ziehl plays for the 'Zimbabwe Over 70's     He's just turned 60! I'd hide if I were you Tino

No Williams Raza and Ballance . I don't see us chasing anything above 140 -145

Williams out of the rest of the Ireland series and will miss at least the first Test Vs Windies.

I hate it . Williams in the twilight of his career . I don't want to see him missing any game . I love watching him play .it hurts and will hurt more than the series loss

Disastrous news for Willo. The physio was trying to put his finger back yesterday, that must have been ticklish when it was broken  . How do you break your finger sliding on grass?

Why isn't Dean getting a commentary stint?

Ya Evans can feel hard done by, as usual.

Much needed wicket. Wicket still holding up, I don't care what the commentators say. If you get leading edges it's a give away that it's slow.

Yes Ponso! Needed that. Madande did well to get to that so quickly. He's lively
