Chairman PCB Mohsin Naqvi who had warned of strict measures against players has now softened his tone and says discussions are underway regarding the team’s poor performance in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024.

Following the defeat against India, Mohsin Naqvi expressed extreme disappointment regarding the team’s performance. While talking to Geo News outside the parliament, Mohsin Naqvi said, “The consultation is ongoing and it is not appropriate to discuss [the matter] further at this juncture.”

Pakistan Cricket Team has lost terribly against the USA and then India. The chances of Pakistan progressing into the Super 8 of the tournament are getting thinner and largely depend upon the outcome of other matches. Pakistan is set to play its last group match against Ireland on June 16th, 2024 in Florida which is expected to be washed out due to the ongoing heavy rains in the city. Pakistan needs to win the match against Ireland to keep its hope alive in the tournament.

PCB Chief has now advised the nation to wait as the tournament is still going on and still a few league matches are left to be played.

He reiterated that the team currently needs support and insisted that Pakistan needs to move ahead in the tournament with the existing teams. He said that everyone is praying for the success of the team.

However, last week after the team’s poor performance against India, he hinted at a major surgery in the team.

“It seemed that a minor surgery would work but after this bad performance, I’m now sure that a major surgery is required. The nation will soon see a major overhaul,” said Naqvi.

Naqvi said that the “defeat against India was disappointing in every sense”.

The PCB chairman said that he “knows what is going on in the team and what are the reasons for losing”.
