Bhopal: A team from the CBI’s economic offences wing arrived at the MP forest department’s wildlife headquarters in Bhopal on Monday to probe two significant wildlife trafficking cases with international ramifications—smuggling of rare red sandalwood and trafficking of wild turtles and tortoises.
The red sandalwood case was registered on Sept 17, 2019, with the Van Mandal, Dhar, after officials had seized 504 logs of red sandalwood weighing 15,530.5kg.
In 2019, officials had received a tip-off that a truck carrying red sandalwood logs was en route to Indore via Maharashtra. The vehicle was intercepted near an interstate NHAI toll booth in Dhar district. Upon search, the red sandalwood logs were found concealed under a cargo of limestone. The logs were reportedly destined for Dubai and were estimated to be worth Rs nine crore in the international market.
Initially managed by the forest department, the case saw two Chennai residents being detained.

Given the organised and interstate nature of the smuggling, which potentially has international connections, the case was transferred to CBI on Jan 13, 2023, under section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. CBI’s EO-II branch in New Delhi now oversees the probe.
The origin of the red sandalwood is suspected to be in Andhra Pradesh. The precious wood is in high demand abroad, especially in East Asian countries, where it is used in traditional medicines and woodcraft. It is also listed as an endangered species by IUCN.

A case concerning smuggling of wild turtles and tortoises was registered on May 5, 2017, with the Tiger Strike Force in Sagar. Over 20 people associated with an international poaching syndicate have been arrested so far.
Mannivannan Murugesan, a key accused, has been detained in Sagar since 2018 for allegedly smuggling critically endangered turtles from the Chambal region for international sale. This is the first environmental crime case involving extradition, with Thailand seeking Murugesan’s extradition. His bail plea was dismissed by the Supreme Court, which confirmed that his case is open in Thailand and an international arrest warrant had been issued.
Murugesan was apprehended by the STF from Chennai on Jan 31, 2018, for smuggling red-crowned roofed turtles from Morena district. Murugesan is said to be a key figure in a network operating across India, Bangladesh, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, China, Madagascar, and Seychelles. The accused’s legal team argues that there is no direct evidence against him beyond his own statement and contends that his ability to travel to Thailand contradicts claims of a pending trial there.
However, the govt advocate said that Mannivannan and Mohammad Irfan, another suspect, are deeply involved in the international smuggling of endangered species, with extensive networks and substantial financial transactions linking them to the illegal trade.
The CBI SP from Delhi had requested that the PCCF wildlife office provide investigating officers (IOs) for both cases and necessary logistical support, including vehicles and guest house arrangements. Forest department had recommended the CBI inquiry for these cases, leading to the current investigations.
