South Africa vs Nepal Commentary
3:15 AM IST Right then, what a fabulous contest we have witnessed here at the Arnos Vale Ground in St Vincent and the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup just keeps giving us these humdingers which the neutrals certainly enjoy a lot. Also, in Tarouba, New Zealand have demolished a hapless Uganda side by 9 wickets in what is a consolation win for the Kiwis. There's still group stage action left in the tournament and next up, it will be India taking on Canada in Lauderhill on Saturday, 15 June at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT) but as usual, you can join us a lot sooner for the build-up. Till then, take care and goodbye!
3:11 AM IST Aiden Markram, the South African skipper says that he is grateful to have got the win. Adds that they were not at their best and were on the back foot for the most part of the game. Mentions that pace is their strength and they want to back it. Shares that it was challenging for the Nepalese batters when the pacers hit the right lengths. Lauds the Nepal bowling made it tough for them and the run-scoring was difficult. Adds that Nepal are a quality side. States that they want to prepare well going forward as the conditions in the Caribbean will be different from those in the USA. Shares that they need to assess, adapt, and develop their plans going forward. Ends by saying that they wanted to give Tabraiz Shamsi, some gametime and with Keshav Maharaj in the mix, both the spinners will play a key role going forward.
3:09 AM IST SOUTH AFRICA HAVE DONE IT AGAIN AND IT IS HEARTBREAK-HOTEL FOR NEPAL! The Proteas have played 4 games and after the first game, all remaining three games have been low-scoring thrillers which they have managed to win whilst not being at their best but they have managed to win every single game and that's the mark of a good side. Nepal though, were so close to getting their first T20I win against a Test-playing nation and they will feel, they let it slip right at the death and this loss means, Bangladesh are all but through to the Super 8s alongside South Africa but Netherlands are still in with an outside chance in Group D.
3:08 AM IST Nepal's skipper, Rohit Paudel says that he is very proud of the unit given the way they bowled and even batted. Adds that they knew the wicket would have been on the slower side and once they got a bit of a feel while bowling, they knew spinners would be the way to go. Reckons that they didn't quite manage to do well in the crunch moments and if they keep up the good work, next time, they will get over the line. On the fans, he says that he wants to thank everyone who has come in from so far and even those at home who watch them and support them.
3:07 AM IST Tabraiz Shamsi is the Player of the Match for his terrific spell. He says that he is definitely relieved as they came into the game with the intention of making four out of four. Adds that the game got close but they came out on the winning side. Lauds the Nepal side as they used the conditions well and played a wonderful game. Mentions that they have been put under pressure and came out victorious which is a positive for them. Ends by sharing that they want to take one game at a time.
3:07 AM IST The Presentation ceremony...
