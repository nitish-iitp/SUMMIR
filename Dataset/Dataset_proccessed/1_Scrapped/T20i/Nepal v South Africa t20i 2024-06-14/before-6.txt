Pakistani cricket team never played like a team and that’s why eliminated from #T20WorldCup Most of us are only criticising the cricketers. No doubt they played very bad but who selected them in this team? Selectors and their facilitators are the real problem not the cricketers. pic.twitter.com/1XYXlvFmVd

India vs Pakistan

The deserving team is through to Super 8 round. If you're depending on Ireland to defeat someone, you seriously don't deserve to qualify. Don't think even "Kudrat Ka Nizam" works for those who are not deserving or ready to improve. All eyes on PCB chairman now! #T20WorldCup
