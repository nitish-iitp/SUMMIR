Having utilised the home conditions smartly, Tanzania appear to be the strongest of all sides at the tournament so far. They skittled Lesotho for just 18 runs in their opening match and then shot out Mali for 61 runs to wrap up two resounding victories in the first two matches.

On the other hand, Cameroon had a challenging start to their campaign as they lost to Ghana in their opener. But they came back strongly to beat Mali in the second match. Cameroon will have to put up an improved performance if they are to halt Tanzania's winning run.
