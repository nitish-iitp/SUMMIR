'Like bad day at City Gate' for T20 WCup fans
JELANI BECKLES
FANS attending the West Indies T20 World Cup match against New Zealand on the night of June 12 were left frustrated trying to access the park-and-ride option from South Park Mall, as there was no crowd control, with people pushing to get on buses.

So unfortunate for South Park users. At Petrotrin access ran off very smoothly. Kudos to the pleasant and polite officers who were directing traffic flow. At the area drivers had busses lined up patiently waiting for us. Thank you PTSC

People pushing is not the fault of the organizers.
