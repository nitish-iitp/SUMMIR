PAK vs NZ Scorecard
Pakistan vs New Zealand Commentary
5:26 PM IST That is it from this game. New Zealand will look to bounce back but they need a much better performance from all the players than this one. The 3rd game will be played on the 21st of this month at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT). Join us earlier for the build up. Cheers!
5:26 PM IST Babar Azam says he is happy with how they bowled in the first six overs. Tells they'll experiment and shuffle with the batting line up in the next matches. Shares all the players are match winners and the combination is good right now in their team. Reckons they want to tick a bit of boxes before the World Cup and they'll try their best to prepare well and be upto the mark.
5:23 PM IST Michael Bracewell says they didn't score a lot as they were slow to adapt to the surface but their bowlers did well to try and defend the score. Tells they'll learn from this game and play well in the next match.
5:21 PM IST Shaheen Afridi is the Player of the Match. He says it's good to bowl after a long time, he just backed his skills today. Adds it's important to bowl according to the conditions and there was not much swing as well today. Tells with Mohammad Amir back, their bowling unit is strong now.
5:12 PM IST ...Presentation next...
5:11 PM IST It's hard to blame the Kiwi bowlers here. They tried their best as they took 3 wickets but were short of runs to defend. It was an all-round performance by Pakistan. They bowled well first of all. All of their bowlers were excellent and right on the money. Shaheen Afridi ended with three wickets while Mohammad Amir on his long return took two wickets as well. The batters chased down the under-par score with ease. Mohammad Rizwan scored half of the score while others motored around him.
