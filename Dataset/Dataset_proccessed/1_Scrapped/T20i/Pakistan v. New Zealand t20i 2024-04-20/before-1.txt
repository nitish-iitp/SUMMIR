PAK vs NZ: [WATCH] Shaheen Shah Afridi Bowls A Stunner To Dismiss Tim Robinson

The first T20I match between New Zealand and Pakistan at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, Rawalpindi ended in a no-result due to consistent rains on 18th April 2024. New Zealand captain Michael Bracewell won the toss and decided to bat first.

The match did not start due to persistent rains. After a long rain delay break, the rain stopped and it was reduced to 5 overs game. Shaheen Shah Afridi produced a beauty hitting the timber off the 2nd delivery getting rid of debutant Tim Robinson. Afridi celebrated before the rain came again and the match was called off as Mark Chapman came to the crease.

The 2 runs came off leg-byes. Tom Robinson opened the innings with Tim Seifert. Dean Foxcroft, Mark Chapman, James Neesham, Josh Clarkson, Ish Sodhi, Jacob Duffy, Ben Sears, and Ben Lister were included in the playing XI for New Zealand.

RIPPER!

In time for a dose of @iShaheenAfridi's first-over magic 😎🦅#PAKvNZ | #AaTenuMatchDikhawan pic.twitter.com/1HwXDKVK1T

Pakistan named Babar Azam, Saim Ayub, Mohammad Rizwan, Usman Khan, Iftkhkhar Ahmed, Irfan Khan, Shahbad Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, Mohammad Aamir and Abrar Ahmed.

Babar Azam has been appointed as the white-ball captain for Pakistan after Shaheen Shah Afridi was removed from the captaincy after a 1-4 loss to New Zealand. Pakistan included Mohammad Aamir in playing for the first match after he decided to step down from retirement.

Pakistan named three debutants for the first T20I match including Muhammad Irfan Khan, Usman Khan, and Abrar Ahmed. Tim Robinson made his debut for New Zealand in the first encounter. This was not an ideal start for both teams ahead of the T20 World Cup 2024 to be played in the West Indies and the USA.

Both teams would look to make use of matches

After the first T20I match was called off due to rain, the focus shifted to the 2nd match of the series to be played on 20th April 2024.

Both teams would look to play the same XI in the 2nd match and hope to see a full match. Pakistan will play T20I matches against England and Ireland before the T20 World Cup.
