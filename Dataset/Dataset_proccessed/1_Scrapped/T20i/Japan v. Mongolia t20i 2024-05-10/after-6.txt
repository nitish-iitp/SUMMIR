Gujarat Titans (GT) and Chennai Super Kings (CHE ) will face off in their next match. Who will win the 59th T20 Match of the Indian Premier League 2024? Find out in the GT vs CHE Today Match Prediction. The cricket match between Gujarat Titans and Chennai Super Kings will be held on Friday, May 10th, at the Venue Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad.

GT vs CHE Today Match Prediction – Team Analysis
Gujarat Titans (GT)

Gujarat Titans has had a really bad season. They’ve played 11 games, won four, and lost seven. The batters haven’t done well at all.

Gujarat Titans are in a tough spot. None of their players are playing well, and they don’t have many backup options. They’ll probably use the same team as before.

GT needs a miracle to make the playoffs. They’ve only won four out of 11 games and are at the bottom. To have a chance, they have to win their next three games by a lot. But they’re playing against CSK, KKR, and SRH, the toughest teams. So, reaching the final seems impossible.

The IPL 2022 champions haven’t played like a team that wants to win.

Chennai Super Kings (CHE )

Chennai Super Kings has had some ups and downs, but they’ve won six out of 11 games. They’ll make it to the playoffs if they win the next three games. But they’ve relied greatly on Ruturaj Gaikwad and Shivam Dube for runs. Other batters need to step up, too.

CSK has too many good players to choose from. Mustafizur Rahman returned home, and Matheesha Pathirana was injured and returned to Sri Lanka. Mahesh Theekshana is ready to play, but Santner did well in the last game, so Theekshana might not play.

CSK won against PBKS in their last match. They must win all three remaining games to ensure they’re in the playoffs. The points table is tight, and teams like SRH, DC, LSG, and RCB are fighting for the last two spots. Ideally, CSK wants to win all three games, but if they have to lose one, it shouldn’t be against GT. They have RR next in Chennai, so winning against GT is important to stay in a good position.

However, there are concerns about consistency from Ajinkya Rahane, Daryl Mitchell, and Ravindra Jadeja. Plus, without Mustafizur Rahman and Matheesha Pathirana, the bowling doesn’t look strong.

Who will score the most runs for CHE in the match: Ruturaj Gaikwad & Shivam Dube

Who will pick the most wickets for CHE in the match: Tushar Deshpande & Ravindra Jadeja

Scores Prediction

Gujarat Titans are predicted to score between 180-190 runs

Chennai Super Kings is predicted to score between 190-195 runs

Who will win the Match?

CSK is expected to win. They have a good team, and beating PBKS in the last game would have boosted their confidence after losing many games.

Jadeja scoring runs and Santner bowling well have given them hope.

Considering how GT has performed this season, CSK should easily win.

Our Prediction – Chennai Super Kings will win against the Gujarat Titans.
