Black Caps all-rounder Jimmy Neesham is renowned for his sense of humour, and his trademark comedic side was evident following Sunday's T20 finale against Australia.

Neesham and Aussie all-rounder Glenn Maxwell exchanged shirts after New Zealand's convincing seven-wicket victory at Wellington's Sky Stadium, proudly displaying the signed kits on social media.

But eagle-eyed fans noticed a hidden message on Neesham's jersey — 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 6.

During the third T20 on Wednesday, Maxwell took a particular liking to the Kiwi seamer's bowling, smacking six boundaries in a single over as he raced to 70 off 31 balls.

Neesham finished the match with bowling figures of 0/60 — the second most runs conceded by a New Zealander in a T20 international.

But the 30-year-old seemingly knows how to laugh at his own misfortunes, gifting Maxwell a piece of memorabilia so he never forgets the chaotic over in Wellington.

The pair represented the Kings XI Punjab at last year's Indian Premier League in the United Arab Emirates, and frequently poke fun at each other on social media.

The Black Caps secured their maiden T20 series victory over Australia, holding their nerve to win Sunday's decider at Sky Stadium.

New Zealand chased down Australia's below-par total with 27 balls to spare, opening batsman Martin Guptill top-scoring with 71.

Apart from Wednesday's entertaining demolition, Maxwell struggled to make an impact in the T20 series, registering scores of 1, 3, 18 and 1.
