World T20: Zampa gives Australia’s NRR massive boost with career-best figures

Australia boosted their hopes of qualifying for the Men’s T20 World Cup semi-finals with an eight-wicket thrashing of already-eliminated Bangladesh in Dubai.

Bangladesh were bowled out for just 73 and Australia chased the target in 6.2 overs to significantly improve their net run-rate and climb above South Africa into second place in Group One.

Aaron Finch made 40 and David Warner 18 before Mitchell Marsh pulled for six to win the game with 82 balls to spare. Adam Zampa took a career-best 5-19.

It was a woeful batting display from Bangladesh, but Mitchell Starc exploited the early swing with the left-armer and Josh Hazlewood both taking two wickets.

Australia knew that chasing the target in 8.1 overs would see them overtake South Africa and after three quiet overs, they took 21 off Mustafizur Rahim to propel their chase.

Finch and Warner were bowled by Taskin Ahmed and Shoriful Islam, but Justin Langer’s side cruised home and capped off an all-round perfect display.

England, who top Group One, are still not guaranteed a semi-final spot, but it would require a huge defeat against South Africa on Saturday for them to not progress.

If South Africa beat England then Australia must beat West Indies to progress to the final four.

Thursday’s second game sees defending champions West Indies, who can mathematically still qualify for the last four, face the already-eliminated Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi. (BBC Sport)
