The Gauri and Nainika S-curve dress came with a black-and-white floral print, a ruffled skirt, a raised collar tied together with a flowy satin ribbon, and wide slots on the torso.

A broad black belt cinched at the waist provided a fit-and-flare silhouette and accentuated Bhumi's frame. Additionally, the floor-sweeping train alleviated the gown's look, lending a fairytale vibe.
