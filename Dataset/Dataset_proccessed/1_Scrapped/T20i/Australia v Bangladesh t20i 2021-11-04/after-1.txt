We are set for Australia's reply! The players of Bangladesh have made their way out in the middle. Aaron Finch and David Warner are the opening batters for Australia.

... THE RUN CHASE ...

Right then. The Australian bowlers have done their job exceedingly well. They would hope their batters come out and chase down this target as soon as possible. The Bangladeshi bowlers do not have much to defend but they will surely try to keep things tight. Do join us for the second essay.

Mitchell Starc is up for a chat. He says that it feels pretty good when they perform like this and they started really well with the ball. Tells that he likes it when he gets some swing early on with the new ball. Adds that he did not have a great game against England but he feels good that he came back well in this game.

The Australian bowlers were on song. They never let the batters settle in. Adam Zampa was the star with the ball for Australia. He picked up a 5-for and made sure to end things quickly. But this wouldn't have been possible without the early destruction provided by Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, and Glenn Maxwell in the first three overs of the innings. Pat Cummins was good with the ball but could not find any success. Overall, the Aussies bowlers have provided their batters with the perfect platform to finish the game early and get a huge NRR boost.

Bangladeshi batters failed to impress yet again. This side looks like it clearly misses the services of Shakib Al Hasan. This was their second game without him, and they were in all kinds of trouble. Bangladesh lost three wickets in the first three overs and right at the beginning, they lost the momentum. Mohammad Naim, Mahmudullah and Shamim Hossain were the only batters to get some sort of start but could not make the most of it. While the rest of the batters were very disappointing. Yet another sorry display with the bat by the Bangla Tigers.

What a show by the Australian bowlers! This is just what they would have wanted in this game. Australia were all over Bangladesh right from the word go. The Aussies have really come out with an intent to make sure they see some growth in their NRR. They will surely be the happier side going into the break.

OUT! TAKEN! Zampa was denied the hat-trick but he gets his 5-wicket haul! Tossed up again, outside off. Shoriful Islam looks to slog sweep but gets the outside edge. Aaron Finch takes a good catch at first slip and that ends the first innings. Bangladesh are bowled out for 73!

OUT! LBW! The review does not work in favour of Hasan and he has to depart on a golden duck. Mahedi Hasan looks to pull away the ball that he thought was short enough but this one skids through. Flatter, around leg. Hasan goes back and looks to pull it away but misses. He gets rapped on his back leg. Zampa appeals and the umpire raises his finger. Hasan decides to take the review. The Ball Tracker shows it is umpire's call on the ball hitting the wickets. The final decision is out.

Mahedi Hasan is the next batter.
