<image:caption>Patrick Mahomes Sr. had a successful baseball career long before his uber-talented son came along, playing for six different MLB franchises over 11 seasons. A pitcher by trade (mostly a reliever), Mahomes Sr. logged 709 innings pitched and finished his career with 42 wins on the mound. And it's clear that his arm strength was inherited by Patrick Jr., who played college baseball at Texas Tech and was even drafted by the Tigers - before starring for the Chiefs.</image:caption>

<image:caption>Mahomes has been an utter revelation since entering the NFL, as he's won three Super Bowls and two MVPs in just his first seven seasons. He's widely considered to be the greatest quarterback in the sport and it's not a stretch to say he has changed the game as we know it with his mind-bending passing accuracy and range. The scariest part? He's just 28 years old, and will likely rule the NFL for another decade-plus as long as his health holds up</image:caption>

<image:caption>LeBron James has put together a career worthy of GOAT status - and his son Bronny has been along for nearly the entire ride. The No. 1 pick in the 2003 NBA Draft, LeBron has mesmerized fans with his athleticism and all-round game, winning four MVPS, four titles and even becoming the league's all-time leading scorer last season with the Lakers. LeBron has also played a massive role in championing player empowerment and movement throughout the league, with his infamous 'Decision' to team up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh changing the sport for years to come.</image:caption>

<image:caption>With a legendary name on his back, Bronny was something of a late bloomer but made strides late in his high school career to become a five-star recruit, ultimately deciding to begin his college career at USC. He suffered a cardiac arrest before his freshman year and missed the first eight games, and that set the tone for a choppy first year in college where he earned played in a reserve role for a struggling Trojans squad. He showed himself to be a capable defender but scored just 4.8 points per game. Nonetheless, he declared for this year's NBA Draft - though he may be wise to reverse that decision and play another year in school.</image:caption>

<image:caption>Not only did Ken Griffey Sr. (left) and Jr. both achieve their dream of playing in the MLB, they did so together, as the father-son pairing was teammates on the Mariners from 1990-91. During that run, in 1990, they did something that had never been done before by a father and son, hitting consecutive home runs in the lineup for the Mariners. The sequence signaled what had passed and what was to come: Griffey Sr. was wrapping up an extremely distinguished, almost 20-year career, while his son would go on to become a Hall of Famer and a 13-time All Star.</image:caption>

<image:caption>Griffey, seen with the Reds in 2008, would go on to have a legendary career not only on the stat sheet but with his impact in the sport. Sure, he hit a whopping 630 home runs, but he also dazzled fans with his effortless fielding ability and base-running prowess - earning him the nickname 'The Natural.' In fact, Griffey Jr. reached the type of pop culture status that baseball players rarely do, and his shoes became a huge hit with fans.</image:caption>

<image:caption>Before Stephen Curry (and his brother Seth) became two of the greatest shooters in NBA history, they had a courtside view of another great shooter: their father, Dell. Dell, who spent most of his career with the Charlotte Hornets, was a sniper from deep and won the Sixth Man of the Year Award in 1993-94. Clearly, spending time around his expertise was beneficial for his sons, as Seth has carved out a long NBA career and Steph, a two-time MVP and four-time champ, is a lock for the Hall of Fame when he calls it quits.</image:caption>

<image:caption>Both Curry brothers are still going strong in the NBA, as the two faced off against each other (not for the first time) this February. Their careers have taken wildly different paths: Stephen, a college star at Davidson, was a first-round pick with instant expectations in Golden State, expectations he more than delivered upon once his ankle injuries subsided. Seth, meanwhile, had to claw his way to NBA relevance after going undrafted out of Duke, and 11 years later, he's certainly done that. And while he won't retire with the same accolades as his older brother, he does have the better career three-point percentage right now!</image:caption>

<image:caption>The Manning brothers, Peyton (left) and Eli (right) also received quite the crash course for their future careers as NFL quarterbacks from their father Archie. A 1971 draft pick, he played in a far different era than his sons would eventually star in, but nonetheless made a name for himself mostly with the Saints, earning two Pro Bowl selections in New Orleans. There were huge expectations for both Peyton and Eli due to the name on their back - as well as their stellar college careers, but they both delivered in the NFL...</image:caption>

<image:caption>Before Dennis Rodman was a doting sports dad, he was a cult hero with the NBA's Bulls. Opposite to Michael Jordan's steely greatness and Scottie Pippen's defensive prowess was the eccentric Rodman: throwing his body around, hauling down rebounds and bringing a much-needed slice of personality to the NBA with his ever-changing hairstyles. Five championships later, Rodman is considered a legend of the sport, and assumed his place in the Hall of Fame in 2011.</image:caption>

<image:caption>Deion Sanders, seen with his sons Shedeur (left) and Shilo (right) was a dual-sport phenom during his playing days. Nicknamed 'Primetime,' Sanders  played baseball and football at the same time, most notably appearing for the MLB's Braves while starring primarily for the Falcons and Cowboys in the NFL. Even within one sport, he was revolutionary, playing offense, defense and special teams for a Super-Bowl winning Dallas squad. He's a Pro Football Hall of Famer and now coaches Shedeur and Shilo at the University of Colorado.</image:caption>

<image:caption>Both Shilo and Shedeur have a chance to follow their dad to the NFL. Shilo, who turned 24 in February, had a career-year in 2023, leading the Buffs in tackles with 70 from defensive back and chipping in with four forced fumbles. Shedeur, meanwhile, is an NFL talent at quarterback, and starred last season despite his team limping to a 4-8 finish. He's projected to be a top-five pick at next year's NFL Draft</image:caption>

<image:caption>Michael, seen with his son Mick in an old photo, is recognized as an F1 legend. The German-born driver, who starred for the likes of Mercedes and Ferrari, earned seven F1 championships and a stunning 155 podium finishes. Tragically, while skiing with a 14-year-old Mick in 2013, Michael suffered a serious brain injury during an accident. While he's still alive, he now hasn't been seen publicly in over a decade, as his son Mick follows in his racing footsteps.</image:caption>

<image:caption>At just 25 years old, Mick is relatively early into his racing career. A former full-time F1 driver with Haas from 2021-22, he later went on to be a reserve for Mercedes and McLaren. Now, Mick is embarking on a new challenge: the World Endurance Championship, in which he's racing for Alpine. His uncle Ralf thinks his nephew's F1 dream may soon be over, but perhaps Mick has another trick or two up his sleeve...</image:caption>
