He will also observe Sri Lanka’s national players’ preparation for the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.

The program marks Sri Lanka Cricket’s initiative to bring in the required expertise to enhance the coaching strength of the SLC High-Performance Center and the Major Club system in the country.
