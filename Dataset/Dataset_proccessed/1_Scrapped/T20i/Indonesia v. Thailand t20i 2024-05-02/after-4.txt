NEW DELHI: An affair between a 45-year-old female politician and her 24-year-old adopted son, who is also a monk, has taken Thailand by storm and captured the attention of social media users, according to SCMP.
Prapaporn Choeiwadkoh, known as "Madam Ple," was caught on video by her husband, Ti, lying naked in bed with Phra Maha, the young monk the couple had adopted from a temple last year.

The incident has sparked a frenzy on social media platforms. Many users, according to the media report expressed their disbelief at the bizarre nature of the story, with one commenting, "This news is explosive, with too many elements. It sounds like pure fiction. The world of the wealthy is indeed fascinating and chaotic."
Another user questioned the plausibility of the story, stating, "A 64-year-old husband, a 45-year-old wife, and a 24-year-old adopted son who is a monk? This is such a mess. It sounds more like keeping a boy-toy rather than adoption. Even dramas don't dare to script this."

When confronted by her husband, Prapaporn reportedly claimed that she and Phra had not engaged in sexual activity and were merely chatting.
Phra, who has since gone on the run, also defended his innocence, saying, "Nothing happened." He claimed that he had sought Prapaporn's help with his personal troubles and that "then we were going to shower."
Ti expressed his sense of betrayal, saying, "I was furious when I found them together. I felt so betrayed. I had bought her gold and given her many gifts."
Prapaporn, a well-known politician from Sukhothai province, currently serves as the president of a local chamber of commerce and has been a member of the Democrat Party since March last year. However, due to the scandal, she has been suspended by the party pending an investigation into the matter.
