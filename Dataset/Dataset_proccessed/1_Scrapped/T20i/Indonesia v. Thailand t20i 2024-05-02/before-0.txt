SRH vs RR (Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Rajasthan Royals), 50th T20 Match Preview

Mayank Markande didn’t play for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the last game. Pat Cummins said they chose to play an extra batter before the match with CSK. There are no reported injuries before Thursday’s game.

In the last game, four out of five bowlers took wickets, and the batters helped Rajasthan win with six balls left. So, we don’t think they’ll change the team for the next match. Jos Buttler hurt his hand while fielding against LSG, but he’s expected to play in this game.

We predict that Rajasthan Royals will beat Sunrisers Hyderabad.
