Ayush Shukla and Lockie Ferguson {PC:X}

Hong Kong’s 21-year-old right-arm medium pacer Ayush Shukla achieved an incredible feat in the history of the T20Is. He equaled New Zealand National Cricket Team pacer Lockie Ferguson's record of bowling four back-to-back maiden overs in the international T20s.

Hong Kong pacer Ayush Shukla achieved the feat during the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier A match against Mongolia in Kuala Lumpur. The game between the two teams took place on Saturday (August 31) at the Bayuemas Oval in Kuala Lumpur.

Ayush Shukla became the first player from Asia and the third bowler overall in world cricket to bowl four back-to-back maiden overs in the T20I match. In the game against the Mongolia National Cricket Team, the 21-year-old picked one wicket and returned with the figures of 4-4-0-1.

Shukla was given the responsibility to take the new ball, and he started the match right on the money with the ball. The right-arm pacer bowled sensationally well and was rewarded for his bowling in the first over as he picked wicket on the last ball of the over.

Ayush then made sure he carried the momentum and bowled 18 dot balls in a row. His spell put the Hong Kong National Cricket Team on top as they made a mockery of the opposition and went on to register the dominating win under their belt and bag important points under their belt.

Ayush Shukla's spell saw the Mongolia National Cricket Team getting bundled out of 17 runs in 14.2 overs. Hong Kong then chased the target in 1.4 overs for the loss of one wicket. Apart from Shukla, Ehsan Khan was the hero with the ball as he picked up 4 wickets and gave 5 runs in 2 overs.

Hong Kong have been decent with the bat and ball in ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier A matches. They have won both their matches and are at the No. 1 position in the points table. They will be next seen in action when they take on Singapore on Monday (September 2).

Ayush Shukla equals Lockie Ferguson and Saad Bin Zafar

Ayush after bowling four maiden overs in joined Saad Bin Zafar and Lockie Ferguson in the list of bowlers who have bowled 4 maiden overs in the T20I game. Canada skipper became the first bowler to achieve the feat when he bowled 4 maidens against Panama in 2021 and also picked up two wickets.

On the other hand, Lockie Ferguson achieved the feat in the game against Papua New Guinea in the T20 World Cup 2024. He didn't give a single run in the four overs that he bowled and also picked three wickets in the match, helping his team register a big win.
