India vs Canada Highlights, T20 World Cup 2024 Match Today: Team India’s final group stage match against Canada was abandoned on Saturday. The IND vs CAN match was not possible as a result of a wet outfield at Lauderhill. Both teams took home a point each. Even without the point, India had already qualified. India finished on top of the standings in Group A with 7 points, followed by USA. Canada, Ireland and Pakistan were eliminated from the group.

It must be noted that already-eliminated Pakistan will also play their final group stage game at the same venue later on Sunday.

The IND vs CAN game is the third time a match has been abandoned at this venue. Sri Lanka’s match against Nepal was also washed out while Pakistan were eliminated on Saturday due to the match between USA and Ireland not taking place. The Men in Green needed Ireland to win against USA but a washout meant that they have no chance to go to the next round even with a game in hand.

As it stands, Australia, West Indies, Afghanistan, and South Africa will join India and USA in the Super 8s while two more spots are up for the grabs –- one each in Group B and D.

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup: IND breeze through to the Super 8 stage

A status check on India afetr the group stage. The Men in Blue have been one of the most consistent sides in the group stages at an event where the likes of England and South Africa have struggled at times and the likes of New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have not even made it out of the group stages. It must be noted that their campaign started with a scare against arch-rivals Pakistan on a tricky pitch in New York. 

The only points they have dropped has been the washout in the game against Canada in their final group match.

What's worked for India?

Indian bowlers have been very good in the T20 World Cup, particularly Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh. Mohammed Siraj has been good as well. Hardik Pandya, meanwhile, has chipped in with breakthroughs in the middle overs whenever needed. In the spin department, Axar Patel has given a good account of himself.  In batting, Rishabh Pant has impressed. Skipper Rohit Sharma and Mr 360 Suryakumar Yadav also have fifties to their names.

What needs to work for India?

Virat Kohli has not been his dominant self so far. There are also questions over Shivam Dube, who seemed to answer his critics with his performance in the last match that India played in.

India’s final Group A match at the 2024 T20 World Cup on Saturday was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to wet outfield, with both the teams awarded a point each.

With incessant rains in Lauderhill, Florida, the fate of the game was hanging by a thread already and despite the weather being clear by the time of the toss, the outfield wasn’t cleared for a game by the match officials. (READMORE)

In the end arrived the reminder that this was a T20 match after all; when Rishabh Pant reverse-scooped Barry McCarthy for a six over first slip’s head to wrap an emphatic eight-wicket win for India. Until the burst of impishness the half-packed stadium had waited for the whole day, the game had rolled along like the first morning of a Test match rather than a T20 game, its beats slow and wary.

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup: Bumrah the problem-solver

Five years ago while watching Jasprit Bumrah wreak havoc in the Caribbean, the West Indian pace legend Curtly Ambrose was moved enough to purr on the most admirable facet of the Indian’s craft. “The way he out-thinks the batsmen, outclasses them,” before adding, “he could have been one of us, he’s so complete a bowler that he could have played in any era.”

Five years later, after thrusting the knife into the Pakistanis and turning a T20 World game in a New York minute, Bumrah would echo that singular bowling character trait of his: “I try to solve the problem that is there in front of me. I know its cliched answer but I was trying to focus on what is the best options over here on a wicket like this … I am not looking at whether I am bowling at the best of my ability.”

Seldom has a cliche rung so thrillingly fresh and true. Of all his insane abilities to conjure a yorker on will or coax the ball into bewilderingly-dipping parabolas with his slower delivery, or his sharp nipbackers or vicious straighteners or even the mechanics of his action that whip up the adrenalin of IIT professors, it’s that buzzing brain. The thought is Bumrah’s most potent weapon. (READ MORE)

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup: Will IND play Kuldeep Yadav?

If India wish to play their best spinner in the squad in Kuldeep Yadav at some stage in the T20 world cup, they will have to make a difficult choice of dropping Ravindra Jadeja. Axar Patel’s stocks are flying high, as evidenced by his promotion to No.4 against Pakistan and his bowling figures are better than Jadeja’s in T20. There is no doubt that Kuldeep is the better strike bowler than Jadeja. (READ MORE)

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup: How Canada's last match went

Desperate situations call for desperate measures, even if it means breaking up one of the most prolific opening partnerships for a team. Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan have been almost a constant at the top of the order for Pakistan in their recent T20I history – not to great effect of late – but after two demoralising defeats to start their T20 World Cup campaign and the wave of criticism coming in their direction, the skipper made the radical decision to drop himself down the order.

With net run rate also in the picture, conventional logic would suggest that the former champions would have try to get the 107-run target as quickly as possible, but the lack of confidence and vagaries of the unpredictable Nassau County pitch meant that even against a limited opposition like Canada, they seemed content in strolling over the finish line. That the seven-wicket win was achieved with only 15 balls remaining told a tale in itself. Pakistan had to seal victory inside 14 overs to get ahead of the United States’ net run rate, but managed just 28/1 in the Powerplay.

As things turned out, it came down to the old firm again after elegant left-hander Saim Ayub perished to a cross-batted swipe, and the modest target allowed Babar and Rizwan to play their usual brand of conservative partnership batting, turning the strike over consistently with the odd boundary thrown in.

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup: Saurabh Netravalkar om SKY

USA’s Saurabh Netravalkar was the key man behind the United States win over Pakistan in the ongoing T20 World Cup 2024. The left-arm seamer not only bowled a composed super over defending just 18 runs but also picked up crucial wickets during the game of Mohammad Rizwan and Iftikhar Ahmed.

Ahead of the United States clash against India The 32-year-old recalled his playing days for Mumbai State side and revealed Suryakumar Yadav and him were close friends. “Suryakumar has been a close friend, actually. I’ve seen him since our under-15 days; we kind of grew up playing for Mumbai together. He was always special, scoring double hundreds and stuff in under-15 and under-17 matches,” Netravalkar said speaking on Star Sports.

“He got a chance to play for India later than I expected, but I’m really happy for him. I’m excited to meet him, and it’s an opportunity to play not just against him but also against a lot of the guys we played with. I don’t know how to get Surya out, but I think I’ll just try to do my role, what the team needs me to do,” Netravalkar added. (READ MORE)

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup: How England came back from the death

In a match that lasted 99 deliveries – one short of a complete innings in England’s The Hundred – Jos Buttler’s men pulled off a ruthless win over a hapless Oman. England won with 101 balls remaining, in what was a ‘Net Run Rate 101’ masterclass.

When Buttler won the toss and opted to bowl first, a few eyebrows were raised. Conventional wisdom suggests that a team looking for a NRR boost would opt to bat first, pile on as many runs as possible and then, with the scoreboard pressure on, restrict the opposition to a low total. Oman could have scraped through a total close to 100 and England would have struggled to win by a margin big enough for a serious advantage.

But England went with what the conditions dictated – a pitch that had good bounce and turn on offer for a solid bowling attack against a struggling batting unit – rather than the said conventional wisdom. They saw in the previous two matches in Antigua that the team batting first struggled to post a total, so backed their bowlers to do the damage and try to chase it down as quickly as possible.
And so they went on to blow Oman away for 47 in 13.2 overs, with the high pace of Jofra Archer and Mark Wood doing the early damage followed by Adil Rashid’s crafty wrist-spin. Chasing 48, England’s batters wasted no time – there was a grand total of one defensive stroke in the run-chase – as they chased it down in 3.1 overs to power their NRR past Scotland and wrestle back some momentum that they struggled to find in their first two matches.

Suryakumar Yadav’s gritty half century and his partnership with Shivam Dube guided India to a hard-fought 7-wicket win against the USA as stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma flopped again, scoring 0 and 3 respectively. USA got penalized 5 runs due to slow over rate which made things a little easier for India who waltzed to the Super 8s wit this win.

Arshdeep Singh starred with 4 wickets as India restricted Canada to 110/8 in their T20 World Cup encounter. Nitish Kumar top-scored for the USA with 27 while Hardik Pandya chipped in with 2 scalps.

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup: Former India pacer T Kumaran talks about USA cricket

When I left Chennai for good in 2011, I never thought my love affair with cricket would continue of all places in the United States of America. Once I quit playing the game professionally in Chennai, I came to Dallas in Texas in 2011 as my wife was already working here.

A friend had asserted to me that Dallas is the best place for cricket in the US but there was not much cricket at all here when I came! Another friend asked me if could coach one of his kids and that’s how Kumaran became Coach Kenny here in US. Slowly the word spread around that a former India player is coaching in the region; most of those who turned up were adults as not many kids were taking up the sport. It was the story until 2013.

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup: Why were USA handed a 5-run penalty against IND? We explain

Remember in the USA match, the co-hosts had to concede 5 penalty runs which made it easier for India to chase down the target in an unpredictable pitch. Here's why and what the new rules state.

According to 41.9.4 in men’s T20I playing conditions, the fielding side is required to be ready to start each over within 60 seconds of the previous over being completed. An electronic clock is on display at the ground that counts down seconds from 60 to zero, as the broadcast showed us an over later. The rule further states that when the clock reaches zero, if the fielding side is not ready to start the next over:

– On the first such occasion in an innings, the bowler’s end umpire shall issue a warning to the captain of the fielding side and inform the batters and the other umpire of what has occurred.

– On the second occasion in an innings, the above sequence is repeated, but with the reminder that this is a final warning.

– On the third and any subsequent occasion in an innings, the bowler’s end umpire shall award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side, informing the captain of the fielding side, the batters and the other umpire.

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup: How Arshdeep regained his swing against USA

For a brief while, the US team made up of Indian, Pakistan and Caribbean expats, lit up hopes of pulling off the unthinkable. Only a week ago, USA had shocked Pakistan.

On Wednesday, with the Indian diaspora filling the stands at Nassau County Stadium, and torn between their allegiances, the hosts had India in a spot of bother on more than three occasions. The noise levels when Rishabh Pant fell with India still 66 runs away showed how badly they wished their fellow expats to win the tie. But Suryakumar Yadav’s composure — after being handed a life by Saurabh Netravalkar, who works in California as a technical staff in Oracle after failing to nail a spot in Mumbai Ranji team – meant India remained unbeaten.

A seven-wicket win with 10 deliveries to spare on the last day of the New York leg, where the conditions have been challenging for batsmen, would look convincing. But as Rohit Sharma admitted later, it was a relief for India to leave the Big Apple unscathed. Chasing 111 for win, India were jolted early by Netravalkar. Playing the World Cup after taking time off from his workplace, he had already gatecrashed Pakistan’s party. (READ MORE)

The stadium which was built in under 100 days has been the criticized for the nature of its drop in pitches due to its penchant for unpredictability.

“After the last match is held at East Meadow on June 12, the stadium will be dismantled, the parts shipped back to Las Vegas and another golf event, and Eisenhower Park will return to normal, but with a world-class cricket pitch left behind,” a New York Times report stated. (READ MORE)

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup: Why isn’t Rohit Sharma hitting as many sixes as Marcus Stoinis, Aaron Jones?

The doors of Barbados cricket slammed on Aaron Jones because, as the story goes, he batted too slow and didn’t fit the new-age white-ball hitter mould. Half a decade later, turning up for the USA, he helms the six-hitting charts of the World Cup, with 13 blows over the ropes, in three games. The fellow residents of the top-five six-hitters club are identical to him—none belong to the elite six-hitting league; all are distant from the T20 batting cream, all are mavericks with wildly fluctuating form. But one uniform and often devalued gift unites them all—the ability to generate muscle-bursting power into the shots, and clear the ropes.

On lethargic, sluggish surfaces of the West Indies and America, muscle has outmuscled touch. Batsmen resorting predominantly on timing rather than brawn—most batsmen rely on both components, only the degrees varies—have found that sixes, the money shot in the modern game, are not rolling off the bat as frequently as they used to. The programmable six-hitting machine of this era, Rohit Sharma has struck one in every 13.75 balls; Virat Kohli and Kane Williamson have yet to open the six-hitting registry; Mitchell Marsh (per 18.3 balls) and Babar Azam (per 29) have mustered just three apiece; Suryakumar Yadav only two in the 61 balls.

The pitch has been the villain in the piece. Too slow that batsmen can’t harness pace to hit behind square. Hence, fewer ramps, scoops and upper cuts. The pet six-fetching area has thus been the unfashionable cow corner. Too much of indifferent bounce, more so in the US, that hitting through the line is rolled in danger. Fewer, thus, the sixes over extra cover. That most splendid sight. (READ MORE)

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup: T20 World Cup’s current strike rate is a lowly 103.68 compared to IPL S.R. of 150.58

Ace commentator Ian Bishop best summed up the batting’ pandemonium in the T20 World Cup.

“People were talking about, ‘make bigger grounds,’ ‘put something on the ball for it to swing.’ Put something in the pitch, and you’ll see a different side of batters. That is my point,” Bishop said during New Zealand’s capitulation against the West Indies on Thursday.

The ongoing World Cup, the ninth edition of the tournament, is by far the poorest for the batters in the Powerplay, with the bowlers savouring an economy just a shade over 6. (READ MORE)

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup: Hardik Pandya the bowler in the spotlight

Suddenly, even as he was expressing his anger-tinged disappointment at how Pakistani batsmen imploded on his YouTube channel, Inzamam-ul-Haq turned to his avuncular persona again as he began to talk about Indian bowlers. He made a very pithy statement about Hardik Pandya: “The way he got the wickets. His usage of short balls. He knew where to bowl.” Awareness. Skill. Execution.

It’s Inzy’s Pandya version that India would hope turns up in Super 8s if India are to beat the tougher teams. For a team that’s still hesitant to use their best spinner in Kuldeep Yadav, they would need Pandya, the intelligent seamer to come through time and again.

The emotional context is well known: the boos at home grounds across the country over the Mumbai Indians captaincy; even the way he faced up at the post-match presentations trying to keep a ‘cool’ cheerful face was trolled, and the speculations over personal life that immediately preceded the T20 World Cup.

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup: Pakistan cricket’s nafrat ki dukaan and the economics of Outrage industry

He was once the unverified Virat Kohli of Pakistan cricket. Now Ahmed Shehzad, 32, is an angsty, bitter television expert. He has a stage presence and his tone is theatrical. A film critic would add that he is prone to hamming too. Pakistan’s T20 World Cup defeats to USA and India brings out the ‘over-actor’ in him.

Referring to a chit with numbers, he is having a go at the much-maligned captain Babar Azam. “In big tournaments he has an average of 27, strike rate of 112. He is third in the world when it comes to runs scored in defeats. He has 1400 runs,” he says, raising his voice. Then in disdain, he chucks in air the piece of paper that has Babar’s dire numbers.

The show isn’t over. He stares at the chit on the ground with fury to end his long rant: “Kaunsa King Babar hai yeh … What’s the use of a king who doesn’t score runs”. The monologue has cast a spell over the studio audiences. They get up and clap. If this was a movie hall, they would have showered coins. (READ MORE)

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup: Player to watch out for in the Canada team

Heyliger has picked up a couple of wickets against Pakistan and looked a class apart. He also played a key part in Canada’s win over Ireland. He possesses the ability to bowl hard lengths consistently and extract bounce off the surface which seems to have troubled the batters and Indian batting unit might need to watch out for him.

India vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup: Player to watch out for in India team

The Super Eight of the tournament will be held in West Indies and India might consider bringing in Kuldeep Yadav into the attack. Ravindra Jadeja has looked a shadow of himself and has been unable to contribute with both bat and ball hence he is the most vulnerable to getting axed if the team wants to get a wrist spinner in therefore he needs a solid performance on Saturday to keep his spot.

What does Hardik Pandya the bowler do for India’s chances in the T20 World Cup?

Hardik Pandya is a confident bowler, at times seemingly more confident than his bowling seems to warrant – like he did this IPL bowling himself ahead of Jasprit Bumrah in the initial games. It didn’t quite work on those batting beauts. His bowling is also such that one can’t still go into a game fully confident that he will come unscathed or that he can slip in his full four-overs quota. But his innate confidence in his own abilities can be seen most times. Especially if the tracks offer something to the seamers – then his nipbackers get more potent – or if they are two-faced as they have been in the US – then his back-of-length deliveries come at unpredictable pace to handcuff the free flow of the bat swings.
