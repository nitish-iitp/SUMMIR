BAN vs NEP T20 World Cup Highlights: Bangladesh beat Nepal to qualify for Super Eights
Commentary
08:43 (IST) Jun 17

That’s it then from this game! Bangladesh have sealed their progression which means the Netherlands have been knocked out. Just the two games from the Group Stage left before the Super 8s begin. Until then, goodbye and take care.

08:41 (IST) Jun 17

The skipper of Bangladesh, Najmul Hossain Shanto says that they are very happy with how they played the group stage. Hopes to continue this bowling performance. Shares that the belief was there that they could defend the total if they picked early wickets. Adds that they have a good variety in their bowling unit and that is why they have excelled in this format. Feels that momentum is important in T20s and hopes to build on it.

08:39 (IST) Jun 17

The captain of Nepal, Rohit Paudel says the bowlers did really well. Batting could have been better but Bangladesh bowled really well. Admits they lost too many wickets in the first 6 overs but they fought back well. Ends by saying they need to step up as a batting unit and assess the wicket a lot better. Also says the team has great potential and he hopes to do better going ahead.

08:32 (IST) Jun 17

Tanzim Hasan Sakib is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his stellar showing with the ball. He says they just wanted to bowl in the good areas and just wanted to defend this total. Adds everyone bowled well and hence, they managed to defend this. Says he was only focusing on his plan and it came well. Also adds they are confident heading into the Super 8s. Ends by saying the widket is not easy, you just have to bowl the right lines and lengths.

08:31 (IST) Jun 17

Time for the presentation ceremony...

08:44 (IST) Jun 17

Nepal then fought back courtesy of Kushal Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee. They really got their side back into the game. It came down to them needing 30 in 24. However, the Fizz yet again came to the fore for his side. He gave away just the 1 run in the 17th and got the wicket of Malla and in the 19th, it was even better, he got Airee and bowled a maiden. Shakib Al Hasan then bowled the last over and picked two in two to seal the game.

08:29 (IST) Jun 17

Yet another nail-biter of a game! Bangladesh in the end have prevailed and have sealed their progress into the Super 8s. Tanzim Hasan Sakib at the start and Mustafizur Rahman at the end were absolutely brilliant. Tanzim ran through the top order as he got 4 in no time. He bowled 4 in a row and got 4 massive wickets.

85 - 10

Shakib Al Hasan to Abinash Bohara, OUT! lbw b Shakib Al Hasan.OUT! PLUMB IN FRONT! Two in two for Shakib Al Hasan to finish things off! Bangladesh are through to the Super 8s. Pushes it through, on a nagging length and it skids through, on middle, Abinash Bohara gets on the back foot and gets inside the line to work it away with the angle. He fails to get any bat on it and it goes through to trap him right in front of the stumps. Up goes the finger but Abinash Bohara takes the review, more in hope than anything else. There is nothing on UltraEdge and it is three reds on Ball Tracking. Nepal have been bowled out for 85 and this is the lowest total ever defended by a team in Men's T20 World Cups.

Offers flight and attacks the stumps, on middle, Sompal Kami skips down the track to go back over the bowler's head but gets done in the flight. He misses to connect and Litton Das does the rest by taking the bails off. Abinash Bohara is the last man in for Nepal.

Mustafizur Rahman to Dipendra Singh Airee, OUT! c Litton Das b Mustafizur Rahman.OUT! EDGED AND GONE! End of Dipendra Singh Airee's struggles against the Fizz and that should be the game for Bangladesh. Angling across, on a back of a length, on off, Dipendra Singh Airee shapes up to work it fine on the off side with an open bat face but only manages a feather on it and Litton Das takes it low near his ankles. A wicket-maiden from Mustafizur Rahman. Nepal need 22 runs off the final over. Sandeep Lamichhane comes in at number 10.
