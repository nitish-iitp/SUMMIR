Hello and Welcome to the World Cup Semis!

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG: ‘We understand the occasion,’ says Rohit Sharma

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG:
"Very satisfying to win this game. We worked really hard as a unit. To win this game like that was a great effort from everyone. We adapted to the conditions really well. It was a challenge and we adapted. We played the conditions really well. If the players play according to the conditions, things falls in place. Very pleasing with how we came through. At one stage, (we were thinking) 140-150, as the game went on, after that partnership, we said another 25 runs. I can set the target in my mind, but I don't want to let anyone know about it, to the batters. They are all instinctive players. I thought 170 was a very good score on this surface. They (Axar and Kuldeep) are gun spinners. It's difficult to play some shots, the pressure is on them as well but they were calm and knew what to bowl. He (Kohli) is a quality player. Any player can go through that. We understand his class and his importance. Form is never a problem. The intent is there. Absolutely (backing Kohli for the final). We have been very calm as a team. We understand the occasion (final). Staying composed helps you make good decisions. That'll help us making the game through. You got to play good cricket. That's what we want to do in the final."

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG: ‘We stuck together, came up short when it mattered the most,' says Jos Buttler

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG:
“India certainly outplayed us. We let them get 20-25 runs too many. It was a challenging surface that they played well on. They fully deserved this win. Very different conditions (than 2022), credit to India. They played a very good game of cricket. With the rain around, didn't expect the conditions to change too much. Don't think it really did. They outbowled us. They had an above-par score. Don't think toss was necessarily the difference between the teams. They've got some fantastic spinners. In hindsight, should have bowled Moeen in that innings with the way spinners were bowling. We are really proud of everyone's effort. We stuck together, came up short when it mattered the most.”

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG: Axar Patel is the player of the match

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG:
“I have bowled in the powerplay in the past, so I had to bowl in the powerplay, that was the plan. The wicket was stopping and keeping low, so tried to bowl in the right areas. The wicket was slow, so I tried to bowl slower in this match, it worked for me. Wouldn't have worked had I bowled quicker, would have been easier for their batters. Our batters told us that the wicket wasn't easy, so 160 was a good total according to us. That partnership (between Rohit and SKY) was magnificent, they scored the occasional boundaries and rotated the strike. Not thinking about Barbados at the moment, will celebrate this player of the match award first.”

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG: INDIA THROUGH TO THE FINAL! Beat England by 68 runs

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG: Bumrah appeals for LBW fourth ball of the 17th, the umpire raises his finger and that has to be that. Archer reviews but it is definitely more because England have one review left than anything else. Not bat on it as Archer looked to meet that classic Bumrah toe-crusher with a sweep. It hits his backfoot on the full and wickets is umpire's call, interestingly. India will face South Africa for the title at the Kensington Oval on Saturday 8.30pm IST. For now, it is confirmed that we will have a team win the T20 World Cup without losing a single match this year. Both India and South Africa have stayed unbeaten, they absolutely pulverised their opposition in the semi finals. This will be one juicy clash indeed

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG: OUT! Extraordinary direct hit from SKY!

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG: Rashid and Archer set off second ball of the 16th, SKY runs across picks the ball and back flicks it to the stumps at the non-striker's end. You had to see it to believe it. India one wicket away.

Rashid run out (Suryakumar) 2 (2)

IND vs ENG Live Score: England 88/9 in 15.2 overs

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG: OUT! A mix-up and a run-out now

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG: Well this really was the only thing remaining. Livingstone runs down the pitch from the non-striker's end, Archer comes about half of how much distance he covered before going back. Throw comes from short fine leg to the non-striker's end. Axar collects and whips off the bails. Liam Livingstone is gone and so are England.

Livingstone run out (Kuldeep Yadav/Patel) 11 (16)

IND vs ENG Live Score: England 86/8 in 14.5 overs

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG: Into the last six overs, England need 95 from it

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG: Just four runs in the 14th over bowled by Jadeja. Liam Livingstone is out there on eight off 14, Jofra Archer is at the other end and he is on three off six. It has all gone horribly wrong for England.

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG: GONE! Wicket No.3 for Kuldeep

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG: Big appeal for LBW off the second ball of the 13th, the umpire gives it, Chris Jordan reviews. No bat on it, it landed on off and is clipping leg stump. England's title defence is in tatters.

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG: OUT! Four and gone for Brook, Kuldeep gets his second

India vs England Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi final, IND vs ENG: Brook showed some initiative but he falls as well. It is all going too quickly for England. Kuldeep had gone fullish for the third ball, Brook got low and swept it fine for a four. Bumrah pulled the length back just that little but fourth ball, Brook goes across but it goes below his bat and takes the stumps.

IND vs ENG Live Score: England 68/6 in 10.4 overs
