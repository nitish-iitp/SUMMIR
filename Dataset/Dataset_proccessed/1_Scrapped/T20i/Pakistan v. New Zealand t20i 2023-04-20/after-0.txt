Head To Head

In the upcoming month of April 2023, the Pakistan and New Zealand team will see each other on the cricket field in order to play 5 T20 international matches. The time for Pakistan vs New Zealand T20 series 2023 has already been confirmed and announced by both the nation's cricket associations. The Pak vs NZ T20 series 2023 will comprise 5 T20 games which will commence on 14 April 2023 and conclude on 24 April 2023. The first 3 T20I will be held in Lahore and the last two T20 will be played in Rawalpindi. The tournament will begin with the 1st T20 international on 14 April 2023 at Gaddafi Stadium. The 2nd, 3rd T20 matches will be held at the same stadium in Lahore on 15, 17, whereas the 4th and 5th match of the series will be fought at Rawalpindi Stadium.

Babar Azam will lead the Pakistan side for the upcoming T20 series under the guidance of Saqlain Mushtaq as a head coach, on the other hand, New Zealand will visit Pakistan under the captaincy of Kane Williamson for the T20 Series between Pakistan and New Zealand 2023. The Black Caps skipper has plenty of experience in the shortest format of the game with 81 T20 matches. Williamson has already contributed 2,225 runs in T20I with 15 half-centuries. On the other hand, Babar Azam has played 89 T20 where he contributed 3140 runs 2 centuries, and 28 half-centuries. Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan are the two most successful batters of the Pakistan team at number 3 and number 1 position in the ICC T20 player ranking table. So, it would not be an easy job for a New Zealand player to stop these two batters.

Currently, New Zealand is in the 5th position whereas Pakistan is standing at the 3rd position in the ICC T20 Team ranking. In terms of head-to-head in the T20I, Pakistan and New Zealand have played 25 T20 international matches where New Zealand got the victory in 10 matches and faced defeat in 15 matches. Overall, as of September 2022, New Zealand has appeared in 175 T20I, out of which they won 90 matches and lost 73. On the other hand, Pakistan has played 208 T20Is where they achieved victory in 127 matches and lost 73 matches. So, it was going to be interesting to watch New Zealand players perform on the Pakistani surface.
