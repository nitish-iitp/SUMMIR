JAIPUR: The slow and low wicket at the SMS Stadium sent Rajasthan Royals stumbling after a good start and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) took away the game as the former 'left it a bit too late'.
Royals’ head coach Kumar Sangakkara rued lack of intent on the batters part and applauded LSG’s effort with the ball after their 10-run loss on Wednesday.
“Our openers put on a good stand. Unfortunately, we lost three wickets in three overs.
We still should have gotten over the line. We had enough batting in the shed. Unfortunately, we left it a little bit too late and needed too many boundaries in the end,” Sangakkara said.

The hosts looked in control of the 175-run chase until the 12th over when an 87-run partnership between Jos Buttler and Yashasvi Jaiswal was broken by Marcus Stoinis. The three quick dismissals of the openers and Sanju Samson between 12 and 13th over shifted the momentum in LSG's favour.
“I think we got a better Powerplay than they did. It was a difficult wicket to bat on as the ball got older, but they also bowled very well. It was all about targeting one or two overs. Unfortunately, every time we wanted to do that, we lost wickets. And at the backend, especially Ravi Bishnoi’s last over, we were not committed enough to take him down and look for three-four sixes. It was a tough pitch and Lucknow bowled pretty smartly,” he added.
