Ireland vs South Africa T20I series starts tonight (September 27) in Abu Dhabi. The iconic Sheikh Zayed Stadium will host both T20Is of this series, with the second T20I scheduled for Sunday.

South Africa performed brilliantly in the T20 World Cup earlier this year, where they finished runners-up after a close defeat in the final against India. On the other side, Ireland had a forgettable T20 World Cup campaign. The Irish team failed to qualify for the Super 8s round.

Both Ireland and South Africa will have one eye on the 2026 T20 World Cup when they lock horns in the upcoming series. Here's an in-depth look at the head-to-head record between the two teams in T20Is.
