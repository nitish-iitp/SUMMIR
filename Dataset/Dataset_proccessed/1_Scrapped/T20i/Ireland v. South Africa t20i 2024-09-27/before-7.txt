ah mean..I was waitin for one of you to say he gone from clapping to scribbling non stop.

Same sun burn up Kings burning up TKR and the rest..

And I watched over the match today-

TKR was dominated today and dare I say it outfoxed too-

Sammy has something about his overachieving unqualified uncertified self that just keeps on ....winning.

I would say dont underestimate him or the value he brings

Sour and ungrateful.

You could say that possibly if he won 1 World Cup but 2 no. Pollard - 0 World Cups as Captain. Bravo -0.

Sammy is the greatest West Indian cricket leader since Viv- Squeeze dat like a pillow and run with it! since the turn of the decade, five straight seasons we have made the playoffs with two final appearances. The nucleus of this team has been together for a while ie: JC, FAF, Aljo, Chase and Wiese.

You only have to ingest some of the nonsense that has played out in the public, post worldcup wins to understand some of the crap behind the scenes that stymied Windies success in the past. It makes you appreciate (in a fair world), the desperate need for leadership that was required and what Sammy has been able to achieve.

Exhibit 2

These guys were their own worst enemies from a team perspective. They desperately needed the 'right' leadership. Sammy brought that. Who doan like it could lump it. No amount of sneaking around hoping for Windies to lose for a whole tournament and then showing your face when they actually lose can change the facts. Evidence trumps wishful thinking every time.

We came pretty close to a semi-final place in last worldcup too, we lost but, we had a bit of bad luck with the weather in terms of momentum in that RSA match...even so, it came down to the wire. I don't expect the haters to acknowledge it though.

Viv wasn’t a good captain. Tactically one of the best captains ever but leading a cricket team is more than that. Sammy and Viv in the same convo bordering on blasphemy. Sammy had the best t20 players in the world available to him and most of the team had IPL and CLt20 experience behind them when we won the first World Cup. And Darren Ganga had already showed the West Indies how to beat international t20 opponents, down to the use of the leg spinner in the power play which was virtually unheard of as the idea had been abandoned since Martin Crowe had used Deepak Patel in the Power play in the 92 World Cup. Sammy is an imposter. He beat an NZ team rife with division, some of it racial in tests and that is his only claim to fame. Beating Bangladesh was supposed to happen, and we were embarrassed in England and lost to a poor Aussie side in 2012 at home

In the dottieland, they get tv, radio and internet after 2009? Sammy's appointment as captain in teams he wasn't even a regular in(and none at all in tests) was the culmination of the windward island hydra's fight with Chris gayle and jerome taylor, and by extension bravo, pollard and sarwan. Gayle and bravo were always close friends. sarwan was regularly in TT because his best friends in cricket were from here.Amazon warriors last year shared a video with pollard, bravo, narine, bishoo and sarwan meeting up after one of the games at providence and showing flashbacks of them playing together in WI colors. So the t20 teams that we sent up were not disunited or needed some kinda messiah-like figurehead to get the team to gel. all the stars were very close friends and the only person who wasn't close to them was samuels and he wasn't even liked by his fellow JA teammates.

What the west indies lacked in 2009 and 2010 was IPL experience. bravo and pollard both got ipl contracts out of their performances in the 2009 champions league where trinidad reached the final and changed how t20s were played in the process. I think sammy was playing under waste of floyd Reifer's second string team vs bangladesh while the tournament was going on. So too did adrian bharath and lendl simmons. And that tournament took place after the 2009 wt20 where we reached the semifinal but lost to an amazing sri lanka team that bamboozled everyone except pakistan in the final. in 2010 we lost to australia after dirk nannes had bowled gayle first ball in the quarterfinals. by 2012....rampaul, bravo, gayle, narine, edwards, pollard, samuels and russell all had at least one ipl season under them. in fact the only people who didn't have ipl experience were sammy, badree, ramdin, lendl and charles. and ramdin, lendle and badree had already been to the champions league twice, a tournament as hard or even harder than the ipl. That's the reason we won. we had a team not only of powerhitters but a team that had experience that wasn't there in 2009 and 2010. the experience of playing in different conditions and playing under pressure all the time. sammy was almost negligible in the entire equation

How could Chris Gayle, the first captain to beat wi england in a series in 11 years, the first and only wi cappo to win a test in south africa ever and the first wi captain to not lose in nz in 13 years be a poor captain and not a leader of men? sammy brought nothing to that side but evangelical enthusiasm which was a mask for the fact that he was the worst player on he team.

Because he became the poster child for the ills of West Indies Cricket? A player that many felt was not good enough to make the team and for the people with a deep seated agenda a WICB's lackey. So he could do not right (not get any credit for wins) and he could do plenty wrong (hide from bowling even though he batted with the tail).

We have had some poor captains - Lara, Shiv, Gayle - who were all could command a spot on the team (remember this became the fan's mantra). I never considered Sammy a poor captain. And initially he certainly was a good enough bowler to make the team on that merit. His batting was not pleasing to watch but he certainly came good a few times for us.

I thank him for being an instrumental part of the success of our 2010's T20 cricket. He is no great but he helped bring some joy back to WI cricket.

brian lara didn't draw with the best team in the world as captain, didn't win the champions trophy in 2004 and reach the finals of the next tournament? Gayle, as stated earlier was the first wi captain in 11 years to beat the english in a test series.

and that is the issue genius. the massive decline in west indian performances can be attributed to sammy's ascension and the behaviors of the board that caused it. Sammy could not make the teams in any of the three formats. yet he was appointed captain. the facts are that sammy was beaten by india, home and away in an era where india was being whitewashed wherever they went. in 2011 alone, they were whitewashed by england and australia. next he was beaten by australia here in the caribbean, probably the weakest aussie team to visit our shores in decades. he beat a divided nz side after the world cup. we know this because ross taylor described the environment as toxic in his autobiography and yes, racism did come into the picture. the next year we lost to nz and india in sachin's makeshift farewell series. those are marked declines from what happened under gayle. We beat england for the first time in 11 years, we did not lose in nz for the first time in 13 years. we beat south africa for the very first time in a test match in SA.

Sammy inherited the side with the best t20 players in the world and a clear template to win t20 games on the subcontinent. You don't need much more than that. Gayle was by far the best t20 player batsman in the word, bravo was its premiere allrounder and pollard and narine had gained ipl experience. Trinidad's red force had changed the way t20 cricket is played and sammy just took that script. he was still using that script in 2024, hence the fact that we could only beat one full member. The players who didn't have ipl experience had champions league experience, that would be ramdin, rampaul, badree and simmons. by 2016, russell had ipl experience and it showed in that world cup. my dog could have captained that team and won the tournament.

the dottie contraption that appointed him damaged west indies cricket in so many ways. firstly, the exiling of gayle and the destruction of sarwan's career by the the ugly coach(and we can only assume he had the boards support because they never dissented and yes sarwan came back but he was clearly shot by that time and a very good cricketing career had been ended by west indian pig headedness that is seen way too often) set the same template for the destruction of Darren Bravo's career as well. every time we had a batsman who could bat, his career has been cut short so now we are left with glaring incompetence in the top and middle order. I feel though that Carty will buck that trend. he can actually bat. Dwayne Bravo's test career ended when this talentless joker became captain because he needed a space and could not make the team other than being captain.

proof of sammy's lack of any kind of captaincy/coaching credentials is that when presented with a team of less quality than the WI t20 team, he's won nothing. Ramdin won 3 caribbean t20 titles and captained the warriors to 2 cpl finals. Dwayne bravo won 4 cpl titles with two seperate franchises. pollard has won 2 cpl titles and reached two finals as captain. Chris gayle has won two cpl titles, rovman powell has a cpl title as captain, even Einstein jason holder, the worst captain since richardson has a cpl title. sammy has reached one final and that is it. nothing as captain, nothing as coach.
i know you won't agree with me because a generation of talentless bajans were the recipients of the second string team formula that started when sammy was appointed cappo.

proof is in the pudding. before shamar, josh, mckenzie and hodge beat australia in brisbane, the last time a west indian team did not lose to Australia or any #1 ranked team was in march and april 1999. the captain then was Brian Charles Lara....who made over 500 runs in 7 innings at an avg of 90. He also won an ICC champions trophy and reached the final of another. In both tournaments, young west indian players came of age. Sarwan was named as the best young player of the 2004 champions trophy and player of the tournament. Gayle was player of the tournament two years later when we reached the final. Yes lara could be moody, everyone know's that. but to say he was a poor captain when only gayle can compare to his achievements is comical and makes no sense. I've spoken about Gayle's accomplishments. And gayle was well on his way to being the best WI captain since clive and viv before the board shot themselves in the foot

International team built around known talented players and some newbies..... having potential.... accountability regarding failure ....... zero.....West Indies perspective...

Sammy nominal success in franchisee cricket and failure in international cricket speaks for itself....

When Sammy was captain....he was captain of both red ball and white ball.....the red ball team players barring Braithwaite....non could prosper....Sammy as captain failed to unearth new players or lead from front....his stats as player and captain abysmal....his victories came against lowly Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.....6 successive victory....blanked out against all top teams....

While the white ball team , itself was self sufficient with Gayle,Bravo ,Pollard et al at peak.....Sammy just kept his mouth shut and kept clapping....team won 2 world cups...so much so .....in 2016 World Cup....just check his stats as player....both with bat and ball.....Nothing...

Being a guy, with total support of administration....he got the job as Head Coach of West Indies, without any credentials or transparency......His team selection was biased.....his tactics totally outdated as was evident during World Cup qualifier in Zimbabwe......this guy is hyped up....few franchise games victories can't camouflage his abject international ICC tournament failures....

More nonsense.

The prevailing argument until now, is that Sammy's success in international cricket as captain..ie 2 worldcups is predicated on a few great T20 players ie Gayle, Bravo, Pollard, Narine et al and that his limited success as CPL captain/ coach somehow demonstrates that his leadership is overrated. Now you come with a whole other argument to the contrary. Y'all can't even make up your mind what your argument is.

not debating any emotional dottie drivel with you homes. fact is under gayle, the captain sammy replaced, we beat england for the first time in 11 years, won a test in SA for the first and only time, did not lose in nz for the first time in 13 years and would have won or drew the test series in australia if the umpiring was better(a series where the last wicket, 33 runs adrift from the target was an umpiring error by billy bowden and also where 3 west indians scored test hundreds with gayle scoring back to back centuries, bravo scoring his second test century in australia and adrian bharath scoring a hundred on debut). does darren sammy have anything equivalent to that?

Homes. nobody thought steve waugh was any good when he started off. but he managed to turn himself into a great cricketer through will and a healthy dose of badmind. that is who people should be inspired by. steve's own brother, mark, said openly that he deserved a shot at aussie selection before steve

bravo, pollard, gayle and russell had stood up to cameron a year before that. Bravo, gayle and pollard in india and again gayle and russell when the world cup team was announced, gayle openly accusing the board under cameron of victimising pollard and bravo and picking a second string team. When the board under the windward islands hydra was doing the same thing as cameron, fighting and exiling senior players, where was Darren Julius Garvey Sammy eh

Yeah the 'Dottie' narrative was bound to come out. You've been sussed out. My last on this is that..Windies decline started looooooong before Gayle or Sammy for that matter. You could bugger off with your revisionist nonsense. If you read what you are actually writing about how many firsts (a list of really low bar items if you ask me) happened under Gayle...then it clearly spoke to climbing out of a hole. You so hateful you tying up yourself in knots.

You are moving the goal post all over the field.

Lara's record speaks for itself. What was his test record as captain? What was his ODI record as captain?

You are such a homeboy instead of accept any failings, shortcomings, and criticisms you project this ridiculous stance that the Trinis did nothing wrong. And that weakens any point you are making.

Lara being one of the greatest cricketers ever means the teams he was cappo of were already miles better than what Sammy had to work with. Lara was a crappy captain.

I don't think Sammy was crappy. But I am not going to fight anyone on the issue.

blah blah blah....yes lara was whitewashed by sa, a tour sabotaged by typical wicb pigheadeness....the same type of pig headedness that saw gayle removed and sammy given the role, beaten in nz by 13 players, beaten by south africa, aus and england....by then all teams that were much better than us. Contrary to popular belief, when we lost in england in 2000, australia a few months later, pakistan and SA in 2001 and also the sri lanka brownwash later that year, nz and India 2002, NZ IN 2005, Lara wasn't skipper. adams was captain in the year 2000, hooper in 2001, lara in 2003-2005(we lost to south africa, england and australia during that period) chanderpaul for the entirety of 2005. Can't talk about lara's example and record and totally ignore the incompetence of sammy as captain. as i said, my dog could have captained the dream teams that won the 2012 and 2016 world cups. sammy's only creditable performance was against team going through the following

Taylor says he was 'undermined' by senior teammates during the 2012 tour of the West Indies and claims he overheard Jacob Oram - who was a Central Districts teammate - tell Kyle Mills "I told you those f**kers were going to drop you" when the bowler missed selection for the fourth ODI.

“In terms of being undermined, that West Indies trip was actually worse than the Sri Lankan tour when it all came to a head. Some of the senior players would be down the back of the bus talking really loudly to people back home in New Zealand - the likes of Heath Mills - about me and the support staff.”

Again what was his record?

I guess you care more about the internet an articles when it suits. Here is one:



However, many considered Lara’s innings to be a selfish one – Ricky Ponting was particularly critical of it. "It's generally not the way we play our cricket," he said. "Their whole first innings might have been geared around one individual performance and they could have let a Test match slip because of it. They ran out of time in the game - that's not the way the Australian team plays."

Former England captain Tony Greig too seemed to echo Ponting’s views, even attacking Lara’s captaincy credentials. "I'm certainly not raving about the innings. I have to praise it for the sheer fact that he stayed in for so long but it wasn't an innings that you could be in awe of. It was clear he had the record in mind and was just going to keep on grinding it out until he got there. As far as I'm concerned that is not a good way to play the game, especially when you're the captain. It shows that Brian Lara is not a very good captain," he said.

two people out of the entirety of the world called the record selfish.


Brian Lara was hailed by the world's media for his recent 400 not out score against England in Antigua in the final Test of the 2004 Cable and Wireless Series. Here are a selection of tributes, from the press of the United Kingdom and India:

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH (UK): "Lara's achievement is a feat of amazing endurance every bit as much as one of skill. Probably, he is not the best player in the world anymore, but he is still the best at big scores. Given that he is 35 and carrying a pound or two more than in his youth, Lara is proof of the power of the mind - he was at the wicket for 13 hours, for heaven's sake. No man cuts the ball with such precision and along such angles; few drive with equal elan; only the cricketers of the subcontinent and Mark Waugh in the modern era, use their wrists so gleefully to ease the ball through leg-side spaces. Brian Lara is a cricketer who makes magic: the surprise is how long he remains able to sustain it."

MANCHESTER EVENING NEWS (UK): "That Lara regained the record playing in a West Indies side which is a shadow of their 1994 counterparts at the fag end of a miserable series for the hosts makes the achievement more rather than less remarkable. It is far from a perfect story but when the tide goes out on the current era of cricket only a few traces will be left - Shane Warne's twisting fingers, Sachin Tendulkar's graceful power and Lara's raised-bat aggression."

REDIFF.COM (INDIA): Indian, Pakistani stars hail Lara: "Amazing achievement," said Sachin Tendulkar, the man often racing the left-handed genius for the numero uno spot in the rankings. "One of the best batsman of my generation, if not the best ever. Such innings can never be planned, they just happen."

Sourav Ganguly: "Great knock," he said. "I was not going to be surprised if he crossed 400 and he did just that. When he is in full flow, there is no better sight in world cricket."
Virender Sehwag, the latest entry in the 300 club, said there was no comparison. "When Lara scored his 300 he was 24, I am 25," Sehwag said.

Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq, also a member of the 300 club, said Lara's performance was out of this world and he has duly taken back what was his - the record of highest Test score.
Former Pakistan skipper and coach Javed Miandad said, "The score is not the great part of the innings, but the fact that he held the record, saw it being broken, and then snatched it back is what is so great about the innings. Any of the top three batsmen in the world like Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting, or Matthew Hayden could have done it if the conditions had suited them like they suited Lara. My guess is that one of the Indian batsmen or Inzamam-ul-Haq will break the record."

Compiled by the Sporting Life:

THE SUN (UK): "Brian Lara rewrote cricket history when he became the first batsman to score 400 in a Test."

DAILY MAIL (UK): "Brian Lara celebrated the 10th anniversary of his previous record hammering of England by again making the highest score in Test history with an unbeaten 400 yesterday in the final match of the series at St John's."

THE TIMES (UK): "To break the most famous of all batting records once might conceivably be ascribed to good fortune. To do it twice is proof of pure genius."

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH (UK): "World records are destined to be set by only a chosen few, so when Brian Lara reclaimed the world record Test score with an unbeaten 400 in Antigua yesterday, six months after it was taken off him by Australia's Matthew Hayden, something extraordinary was afoot."

THE GUARDIAN (UK): "Brian Lara promised West Indies cricket a legacy and, yesterday, in front of a cacophonous crowd at the Recreation Ground, each and every one of whom will tell their grandchildren they were there, he delivered, as if to order, the highest individual score in Test match history."

Sammy has coaching experience in the CPL and the PSL, but this will be his first assignment in international cricket. While Sammy is not a certified coach, Shallow pointed out that he fulfilled all the criteria necessary for a coaching role. "There's a different set of criteria that you know don't necessarily need to be a Level 3 [coach]," Shallow said. "It's ideal, but when we go through the different assessments, he certainly qualified to be the head coach, which is why he was shortlisted in the first place and then he was interviewed by a panel of five."

1. I have this unsubstantiated suspicion you are not much older than 32.
2. If Gayle was a good Captain to you then your bar is really low.

If I could be romantic about the brilliant captaincy from times before you were born there was this psychological aspect to it that I think does not exist today. Maybe things that should not be in the sport today.

Pollard would have fit right in. Only problem he would not have been talented enough to make the side.

When england came here in 2004, their attack was harmison, flintoff, jones and hoggard. wi attack was edwards, colleymore and tino. there way no way in hell we were going to beat them. when australia came here in 2003, we had dave bernard jr, jermaine lawson and tino.....again, no way we were going to beat them in a series

Former Australia spinner Shane Warne has been picking his favourite teams over the last few days as the world has come to a standstill due to the coronavirus outbreak. And on Thursday, he picked the greatest West Indies XI and it came as no surprise that he named Brian Lara as skipper of the team.
As has been the case with his selections, Warne only picked players that he has played against and that saw him pick Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose over the legends of the past like Michael Holding among others.

This also saw Warne give Viv Richards a miss in the XI which had Chris Gayle opening the batting with Desmond Haynes and the likes of Carl Hooper and Shivnarine Chanderpaul giving Lara company in the middle order.

The pace battery saw Ian Bishop and Patrick Patterson join the duo of Walsh and Ambrose.

Hey quick question how come Ganga is given credit for being a tactically great T20 captain didn’t he basically have a WI T20 Team if we’re being honest he didn’t really have to do much tactically when he already had the best players on the park just like Sammy ehh???

Now Ramnaresh Sarwan on the other hand had a team of literal nobodies and won the regional T20 crown a couple times I believe and also led GAW to a few Finals as well why isn’t he given more credit than both Sammy & Ganga???

You see because Ganga created a style of t20 cricket. Caribbean people may have known about pollard before the second Stanford tournament, but nobody else really. Pollard and bravo didn’t get ipl contracts until after the champions league in 2009. Those guys were hungry before 2009, they weren’t stars. They were after the champions league run though and Ganga moulded that team. Firstly he was significantly older than the rest of the side and I believe that helps. Secondly, his tactics were never nonsensical even though, like Dwayne Bravo’s tactics, they could be funky, a little unorthodox but never nonsensical

On the contrary...... Sammy was made captain of all formats, by Hunte, when he hardly had any performance to boost....he was blue eyed establishment boy.....inspite of winning 2012 World Cup as captain......his personal performance in all formats was abysmal.....

Immediately, after Cameron was elected, he replaced Sammy with Dwayne Bravo as ODI cappo..........Ramdin replaced Sammy as test cappo.....his own performance was totally nil....he knew his days were numbered.....he would eventually be dropped....from T20.....even his performance in World Cup T20 batting @2.66 and bowling @31 with 1 wicket r.p.o. 10 .... with just 3 overs bowl.....

Thereafter, he rebelled against Cameron,when he did not have anything to loose......

Then immediately, campaigned against Cameron,....as soon as Cameron lost the election....Skerritt, the new President made him independent Director of CWI....thereafter, going beyond the rules and regulations was made white ball head coach by Shallow...

To me, Sammy knows the Art of staying with the establishment.....reap benefits.....

His story is.....a man with very limited cricket abilities...as his stats clearly shows.....has been reaping benefits since 2011..... simply by staying with the power...

Unbalancing the Side

now we are getting somewhere. the only team sammy didn't unbalance was the t20 side.....because the main cast was so good. teams with lesser capabilities(because they were second string) were unbalanced by his presence in the starting XI. Great point

Darren Sammy creates a serious imbalance in the Test squad and places a major burden on our fast bowlers. We need another attacking fast bowler to complement Roach and Rampaul. A number of names come to mind, but the two foremost would be Russel, who is a better batsman and bowler than Sammy, or Johnson, who would bring pace, height and variety to the bowling line-up. There were times during this Test match when our opening fast bowlers showed glimpses of real aggression, but this was always relaxed when the first change bowler came on. We now have too many quality fast bowlers in the wings to continue to play with only two frontline genuine pacers. The Sammy experiment needs to come to a conclusion immediately.

For the record

Lucian Kings under SAMMY deserve to be in the FINAL.

That team is gelling better than all others ...and I am of the opinion that it is SAMMY ...again...making a set o stars out of a team 

Now...Royals the least of the Apostles have to face another team that I truly enjoy...De Warriors...but they lack self belief and cohesion...aka...spazmodic to all with all that talent - go figure.

Royals... have favour and cunning on their side...when the enemy rushes in like a flood...a Standard is raised...miraculously to see them through.

there..

think I have yanked on enough petticoats and offended a few -

my work here is done

-

until...

Suh these people that hate Sammy making up shyt to prove their point?

 
natty_forever 2024-10-04 04:38:59 

Yeah, Sammy got a chance, and built on it, however, for himself, cause unless the haters lying. Them stats poor if you take away the 2 WC wins.

Everytime Sammy leads a team to victory-

Everyone wins.

it really is that simple.

you keep using the paradigm of Individuals

I ask you to take the Holistic and Umbrellic* viewpoint.

Sammy builds TEAMS that shine like stars.

cant fight the facts...use science , use stats...and for heavens sake...please to use results.

Everything rises and falls with Leadership- JOHN MAXWELL.

Everything.......

Posters only talk about 2 T20 World Cup....

Sammy was captain of all three formats...Test and ODI teams performance was abysmal...Did any posters questions his appointment as ODI coach...He has Zero experience or certificate in ODI coaching...

The T20 team , which Sammy lead was one of the greatest...all at their peak...

As coach of franchisee team ....he did admirably in Peshawar and SLK......

SLK is favourite to lift Cup....

But coaching a franchisee team and international team....chalk and cheese...Sammy till date has failed in almost all international white ball ICC events....

If SLK victory is equivalent to West indies success for these posters...Best of Luck!!?!!

They'll clutch at anything. But let me add, he may become an excellent coach, just that he did it in reverse. Should have started out at the club level and work your way up.

 
Cheeks 2024-10-05 00:45:54 

Mad dem Sammy.

The 'eef wuznt fuh dem 2 worldcups'..is di best argument yet.

Is like saying yuh lucky yuh study otherwise you would nevah get yuh degree.

Hate...and make no bones about it..it is hate...throws logic and reason out di door.

Mad dem Sammy.

Agree..... with time Sammy may become good coach...but every good coach......worth......how his team transform into well knit unit performing at international level as well as performance in ICC events.....

Appointment of Sammy as ODI coach is totally absurd ...I would be the happiest,if Sammy build the ODI side into strong unit and makes West Indies qualify for World Cup.... results in ICC events improve...

Sammy appointed March 2023......we presently, October 2024... West Indies ranking 10th....

Hopefully, by cut off date 31st March 2027, we finish in top 9 excluding South Africa as Host......for automatic qualification.....

Go Sammy Go....do something to cheer the blind supporters......I as always.......Rally

More disingenuous jackassery.

You think team culture changes overnight? Steups.

Mad dem Sammy.

Let go of the hate and then you may find some reason.

In reply to Cheeks

Jackassery is.......

When blind supporters try to camouflage......some low level franchisee cricket over gross underperformance at international level.....

No experience
No certificate
No result
In last one & half years ..ODI cricket....

They talk about

You think team culture changes overnight? Steups.



Just get the team in top 9 till cut off date 31st March 2027....

Still 2 and half years.....

But franchisee success in Peshawar and SLK ....is greatest.....IPL & BBL most sought after coach...

Tongue in cheeks......
