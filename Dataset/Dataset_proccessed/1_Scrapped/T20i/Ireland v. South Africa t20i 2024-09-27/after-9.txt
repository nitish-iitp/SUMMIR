IRE vs SA Scorecard
Ireland vs South Africa Commentary
7:20 PM IST Right then, that's it from the coverage of this game. South Africa will be delighted with this victory, as this was the highest total chased down in T20Is in Abu Dhabi. Now, they will be eyeing to seal the deal in the next encounter which is on 29th September 2024. The first ball will be at 3.30 pm GMT. Although you can join us early for the build-up. ADIOS!
7:14 PM IST Aiden Markram, the skipper of South Africa is in for a chat. He expressed his satisfaction with the win, especially during challenging times for the team, emphasizing that victories should never be taken for granted. Praised the players for performing well under tough conditions, particularly highlighting the difficulties in gripping the ball and managing the bowling. States that the opening partnership was quite special.
7:10 PM IST Paul Stirling, the captain of Ireland is in for a chat. He mentioned that the team had been targeting a score of around 190-200 but lost their way after the 15-over mark. He gave credit to the opposition for bowling well and acknowledged that 171 was slightly under par. Reflecting on the conditions, noted that it was difficult to grip the ball, which led to some full tosses, an area the team will need to improve on. Despite the challenges, he praised the team for showing good fight, particularly highlighting the efforts of the youngsters towards the end. He concluded by expressing his gratitude.
7:09 PM IST Ryan Rickelton wins the Player of the Match award for his stunning knock of 76 runs.  He says that it was a good wicket but they had an idea with the training that it might swing a bit. Adds that once they found the groove and the ball stopped swinging, they decided to play quite well. Ends by sharing that the wicket was pretty good so fell into their lap.
7:07 PM IST Stay tuned for the presentation...
7:07 PM IST Earlier in the innings, Ireland got off to a quick start, thanks to Ross Adair, but they kept losing wicket at regular intervals once he slipped out, which kept breaking their flow. Curtis Campher's 49 gave them some boost, but the same story repeated in the death, when the wickets kept tumbling. Patrick Kruger stood out with the ball earlier with his four wicket haul.
