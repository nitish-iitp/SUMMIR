Ryan Rickelton’s rasping innings of 76 from 48 balls led South Africa to a comprehensive victory by eight wickets with 14 balls to spare in the first of first of two T20 Internationals against Ireland at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Friday.

Chasing 172 for victory Rickelton added 136 for the first wicket with Reeza Hendricks (51 from 33 balls) to all-but seal victory before Rickelton slashed a full, wide delivery from seamer Mark Adair to Curtish Campher at point having lashed three fours and pulled six sixes.

Hendricks enjoyed a much needed return to form with 51 from 33 balls (5x4, 3x6) before being trapped lbw by seamer Craig Young, but with the score at 138-2, the result was all but confirmed.

Captain Aiden Markram (17* from 12 balls) and Matthew Breetzke (19* from 14 balls) finished the job in clinical fashion to give the Proteas a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.

IRELAND SENT IN TO BAT

Earlier an entertaining partnership between Curtis Campher and Neil Rock helped Ireland post a competitive total of 171-8 after being sent in to bat in the first of two T20 Internationals against South Africa

Opener Ross Adair (18 from 10 balls) took 16 off the first over of the innings from Lizaad Williams (3-0-29-0) to set the tone for a compelling performance before a drive against Wiaan Mulder to Tristan Stubbs at mid-off.

Captain Paul Stirling (2) was bowled by Ottneil Baartman (3-0-36-1) and when Harry Tector (16) toe-ended a reverse sweep against Bjorn Fortuin (4-0-28-1) to Williams at short third, the ‘host’ nation were wobbling at 64-3 in the seventh over.

Rock’s excellent, career-best 37 from 28 balls (4x4, 1x6) took full toll on some profligate bowling but also owed much to a positive, fearless mindset from the Irish top order who took the challenge to their opponents with bold footwork and slashing blades. Rock’s missed slog-sweep against legspinner Nqaba Peter (3-0-20-1) saw him bowled in the 14th over.

Former SA under-19 player, Campher, played with consummate skill for 49 from 36 balls (6x4, 1x6) before top-edging a pull against allrounder Patrick Kruger and George Dockrell’s terrific 21 from 16 balls ended one ball later with a catch to ‘keeper Ryan Rickelton.

Kruger collected a third wicket in the final over of the innings to finish with a flattering 4-27 from his four overs, but ‘lucky’ days are far fewer than ‘unlucky’ days and the Warriors allrounder deserved the fortune.

IRELAND: Paul Stirling (captain), Ross Adair, Harry Tector, Curtis Campher, Neil Rock (wkt), George Dockrell, Mark Adair, Fionn Hand, Matthew Humphreys, Craig Young, Benjamin White.

SOUTH AFRICA: Ryan Rickelton (wkt), Reeza Hendricks, Matthew Breetzke, Aiden Markram (captain), Tristan Stubbs, Wiaan Mulder, Patrick Kruger, Bjorn Fortuin, Nqaba Peter, Lizaad Williams, Ottneil Baartman.
