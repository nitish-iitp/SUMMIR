Reigning Twenty20 World Cup winners West Indies have just barely kept their tournament hopes alive with a final ball victory over Bangladesh.

Key points:
Jason Holder scored vital runs and took a pivotal catch for the West Indies
The wicket in Sharjah was very slow and made batting difficult
Andre Russell was out for a diamond duck but proved the match-winner with the ball for West Indies

Bangladesh were chasing a total of 143 on an extremely slow Sharjah wicket and needed a four off the final delivery.

Bangladesh captain Mahmdullah was on strike but star West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell gave him no chance as he bowled an unplayable yorker to keep West Indian hopes alive and snuff out Bangladesh's tournament after just three group matches.

"This win means a lot to the team," Jason Holder told reporters.

"We're obviously in a do or die situation, having to win the last remaining games. So it's good to start this one off. It was a close encounter. Nevertheless, we got over the line."

Bangladesh had needed 13 off Russell's final over to chase down West Indies' 7-142, which was built on Nicholas Pooran's 40 off 22 balls.

Russell did not find much support from his fielders, who were guilty of dropped catches and poor ground fielding even in the last over, but still gave away only nine runs and restricted Bangladesh to 5-139.

Bangladesh had seemed to be well on their way to overhauling West Indies' score but faltered at the death.

Liton Das, who top-scored for Bangladesh with 44, stitched together a 40-run stand with captain Mahmudullah but his departure to a smart catch by Jason Holder on the boundary rope in the penultimate over hurt Bangladesh's chances.

Mahmdullah had started the over by hitting Dwayne Bravo for six and Das looked to finish it the same way, but Holder had positioned his 2.01-metre frame right on the boundary and caught the ball above his head.

The catch was cool as you like as he kept his balance and turned the game.

Bangladesh were not helped by the fact the batsmen crossed, which left 22-year-old Afif Hossain on strike as he came to the crease.

Mahmdullah was then dropped in the outfield with three balls to spare to give Bangladesh a chance but despite remaining unbeaten on 31 he could not steer his side home.

For Russell the final over performance was the opposite of his day with the bat.

The powerful star was run out for a diamond duck as a straight drive from Roston Chase cannoned off the foot of fast bowler Taskin Ahmed and hit the stumps, his dismissal indicative of the early part of West Indies' innings.

West Indies had promoted Chris Gayle to open the batting after dropping Lendl Simmons but their woes with the willow continued as the side were reduced to 3-32 after being put in to bat.

Captain Kieron Pollard also failed to get going and walked off retired hurt before Russell fell.

The arrival of wicketkeeper Nicholas  Pooran to the crease provided the spark West Indies' innings required and the left-handed batter smashed spinners Shakib Al Hasan and Mahedi Hasan for two sixes each in his knock.

The 26-year-old provided the late flourish during a stand of 57 with Roston Chase, who made his T20 international debut for West Indies.

Pooran and Chase (39) were out on consecutive balls to seamer Shoriful Islam but some big hitting from Holder continued West Indies' late assault.

Holder, who came into the squad late as an injury replacement, hit 15 off five deliveries as West Indies added 72 in the last six overs.

Pollard returned to bat and hit a six on the last delivery of the innings.

"I felt like 140 was a very good total. I think with our bowling attack we could defend that, and it proved to be enough," he said.

The win leaves West Indies with a 1-2 record and fifth in their group.

They also have terrible net run rate after being hammered in their opening game of the tournament by England but they remain alive with matches to come against Sri Lanka and Australia.
