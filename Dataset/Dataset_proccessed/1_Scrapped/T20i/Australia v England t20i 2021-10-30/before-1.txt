On this day in 2019: Lisa Keightley appointed as England Women’s head coach

The former Australia international was the first female to take on the role.

Published Oct 30, 2021

Former Australia international Lisa Keightley was appointed England Women’s first full-time female cricket head coach on this day in 2019.

Keightley, who was the first woman to score a century at Lord’s, would wait until January to take up her post as she saw out the Women’s Big Bash League campaign in Australia, where she was coach of the Perth Scorchers.

Keightley had previously worked with the ECB as head coach of the England Women’s academy between 2011
and 2015, and had been due to become head coach of the London Spirit in The Hundred before accepting the England role.

“I’m massively excited,” Keightley said as her appointment was announced. “It’s a huge opportunity.

“It’s a team full of world-class players and to be given the chance to work with some of the players who I worked with a few years ago is really exciting. I can’t wait to get started and see where we can get to.”

Keightley inherited a side who were reigning 50-over world champions, and who had reached the final of the previous ICC Women’s T20 World Cup.

“They’re a very competitive side and they wouldn’t be in big matches like that if they didn’t have a really strong group of players who can perform on the big stage,” she added. “I’m really looking forward to getting under way and helping the team progress.”

In a pandemic-hit first year in charge, Keightley guided England to the semi-finals of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup, but their final four contest against India was a wash-out, with India advancing based on group-stage results.

They also enjoyed a 5-0 Twenty20 whitewash of the West Indies, while this year has been highlighted by one-day series victories over New Zealand and India, leaving England second to Australia both in the ODI and T20 world rankings.
