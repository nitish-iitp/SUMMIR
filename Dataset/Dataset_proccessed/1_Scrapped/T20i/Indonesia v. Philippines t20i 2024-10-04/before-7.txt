PREVIEW

Philippines (PHI) and Indonesia (INA) will take on each other in the ninth fixture of the ongoing T20 WC EAP Sub-Regional Qualifier B. Incheon’s Yeonhui Cricket Ground will host this game on October 4, 2024, at 6:30 AM (IST). It will be a crucial game for both teams to strengthen their chances.

The Philippines (PHI) are in the second spot in the tournament’s points table, winning and losing two matches each in their four games. They are coming off a 27-run defeat against Japan (JPN) following two successive wins against Indonesia (INA) and South Korea (SK). A win in this game will take the number of wins to three, with an addition of two more points.

Speaking of Indonesia (INA), they have the same number of wins and defeats in their four games compared to the Philippines (PHI). However, they are placed in the third spot due to a lower net run rate than PHI. A win in this game will propel them to the second spot in the table, surpassing their opponent Philippines.

PITCH REPORT

The surface at the Yeonhui Cricket Ground in Incheon is a bowling-friendly turf, mostly for spinners. The average score here has only been 125 runs. So, the toss-winning skipper will look ahead to bowl first and restrict the opponent to a low total.
