Delhi Capitals Face Double Blow After Defeat
Heavy Defeat on the Field:

Delhi Capitals suffered a significant setback in their IPL 2024 campaign as they faced a resounding defeat at the hands of Kolkata Knight Riders. Despite a valiant effort from Rishabh Pant and the batting lineup, Delhi Capitals fell short in their pursuit of Kolkata’s imposing total. The massive margin of defeat not only dented Delhi’s confidence but also dealt a severe blow to their run rate, impacting their standing in the tournament.

Action Against Rishabh Pant and Delhi Capitals:

The woes for Delhi Capitals didn’t end with their on-field defeat. The IPL disciplinary committee took stern action against the team, particularly targeting captain Rishabh Pant for their slow over rate during the match against Kolkata Knight Riders. This wasn’t the first instance of slow over rates for Delhi in the season, leading to a hefty fine of Rs 24 lakh imposed on Pant. According to IPL’s code of conduct, repeat offenses are met with severe penalties.

Fines for Playing XI:

In addition to the action against Rishabh Pant, the entire playing XI of Delhi Capitals faced financial penalties for their role in the slow over rate. Each player was fined Rs 6 lakh or 25% of their match fee, whichever was less. This collective penalty serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining the pace of play as per the league’s regulations.
