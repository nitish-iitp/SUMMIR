in a t20 game. can the team batting first declare after X amount of overs therefore not batting out the full 20. Put the opposition in and then try and bowl them out before the rain forecasted turns up and kill their chances of getting the 2 tournament points needed to qualify for the next round?

Sorry, this is not specifically replying to your question but from what I am seeing it seems like rain is more likely to affect Scotland Zimbabwe game than ours. Unfortunate for Zimbabwe if that happens. We have to beat Ireland if we play, By whatever means. However, we should get a good idea about weather around 7pm Guyana time. That should be like 5 hours before start time. I should think theyll have an accurate forecast then. I remain highly optimistic that we are going through

Xactly what I was thinking when I saw Ragg's scenario.

There is no rule saying you cant declare

So Better yet
Both teams declare at 0/0
Game tied
Then play the superover 

All you need is about 20 mins

Can A Team Declare In An ODI or T20 Match?
No, a cricket team cannot declare in a limited overs match like an ODI or a T20 game. The laws of cricket state that declaration is only possible during a game where it is possible for both teams to bat twice. Therefore, the only types of cricket matches where declarations can occur are first class matches. Examples of first class matches are test matches and 4-day games between counties or state teams!
