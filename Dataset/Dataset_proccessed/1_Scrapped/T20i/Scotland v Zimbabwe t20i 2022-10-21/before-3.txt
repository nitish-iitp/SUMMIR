Thought of the Day for School Assembly 21 October 2022
The thought of the day for the school assembly on October 21, 2022, is provided below.
“There is nothing impossible to they who will try.” Alexander the Great
Explanation
For the people who make honest efforts to complete a task, everything is possible and nothing impossible. One should keep in mind that there is a way to succeed as long as one puts in all the effort and preserves.  Between dreamers and doers is a thin line. Dreams are the initial steps in any journey, and connecting them to goals is the second, but planning and execution are the most important steps because without them everything would seem pointless. The take-home point is we must put in all the efforts to whichever task or goal we aim at along with proper planning and execution.
