10.25pm: Here are the captains, starting with Scotland's Richie Berrington: "It's hugely disappointing not to get over the line. Felt we were 25-30 runs short with the bat, a few more would have allowed to create more pressure in the chase. We've played some good cricket so disappointing we didn't execute with the bat today. We can walk away proud with our performances, take a lot of positives from that moving forward."

And Zimbabwe skip Craig Ervine: "I don't think anyone could explain what it means. We've had the whole country behind us. The cricket we've played coming into the tournament has been special, so credit to the boys. [Raza] I needed someone to come in and play that innings. I was aiming to steady the ship and knock it around, we knew Raza could come in and hit boundaries. [Fans] The support for us has been special. We're looking forward to travelling around Australia and having that with us."

That's us done for tonight, Firdose's report will tell the tale of Zimbabwe's achievement and we'll be back tomorrow for the start of the Super 12s: Australia taking on New Zealand at the SCG (weather permitting) and England against Afghanistan over in Perth. From myself, Peter Della Penna and Venkat Raghav, thanks for keeping us company. Bye!

10.12pm: Jubilation for Zimbabwe, they are through to the Big Time. Scotland can't repeat their heroics of 2021. First time Zimbabwe have made it into the second stage of a World T20, and you can see what it means to this group; they dispatched Ireland in the first game and then bounced back from defeat to West Indies to top the group and take their place in Group 2 alongside India, Pakistan, South Africa, Bangladesh and Netherlands. There's a small pocket of Zimbabwe fans in the ground going absolutely bananas! The margin was comfortable enough in the end, Scotland just didn't get enough runs on the board

Sikandar Raza is named Player of the Match after taking 1 for 23 and scoring 40 off 23 balls in the chase: "Credit to Scotland for making it tough. We've been part of too many tournaments where it's pretty cut throat. After the way we bowled, I thought one of us would get the job done. It was my turn but I thought Craig played really well and the two youngsters at the end. It's satisfying and humbling and emotional as well. I said to Craig your job is to bat through, give me 8-10 balls and I'll try to get it as quickly as possible. You're the one who's going to win us this game. Some of the risks I took came off and that partnership was instrumental in getting us there. [Fans] If you look at the numbers and hear the noise, you can't tell it's a small number. Credit to them, the supporters back home and overseas as well."
