Here's how Scotland lost their third wicket, that of their captain for 13.

50 for George Munsey
published at 15 overs
15 overs

Sco 91-3

A second half-century of the tournament for opener George Munsey. It hasn't been the most free-flowing innings, coming from 46 balls but he has stuck around and set an important platform.

Zimbabwe have bowled very well at him but he has absorbed all the pressure. Can he kick on now and increase that strike rate?

Sco 87-3
published at 14 overs
14 overs

It feels like Calum Macleod has got to be the one to hit the accelerator now.

George Munsey is anchoring the innings with 48 from 43 balls so he needs the rest of the batters to pick up the pace around him.

Yep, bowler Wessly Madhevere tried to throw the ball to the stumps but disturbed the bails with his hand instead.

The batters make it back for two, Macleod survives.

Oh no, has Calum Macleod been run out? Or has the bowler knocked the stumps with his hands?

Chatara has bowled really nicely. It's not so often that you see seamers being so economical in T20 cricket these days. Scotland really struggling.

Sco 80-3
published at 13 overs
13 overs

Munsey and Calum Macleod are desperately trying to find the boundaries, stepping across their stumps and attempting to clear the fielders but it's not not happening.

Tendai Chatara has been brilliant: three overs for just eight runs and taken the wicket of Michael Jones.

Sco 74-3

12 overs

Another miserly over from Sikandar Raza, just three from it, as he continues to lead Zimbabwe's bowling attack brilliantly with his spin.

Scotland need some boundaries, and quickly.

Another quiet, boundary-less over with six runs from it. Zimbabwe just squeezing, biding their time.

Can George Munsey lead a counter-attack for Scotland? He has 42 not out.

Sco 65-3

Another very good over from Sikandar Raza, who has 1-9 from his two overs so far.

Halfway through and Zimbabwe will be the happier of the two sides.

Berrington c Shumba b Raza 13 (Sco 64-3)

The pressure tells!

Having just said Zimbabwe weren't giving much away, Richie Berrington clearly felt that Scotland needed to find a boundary from somewhere. He takes on Sikandar Raza, but slog sweeps it straight to deep mid-wicket.

Disappointment for Scotland's captain and they need someone to stick around with George Munsey here.

Sco 63-2
published at 9 overs
9 overs

Sean Williams whizzes through another over of spin.

No boundary from it, but Scotland tick over six more runs as they just continue to build a bit of a platform for the end of the innings. Zimbabwe aren't giving much away at the moment.

How's this for a catch? A stunner from Wessly Madhevere.

Sco 56-2

A tidy start from spinner Sikandar Raza just pegs back a bit of control for Zimbabwe, just five runs from it.

Scotland need to keep finding a boundary an over. They just need to make sure the scoreboard keeps moving. They're currently going at 7.14

Sco 50-2
published at 7 overs
7 overs

Oh, almost! George Munsey flicks one nicely off his legs for four, just over the head of Blessing Muzarabani at short fine leg.

He's the tallest player on the pitch so if he can't get there, nobody can. Scotland building a nice little partnership here.

Share
Sco 43-2
published at 6 overs
6 overs

George Munsey finishes the powerplay in fine style, cutting Blessing Muzarabani's last ball for a perfectly timed boundary.

He's the key for Scotland now, with 29 from 21 balls.

Here's how Michael Jones was dismissed in the first over for just four, giving Zimbabwe a great start.

Sco 36-2
published at 5 overs
5 overs

Four more to George Munsey as he just gets enough glove on one down the leg side to beat the keeper and race away to the boundary.

Regis Chakabva lands a little awkwardly and receives some physio treatment, but is eventually fine to carry on.

Munsey then drives the last ball of Ngarava's over for four glorious runs, straight out of the textbook.

Xavier Doherty
Former Australia spinner on BBC Test Match Special

That's a cracking catch there. Cross would have thought it was four immediately. It was a metre, a metre and a half wide of the fielder.

That was a spectacular catch, horizontal as it hit his hands.
