Narps, Onion was waiting on you to take over the score updates. Our team is in serious trouble!

Nobody losing sleep for that team. Checked the scorecard this morning and laughed. 

If they can't beat Scotland ah don't know how they will manage to be competitive against Ireland and Zimbabwe.

The result was so predictable

If we had won it would have been an upset

Just woke up and going through the details too...

 
Narper 2022-10-17 13:20:19 

The coach was also at a loss for words to explain why such collapses keep repeating themselves. "I don't know. I haven't questioned the dressing room yet, let them calm down a little bit first, let myself calm down a little bit first before I go into the dressing room," quipped Simmons.

Ice Cream Man

ICM... what a special coach! 

For sure if they gave him the wrong flavor ice cream is nuff noise though 

 
Kay 2022-10-17 13:55:39 

ICM:



I think we need to wake up and start being as professional as we can be when we're batting.

When we are coaching too ....

same program



Leask to Pooran, out Bowled!! This is a serious problem for Nic Pooran. The number of times he's out to spin (off-spin in particular) in the recent past - got to be some mind-boggling stat there. It was slightly short and not short enough to play the slog/pull. Pooran jumped on the back foot looking to find a boundary with a hack and the lack of bounce beats his under edge, hits the top of off and sends Scotland into a cock-a-hoop mood. Pooran b Leask 4(9)

In support of de coach, I had a raspberry sorbet when de game started...next thing you know its 52/0 in less than six when de rain came....

 

 
Narper 2022-10-17 15:02:30 

Nicholas Pooran:
We are gonna have a bowl. New pitch and just to have a look at the conditions. We are motivated, not taking it for granted. Fletcher, Reifer, Cariah and Charles are out today.

Sheer cowardice


Pooran:
Tough loss for us. Disappointing for sure. I guess now we got to do the hardwork now and win both the games. 160 was a par score. The middle-order batting was disappointing. We have been struggling in the middle order for some time and it continues. Definitely not acceptable (asked about the batting against Scotland's spinners). The ball wasn't spinning much. We got reflect and get better. Next two games are must win. I guess when you perform bad as players, you want the next game to come as quickly as possible. I don't think we were complacent. We did get off to a good start, but disappointing after the powerplay

Living in the west, I was able to watch every ball
It is hard to watch our batsman bat

Not good for our health 

Management and players wing it ERVERY MATCH for a long time now

ICM is clueless....he says it himself....

YOU MISSED A LOT SKUNT. YOU MISSED THE WHOLE BEAT DUNG OF SO CALLED STARS LIKE POORANDI, FOLDER, FAKECOY, BONG, LEWDIS, PROOKS ETC. THESE SO CALLED STARS GOT A BEATING LIKE NO TOMORROW FROM THE 13TH RANKED SIDE.

IF YUH SKUNTS AGAIN DO OVER ACTION I WILL CUT UR TRESTICLUES AND SERVE THEM TO CROCODILES. SHAMELESS IDIOTS.

DEDING WID LAF NARPSHITE.

I joined CITYBOY in the same pew, I have seen too many great cricketers to let these players, whose stats are far away away from International, to effect my heart
Poorman should turn over his role, it is effecting his game
The blind is leading from Phil to the players
We need an Icon in that team, not a UB

I cannot remember teams winning the toss and batting. Seems in T20 you win and chase. I will take note this FL.

Speaking of FL if the Windies do not qualify can I call it off?

No...it becomes more interesting ...and a narrower and higher caliber pool to choose from

14.1
Delany to Pooran, out Caught by Tector!! West Indies captain departs! Delany does the trick once again. A tossed up delivery by the spinner, keeps it outside off, well out of the batter's reach. Pooran tries to slice it over deep point with a lofted shot, but fails to clear the fielder stationed near the boundary. That was the longer boundary and Delany made it count. Pooran c Tector b Delany 13(11) [6s-1]




105-4 15 ova

you missed all d excitement. same old story



Nicholas Pooran:

It's tough, we haven't batted well in this tournament at all. On a really good batting surface, making 145, it's a really difficult task for the bowlers. It was going to be a challenge. Congratulations to Ireland, they batted fantastically and bowled well today. There are a lot of positives, Jason is back to bowling well, King is batting wonderfully, Joseph is stepping up with the ball for us. This is a learning experience for us. We have disappointed our fans and ourselves. It's definitely hurting. I have disappointed my guys with the way I performed.
