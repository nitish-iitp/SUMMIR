IND vs SA 3rd T20 Dream11 Prediction & Fan2Play Possible 11 Pitch Report | IND vs SA 3rd T20 Dream11 Prediction Today | India vs South Africa 3rd T20 Key Players | Visakhapatnam Pitch Report

The Protea Fire is burning hot right now, with South Africa continuing their promising rise in T20I cricket with another terrific performance. After Rassie van der Dussen and David Miller produced the goods in Delhi, Heinrich Klaasen, who came in for the injured Quinton de Kock, produced a masterclass on a tricky Cuttack pitch to hand South Africa a 2-0 series lead.

It was another sign of South Africa’s growing belief. Ahead of the series, Temba Bavuma spoke of the positive mood in the camp both on and off the field, and it is showing in their performances as the Proteas have now won 15 of their past 17 T20Is since their heavy defeat to West Indies a year ago. Now, it’s time to complete the job in India, with an unassailable 3-0 series lead right there for South Africa to grab.

It’s the kind of pressure that could serve the home team well. As questions continue to be asked about Rishabh Pant’s captaincy, a number of the players need to take greater responsibility for their performances. Also, the ineffectiveness of the bowling attack under pressure in the first two matches – apart from Bhuvneshwar Kumar – may prompt a change in personnel, but it remains to be seen if India select the uncapped Umran Malik and/or Arshdeep Singh in a do-or-die clash.

Or could it spur them on? Possibly. Both Malik and Arshdeep form a key part of India’s uncapped talent pool, and such an occasion can bring the best out of them. For that to happen no matter the bowling personnel, the batsmen will be out for a repeat of Delhi rather than the struggle of Cuttack.

IND vs SA 3rd T20 Possible Playing 11

India: 1. Ishan Kishan, 2. Ruturaj Gaikwad, 3. Shreyas Iyer, 4. Rishabh Pant (c & wk), 5. Hardik Pandya, 6. Dinesh Karthik, 7. Axar Patel, 8. Harshal Patel, 9 Avesh Khan/Umran Malik/Arshdeep Singh, 10. Bhuvneshwar Kumar, 11. Yuzvendra Chahal/Ravi Bishnoi

South Africa: 1. Reeza Hendricks/Quinton de Kock, 2. Temba Bavuma (c), 3. Rassie van der Dussen, 4. David Miller, 5. Heinrich Klaasen (wk), 6. Dwaine Pretorius, 7. Wayne Parnell, 8. Kagiso Rabada, 9. Keshav Maharaj, 10. Anrich Nortje, 11. Tabraiz Shamsi

Key Players to Watch/Key Stats

India:

Ishan Kishan is an almost must-pick in a fantasy XI. The left-hander has struck scores of 45, 51, 6, 43, 48, 76 and 34 in his past seven knocks. He is the top run-scorer this series with 110 at a strike rate of 159.42.
Shreyas Iyer’s last seven scores in T20Is: 25 (20), 25 (16), 57* (28), 74* (44), 73* (45), 36 (27) and 40 (35).
Eyes will be on Hardik Pandya and Dinesh Karthik in the finishing department. Hardik struck 31* off 12 balls in the first T20I, and Karthik helped India reach a competitive score in the second with 30* off 21 balls.
Dinesh Karthik had the best strike rate of any player with at least 300 runs in the recent IPL (183.33).
Bhuvneshwar Kumar is looking in irresistible touch. The seamer is the leading wicket-taker this series (5), four of which have come in the powerplay.
Also, Bhuvneshwar has experience bowling on this ground. He has taken six wickets in as many matches at Visakhapatnam at an economy of 7.05.
Harshal Patel will be tasked with limiting South Africa’s momentum at the backend of the innings. He has taken 51 wickets in the past two IPL seasons and two in two matches in this series.

South Africa:

What a knock it was by Heinrich Klaasen in Cuttack (81 off 46). He has a very favourable record against Yuzvendra Chahal: 25 balls faced, 71 runs scored, no dismissals, strike rate: 284.
David Miller is having a dream year. He has been dismissed just twice when chasing since the beginning of IPL 2022. He struck 320 runs at a strike rate above 150 (two dismissals) when batting second in the IPL and is yet to be dismissed this series (64* off 31 and 20* off 15).
Rassie van der Dussen will be key for the Proteas in the absence of Aiden Markram and potential absence of Quinton de Kock. In 25 T20I innings since the 2019 ODI World Cup, van der Dussen has struck 756 runs at an average of 42.00 and strike rate of 142.64.
Kagiso Rabada has just the one wicket so far this series, but his economy rate of 6.25 is priceless for South Africa. He will be key both upfront and at the death as he was in the recent IPL where he took the most wickets by any seamer (23).
Anrich Nortje is South Africa’s leading wicket-taker this series (3), with two coming at the death. The other was the crucial wicket of Ishan Kishan in the 7th over at Cuttack.
Dwaine Pretorius is conceding an expensive 10.71 per over, but he could offer value with bat and ball today. He is being used as a pinch-hitter, and it came off in the first match where he scored 29 off 13 balls.
Other Stats and Facts
Head-to-head: Matches 17, India 9, South Africa 8.
Yuzvendra Chahal is still struggling in T20Is. Since 2019, the leg-spinner has taken 25 wickets in 29 T20Is at an average of 38.92 and economy rate touching nine.
Rishabh Pant in T20s at Visakhapatnam: 5 inns, 117 runs, avg. 23.40, SR 151.95.
Arshdeep Singh conceded just 7.70 runs per over in IPL 2022.
Ruturaj Gaikwad has been dismissed 12 times for 221 runs in 166 balls by left-arm seam in all T20s.
Tabraiz Shamsi has conceded 48 runs in four overs this series without taking a wicket.
Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium, Visakhapatnam Pitch Report and Weather

There have been just two T20Is at this ground. Both were low-scoring matches. In the first in 2016, India rolled Sri Lanka for just 82 and chased it down inside 14 overs. In the second in 2019, Australia restricted India to 126/7 and won by three wickets.

Both spinners and seamers has success, which suggests this could be a tricky track like we saw in Cuttack. The rain is likely to stay away for this match, but temperatures and humidity levels will be high.

Batsmen: David Miller, Shreyas Iyer, Ishan Kishan
All-rounders: Hardik Pandya, Dwaine Pretorius

IND vs SA 3rd T20 Match Prediction

It is unimaginable to think that India will lose three matches in a row to lose a five-match series. India can bounce back well today, but the chasing team is likely to have an advantage.
