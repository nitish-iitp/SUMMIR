22:19 (IST)
14 JUN 2022
IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Bhuvi gets his first wicket

Penultimate over of the match and the innings. Bhuvneshwar Kumar has been brought into the attack and strikes straightaway. Maharaj looks to reduce the margin of defeat and only gets the safe hands of Dinesh Karthik. SA: 126/8 after 18.2 overs

22:16 (IST)
14 JUN 2022
IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Maharaj hits a rare six

Avesh Khan back on the field and will bowl the 18th. Great fielding by Ruturaj to stop a four. 3 runs off the first 2 balls. South Africa need boundaries and not just fours. They need sixes at this juncture. That's one of them as Maharaj slaps it over the boundary. SA 126/7 after 18 overs

22:10 (IST)
14 JUN 2022
IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Rabada OUT!!

The 17th over will be bowled by Harshal Patel. Avesh, meanwhile, is off the field. Might have hurt hit finger trying to evade a Rabada rocket in the last over. 3 runs off the first 3 balls in this over as SA batters struggle for clean connection. Rabada tries to hit a big one and is caught by Chahal. SA 113/7 after 16.4 overs

22:06 (IST)
14 JUN 2022
IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Rabada hits a four

Avesh Khan in to bowl the 16th. Just 2 runs from the first 3 balls. Excellent under the circumstances. That was nearly another wicket as Rabada's hit just falls behind him. The next ball is hit down the ground for a four by Rabada. South Africa need quite a few of these. SA 110/6 after 16 overs

21:59 (IST)
14 JUN 2022
IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Chahal snaps up Klassen

Last over by Bhuvneshwar yielded 9 runs as it ended with a boundary. 15th over due to start and Chahal to bowl this one to finish his spell. South Africa need to get a big over from anywhere. 4 runs off the first 3 balls as Harshal covers a lot of ground to save a boundary. Klassen is gone!!! Axar takes the catch!!! South Africa's hopes might as well be extinguished now. SA 100/6 after 14.5 overs.

Raise your hand if you just picked up a wicket ?‍???‍??

IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Bhuvi starts brilliantly

Huge shout for LBW but India decides against the review. That looked very very close. Should probably had gone for that. Beautiful bowling by Bhuvi. SA 2/0 after 1 over.

14 JUN 2022
IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Run chase begins

14 JUN 2022
IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: India post 179/5

Last over now after the previous over yielded 11 runs, courtesy 2 fours from Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel. Parnell in to bowl the last one and is hit straight for a four by Pandya. What a shot!!! Gets the yorker right next ball and it's just a single. Patel rotates the strike as Pandya is back to face Parnell. Full toss and a brilliant hit by Pandya for the second four of the over. Absolutely whipped. A dot to follow. Can India reach 180? They just need a boundary. Any boundary. No they reach 179/5. South Africa need 180 to win

Innings Break! #TeamIndia post 179/5 on the board on the back of fifties from @Ruutu1331 & @ishankishan51 and a cameo from @hardikpandya7! ? ?

After a couple of drop catches, finally Bavuma's safe hands removes Pant for 6(8), not a good series for indian captain so far.#INDvsSA pic.twitter.com/PVrpXfwJl0

IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Anrich Nortje's gameplan

It's good for us to be together as a team again. The last time we played was the World Cup. We've been keeping things quite simple since the World Cup. (On his fitness) It's still not 100%, but getting there, some discomfort here and there. Generally good to get some game time in the middle. Different conditions playing in India, I haven't played too much here in general, that already is a new challenge for me. All in all, happy with the progress, hoping to keep on progressing until hopefully the next World Cup. I don't think anything will change for this game. Our plan is obviously to go 3-0 up and try and secure the series. It's a massive game for us, we see it as a final in a way, try and give our best, put some pressure on ourselves as well to try and execute in this game. The boys are going to be coming hard today.

IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Both teams unchanged

Temba Bavuma: Same thing, bowl again. The colour is different, has a yellowish tinge to it. Feels hard, looks like a good wicket to bat. Same team. Just want to focus on the areas we can improve.

Rishabh Pant: We would have bowled as well. But as an Indian team we are not looking at the toss too much. Same team. We spoke about getting better in execution and if we do that we will be fine. Looks like a better wicket, but feels a bit soft underneath.

IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Pitch Report

The outfield is cushy, soft and lush green. Straight boundary is long compared to the sides. The spinners have got a lot of purchase before it looks a much better pitch tonight to bat on. It sounds firm, looks like it has been rolled in really well. I don't think this will be a low-scorer. 170-180 could be a par total. I don't expect the spinners to get great assistance. It is slightly overcast and if it stays that way we may not have that dew. If you're a batter, you would love to bat on this surface - says Deep Dasgupta.

IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Will Chalal and Axar retain their place?

In bowling, the spin duo of Yuzvendra Chahal and Axar Patel have been a big letdown as they went for 75 and 59 in six and five overs in the two matches and the axe is likely to fall on one of them going into the third game.

IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Pant's captaincy comes under the scanner

Shoehorned into captaincy, Pant (29, 5) has not fired himself so far. He has only three fifties in 45 T20Is with an average of 23.9 and strike-rate of 126.6. As someone, who is touted as a future leader, Pant has not inspired enough confidence with his leadership abilities. His decision to promote Axar Patel over designated finisher and the experienced Dinesh Karthik in the second game was baffling, to say the least.

IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Can Kishan build on strong start tonight?

In the first T20I, The 23-year old Ishan Kishan, who had an average IPL 2022 with Mumbai Indians helped India set a base for a big first innings total, the highest in T20Is at Kotla. At the start of the innings though, runs didn’t come by smoothly for the Indian opener. “I think initially we knew that the wicket is not easy to get going and it will be tough for the batsman coming after me,” Kishan said. “My plan was just to target the loose balls because in a T20 game the powerplay is also very important and we needed to put pressure on the bowlers.”

14 JUN 2022
IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: India will be wary of Rassie Van der Dussen

At one juncture of South Africa’s chase in the first T20I, Rishabh Pant was heard yelling playfully at Avesh Khan: “Isko strike par rakh, Miller ko mat dena (keep him on strike, not Miller).” The Indian ’keeper-captain was referring to Rassie van der Dussen, who at that precise moment was in the middle of an ordeal, frozen like a man who had stepped onto Alaska in beachwear.

Van der Dussen had just crawled to 29 off 30; a rate that even in the 50-over game is considered unsatisfactory. But Pant’s quip/banter/genuine tactic didn’t age well; in the next 15 balls, he plundered 45 runs. As if, in the twitch of a second, he transformed from an Everyman to a Superman, though sweating incessantly in the Kotla heat, each stroke leaving its strain on his face and limbs.

IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Can Klaasen make his break count?

South Africa wicketkeeper-batter Heinrich Klaasen hopes his match-winning effort against India in the second T20 helps him prolong his international career. Dropped after the T20 World Cup last year, Klaasen also found himself out of the ODI side and also lost his central contract. He would not have got a look-in had Quinton de Kock not injured his wrist before the game on Sunday as the 30-year-old finally got a chance. He took the game away from India with his fiery 46-ball 81, his career-best T20 score.

Career-best score??

IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Last time they met

When Bhuvneshwar Kumar scythed the match open with a probing exhibition of swing and seam bowling in the Power-play, the game seemed like a low-scoring thriller in the making. Indian hopes lingered after his three-wicket burst had South Africa on the knees in pursuit of a modest score of 148. But they soon went up in smoke and blended with the haze that had enveloped the Barabati Stadium, as South Africa wrapped up the game with 10 balls to spare and four wickets in hand. (READ MORE)

IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Can South Africa clinch the series tonight?

South Africa, on the other hand, have looked like a well-oiled machine with both their bowlers and batters working in partnerships. If Miller and van der Dussen took it away with a stellar show in the first T20, comeback man Klassen proved to be the difference on Sunday with his fluent 81-run innings on a tricky wicket. Skipper Temba Bavuma also played the perfect foil to Klassen to script SA’s recovery.

IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Why was DK held back in the last match? Shreyas explains

When Hardik Pandya was bowled by Wayne Parnell, India had been reduced to 90 for 4 in the 13th over against South Africa in the second T20I in Cuttack. Dinesh Karthik had been slotted in at No 6 but he was held back as India decided to send in Axar Patel instead. While Patel could manage only 10 off 11 deliveries, Karthik, who arrived at No 7 with five overs left, overcame a slow start to knock an unbeaten 30 off 21. However, India could only post 148 for 6 in a four-wicket defeat.

Dinesh Karthik’s frantic 30 off 21 balls on Sunday night at Cuttack was not enough as India lost the second T20 by four wickets against South Africa. But before the match, the Indian wicketkeeper-batter, who is making his comeback to the Indian team, took part in a fun ‘This or That’ segment, where he has candidly admitted that he is a fan of Roger Federer and Lionel Messi.

IND vs SA 3rd T20I Live: Will Heinrich Klaasen come good tonight as well?

When Heinrich Klaasen was in Grade 1 at school, and immersing himself into cricket, his teacher warned him that cricket would not get him through school. He has proven the teacher wrong. Proving people wrong has been his thing. Even on Sunday night, after he hit a blistering 81 that won the game for South Africa in Cuttack, his team-mate David Miller would admit that Klaasen’s promotion in the order was “more to just hold me back but Klaasy proved us wrong … Klaasy’s knock was phenomenal and one of the best I have seen. It was a bit of a tricky pitch.” (READ MORE)

The hosts, save Bhuvneshwar Kumar, have looked bereft of ideas of getting breakthroughs as India picked just four wickets in the opening game and six in the second match with the leading seamer from Meerut doing most of the damage.

IND vs SA: Shreyas Iyer explains why India held Dinesh Karthik back

When Hardik Pandya was bowled by Wayne Parnell, India had been reduced to 90 for 4 in the 13th over against South Africa in the second T20I in Cuttack. Dinesh Karthik had been slotted in at No 6 but he was held back as India decided to send in Axar Patel instead. While Patel could manage only 10 off 11 deliveries, Karthik, who arrived at No 7 with five overs left, overcame a slow start to knock an unbeaten 30 off 21. However, India could only post 148 for 6 in a four-wicket defeat.

After the game, Shreyas Iyer said that India would continue to preserve Karthik for the death overs, although the decision came in for criticism from former South Africa captain Graeme Smith in the post-match broadcast analysis. “It’s definitely something we have strategised earlier as well. We had seven overs left and Axar Patel is someone who can take singles, who can keep rotating the strike,” Iyer explained in the post-match press conference.
