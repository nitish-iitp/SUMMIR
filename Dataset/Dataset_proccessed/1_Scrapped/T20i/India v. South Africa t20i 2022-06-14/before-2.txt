Kwibuka Women’s T20 2022 Tournament – Complete Squad and Schedule

Gahanga International Cricket Stadium and IPR Kicukiro Cricket ground will be the two venues for the tournament that will be played in a round robin format followed by play-offs. The event will be conducted under the able aegis of Rwanda Cricket Association.

While Kenya are the defending champions, Uganda and Tanzania have been the champions in the past. Kenya won their fourth title in 2021. Their previous three wins came in 2015, 2017 and 2018. Uganda on the other hand have won twice, in 2014 and 2016. Tanzania have won the competition just once, in 2019.

The inaugural season of the Kwibuka T20 tournament was played in 2014 and since then the competition has been held annually. In 2020, due to COVID-19, the tournament did not take place. It is the flagship event of the women’s cricket calendar in Rwanda. Through this tournament, the cricket community gets a chance to contribute to Rwanda’s healing process in view of the atrocities committed during the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi. The participating teams get a chance to visit the Kigali Genocide Memorial and take a look at what the country went through during the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi. Apart from this, they also get the opportunity to visit other places in Rwanda.
