From Bruges to Paris to Oaxaca, Cologne and Le Fortuna, on World Chocolate Day, let’s stroll through the world’s best cities for chocolate lovers.

Xocolātl (xoco = bitter, all = water). Bitter Water. That’s what ‘chocolate’ meant in the Classical Nahuatl (Aztec) language. It is not a misnomer; in its earliest avatar, cocoa powder was served as a bitter liquid until the Europeans stumbled upon it, added sugar to cocoa and turned it into what we now know as chocolate.

Chocolate arrived in Belgium as early as the 17th century but it wasn’t until the 19th century that chocolate became easily available. Pharmacist Jean Neuhaus claims the credit for the first Belgian chocolate. And the praline was born in 1912. In order to protect the pralines, his wife created a carton box, just like a jewellery box, and called it the ‘ballotin’. Nearly 112 years later, a ballotin of chocolate pralines is still the favourite gift from Brussels, Today, Brussels is full of chocolate shops, renowned chocolate makers, great classics, artisan craftsmen and rising stars.

Paris (France)

It was a gift to the 14-year old King Louis XIII from his 14-year old wife to be – Anne of Austria. That’s how chocolate came to France - placed in a chest as a gift of great value. In those days, chocolate was expensive, exotic and considered an aphrodisiac and almost a recreational drug. In the early days, it was taken in liquid form - the cocoa bean paste mixed with water or milk and added flavourings like chilli, all spice, cloves and vanilla.
