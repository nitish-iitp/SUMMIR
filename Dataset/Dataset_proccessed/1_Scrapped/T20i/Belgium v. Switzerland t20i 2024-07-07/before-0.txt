England, despite not having won a major international trophy since their 1966 World Cup triumph, demonstrated their prowess by reaching the final of Euro 2020, where they suffered a heart breaking penalty shootout defeat against Italy.
Meanwhile, Spain and Portugal have also assembled formidable squads, making them strong challengers for the championship
.
Cristiano Ronaldo, the iconic Portuguese forward, is set to make history by participating in his sixth European Championship, a record unmatched by any other player.



Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portuguese superstar, had already established remarkable feats in the European Championship prior to this competition. He held the records for the highest number of appearances, having played in 25 matches, and the most goals scored, with an impressive tally of 14. At the age of 39, Ronaldo celebrated a momentous victory with the Portuguese national team in the 2016 tournament.
The previous European Championship, originally scheduled for 2020 but postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, saw Italy emerge as the champions. The Italians clinched the title by defeating England in a thrilling penalty shootout during the final match, which took place at the iconic Wembley Stadium.
