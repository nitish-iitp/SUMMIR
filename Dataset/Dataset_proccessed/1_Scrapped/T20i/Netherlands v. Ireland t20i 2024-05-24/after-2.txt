USA vs Bangladesh Live Score: It’s a Wicket. Shoriful Islam is out and Bangladesh at 132/9 after 18.4 overs

USA vs Bangladesh Live Score: OUT! TIMBER! WOW! This is huge. Chants of USA going all across the park. Saurabh Netravalkar with his second wicket here. It is way fuller, around off. Islam makes some room and tries to hit it through the line. It catches the inside edge and crashes into the stumps. USA now one wicket away from winning this series. Who would've thought. This is incredible, if they take it home.

USA vs Bangladesh Live Score: Rishad Hossain smashed a Four on Ali Khan bowling . Bangladesh at 130/8 after 17.6 overs

USA vs Bangladesh Live Score: FOUR! Up and over! A much-needed boundary for Bangladesh. This boundary does keep them in this contest. It could just go down to the wire. Fuller one, outside off. Plenty of width on offer and Hossain makes the most of it. He lofts it towards long off and finds the boundary.

May 23, 2024 11:48 PM IST
USA vs Bangladesh Live Score: It’s a Wicket. Tanzim Hasan Sakib is out and Bangladesh at 125/8 after 17.3 overs

USA vs Bangladesh Live Score: OUT! LBW! Ali Khan is turning the match on its head. Two huge wickets in just three deliveries. USA have now become the favourites here. Ali Khan serves a toe-crushing yorker, in the blockhole. Tanzim Hasan Sakib looks to clip it away but misses. He takes a blow on his pads. Ali Khan with a loud appeal, and the umpire this time does raise his dreaded finger.

May 23, 2024 11:45 PM IST
USA vs Bangladesh Live Score: It’s a Wicket. Shakib Al Hasan is out and Bangladesh at 124/7 after 17.1 overs

USA vs Bangladesh Live Score: OUT! CHOPPED ON! What is happening here? Is there a twist in the tale? Well, it certainly looks like it. It is a fuller one, outside off, angling across as well. Shakib Al Hasan shuffles and looks to crunch it through the line but he only manages to get a thick inside edge, which sees the ball disturb the furniture behind him.
