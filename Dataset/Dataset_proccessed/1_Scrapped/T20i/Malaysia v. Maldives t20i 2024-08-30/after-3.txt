By Llywellenie Mpasa:

Malawi Under-19 Women’s National Cricket Team received a hero’s welcome at Chileka International Airport in Blantyre Thursday as it landed with the International Cricket Council (ICC) under-19 women’s T20 World Cup sub-regional trophy.

 The team lifted the trophy in Kigali, Rwanda, on Tuesday after finishing the tournament with a perfect record, amassing 12 points in the process.

This historic victory marked the first time a Malawian team had won an international cricket tournament, signaling a new era for the sport in the country.

Captain Ketrina Chingaipe said she was honoured to lead the team to victory and highlighted the significance of the accomplishment.

“This tournament is a stepping stone for us. It will propel us to even greater successes in the future. The team has shown resilience and determination and we are ready to take on more challenges,” Chingaipe said.

In a thrilling final match, Malawi secured the title by defeating Kenya by two wickets, capping off an impressive campaign with six consecutive wins.

Malawi’s success was further underscored by individual accolades with left-arm bowler Eva Kabwere being named the Best Bowler of the tournament.

Kabwere’s exceptional performance included taking 15 wickets and scoring three runs in batting, making her a key player in Malawi’s victorious campaign.

“It was an incredible experience and I am proud to have played a part in my team’s success,” she said.

Team Coach Gershom Mtambalika emphasised the need for continued support as they prepare for regional finals scheduled for September 20 in Kigali.

The finals will determine which team qualifies for the 2025 ICC U-19 T20 World Cup in Malaysia.

“The team requires all the possible support to continue making the country proud. We just have to continue working hard as more significant opportunities lie ahead. It is crucial that we prepare mentally and physically to do well,” Mtambalika said.

Malawi National Council of Sports Board Member Helen Mpinganjira-Tasosa said they are excited with the team’s performance.

“Our team’s triumph is a milestone in the country’s sporting history and has set the stage for an exciting journey. As the team prepares for the regional finals, the focus will be on maintaining the momentum and ensuring that we continue to shine on the international stage,” Mpinganjira-Tasosa said.
