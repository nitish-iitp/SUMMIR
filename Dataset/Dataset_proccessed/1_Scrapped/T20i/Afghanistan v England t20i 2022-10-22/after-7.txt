England to face Afghanistan in Perth in the opening match

Former England captain Eoin Morgan has called Afghanistan spinner Rashid Khan a crucial factor in England's upcoming Super-12 clash in the ongoing ICC Men's T20 World Cup. The 36-year-old said Rashid Khan's battle with England captain Jos Buttler will be pivotal in the tie.

Speaking ahead of England's opener against Afghanistan, Morgan said Rashid Khan could be crucial to England winning or losing the game.

"Against England, I think he [Rashid Khan] could be the winning or the losing of the game," said Morgan.

He went on to say that the battle between Buttler and Khan could decide the match between the two sides.

"England's strongest player is their captain, Jos Buttler, and he has a terrible record against Rashid Khan. If he turns over Jos [Buttler] early in the game, I think it's going to cause a big headache for England," Morgan added.

Buttler also talked up the Rashid Khan threat, saying Afghanistan will pose a strong challenge to other teams in the tournament.

"Yeah, I see them as a really tough opponent. You look through their team, there's some fantastic players. Any side with Rashid Khan in T20 cricket is going to have a big say. We give them huge respect, and we look forward to a really competitive game," said the England skipper.

England were outclassed by New Zealand in the semi-final of the T20 World Cup in the UAE last year as the power-packed side, under Eoin Morgan, failed to deliver on the potential to go all the way. The three lions will be looking to deliver on expectations this time around in Australia, under new captain Jos Buttler.

England vs Afghanistan will start at 7 pm local time, 4:30 pm IST.

PREDICTED XIs: ENG vs AFG

England: Jos Buttler (c & wk), Alex Hales, Ben Stokes, Liam Livingstone, Harry Brook, Moeen Ali, Sam Curran, Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood

Afghanistan: Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Hazratullah Zazai, Najibullah Zadran, Ibrahim Zadran Usman Ghani, Mohammad Nabi (c), Fareed Ahmad Malik, Rashid Khan, Naveen-ul-Haq, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Fazalhaq Farooqi
