A magnificent win for England. The bowlers were on fire in the first innings and rattled the Afghan batting, bowling them out for a mere 112. Sam Curran was the pick of the bowlers and took five wickets for 10 runs.

Mark Wood and Chris Woakes also bowled with venom and created all sorts of problems for the Afghanistan batters.
