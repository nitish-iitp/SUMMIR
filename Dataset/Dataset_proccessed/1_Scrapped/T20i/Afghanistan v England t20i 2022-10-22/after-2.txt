A game which could have gone either way only if there were another 20 more runs to play with. England got half a scare against spin in the middle overs, something they will be mindful of with Sri Lanka also in their group. Afghanistan look good already, and will want more from their batters in the games to come. Until then, it is goodnight and goodbye from us. See you tomorrow!

Jos Buttler, the winning captain: "Coming into the tournament, there were a few nerves. To get out there and get a win was fantastic. There were [fantastic catches]! I thought it was a fantastic effort. I enjoyed that [his own catch]. Mark Wood is always fun to keep wicket to... It is very vital to have someone who can bowl at that express pace. He is a great asset. [Sam Curran] has got a great character for death-bowling. We know it's a really tough period of the game to bowl in. It goes against you... Felt like the ball swung early. We were challenged, and felt like we had to pay respects to the bowlers. Could have been more fluent, but full credit to Afghanistan"

Mohammad Nabi, the Afghanistan captain: "Good start to the tournament... We didn't put up a good score. England is the best T20 team in the world, and recently they played good cricket against Australia and Pakistan. Boys played really well. [There were] two or three good catches; we thought 145 would be a good total to fight. This is our plan: put a good total on the board. We have good spinners - me, Rashid and Mujeeb - who play the Big Bash here. We'll learn and we hope we improve in the next game"

Sam Curran is the Player of the Match for his 5 for 10: "We saw the way the Afghanistan team made it quite tricky towards the end. They have world-class spinners... You've seen in the qualifying groups, with the West Indies missing out that any teams can... Hopefully we can keep playing with confidence and keep winning. To come here and start with a win is great. Ireland will be another tricky game. I was just trying to be as adaptable as possible. Trying to get better in different phases of the game. Really enjoying my cricket at the moment"

Stick with us for the presentations

Wasif: "This is the group of death, England might rue their slower chase later in the tournament"

10.08pm So a low-scoring entertainer in Perth follows a high-scoring one-sided game in Sydney. Who knew what would have been had Afghanistan even scored 130? The pitch always looked pacy, and thus challenging for them, even as they ensured they didn't let England have it easy. A bit of a middle-order collapse did shake England up, as Nabi, Mujeeb and co did their bit to try and defend a small score. But Livingstone hung around, and ensured Curran's five-for didn't go in vain.

18.2
1w
Azmatullah to Moeen Ali, 1 wide

Another short ball, which is on middle. Moeen lets it go, and it is called wide. Woah, some way to win it. England won't mind though. They bag two points even if it was done with some tremors

Scores level

Tinura: "At least Afghans could reduce the damage to their NRR..."

Short ball to Moeen again. Bangs it in on middle and leg, as it angles in with Moeen half-ducking

15.2
W
Rashid Khan to Brook, OUT

Heaved to long-on! Rashid strikes late, but he does so eventually. This time he tossed it up, and bowled full on middle and off. Brook was already into his stroke, trying to hoick that across the line. The ball instead flew off the inside half of the bat to long-on, who barely had to move

Harry Brook c Ibrahim Zadran b Rashid Khan 7 (6b 0x4 0x6 9m) SR: 116.66

George: "It is difficult to be competitive all the time with just three international level bowlers. Teams will just target the remaining two, especially when presented with low targets."

15.1
2
Rashid Khan to Brook, 2 runs

Short ball on off, and pulled to long-on, where half a fumble is enough to allow the second run
