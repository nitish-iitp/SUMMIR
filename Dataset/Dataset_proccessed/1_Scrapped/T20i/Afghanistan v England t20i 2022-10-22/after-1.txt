England vs Afghanistan highlights, T20 World Cup 2022: Under the leadership of white-ball maverick Jos Buttler, former world champions England kickstarted their campaign on Saturday against Afghanistan. Buttler won the toss and invited Afghanistan to bat first in the Super 12 Group 1 fixture (Match No.14) of the ICC T20 World Cup 2022 at the Perth Stadium. Putting up a spirited bowling display against Afghanistan, Sam Curran-starrer England bowled out the Mohammed Nabi-led side for 112 in the 20-over contest. Pacer Curran became the first England bowler to take a five-wicket haul in the shortest format of the game. Chasing the paltry target of 113 in the 20-over contest, Liam Livingstone remained unbeaten on 29 off 21 balls to help England register a comfortable 5-wicket win over Afghanistan.
