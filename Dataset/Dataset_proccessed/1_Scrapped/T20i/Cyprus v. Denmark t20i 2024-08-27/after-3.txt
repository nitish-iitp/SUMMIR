SPAIN’S MEN’S CRICKET TEAM BREAKS AN IMPRESSIVE RECORD PREVIOUSLY HELD BY MALAYSIA
BY
BEN PAWLOWSKI

AUSTRALIA, England and India may be cricket’s big three, but the lowly minnows of Spain now lay claim to one of the sport’s great records.

Following a 7-wicket win over Greece on Sunday, Spain’s men’s national cricket team made history with their 14th consecutive International T20 victory, surpassing the previous record of 13 held by Malaysia.

Spain are currently in the midst of the Europe T20 World Cup Sub Regional Qualifier C, held in Guernsey in the Channel Islands, where they have defeated Greece, Cyprus and Czechia, although their final group game against Denmark was washed out.

The Spanish side’s most recent defeat in the 20-over format came in late 2022 against Italy.

Since then, the team completed series whitewashes against the Isle of Man, Jersey and Croatia.

In the side’s sixth T20 against the Isle of Man, the Manx team were bowled out for just ten runs – a record low for a T20I match – a total which Spain successfully knocked off in just two balls.

Spain’s head coach, the Dutchman Corey Rutgers, told Cricbuzz: “A proud record to be notified about today, we obviously don’t play for records but this does feel special for the group. It has been a transformative few years in Spain, and a lot of credit goes to players who sacrifice a lot of their time to play for España, the management and my coaching staff. Couldn’t be prouder of all involved”.
