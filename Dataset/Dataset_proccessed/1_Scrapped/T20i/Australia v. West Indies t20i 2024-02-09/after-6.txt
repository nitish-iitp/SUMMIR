AUS vs WI, 1st T20I Highlights: David Warner slammed 70 off 36 balls in his 100th T20I and Adam Zampa grabbed three wickets as Australia beat the West Indies by 11 runs in the opening clash of their three-match series on Friday. The hosts crunched 213-7 after being sent in to bat on a windy and cold Hobart evening. The visitors put up a valiant fight but they could only manage 202-8, with Zampa taking 3-26. Warner, who became only the third man after New Zealand's Ross Taylor and India's Virat Kohli to play 100 internationals in each format, hit 12 fours and a six in his explosive knock to anchor the Australia innings.

Right then, that is it from our coverage of this exciting encounter between Australia and West Indies where Australia emerged victorious. The series isn't over yet and the next T20I between these two teams will take place on Sunday, 11th February, 2024. The first ball will be bowled at 1.30 pm IST (8.00 am GMT) but our coverage will start much earlier. Do join us for that match. Until then, goodbye and Cheers!

!

Matthew Wade, the vice-captain of Australia is up for a chat because Mitchell Marsh isn't yet allowed to be in contact given his recent recovery from COVID-19. He says that Marsh is fine and he is just waiting for a couple of more negative tests. Adds that the boys have been playing franchise cricket and they felt 200 was par on this track. Adds that the luxury they have with seven batters is nice to see and the way Tim David played was nice to see. On Adam Zampa, he says that the way he bowled, the skipper must be happy.

!

Rovman Powell, the skipper for West Indies is up for a chat. He says that in the middle they struggled to get partnerships, but it was still a good game of cricket. Says that they just got back to the rhythm a little bit more. Mentions whenever they raised their bat they found a fielder. Thinks the guys did well. Mentions that it is a little bit too cold for them, but the crowd was good.

!

David Warner is the POTM for his exceptional performance. He says that he is pleased to get the win on the board and it was a nice wicket to bat on, one you don't want to miss out on. Adds that he feels fresh and wants to finish on a high at the T20 World Cup. Mentions that it is important that they need to win in the World Cup but win this series as well.

The Presentation ceremony…

!

Earlier in the game, Rovman Powell put Australia into bat and this decision backfired right away. Akeal Hosein, who is generally very tight in the Powerplay was off his game and David Warner hit him for plenty of runs. The pacers too didn't pose much of a threat at the start and Australia were allowed to just get going. The middle phase was where West Indies did come back and found a few wickets with all the pacers getting into the wickets column. Russell ended with 3 wickets but thanks to a superb 70 from Warner and some clean hitting from Tim David at the death, the hosts posted 213 big runs on the board. Coming to the chase, the Windies openers set up the game well but once they started losing wickets, they simply couldn't keep up with the scoreboard pressure.

!

Adam Zampa is down for a chat. He says that they had a good total on the board and it almost got chased but they bowled well. Adds that West Indies are a dangerous team with a lot of power and he feels lucky to have taken wickets at crucial stages. Mentions that he made decisions on the go according to how the batter was playing against him. Adds that as a group they love to play together and coming from the ODI group where there were a lot of youngsters, this feels a bit different.

!

West Indies had a great start to their innings with Brandon King and Johnson batting with great positive intent. They made full use of the powerplay and put up an 89-run partnership before Charles was dismissed. After that, the scoring rate dropped a bit and Brandon King too departed trying to play big shots. Rovman Powell came in and played a fine cameo as he took apart Glenn Maxwell, however, the bowler got the better of him and sent him back to the pavilion. Shai Hope departed in the same manner but the most shocking dismissal was of the big man, Andre Russell, who was cleaned up trying to play a rash shot. They needed a good partnership to stabilize the innings and instead, they lost their wickets. Pooran too tried to overhit the ball and lost his wicket foolishly. Sherfane Rutherford too went for all the glory shots and ended up gifting his wicket. Romario Shepherd followed him soon after and it looked like an amateur team. Jason Holder and Akeal Hosein tried to power the innings till the end but the runs needed were a bit too many and they ended up on the losing side after a well fought match.

!

Australia used the pitch to their advantage and managed to defend the target in a very exciting run chase. Australia were the team to bounce back after the first 8 overs. Through the middle phases of the match, the slower deliveries and the spinners did the job for them. They were taking a lot of hits in the powerplay but Adam Zampa came in and gave them their first breakthrough. Marcus Stoinis covered up soon after and sent back Brandon King to the dugout. Glenn Maxwell got his revenge as he dismissed, Powell after the batter took him to the cleaners. Stoinis came in and sent back Hope just when he was starting to free his arms. Zampa showcased his brilliance once again with the wicket of Russell and Pooran. Sean, who had been a live wire in the field got his first wicket as well in the form of Rutherford. Jason wasn’t one to be left behind and he sent Romario packing off to the dugout. After that, they sealed the game well and managed to take the lead in the series. Sean Abbott also becomes the first Aussie to take four catches in a T20I match.

That's it, just a single to end and Australia have come out on top in a good battle here. Goes full and straight and gets it in the blockhole, Jason Holder clears the front leg but can't get under it and heaves it toward deep mid-wicket for a single. Australia win by 11 runs!

SEAN ABBOTT TO JASON HOLDER

Oh, dear! The fielder completely gets bamboozled by the spin off the turf. Full and wide yet again and in the blockhole, Jason Holder squeezes this one toward short third man where the fielder runs ahead of the ball and the batters get three runs in the deep.

SEAN ABBOTT TO JASON HOLDER

FOUR! Creamed through the gap and West Indies practically need 3 sixes off the last 3 balls to win! This is full and wide again, Holder smashes it away along the ground and well wide of mid off for a boundary.

SEAN ABBOTT TO JASON HOLDER

SIX! Crunched! Sean Abbott misses his mark with the yorker and serves a low full toss instead. Jason Holder stays deep in the crease and uses those long levers to whack it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum. It's not over just yet.

JOSH HAZLEWOOD TO AKEAL HOSEIN

Josh Hazlewood with a golden dot ball! Gets it right in the blockhole again around off stump, Akeal Hosein looks to drive at it but misses. 27 needed off the last over.

JOSH HAZLEWOOD TO JASON HOLDER

A bit of cat and mouse between the batter and bowler. Jason Holder pre-meditates shuffling across the off stump and Josh Hazlewood follows him with a slower and fuller one. Holder gets into an awkward position but manages to work it away toward fine leg for a brace.

JOSH HAZLEWOOD TO JASON HOLDER

FOUR! That has been smashed away! Banged in short over off and at a comfortable height, Jason Holder stands tall and pulls it firmly in front of square and the ball rockets into the fence.
