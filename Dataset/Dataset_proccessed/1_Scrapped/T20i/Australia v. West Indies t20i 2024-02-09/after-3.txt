Veteran opener David Warner has fired in his 100th T20I to inspire Australia to an 11-run win over West Indies in their series opener.

The 37-year-old top-scored with 70 from 36 deliveries before spinner Adam Zampa starred with the ball as the hosts defended 7-213 at Hobart's Bellerive Oval on Friday night.

West Indies — coming off a 3-0 thrashing in the ODI series — got off to a blistering start thanks to openers Brandon King (53 from 37 balls) and Johnson Charles (42 from 25).

Zampa broke their stand in the ninth over, before finishing with an ultra impressive 3-26 from four overs in a batter-dominated match.

He bowled Andre Russell and had Nicholas Pooran caught on the rope in a crucial 16th over.

Marcus Stoinis also had a good night with the ball, picking up 2-20 from three overs.

With West Indies needing 40 off the final two overs, all-rounder Jason Holder hit an unbeaten 34 from 15 balls as his side finished at 8-202.

The two sides meet again on Sunday in Adelaide, with Australia looking to wrap up the three-match series.

Warner, returning after a stint in the United Arab Emirates 20-over league, became the first Australian to play 100 internationals in each format of the game.

He got Australia off to a flying start with a 93-run partnership with Josh Inglis.

Opening together for the first time in a T20I, the pair had Australia 0-77 after the six-over powerplay.

Warner finished with 12 fours and one six, but had some luck on 48 when wicketkeeper Pooran grassed a tough opportunity diving one-handed.

Inglis also had a life when King spilled a half-chance in the outfield, but departed soon after in the eighth over for 39 from 25 balls.

Tim David, who struggled for runs in the BBL this summer, went to town late with an unbeaten 37 from 17 balls.

Warner, who set the tone with four boundaries off Holder in the second over, fell in the 13th when he gloved an Alzarri Joseph delivery to Pooran.

The Australians were 5-159 in the 16th over after losing 4-30 before David combined with Matthew Wade for a partnership of 50 off 23 balls.
