Ahead of the SL vs AFG ODI series, Sri Lanka have announced their squad for the series starting on February 9, 2024. Kusal Mendis will lead Sri Lanka whereas Charith Asalanka has been named the team’s vice captain. The selectors have not included former captain and all-rounder Dasun Shanaka, and the team would hope to continue the momentum they gained after winning the ODI series against Zimbabwe.

The squad has regular members such as Pathum Nissanka, Sadeera Samarawickrama, and Avishka Fernando but the team also has inexperienced players such as Shevon Daniel and Janith Liyange. Sri Lanka, which is known to be a spin-friendly team, the squad also has the likes of ace spinner Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Akila Dhananjaya, and also the young spinner Dunith Wellalage. Wellalage inspired with his performance during the Asia Cup 2023.

All-rounder Dhananjaya de Silva lacks his place in the side and his last appearance for Sri Lanka came in the ODI World Cup 2023. In place of de Silva, Chamika Karunaratne has found a place in the squad to boost the pace bowling department of the team. The team also has the likes of pace bowlers such as Dilshan Madushanka, Dushmantha Chameera, and Pramod Madushan. Matheesha Pathirana is not included in the side as he continues to recover from his shoulder injury.

Sri Lanka registered a thumping 10-wicket win against Afghanistan in the one-off Test match and now the action of the tour shifts to the white ball leg. The series is starting on February 9 and will end on February 14. All the matches will be played at the Pallekele International Stadium in Pallekele, whereas it will head to the T20Is which will be played in Dambulla.

Afghanistan have already announced their squad which will be led by Hashmatullah Shahidi. Rashid Khan is not on the side as he continues to recover from his back injury. The Afghani team defeated Sri Lanka in the ODI World Cup 2023 and will aim to continue the same performance.

Sri Lanka had a disappointing performance in the ODI World Cup 2023 and they finished in the ninth position in the points table. The Sri Lankan team were only able to win 2 matches from 7 games and they also lost many main players due to their injuries.

However, Sri Lanka showcased a decent comeback in the ODI series against Zimbabwe and were able to win the series by 2-0. Kusal Mendis and Janith Liyange impressed with their performance and were the top two run scorers of the series. Mendis scored 129 runs from 3 games whereas Liyange scored 119 runs from 3 matches.

Getting back to Afghanistan, the Afghani team is one of the fastest-growing cricketing nations at present. Afghanistan gave tough competition to India in India in the T20I series they played against the Asian giants in the early days of January 2024. The Afghani team also showcased a decent performance during the only Test match, however, Sri Lanka proved to be too much for Afghanistan and they were able to register a remarkable 10-wicket win.

Sri Lanka’s squad for the ODI series against Afghanistan

Kusal Mendis (c), Charith Asalanka (vc), Pathum Nissanka, Avishka Fernando, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Janith Liyanage, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Dushmantha Chameera, Dilshan Madushanka, Pramod Madushan, Sahan Arachchige, Akila Dananjaya, Dunith Wellalage, Chamika Karunaratne, Shevon Daniel.
