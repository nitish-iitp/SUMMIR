In the recent second Test match between India and England held at the Dr. Y.S.

His remarkable display completely dominated the proceedings, contributing significantly to Team India’s comeback victory after losing the opening Test in Ahmedabad.

Bumrah played a pivotal role in India’s success, securing a sensational 6-wicket haul in the first innings and adding three more wickets in the second innings, ultimately claiming a total of 9 wickets in the match.

No wonder, Bumrah garnered praise from various quarters, including England captain Ben Stokes. Adding to the accolades, AB de Villiers recently commended Bumrah for his stellar bowling performance. Notably, De Villiers, demonstrating his proficiency in Hindi, lauded Bumrah on his YouTube channel, saying, “Bumrah shaandar bowling karta hai (Bumrah bowls brilliantly).”

De Villiers highlights Bumrah’s dominance

De Villiers emphasized Bumrah’s standout performance, noting that the Indian fast bowler outshone his teammates with his exceptional bowling display. Despite the figures of other Indian bowlers not reflecting their contributions, the former South Africa skipper acknowledged their role in setting the stage for Bumrah’s success, emphasizing the collective effort of the Indian bowling attack.

“What a bowler Jasprit Bumrah! He outbowled other Indian bowlers, but I feel the others took their turn and it was hunting in packs. Their figures don’t look great, yes. But they did play a role in setting up for him. It is not an individual sport and this is what I like about this Indian attack,” explained ABD.Watch live sports online

De Villiers also highlighted Bumrah’s proficiency in delivering yorkers across all formats of the game, citing it as a potent weapon in the bowler’s arsenal. Drawing from his own experience playing against Bumrah, De Villiers recognized the yorker as Bumrah’s primary threat, even in Test matches where he has consistently claimed wickets with this skill.

“That is certainly his (Bumrah) weapon across all the formats he plays in. Playing against him, I would always think of the yorker as his stock threat or main threat. Even in Tests, he picks a lot of wickets with that,” added De Villiers.

Bumrah ascends to No. 1 in Test rankings

Following his outstanding performance in the second Test, Bumrah has ascended to the coveted No. 1 spot in the latest ICC men’s Test rankings. This achievement not only marks the Ahmedabad-born cricketer’s dominance in the Test format but also makes him the only bowler in cricket history to achieve the No. 1 ranking across all formats at least once.
