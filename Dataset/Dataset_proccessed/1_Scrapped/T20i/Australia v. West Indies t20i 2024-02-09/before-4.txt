Riding the momentum from their triumph in the solitary Test match, Sri Lanka will aim to kick off the 50-over series with a victory.

Pallekele International Cricket Stadium Pitch report:

The  Pallekele Cricket Stadium is home to a batting-friendly pitch, well-known for its favorable conditions for batters. This surface doesn’t offer significant support to fast bowlers, creating an enticing setting for batters to showcase their skills and enjoy fruitful innings. Once batters find their groove and get accustomed to the conditions, they can take advantage of numerous opportunities to accumulate substantial runs. As the game progresses, the pitch tends to evolve, developing additional grip that plays into the hands of spin bowlers. Consequently, winning the toss often prompts captains to choose batting first, aiming to exploit the favorable conditions that the Pallekele pitch offers throughout the fixture.

SL vs AFG Dream11 Prediction Picks:
Wicketkeepers: Kusal Mendis, Rahmanullah Gurbaz
Batters: Hashmatullah Shahidi, Ibrahim Zadran, Pathum Nissanka
All-rounders: Mohammad Nabi, Wanindu Hasaranga, Azmatullah Omarzai, Dunith Wellalage
