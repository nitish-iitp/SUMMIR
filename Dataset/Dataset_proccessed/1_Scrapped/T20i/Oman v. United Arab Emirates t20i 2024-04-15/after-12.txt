TOZO HT2 Review
April 15, 2024

TOZO, a globally recognized consumer electronics brand, offers a wide range of audio products, covering various designs such as in-ear, semi-in-ear, and open-back headphones, providing consumers with ample choices to suit their preferences. Recently, TOZO launched its latest addition to the lineup of noise-canceling headphones—the TOZO HT2, further expanding its product range to cater to a broader spectrum of user needs. Positioned as the latest flagship over-ear product from TOZO, the HT2 boasts features like a 40mm oversized dynamic driver unit, Hi-Res Audio certification, -38dB depth adaptive active noise cancellation, and up to 60 hours of ultra-long battery life, catering to users' high-quality wireless audio needs and delivering a convenient user experience. 

In terms of design, the TOZO HT2 features a lightweight and foldable design for easy storage and hassle-free carrying, with an adjustable headband equipped with a humanized scale design for quick and convenient adjustment to ensure optimal fit. The ear cups are made of high-quality premium protein leather material, providing a soft and comfortable touch for extended wear, coupled with slow rebound memory foam to offer excellent wearing comfort. This non-intrusive listening experience also helps avoid discomfort from prolonged earbud wear. Additionally, the inner side of the headband top is equipped with soft padding to effectively reduce pressure on the top of the head during extended wear, ensuring comfort even during long listening sessions.
In terms of user interaction, all operational buttons are conveniently located on the right ear cup, including the noise-canceling button, volume controls, and the multifunctional power/play/pause button, allowing for easy adjustment of volume, music control, call handling, and EQ mode switching without the need to reach for the phone, ensuring a seamless user experience. Moreover, the TOZO HT2 supports connectivity via a 3.5mm audio cable and Type-C audio adapter, ensuring wide compatibility with various devices, including non-Bluetooth devices, for seamless multi-device switching and convenient audio input.
Noise cancellation is a standout feature of the TOZO HT2. Equipped with dual-microphone arrays for feedforward and feedback, the HT2 supports hybrid active noise cancellation, detecting internal and external sounds in real-time and emitting precise counteractive sound waves to effectively eliminate environmental noise, providing deep noise cancellation for a quiet listening experience, allowing users to immerse themselves in the world of music. Additionally, the transparency mode, accessible via the built-in NC button, allows users to enjoy music while staying aware of their surroundings, making it convenient and safe for outdoor use.
In addition to conventional active noise cancellation, the TOZO HT2 also features dual-mode intelligent ear canal adaptation, intelligently recognizing ear canal structure and wearing conditions, generating unique noise cancellation parameters, and automatically adjusting audio curves to ensure that each user experiences the same superior noise cancellation and audio performance. This personalized optimization enhances noise cancellation performance while improving music listening experiences, ensuring that users enjoy captivating sound quality regardless of their listening preferences. The closed-back design of over-ear headphones also provides comprehensive coverage when worn, effectively isolating external noise interference and providing a purer audio environment, making them an ideal choice for use in noisy environments such as public transportation, offices, or cafes.
Apart from entertainment purposes, voice calls and communication are also frequent uses of headphones. To address this, the TOZO HT2 is equipped with a three-microphone array and ENC (Environmental Noise Cancellation) call noise reduction algorithm, intelligently identifying various noise reduction scenarios and accurately capturing speech. Whether in bustling urban areas or busy streets with constant traffic, the HT2 ensures clear and intelligible voice calls, making communication stable and smooth.
In addition to its impressive hardware, the TOZO HT2 benefits from software support. The TOZO app features six noise cancellation modes, allowing users to freely select and adjust noise cancellation levels according to different listening environments, balancing noise reduction effectiveness and comfort. Moreover, the app includes 16 preset EQ modes for users to switch between, while the custom EQ adjustment feature allows users to personalize their listening experiences according to their preferences by enhancing specific frequency ranges.
Audio quality has always been TOZO's forte, and the HT2 is no exception. As an over-ear headphone, the TOZO HT2 offers inherent advantages over typical true wireless earbuds in several aspects. Firstly, in terms of speaker units, the larger internal space of over-ear headphones allows for larger speaker driver units. The HT2 is equipped with a 40mm large-sized composite diaphragm dynamic driver unit, providing a full range of audio performance from deep bass to crisp highs, coupled with manufacturer tuning for optimal audio effects. Additionally, the TOZO HT2 boasts an ultra-wide frequency response range of 16Hz-44.1kHz and is Hi-Res certified, supporting authentic high-resolution audio quality for precise audio reproduction, delivering a natural and realistic listening experience, allowing users to experience the charm of music in its purest form.

An outstanding user experience is further enhanced by robust battery life. The TOZO HT2 features a large-capacity 500mAh battery, providing up to 60 hours of ultra-long music playback time when noise cancellation is turned off, and up to 40 hours of continuous playback with noise cancellation enabled, allowing users to enjoy uninterrupted music playback for various listening needs, whether it's during vacations, daily commutes, or home use.
