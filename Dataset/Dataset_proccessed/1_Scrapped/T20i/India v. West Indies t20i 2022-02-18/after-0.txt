Highlights India vs West Indies T20 Scorecard As It Happened

Kolkata: Hello and welcome to our live cricket coverage of the 2nd T20I match between India and West Indies at the Eden Gardens Stadium, Kolkata.

Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Harshal Patel produced superb bowling in slog overs as India survived some anxious moments before walking out with an eight-run won over West Indies in the second T20I that handed them an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series here on Friday.

Significant contributions from Kohli (50), Rishabh Pant (52) and late blitzkrieg from Venkatesh Iyer take India to 186-5 after 20 overs? Will Kieron Pollard and team script a successful chase to keep visitors alive in the series? or Will Rohit outfox visitors to take another series win? Stay tuned for live updates!

Sheldon Cottrell striked in his first over as Ishan Kishan departed after an underconfident innings. Virat Kohli walked in and was exceptional till he got out. His intent was clearly visible. He was batting at a better strike rate than Rohit. Roston Chase came to the party for West Indies as he sent Rohit-Suryakumar Yadav to the dugout right after the first powerplay.

West Indies have won the toss and elected to field first. Jason Holder comes back in place of Fabian Allen. India, on the other hand, are unchanged.
