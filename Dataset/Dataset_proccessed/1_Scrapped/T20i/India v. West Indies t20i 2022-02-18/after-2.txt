India vs West Indies 2nd T20I: IND vs WI Live Score and updates

India vs West Indies 2nd T20I Highlights: The Windies pair of Nicholas Pooran and Rovman Powell showed all their power-hitting pyro techniques at the Eden Gardens, to not just revive West Indies from the early blows but also threaten India to steal a challenging win, but Harshal Patel and Bhuvneshwar Kumar held their nerve in the final three overs. India eventually won by eight runs to take an unassailable 2-0 series lead.- Earlier, India began the proceedings on a sedate note in Kolkata with the hosts losing Ishan Kishan early. But the pair of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli helped India revive with their 46-run stand before the latter found his touch as he scored his 30th half-century in the format. However the Windies spinners began to choke the run rate post the powerplay as India looked to struggle and eventually lost Rohit and Suryakumar Yadav successively. Kohli too departed after his half-century as Roston Chase picked his third but the fiery 75-run stand between Rishabh Pant and Venkatesh Iyer helped India recover in superb fashion as they ended with 186/5 in 20 overs. ...Read More

IND vs WI Live Updates: Rohit Sharma on the Shreyas Iyer issue:

"Someone like Shreyas Iyer is sitting out, very hard on him not making it to playing eleven, but we needed someone to bowl in the middle which is why we couldn't get him in. It's always nice with that kind of competition going around and a lot of the guys are missing out as well. I'm happy to have that kind of challenges rather than not having players available and not in form. We were very clear with Shreyas and we told him we want that option going into the World Cup. Guys do understand what the team wants and all these guys are professionals and they do understand that team comes first" - Rohit after the 1st ODI.

IND vs WI: What about Shreyas Iyer?

The newly-announced captain of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) has been pretty unfortunate in missing out on opportunities in the limited-overs format. He did play the ODI series in South Africa, but so far played only one of the four limited-overs game at home against West Indies, and had scored an impressive knock of 80 runs to help the team win the game (3rd ODI). 

But Iyer's entry will only happen at the expense of Suryakumar Yadav sitting out and the Mumbai Indians star has been phenomenal in the last couple of games for India.

India likely to make any changes for the 2nd T20I?

There were a light injury concerns pertaining to Deepak Chahar and Venkatesh and hence one between Siraj and Avesh can replace the pacer while India might want to try Shardul in place of the all-rounder or go with Deepak Hooda, who is an all-rounder as well who bowls the off-break delivery.

India won the 1st T20I

Put to bat first, West Indies amassed 157, courtesy of Pooran's 43-ball 61 after the spin pair of Bishnoi and Chahal wreaked havoc, picking three between themselves. Bishnoi, playing his maiden international match for India, was the pick of the bowlers with his 2/17 in four overs. Rohit Sharma then got India off to a blistering start with his 19-ball 40 before a middle-order collapse saw the hosts being reduced from 64/0 to 114/4 in a matter of 7.3 overs. However, a 48-run stand between Suryakumar and Venkatesh helped India revive and chase down the target with seven balls to spare.
