Yes, India has been banned from playing international cricket games in the past. The most notable instance was in 2001 when the Indian cricket team was temporarily banned by the International Cricket Council (ICC). This occurred due to a dispute between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Indian government over the appointment of an independent auditor to review the BCCI's accounts. The ban was lifted shortly after, allowing India to resume playing international cricket.

Who was the first Indian to be banned from playing cricket?

1. Mohammad Azharuddin

One of the greatest Indian captains and one of the finest batsmen of the modern era, it is sad that a player of the calibre of Mohammad Azharuddin got involved in a major match-fixing scandal. With 22 Test centuries and over 15,000 international runs to his credit, Azharuddin was widely considered to be India's best batsman for almost a decade before Sachin Tendulkar rose to prominence.

Azharuddin was also one of the most stylish batsmen ever and is remembered for his brilliant wrist work. He got involved in the match-fixing scandal as Hansie Cronje, while confessing his g

Has any player been banned for life for cheating in international cricket?

Quite a few have received life bans though some have been overturned on appeal.

Three have received life bans which have not been overturned.

Hansie Cronje, South Africa, was central to a betting scandal involving deliberately losing one day internationals.

Lou Vincent, New Zealand, was originally banned for failing to report an approach to fix a match then that was extended to life for fixing domestic matches.

Danish Kaneria, Pakistan, originally arrested and banned for fixing domestic matches in England, he later admitted spot fixing.

Of these three, only Cronje certainly cheated in international

What will happen in India if cricket gets banned due to some reasons?

I will be happy because people might concentrate on some other sports. The ranking of football and other sports like, tennis, swimming, shooting, billiards, etc will improve drastically.

However, I am finance guy and I know one thing that it will impact the business. You see the money involved in the Indian cricket. It’s totally insane. The reason Cricketers are filthy rich and let us not utter word about BCCI, we have no clue how much those board members are earning. There are figures we known and those are official figures. Now imagine the black money and all the betting system!!!

It’s almost

Which countries have banned Indians?

Indian Passport for a fact is the most accepted identity for Indians all over the world.

If you are Indian and want to travel to extreme corner of the world, Just have the Republic of India Passport.

I mean, we malayalis, say(proudly) “A Malayalee can be found in every part of the world”. This was back in early 2000s.

Now, Indians from every Indian languages can be seen in every part of the world.

So yes, Indians are not banned in any country. But, due to current Pandemic, some countries has put India on the Red List(not the banned list).

No countries would reject a person

What if cricket is banned in India?

If cricket is banned completely, as in banned from playing, watching or even talking from India…

Mothers of young children will have a hard time on holidays. Kids will no longer get up at 7 to play cricket. Instead, mothers will have to shout on them multiple times till they finally get up at 10.
Young ladies will enjoy this situation. Their boyfriends will no longer spend hours together glued to the TV and may spend more time with them.
Students like me will score better in their exams because they will not spend 4 hours on exam eve watching a T20 match.
Young men will suffer the most. They will

Why has Zimbabwe stopped playing international cricket matches? Has it been banned by any organization or country?

It hasn't stopped. As of today, 12 July 2024, Zimbabwe is in the middle of a series of matches playing against India, with Zimbabwe hosting the Indian national team. The last match (T20I) was 2 days ago on Wednesday 10th July 2024, and the next one is scheduled for tomorrow, Saturday 13th July 2024.

Zimbabwe is also scheduled to tour Ireland for Test matches from July 25, 2024 to 29 July, and further to tour England in May 2025 for another Test Series.

So - Zimbabwe is currently playing international cricket matches.

What will happen if cricket was banned for a year in India?

Unemployment. Lakhs and lakhs of people are related to cricket in India.


Advertising Industry
Professional cricketers, umpires, referees, commentators, etc
Channels like Ten Cricket, Neo Cricket, Star Sports, etc will face huge losses.
Practically International Cricket won't be financially stable.
Lakhs of Cricket Crazy fans of our nation might go to depression.
Last and the most radical one, there might be several riots, how did the government dare to ban a religion (cricket) in a secular republic like ours.

What I do think is my answer is as improbable as your question is.

What will happen in India if cricket gets banned due to some reasons?

For once, I really would like for it to be banned. Cricket has taken over all the other sports in the nation. This is not my rant about cricket by general views.

Other sports will actually come into the limelight and people will know about other great sports personalities that India has.
Over promotion of cricket in media will be stopped. The sports page will not be covered with cricket news only but also with other sports.
The people will become more aware of other great sports people and start to see what they have done for the country. Sportsmen like dhanraj pillay, Gopichand, milkha singh, ra

Protests against the person(s) who proposed the ban, and not to firget the memes. India will stand together united against that person(s). While this continues for some time, other sports may start getting more attention, surely not much as cricket has got though. Apart from these, people will be relieved from commentary of Ravi shastri, Sunil gavaskar, Sidhu, Arun Lal, Russel Arnold, and the most importantly, Rameez Raja. Economically few products will find tough on marketing, because they will have to place their ads on many regional channel instead of a single sports channel. Sponsors will

What are the reasons for which a cricketer can be banned from international cricket?

Exactly what you'd expect

Bribery

Cheating

taking performance enhancing drugs. And a serious crime

These are off field reasons and would merit a serious ban.

On field reasons

Bowlers who throw

Badbehaviour carries the possibility of being suspended for a few matches but these are not bans.
