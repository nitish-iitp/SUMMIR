Zimbabwe vs India Commentary
2:17 PM IST Right then! India came out on top and won the series 3-1 and have outplayed Zimbabwe in all the departments in the 4th T20 with the last T20I coming up on the 14th of July 2024. Sunday. The match is scheduled at 4.30 pm IST (11 am GMT) but you can join us early as we bring you the pre-match excitement. Till then, have a great time.
2:16 PM IST Shubman Gill, the India captain, expresses his happiness with his first series win as captain but acknowledges that the job is not yet complete with one game left to play. He mentions that chasing was a key focus and is pleased they accomplished it. Gill praises the team, calling them a great bunch of players, and hopes to lead them forward. He also notes that he hasn't discussed potential changes with the coach yet and will inform everyone at the toss if there are any, adding a chuckle at the end.
2:14 PM IST Yashasvi Jaiswal is the Player of the Match for his outstanding knock of 93 runs off just 53 balls. He says that he really enjoyed his batting and he had plans for different bowlers as well. Adds that the new ball was coming onto the bat nicely but once it got older it was a bit slow. Says that he thought about the hundred but adjusted to the conditions and just tried to stay there till the end. Ends by saying that it was great batting with Gill out there.
2:10 PM IST Sikandar Raza, the Zimbabwe captain, reflects on the match, stating that the wicket was slightly on the slower side initially, possibly due to it being a bit damp. He mentions that their target was around 160, which they considered to be a par score. However, given India's exceptional batting performance, Raza acknowledges that even 180 runs might not have been sufficient. He expresses hope that his team will come back stronger in the final game of the series. Raza emphasizes the importance of bouncing back well in all three departments. He adds that even if they end up losing the series 2-3, it would still be a satisfactory outcome.
2:02 PM IST ... TIME FOR THE PRESENTATIONS ...
2:01 PM IST Khaleel Ahmed is up for a flash interview. He says that he is very happy with his performance. Adds that he has been able to adapt to the conditions and execute his plans well. Tells that he was missing the atmosphere of being in the Indian dressing room and is glad to be back again. Mentions that everyone is equal and no one is bigger than anyone and says that he was practicing a lot when he was part of the reserve squad for the T20 World Cup.
