Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are in the same group for ICC T20 World Cup 2024. This series will give the two Asian sides an opportunity to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses ahead of their mega clash on June 8 at the Grand Prairie Stadium.

Before the first T20I of this series starts, here's a look at the pitch history of the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium.
