Sri Lanka defeat Bangladesh by 3 runs. (X/Sri Lanka Cricket)

BAN vs SL 1st T20 Highlights: Mahmudullah and Jaker Ali scored fighting half centuries but it wasn’t enough for Bangladesh to go over the line as they lost to Sri Lanka by 3 runs. Angelo Mathews, Binura Fernando and Dasun Shanaka shared 2 wickets each as the Bangla Tigers scored 203/8 in a chase of 207.

Earlier, Sadeera Samarawickrama and Kusal Mendis scored fifties while Charith Asalanka played a blistering 44 as Sri Lanka posted 206/3 in the 1st T20I at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Monday with both teams looking to build momentum for the upcoming T20 World Cup.

The last time these two teams met in a competitive fixture was back in the 2023 ODI World Cup which was infamous for the time-out dismissal of Lankan batter Angelo Matthews brought on by Bangla skipper Shakib Al Hasan.

18:15 (IST)
04 MAR 2024
Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka Live Score: Mendis looks to have hurt is shoulder, still continues

Rishad Hossain again and Samarawickrama has swung the bat at the first ball but a great bit of fielding from Soumya Sarkar to save a boundary.

18:05 (IST)
04 MAR 2024
Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka Live Score: Nifty from Rishad

Rishad Hossain in the attack now and gives away just a single from the first 3 balls as the batters are cautious playing the leg spinner in the early going. Uff!!

18:02 (IST)
04 MAR 2024
Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka Live Score: Powerplay done

Last over inside the powerplay now and Mustafizur Rahman will be introduced in the attack. Samarawickrama on strike and he swings and misses the first ball. Goes for another heave ho and misses again. Gets rapped in the pad next but decides against the single as the score stays stagnant.

17:48 (IST)
04 MAR 2024
Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka Live Score: Kamindu with a SIX!!!

Kusal whips the 3rd ball but that's straight to the fielder before the 4th delivery also goes for a dot. Kusal takes a quick single and weirdly, Bangladesh have taken a review. Pitching outside leg and it's a review lost. The over ends with Kamindu smashing the bowler for a boundary, just to rub more salt into the wounds. SL 21/1 after 3 overs

17:41 (IST)
04 MAR 2024
Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka Live Score: Tight over by Taskin

Taskin Ahmed in to bowl the second over and starts with a corker which goes through Kusal Mendis. The keeper reckons he heard something but Bangladesh decides against the review. Kusal gets an edge now and pushes for a single towards third man. The next is a wide as the ball swings away from the batter's outstretched willow and a good gather by the keeper. That one was flying!! Two more singles as the SL batters finally can rotate strikes after that early barrage by the BAN bowlers.

Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka Live Score: Pitch perfect?

"8 out of the 10 T20Is that have been played here have been won by the chasing team. Talking about the dimensions, it’s 60m on one side and 65m on the other side. There’s a nice grass covering, there will be some seam movement and bounce on offer for the pacers, the spinners are going to struggle today. If you bat first, you got to target 180-190 here, says Russel Arnold

17:17 (IST)
04 MAR 2024

Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka Live Score: The history of the Naagin Dance rivalry

In 2018 Nazmul Islam Apu brought out a Naagin Dance celebration when he took wickets against Sri Lanka. He would also be joined by his teammates much to the chagrin of the Lankan Lions. In the next match, Sri Lanka gave it back in kind when they mimicked the dance after taking the wicket of Abu Jayed which led them to win the match.

Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka Live Score: Last time they met

With both teams out of World Cup semifinal contention, and much of the buildup highlighted by the toxic air around the smog-filled cauldron of the Kotla, the latest edition to the feisty cricket rivalry between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka seemed to be heading down an eventless path midway through the first innings. All of a sudden, it got its moment of animosity.

Angelo Mathews’ timed out dismissal will cause much debate. Over the ‘spirit of cricket’ after Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan appealed for the decision – which was well within the rules – when Mathews seemed to have a problem with his helmet. Over Mathews’s lack of awareness of the rules. Over the rules themselves, as a batsman’s malfunctioning equipment led to his dismissal without facing a ball. (READ MORE)
