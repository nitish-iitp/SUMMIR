Players to watch out for
Renata Sousa:

Roberta Moretti Avery:

The skipper leads from the front in terms of wicket tally. The right arm seamer has 15 wickets in 10T20Is, including the best of 3-1. Apart from her bowling, she is a good right hand bat, having scored 150 runs in nine T20Is, at an average of 30.

Sindhu Sriharsha:

The captain of the United States is the leading run scorer for her side. The right hand opening bat has scored 118 runs in seven T20I innings. She is also one of the most experienced players in the team. Prior to playing for the United States, she was a part of the India U-21 team.

Uzma Iftikhar:

The right arm off spinner is a wily bowler. She has four wickets in as many T20Is, including the best of 4-19. She bowls at an economy of just 4.84.

Last 5 match-performance

Brazil have won their last five T20Is, which they played against Chile, Peru, Mexico and Argentina (twice) between October 3 and October 6, 2019. Since then, they have not played a T20I.

On the other hand, the United States have managed to win just one out of their last five T20Is. The United States won against Namibia only on September 6, 2019. They lost to Netherlands, Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea and Scotland in the other four matches. Since September 6, 2019, United States have not played a single T20I.

Weather

The weather does not look that good through the course of the match. There is a 25% chance of precipitation in the morning and 40% chance of precipitation in the afternoon. The temperature ranges between 20 and 23 degrees Celsius.

Pitch

Six T20Is have been played at this venue. All these matches were played in 2019. Teams batting second have won on four occasions while teams batting first have won on two occasions. The highest total scored is 157 and the lowest total mustered is 89. Among the highest wicket-takers, the top five have been right arm seamers, which suggests that the venue favors the quick bowlers more than the spinners.
