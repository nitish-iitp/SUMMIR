SL vs AFG Highlights: Afghanistan face Sri Lanka in Asia Cup 2022

Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan, T20 Asia Cup 2022 Highlights: Sri Lanka held nerves in yet another tricky run-chase as they beat Afghanistan by four wickets in the opening Super 4 game of the Asia Cup on Saturday. The islanders chased down the 176-run target in 19.1 overs with several small but impactful contributions that sealed the issue for them. This was the highest run-chase in a T20I at Sharjah. Kusal Mendis (36 off 19 balls) started from where he had left against Bangladesh the other day as he launched into opposition's best bowler Rashid Khan, depositing him for two successive sixes as 17 runs came in that over inside the Powerplay. However, it was Danuska Gunathilaka (33 off 20 balls) and Bhanuka Rajapaksa (31 off 14 balls), whose 32 runs stand of just 2.3 overs changed the complexion of the game. Rajapaksa's late blitz eclipsed Rahmanullah Gurbaz, who smashed 84 to guide Afghanistan to a 175-6 in 20 overs. Gurbaz put on a key second-wicket stand of 93 with Ibrahim Zadran, who made 40, after being put into bat first but Sri Lanka hit back late to check the opposition total. Zadran though got a few lusty blows and so did Rashid Khan (9) towards the fag end of the Afghanistan innings to take the score close to 180.

T20 Asia Cup Live Updates: Gurbaz on the end result

"Of course disappointed with the result. But it happens. We were short 25 runs. Just tried to play my natural game and be positive. He (Trott) works so hard with us. So happy with him. We will take it from here to the World Cup as well," says Gurbaz, who gets Player of the Match award for 84 off 45 balls.

Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan Live: ‘We believe we can chase anything’

"It's the belief of the dressing room. As a team we believe we can chase anything on these kind of wickets. When chasing, we have a clear idea of how the wicket behaves. Boys executed the plan very well - Fernando, Hasaranga, Theekshana. Very pleased to see how Mendis and Pathum got started. And the others followed," says Dasun Shanaka.

T20 Asia Cup Live Updates: Rajapaksa on the win

"When I went to bat in, it was just a matter of connecting the ball well and running initially, but the wicket seemed quite good, and we thought 175 was a pretty good score. All in all, the boys did a great job and it was a fantastic win for us," says Bhanuka Rajapaksa.

"In the IPL I have batted at number 3, and coming back to Sri Lanka's squad, they wanted me to bat at number 3 initially, but in order to strengthen the middle-order they wanted me to bat at number 5, or number 6," he adds.
