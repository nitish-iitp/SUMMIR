Afghanistan batter Rahmanullah Gurbaz was on top of his game during his team’s match against Sri Lanka on Saturday, September 3 at Sharjah Cricket Stadium.

In the Asia Cup 2022 Super Four match, the 20-year-old scored 84 runs off 45 balls with the help of four fours and as many as six sixes.

He started in a cautious way, but once he got his eyes in, he started playing his shots without any fear or inhibition.

The right-hander raced away to a 22-ball half-century and made the joint-highest T20I fifty for Afghanistan along with Najibullah Zadran and Hazratullah Zazai.

The record for the fastest fifty is being held by Mohammad Nabi, who got to his fifty off Ireland in 2018.

Gurbaz was also involved in a partnership of 93 runs for the second wicket along with Ibrahim Zadran.

Gurbaz, in the meantime, surpassed Indian skipper Rohit Sharma in the list of highest individual scores in Men’s Asia Cup T20s.

Back in 2016, Rohit scored an unbeaten 83 against Bangladesh at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur.

Gurbaz surpassed Rohit, after which he got out to Asitha Fernando, who made his T20I debut the other day against Bangladesh at Dubai International Cricket Stadium.

Gurbaz tried to play a cross-batted shot, but could only manage an outside edge. Wanindu Hasaranga held his nerve and took the catch without much fuss.

Gurbaz has had an impressive campaign thus far in the Asia Cup 2022. In the opening match of the tournament, he scored an 18-ball 40 and helped Afghanistan beat Sri Lanka by eight wickets.
