Adil Rashid | Player of the Match Speaks:

"I thought Stokes played a magnificent innings. These sort of things happen in T20 cricket. You bowl dot balls, you take wickets and create the pressure, that is T20 cricket for you. I created a few chances, bowled well, but I think it was a great team effort. I think all the bowlers bowled well, Stokes, Wood, everyone. We got some assistance (spin and seam) from this wicket, you don't get such assistance on Australian wickets. I felt quite good, even before the tournament I was feeling good. I did my job, was focused on it, rest is history. The pitch might spin, seam, you need to assess the conditions accordingly. We get this kind of support wherever we go, hopefully they (fans) will come out in numbers in the next match (semi-final) as well."

The Lankans need a wicket while England need a huge hit to relieve some pressure. And another dot!!! Masterstroke, bringing in Kumara at this juncture. That's one and Stokes is on strike now. Another single. 13 from 13. And another pull and that's out!!!! Curran is gone. Game well and truly on!!! ENG 129/6 after 18 overs.

How a meeting at a temple helped a boy from poor family grow up to give a mighty scare to England at the world cup

Along with a friend, Pradeep Nishantha, a coach, was trying to find the home of Pathum Nissanka. He had heard about the batting talent of Nissanka, wanted to draft him at a Columbo school, but was finding it impossible to locate the small house. Nissanka’s house was one of the government-built homes for people affected by the tsunami.

Eventually, they would make a call to Nissanka’s father and ask him to come to the famous temple Kalutara bodiya in the region. (Read more)

ENG vs SL: Sri Lanka 141/8

After a promising start in the Powerplay with 54 runs. Sri Lanka lost their way in the middle overs. Nissanka batted brilliantly for his 67. Other than him the batting struggled. The team managed to score only 61 runs in the next 10 and 25 in the last five. Some brilliant bowling by the likes of Adil Rashid in the middle overs and Mark Wood at the death.

ENG vs SL: Can Sri lanka get to 180?

Brilliant start this by Sri Lanka. They have started well in the Powerplay and are taking the momentum forward. Pathum Nissanka crosses his 50. With Bhanuka Rajapaksha in Shanka to come. They should definitely look for 180 here.

There is spin. Sri Lanka can hope; so can Australia

Sriram Veera: In the 7th over, when Liam Livingstone came on to bowl his legspin, the third ball must have raised hopes for Sri Lanka and the hosts. It gripped on a length and spun sharply past the defensive prod. If Liam can do that, so can Sri Lankans in the chase. Australia can hope. But if you get the length wrong, it can be whacked as Pathum Nissanka showed in the final ball of the same Liam over when he got down on his knee and whacked a full ball over long-on. Short compact and stroke-full - Pathum Nissanka has impressed  so far with his pluck and shot selections.

Sriram Veera: When Pathum Nissanka flicked Chris Woakes, ala Kaluwitharana, he thought he was a goner. There was Harry Brook stationed at deep square-leg exactly for that shot. But it had seemed a gentle flick and flat that Brook came in a bit. Mistake. The ball had just about enough legs to carry on over the head of Brook who leaped and lunged behind but couldn’t get to it. 


First Nissanka pursed his lips into a ‘ooooh’ before he started laughing away once his partner joined him.

Liam Livingstone stuns Mendis.

Sriram Veera: ‘Kusal Mendis has thrown it away’ Russell Arnold would say on air when the Sri Lankan open got out. A bit harsh call, that. It was a ball to be hit - a slowish short of length delivery from Chris Woakes, and Mendis pulled it over midwicket. There was no fielder there but he didn’t reckon with Liam Livingstone. Off Liam charged all the way from deep square-leg, a manic dash if there was one, and suddenly found himself pretty close to the ball but it was dipping. He slid down on his knees and cupped it with both hands pretty close to the turf.

Buttlerâ€™s Wood gamble

Sriram Veera: What do you do when the fastest bowler at the world cup comes on? Wood was introduced earlier than usual by Jos Buttler to try exploit Sri Lanka’s weakness against express pace, as Nasser Hussain put it. Kusal Mendis put Wood’s first ball high over backward square-leg into the upper tier. A lovely long-handed swing and the  length ball on middle and leg kept flying. Couple of balls later, he chipped one over midwicket for three runs. Wood fired his last ball with a sharp short ball outside off and Pathum Nissanka hopped up to upper cut it up and over the leaping third man for the second six of the over. Buttler’s Wood gamble costed him 17runs

ENG vs SL: Sri Lanka won the toss chose to bat first

Dasun Shanaka: We are going to bat first. It's a used wicket, last 7 games were won by teams batting first. We have one change, Karunaratne is in for Madushan. It's an important game for us, we want to carry the pride for us. Hope we'll get some turn.

Jos Buttler: It's a used wicket, we need to play well, we need to play our best cricket. Would have batted first as well. We need to adapt to the conditions quickly, we have plenty of options with seam and spin. We are going in with the same team.

The good, bad and the ugly of Alex Hales

It was a hearty return to big runs in T20 cricket for Alex Hales, after a painful exile and time away from the national squad, as he weathered the Southee-Boult storm to score a reassuring half century against New Zealand in a vital game. Seven fours and a six were part of his 52 off 40 balls.

On a bright English summer day in 2016, a tall right-handed opener smashed Pakistan bowlers all over the park at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. The prodigal son of the county scored 171 runs in 122 balls. It wasn’t just any ordinary innings; it was an announcement of arrival.(Read more)

Hello, welcome, everyone! to the final game of group 1 here in Sydney. With plenty of possibilities still open in the World Cup like who will face each other in the Semi-final and who will play where we are about witness a mouthwatering clash between England and Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is out of the tournament but England is with a chance. If England loses Australia goes through to the semis. So it is all to play for on super Saturday.

England has to win against Sri Lanka on Saturday at SCG to qualify for the Semi-Finals of the World Cup

New Zealand and England were the major winners from a game neither of them took part in at the Twenty20 World Cup on Friday as Australia ended up beating Afghanistan by only four runs. New Zealand, which earlier defeated Ireland by 35 runs, secured its semifinal spot because Australia needed a crushing win to match the Kiwis. New Zealand’s run rate of 2.113 makes it the favourite to finish atop Group 1 ahead of England and Australia. (Read More)
