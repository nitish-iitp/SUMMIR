Mrunal, on Monday, made our blues go far away with a set of pictures of herself looking sharp in the six yards of grace which can be worn to a festive evening, as well as to a Halloween party, if you want to stand out in the crowd. The actor picked a black saree for the pictures and looked absolutely stunning in it. The black organza saree hugged her shape and showed off her curves. Mrunal added the necessary bling to her look with a black sequined blouse, that came heavily embroidered in silver resham threads. The sleeveless blouse came with a plunging neckline. In a diamond neck choker and diamond earrings, Mrunal further accessorised her look for the day. The actor declared her love for black with multiple black heart emoticons in the caption.
