ST JOHN’S, Antigua – The Cricket West Indies Selection Panel today named the West Indies Women’s U19 squad for the upcoming tour of India. The players for the T20 matches were selected after trial matches in Trinidad.

Ashmini Munisar has been named as captain of the 15-member squad with Trishan Holder as vice captain. They will be under the guidance of Head Coach Steve Liburd. Munisar is an allrounder who led the team when West Indies Women's U19 played against USA Women’s U19 in Fort Lauderdale in August. Holder is a top-order batter who was a member of the Barbados team at the Commonwealth Games playing matches against Pakistan, Australia and India.

The upcoming tour will feature matches against India ‘A’ Women U19, India ‘B’ Women U19 and Sri Lanka Women U19 in Visakhapatnam at the Dr Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy International Cricket Stadium. West Indies will then travel to Mumbai where they play against New Zealand Women U19 at the D.Y. Patil Stadium.

I don't understand, how can you under take such a big tour to India and not have a major domestic compitition to chose the team, we never had much going on for young female cricketers, we should get our house in order before venturing out in these major under takings, if the girls are over match, cause for major loss in self confidence

It would be nice if the writers of these articles could list the various territories the players are from.

such bad lazy journalism. England would show what county they representing and Australia would show the state they are associated with but the West Indies ? Is like do the research yourself. I notice the Under 19 men teams gets the same treatment.

I did mention I was not sure whether or not there was a female under 19 compititation, having said that, I think it is early days for women's youth cricket in the Caribbean, should be more local compitition before these big exposure

Look at the names!

What difference does it make anyhow?

Or you just want to complain about which territory got the most picks?
