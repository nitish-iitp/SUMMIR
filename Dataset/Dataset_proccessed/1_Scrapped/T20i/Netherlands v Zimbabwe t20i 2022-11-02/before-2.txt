Rohit Sharma-led Team India is currently playing the T20 World Cup 2022 Down Under. While the side clinched  epic win over arch-rivals Pakistan by 4 wickets, they beat Netherlands to register second consecutive win in the tournament. However, they suffered the first lost in the tournament against South Africa on Sunday.

The side will next face Bangladesh on November 2, 2022 and will play their  last Group match against Zimbabwe on 6 November 2022. The Men in Blue will hope to come out on top against both these sides as they aim to secure a berth in the knockouts. 

But the year 2022 does not end here for the Men in Blue. The side will tour New Zealand for three-match T20I series followed by three-match ODI series.
