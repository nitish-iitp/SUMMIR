In Short
India moved to the top of the Group 2 points table
India will be assured of a spot in the semi-final if they beat Zimbabwe on November 6
Both Pakistan and Bangladesh are not out of the semi-finals race yet

India survived a last-over thriller against Bangladesh in a crucial T20 World Cup 2022 Super 12 match to top the Group 2 points table. Rohit Sharma's men held their nerves in a rain-affected match in Adelaide to clinch a 5-run win and head to pole position in the spiced-up semi-finals race of the tournament in Australia.

India are now on top of the Group 2 points table with 6 points but they are not yet assured of a spot in the semi-final. The win over Bangladesh certainly puts India in the driver's seat, making their path to the semi-finals less complex.

India vs Bangladesh, T20 World Cup: Report | Highlights

India posted 184 on the board after Shakib Al Hasan won the toss and opted to field on a cloudy evening in Adelaide, riding on the fifties from Virat Kohli and KL Rahul. India faced a huge scare when Bangladesh opener Litton Das took the Indian new ball attack to the cleaners. Litton hit 50 off just 21 balls and put Bangladesh in the driver's seat. In fact, Bangladesh were 17 runs ahead of the Duckworth Lewis and Stern par score when they reached 66 off 7 overs after which rain interrupted play.

However, chasing a revised target of 151 in 16 overs, Bangladesh lost the plot, losing wickets at regular intervals to lose the match by just 5 runs.

SUPER 12 GROUP 2 POINTS TABLE (AS OF NOVEMBER 2)
HOW CAN INDIA QUALIFY FOR THE SEMI-FINALS

India's next match: Against Zimbabwe in Melbourne on November 6

India have fate in their own hands as a win over Zimbabwe in their final Super 12 match will take through to the semi-finals. India missed the bust to the last 4 in the UAE last year and would be keen on making up for it.

If the match in Melbourne gets washed out and India and Zimbabwe split points, then also, India will reach the semi-finals.

Even with a defeat, India can progress to the semi-finals but then the equation can come down to Net Run Rate if Pakistan or Zimbabwe get to 6 points and there's a two-way tie at 6 points each.

Notably, Pakistan can stay alive in the race to the semi-finals with nothing less than a victory over South Africa in their penultimate Group 2 match in Sydney on Thursday, November 3.

HOW CAN SOUTH AFRICA QUALIFY FOR THE SEMI-FINALS

South Africa's next matches: Against Pakistan in Sydney on November 3, against Netherlands in Adelaide on November 6.

South Africa are at the 2nd spot in Group 2 points table with 2 games left. They will be through if they beat Pakistan on Thursday in Sydney.

South Africa have the opportunity to top the Group 2 points table as they have Pakistan and Netherlands to face and victories in both matches will take them to 9 points.

Keep in mind, South Africa are the only unbeaten team in the T20 World Cup so far.

South Africa can progress to the semi-final even if they win one of their remaining two matches.

In case one of their matches or both their matches get washed out due to rain, they have a good chance of reaching the semi-final due to their superior Net Run Rate.

HOW CAN PAKISTAN QUALIFY FOR THE SEMI-FINALS

Pakistan find themselves on the brink of elimination after their shock defeat to Zimbabwe. Pakistan bounced back to pick up their first win of the tournament against the Netherlands.

Pakistan will have to beat both South Africa and Bangladesh and hope South Africa lose to Netherlands in their final match or India lose to Zimbabwe in their final match.

Pakistan don't have to rely on Net Run Rate if they win their remaining matches and South Africa lose their remaining matches.

If South Africa beat the Netherlands even after losing to Pakistan, then Babar Azam's men can go through only if India lose to Zimbabwe by a big margin.

HOW CAN BANGLADESH QUALIFY FOR SEMI-FINALS

Bangladesh's next match: Against Pakistan in Adelaide on November 6

Despite their defeat to India, Bangladesh are in with a chance to qualify for the semi-finals.

Bangladesh vs Pakistan on November 6 can prove to be a virtual quarter-final if South Africa lose both their remaining matches.

If South Africa win their next two matches, Bangladesh will have to hope India lose to Zimbabwe by a big margin and they beat Pakistan by a big margin to have chances of making it to the semi-final.
