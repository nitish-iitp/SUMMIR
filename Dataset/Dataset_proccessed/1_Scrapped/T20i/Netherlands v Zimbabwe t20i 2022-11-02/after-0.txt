That's all from us for this game. A big one coming up very soon, click here for India v Bangladesh. Till then, from this section of the ESPNcricinfo page, it is time to say good bye!

Losing captain Craig Ervine: "It was one of those tosses where we were split, whether to bowl or bat. I just thought that credit to Netherlands for their powerplay bowling to put us under the pump. Raza and Williams did really well to get us back into the game but unfortunately we couldn't finish it off. With the ball, we didn't find enough movement with the ball. Credit to Netherlands for the win."

Winning captain Scott Edwards: "Awesome. We came here to win some games at the Super 12. Good to get the ball rolling after a rocking start. Bowlers were sensational, the top four got us pretty close to the total too. Max has been sensational for the past 4-5 years. He rocks up at big occasions.

Max O'Dowd is the POTM: "I was quite scrappy at the start. It was important to adapt to the wicket. ZImbabwe have some tall boys, so they have extra bounce. I took time to adapt but eventually adapted well to bat as long as I could."

Mustafa Moudi: "Every team in Group has a victory each in Group 2 and all of the 12 teams has a pair of points each. This is simple the best edition of all the T20 World Cups !!"

Adeel: "This clearly shows that one single player (Sikandar Raza) can't win you matches everytime. "

5.44pm A disappointing batting performance from Zimbabwe meant that their bowlers did not have much to work with, especially with the solid start that Netherlands' top three gave the chasing side. Some late wickets in the evening may have made Netherlands' win slightly iffy, but they have actually dominated the whole game. Credit to Max O'Dowd and Tom Cooper, both coming good at the World Cup after a spell of low scores. Let's hear from the Player of the Match and the two captains soon.

Williams to de Leede, FOUR runs

Netherlands complete a special win! Every team in Group 2 now with atleast one victory as the batter charges down the ground and hammers this ball over the non-striker's head. Zimbabwe pretty much eliminated, except mathematically

17.5

Williams to de Leede, no run

Good length ball outside off. Turning away with the batter making room to slap it square. Misses out though

17.2
•
Williams to de Leede, no run

Misses a stumping! Batter misses, didn't even turn around since he thought he was stumped, but he survives since the keeper Chakabva makes a mess of it. Good length ball outside off that he came down the track for, but de Leede is lucky that the wicektkeeper fluffed an easy chance

Yorker, just outside off. Backs away to drive, but misses again. We need to wait for the winning runs!

16.5
•
Ngarava to van der Merwe, no run

Good length ball on off and angling across slightly. Roelof tentatively pokes at it, and it goes past the outside edge

16.4
•
Ngarava to van der Merwe, no run

Fullish on leg stump, and worked off his pads to midwicket. Can't take the run

Sheroe: "As a Dutch born Pakistani i woke up 4.50 am in Amsterdam to watch this game. Yeezzz the i hoped for a Dutch win, but this one is a comprehensive one! Hup Holland Hup!"

16.3
W
Ngarava to Edwards, OUT

Netherlands stuttering with victory in sight as another wicket falls, this time the captain. Short of a good length on middle. Edwards tries to swipe across the line but the ball gets big on Edwards before taking an outside edge to the keeper

Muzarabani to Edwards, FOUR runs

Short and wide, and cut along the ground behind point. Shumba at deep cover runs to the deep point region to intercept, but alas!

15.1
W
Muzarabani to O'Dowd, OUT

Short and wide. O'Dowd backs away and cuts uppishly, but straight to Shumba at deep point! O'Dowd can't take Netherlands home, someone else will have the pleasure of doing that. Shumba makes up for that previous error and also makes a case for why he is one of Zimbabwe's better fielders.
