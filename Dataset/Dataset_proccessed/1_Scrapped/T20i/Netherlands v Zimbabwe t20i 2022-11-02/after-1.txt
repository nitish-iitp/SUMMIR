Zimbabwe, after a  narrow defeat to Bangladesh, would be eyeing to beat the Netherlands when they face them in a Group 2 encounter at the T20 World Cup 2022. The African side has turned out with some surprising performances in the tournament, the highlight of which was a thrilling one-run win over Pakistan last month. With one win in three games, Zimbabwe are not mathematically out of the semifinals and a win against the Netherlands can really spur them on to perform well in their remaining group fixture, which is against India.  ICC T20 World Cup 2022 Points Table Super 12 Updated Live: England Move to Second Spot in Group 1 With Win Over New Zealand

The Dutchmen, on the other hand, are winless so far in three games and are officially out of the reckoning for a semis berth. They have had inspirational performances so far but just have not been able to go over the line.
