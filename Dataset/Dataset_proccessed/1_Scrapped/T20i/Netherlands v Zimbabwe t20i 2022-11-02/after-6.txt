England defeated New Zealand with 20 runs to keep their hopes alive in the Men's T20 World Cup in Brisbane.

Knowing defeat would all but eliminate them, England survived under intense pressure to successfully defend 179 at the Gabba.

England batted first and ended up with 179 for 6 in 20 overs, the Kiwis chased and ended up with 159 for 6.

New Zealand still leads Team 1, England is in second while Australia has now moved to third.

In matches today, Netherlands will take on Zimbabwe at 4pm while India will face Bangladesh at 8pm.
