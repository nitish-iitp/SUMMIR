Pakistan captain Babar Azam was confident of his team beating archrivals India in their upcoming clash in the T20 World Cup 2021 on October 24, 2021, in Dubai international cricket stadium. India is the favorite in the contest as the Men in Green are yet to defeat the Men in Blue in a World Cup match.

India and Pakistan first clashed in the T20 World Cup in the inaugural edition in 2007 in South Africa and the Men in Blue defeated Pakistan in both the league stage and then in the final as well to become the first-ever T20 World Champions. Pakistan won the title in 2009, but both the teams are yet to repeat the feat, despite India reaching the finals in the 2014 edition.

Past Is Gone, We Are Not Thinking About It: Babar Azam On 7-0 Record Against India In World Cups

This will be the first time for both Virat Kohli and Babar Azam to lead their respective teams India and Pakistan in a T20 World Cup tournament. And Babar Azam, who has less experience of captaining at the international level was confident of his team doing well against the more experienced captain Virat Kohli.

“When you go into a big tournament, what matters is your belief, the confidence you have within the group. As a team, our confidence and morale is very high. Past is gone, we are not thinking about it rather we are focusing on the future. I am confident that we are well prepared and will play good cricket in the match,” Azam said during a presser.

“An India-Pakistan contest is always a high-intensity match and there always is pressure but as players and as teams, we try to focus on cricket. We need to be calm and focus just on cricket. We will have to play good cricket in the match,” Azam added.

Azam was of opinion that having played in UAE extensively previously, Pakistan has the upper hand and they will win the upcoming match against India.

“As far as the conditions in UAE is concerned, since I have been playing cricket, we have played in UAE in the last 3-4 years and we know how the wickets will behave and how the batsmen need to adapt themselves. On the day, whoever plays better cricket will win and our aim is to play best cricket and if you ask me, I think we will win,” Babar signed off.
