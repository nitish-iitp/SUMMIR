Sri Lanka Vs Bangladesh Highlights T20 World Cup 2021: Sri Lanka beat Bangladesh by 5 wickets in Sharjah

Sri Lanka Vs Bangladesh Highlights T20 World Cup 2021: Fiery knocks from Asalanka and Rajapaksa helped Sri Lanka script 5-wicket win in Sharjah against Bangladesh. 
Sri Lanka's Charith Asalanka hits the ball for four runs during the Cricket Twenty20 World Cup match between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in Sharjah, UAE, Sunday

Sri Lanka Vs Bangladesh Highlights T20 World Cup 2021: The brilliance of Charith Asalanka and Bhanuka Rajapaksa have helped Sri Lanka complete their highest successful run-chase in T20 World Cups. Quick wickets from Shakib and Saifuddin dented Sri Lanka's charge in the middle, but the two smartly negated the pressure to stitch an 86-run stand with the pair lacing eight boundaries and eight sixes to help Sri Lanka reach the target with seven balls to spare. Bangladesh were sloppy on the field and the bowling changes were poor, something that the two capitalised on largely. This was the start Sri Lanka were looking for and they have got it.

Charith Asalanka, Player of the Match:

“Happy that I could help Sri Lanka win the game. It looked like a very good pitch when I walked out to bat, so I tried to play my shots. Rajapaksha was the game changer, he played a few wonderful shots. I want to keep this up and keep winning games for my country.”

50 off 28 from birthday boy!

A phenomenal knock from Rajapaksa! He laced three sixes and three boundaries to score a 28-ball half-century and become the first batter to score a fifty on his birthday in T20 World Cup.

Oct 24, 2021 6:51 PM IST
6, 6, 4, 1, 1, 4!

Bangladesh stuttered, Liton Das made two costly drops and the two batters at the crease made most of the opportunity to grab the momentum and keep Sri Lanka well on track for a victory in Sharjah. Birthday boy Rajapaksa smashed two sixes and two boundaries against Saifuddin to milk 22 runs off the over as he reduced to the equation to 24 off 24.

Oct 24, 2021 6:42 PM IST
Asalanka leading the charge!

He smokes the widish delivery from Mahmudullah downtown for a maximum and then slog sweeps the fourth delivery over deep mid-wicket. 16 off the over! Sri Lanka now have the momentum, completely, and need 51 more from 36 deliveries.

Oct 24, 2021 6:32 PM IST
A birthday special from Rajapaksa?

He shimmied down to punch the widish ball from Afif Hossain for a six and then swept the third ball for a boundary. Meanwhile, Asalanka notched up his half-century, off 32 deliveries.

Sri Lanka 105/4 in 13 overs

Oct 24, 2021 6:18 PM IST
Bangladesh are on a rampage!

Sri Lanka quickly losing the plot! They looked well set for the chase riding on that 69-run stand for the second wicket, but the likes of Shakib and Saifuddin have dented their charge and they have now gone four down at the end of 10 overs. Hasaranga is the fourth batsman to depart, scoring just 6 off 5.

Sri Lanka 80/4 in 10 overs

Oct 24, 2021 6:10 PM IST
History for Shakib!

With twin dismissals in the same over - of Nissanka and Avishka Fernando - Shakib has now surpassed Shahid Afridi to become the leading wicket-taker in T20 World Cup history. He now has 41 wickets to his name in the tournament. 

 

Sri Lanka 72 for three in 9 overs

Oct 24, 2021 5:56 PM IST
Sri Lanka fight back

The 52-run stand off 34 balls, stitched by Nissanka and Asalanka, have helped Sri Lanka revive after the early dismissal of Kusal Perera. Sri Lanka have managed 54 runs for the loss of one wicket in the powerplay, scoring three boundaries and three sixes.

Oct 24, 2021 5:46 PM IST
Asalanka on fire!

He slog swept Mahedi Hasan for a boundary down deep square leg, then smashed Nasum for two sixes - one over deep square and the other over deep extra cover. He then cracked another boundary against Saifuddin, scoring 27 off 13 already.

Sri Lanka 34/1 in 4 overs.
