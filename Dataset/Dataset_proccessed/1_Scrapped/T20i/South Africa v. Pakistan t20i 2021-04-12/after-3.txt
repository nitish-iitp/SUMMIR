A Pakistani journalist said that Aamir Sohail's wicket in 1996 World Cup was Prasad's only achievement in cricket.

Venkatesh Prasad's dismissal of Aamir Sohail in the 1996 World Cup is still fondly remembered by Indian fans. It was a comeback story where a bowler after being hit for a four, comes back to take revenge and dismiss the batsman. The dismissal has been played in loop by Indian cricket fans for several years. It is like that moment which people never forget.

Sohail was batting on 51, when he spanked a cover drive off Prasad. As the ball raced to the boundary, Sohail notoriously pointed his fingers at Prasad and then towards the ball, almost mocking him to go and fetch the ball. What happened the next ball is remembers as one of the greatest comebacks of all time with Prasad castling Sohail and giving him a roaring send-off.

It prompted a response from a Pakistani journalist, who said that it was Prasad's only achievement in cricket.

But the former India fast bowler was quick to shut down the journalist as he replied in the most epic manner.

"Nahi Najeeb Bhai. Had reserved some achievements for later. In the very next World cup in Eng in 1999 , took 5/27 at Manchester against Pakistan and they were unable to chase 228. God bless you," Prasad said.




On the day of the IPL 2021 opener, even the contest between Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers failed to create the kind of waves a TV ad featuring Rahul Dravid managed to. Dravid's latest ad, in which the former India batsman is seen losing his temper and pretty much 'lose it', broke the internet with netizens appreciating the former captain's acting skills.
