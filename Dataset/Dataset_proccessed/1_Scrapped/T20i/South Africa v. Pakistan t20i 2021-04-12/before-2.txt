Punjab Kings skipper KL Rahul praised Chris Gayle for the way he plays in the Indian Premier League. KL Rahul feels that the West Indies cricketer keeps getting better and better in every season of the Indian Premier League despite growing older.

KL Rahul and Chris Gayle are part of Punjab Kings in IPL 2021. Chris Gayle played 7 matches for Punjab Kings in IPL 2020 and scored 288 runs at an average of 41.14. The left-handed batsman also smashed 3 half-centuries in the tournament which consisted of one 99-run knock.

Want To See Chris Gayle Hitting Sixes In IPL 2021: KL Rahul

KL Rahul spoke about Chris Gayle during a podcast on Red Bull’s Decoding Athletes series. The wicket-keeper batsman mentioned that he wonders how Gayle is always partying on a yacht and then plays the way he does.

“I obviously played with Chris [Gayle] for a long time. Having him around is great fun. I’m really looking forward to playing with him again. One year older, but every time he comes back, he keeps getting better and better. I really wonder how he does that. It’s like he’s always on the yacht, partying. And then he turns up and plays the way he does. For someone like me who spends three-four hours getting my batting and skill right, I really wonder how he does it. So, I’m really looking forward to having him in the team and hitting some sixes,” KL said.

KL Rahul also mentioned the Punjab Kings were a bit unlucky in IPL 2020 and hopes that the new name and different jersey will bring good fortune for the team. Punjab Kings was known as Kings XI Punjab in the last 13 editions of the Indian Premier League but the franchisee changed the name for IPL 2021. In IPL 2021, Punjab Kings’ jersey will have golden stripes forming the edges of the design. A crest of a lion will be present below the primary sponsor logos. The team will also wear golden helmets in IPL 2021.

“We have our fingers crossed. I genuinely believe that we were a tad bit unlucky last year. We did play some really good cricket. A couple of the games we really couldn’t close for a couple of reasons. It did hurt a little bit, so I’m hoping the change of name and jerseys, and a whole lot of other changes, will bring us some good fortune,” KL Raul further said.

Looking Forward to Watch Riley Meredith’s Bowling: KL Rahul

KL Rahul also said that he is looking forward to watching Riley Meredith’s bowling in IPL 2021. “I’m looking forward to watching Riley Meredith bowl. I’ve watched him in a couple of games. He looks like he can bowl some proper pace. That’s something I felt we were missing for a few seasons – someone who can intimidate the opposition with some pace. So I’m really looking forward to watch him bowl,” he said.

Punjab Kings bought Australian pacer, Riley Meredith, during IPL auction 2021 for Rs. 8 crores. Punjab Kings’ costliest buy was Australian young pacer Jhye Richardson, who was bought for Rs. 14 crore. Both the bowlers will play their first IPL tournament in IPL 2021.

The other players that Punjab Kings bought during IPL 2021 auction were Shahrukh Khan, Moises Henriques, Dawid Malan, Fabian Allen, Jalaj Saxena, Saurabh Kumar, and Utkarsh Singh. Punjab Kings will commence their IPL journey against Rajasthan Royals on April 12, 2021.
