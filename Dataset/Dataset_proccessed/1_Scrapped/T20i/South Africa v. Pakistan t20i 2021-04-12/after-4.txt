Too Close
9pm, ITV

Emily Watson stars as forensic psychiatrist Emma Robertson in this thriller, continuing nightly until Wednesday. Robertson is assigned the case of Connie Mortensen (Denise Gough), a woman who is accused of a violent crime but claims she cannot remember anything about it. In tonight’s opening episode, the pair begin to establish a prickly relationship, with Robertson probing Mortensen’s close relationship with her neighbour Ness (Thalissa Teixeira), while Mortensen casts doubt on Robertson’s marriage.

The Repair Shop
4.30pm, BBC One

The barn-dwelling restorers continue to provide a welcome dose of endorphins with their sentimental repairs. This week, carpenter Will is faced with a Scandinavian folk figurine that has been mauled by a naughty dog and Dominic tries to unseize an unusual family heirloom – a rusted metal vice. AK

Jamie: Keep Cooking Family Favourites
8.30pm, Channel 4

Until hell freezes over (and possibly afterwards?) you’ll find Jamie Oliver in his kitchen, throwing together speedy meals with ungodly amounts of olive oil and the occasional child-shaped commis chef. This week, his supermarket-friendly fare includes sausage casserole. Hannah J Davies

The teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg is the focus of this three-part series, following her “gap year” off school in 2019, travelling the globe sustainably. Tonight, Thunberg is on her way to a UN climate conference in Chile, witnessing forest fires in California and insect infestations in Canada. AK

Hoarder Homes: No Room to Move
9pm, Channel 5

Another stuffed episode of the series profiling people who just cannot let things go. Among tonight’s subjects is pensioner Bubbles, whose crammed high-rise flat in Harlow is barely half the story: the 63-year-old also has four lock-ups full of clutter and keepsakes that used to belong to her mum. Graeme Virtue

The Truth About Police Stop & Search
10pm, Channel 4

Police stop and search is on the rise in the UK, and evidence shows the controversial policing method disproportionately targets black people. This documentary sees Jermaine Jenas talk to a group of black men who have filmed their experiences of the practice, and unpick its impact. AK

Submarine (Richard Ayoade, 2010), 1.55am, Film4

It is hard to resist this sweet-natured romcom from Richard Ayoade. It’s the story of 15-year-old Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts), who is determined to lose his virginity before he hits 16 (preferably with Yasmin Paige’s Jordana) and to protect his mother (Sally Hawkins) from old flame Graham (Paddy Considine).
