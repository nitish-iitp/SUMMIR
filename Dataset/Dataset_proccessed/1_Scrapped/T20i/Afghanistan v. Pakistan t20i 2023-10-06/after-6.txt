Pakistan’s Mohammad Rizwan and Saud Shakeel hit half-centuries in an otherwise underwhelming batting effort in their World Cup opener against the Netherlands on Friday, before the bowlers sealed a routine 81-run win for the 1992 champions.

Faced with an achievable target of 287, the Dutch looked on course for a stunning win in Hyderabad at one stage as Vikramjit Singh (52) and Bas de Leede (67) got going, but Pakistan kept chipping away to dismiss the underdogs for 205 in 41 overs.

De Leede ripped through the Pakistan lineup taking four for 62 and Colin Ackermann claimed two for 39 after the Netherlands won the toss and decided to bowl, but Rizwan (68) and Shakeel (also 68) ensured Pakistan made 286 in 49 overs.

Haris Rauf took three for 43 and was the pick of the Pakistan attack that was missing the injured Naseem Shah – Rauf finished the job by bowling Paul van Meekeren.

De Leede, the son of former Dutch captain Tim who featured in the 1996, 2003 and 2007 World Cups, was in a menacing mood as he smashed six fours and two sixes, including a hooked shot over the boundary off Rauf.

He celebrated that shot by cheekily winking at the bowler, who had struck the all-rounder in the face with a fiery bouncer during last year’s Twenty20 World Cup.

But the 23-year-old De Leede was bowled by Mohammad Nawaz and the Dutch challenge fizzled out despite a late flurry by Logan van Beek, who scored an unbeaten run-a-ball 28, featuring three fours and a six.

Pakistan were tottering at 38 for three at one point and their captain, Babar Azam, said he was happy to come away with a victory.

“I’m satisfied,” said Babar. “Credit to the bowlers, we started well and took wickets in the middle overs to put the pressure on them.

“After we lost three wickets, Rizwan and Shakeel started building the momentum … the way Saud built his innings shows his improvement.”

Opener Fakhar Zaman was the first to fall in the fourth over, lofting a slower ball from Van Beek back to the bowler and the Netherlands turned the heat up by taking the prized wicket of Babar for five.

Babar barely looked settled during his 18-ball stint on a dry track that offered plenty of turn and bounce early on and the skipper pulled one to Saqib Zulfiqar at mid-wicket in Ackermann’s first over.

Pakistan limped to 43 for three in the 10 powerplay overs after Imam-ul-Haq holed out in the deep, but Rizwan and Shakeel steadied the ship with a fourth-wicket partnership of 120.

The Dutch, playing their first World Cup match since 2011 after coming through the qualifying event, responded as spinner Aryan Dutt had Shakeel caught while De Leede shattered Rizwan’s stumps.

De Leede repeated the feat in the 44th over against Shadab Khan (32) and trapped Hasan Ali lbw with his next ball. Nawaz was run out for 39 but the rearguard effort ultimately paid off for Pakistan.

“It’s a bit disappointing. They made a few runs at the end there but we felt like that was a par score,” said the Dutch captain, Scott Edwards. “At 120 for two we felt we were well and truly in the game.”
