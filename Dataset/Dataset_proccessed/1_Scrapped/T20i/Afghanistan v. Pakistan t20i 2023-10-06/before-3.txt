India's Asian Games team captain Ruturaj Gaikwad.

Before India's showdown against Bangladesh at the ODI World Cup 2023 in Pune on October 19, two young teams representing the neighbours will clash in a totally different setting in Hangzhou, China. Different setting and different goals, without a doubt, but the first semi-final of the 2023 Asian Games men's cricket competition -- a T20I affair -- between India and Bangladesh will be equally captivating. (Live Blog | Scorecard | Full Coverage | Cricket News)

India, taking part in the Asian Games cricket for the first time, has already won a gold medal, thanks to the exploits of Harmanpreet Kaur & Co. Their male counterparts, led by Ruturaj Gaikwad are two wins away from replicating the feat.

But first, India will need to tackle a tenacious Bangladesh side that survived a thriller against Malaysia in the quarter-finals. Gaikwad & Co. also started their Asiad campaign at the same stage with a tricky 23-run win over Nepal -- an encounter made memorable by Yashasvi Jaiswal with his explosive century.

Bangladesh, meanwhile, is looking to win a sixth medal at the Asian Games cricket. While the men's side won gold and bronze in the 2010 and 2014 editions, respectively, the women's team collected back-to-back silver medals before claiming bronze in Hangzhou.

Interestingly, in the women's event, India and Bangladesh met at the same stage with the former winning by eight wickets. While India women went on to win the gold medal thanks to a 19-run victory over Sri Lanka in the final, Bangladesh women took bronze after beating two-time defending champions, Pakistan in the play-off.

India have since defeated Bangladesh three times on the bounce. The last time these two teams met in the shortest format of the game, during the 2022 T20 World Cup, India beat Bangladesh by five runs (DLS method).
