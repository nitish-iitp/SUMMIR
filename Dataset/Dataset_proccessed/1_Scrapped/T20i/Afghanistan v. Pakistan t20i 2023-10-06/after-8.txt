PAK vs AFG Commentary
9:58 AM IST Right then this is it from the second Semi-final of the Asian Games 2023 as Afghanistan has advanced through to the Gold Medal match where they will be facing India while Pakistan will be up against Bangladesh for a Bronze medal match.  You could join us for both the games on Saturday with the Bronze Medal game set to be played from 6.30 am IST (1 am GMT). You could join us an hour before for the build-up as well. For now, you can enjoy the ongoing ICC CWC game between Pakistan and the Netherlands as well. Till then have a nice time.
9:15 AM IST Pakistan's bowlers put up a commendable performance, but ultimately, it was the runs on the board that made the difference. A margin of 20 more runs from the Pakistani batters could have altered the outcome. Pakistan's quest for an Asian Games Gold medal concludes here, and they will now compete for third place against Bangladesh. Meanwhile, Afghanistan's triumph sets the stage for a thrilling final showdown against India, the top-ranked T20 team in the world, as they vie for the coveted title.
9:10 AM IST Afghanistan's batting performance mirrored that of Pakistan, with both teams losing early wickets and exposing their middle order to the new ball's challenges. However, Afghanistan found a lifeline in the form of a crucial partnership between Noor and Afsar in the middle overs, which helped them regain their footing in the game. Pakistan fought back by dismissing both set batsmen in a single over, putting them in a commanding position. As the game entered the death overs, Afghanistan's captain, Gulbadin, played a decisive role, scoring an unbeaten 26 off just 19 balls to guide his team to victory and a place in the finals against India.
9:10 AM IST The semi-final clash between Pakistan and Afghanistan in the Asian Games 2023 proved to be a roller coaster ride of emotions, with Afghanistan emerging as the victors and securing their place in the final against India. Pakistan, on the other hand, will compete for third place against Bangladesh as the tournament enters its final stages.

Aamer Jamal to Gulbadin Naib, 4 runs

FOUR! This sums up the evening for Pakistan as Mirza Tahir Baig has misfielded this for a boundary that takes Afghanistan into the final for a Gold Medal game against India. On a length in middle, Gulbadin Naib pulls this flat and hard towards deep mid-wicket for a boundary.
