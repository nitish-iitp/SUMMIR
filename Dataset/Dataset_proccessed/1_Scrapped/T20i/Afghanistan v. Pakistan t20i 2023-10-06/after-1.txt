DAWIN MALAN'S SPARKLING 140 LEADS ENGLAND TO VICTORY OVER BANGLADESH, PAKISTAN SET RECORD RUN CHASE AGAINST SRI LANKA
BYJAMES WALKER-ROBERTS

UPDATED 10/10/2023 AT 17:30 GMT

Defending champions England recorded their first win at the Cricket World Cup as they beat Bangladesh by 137 runs. Dawid Malan hit 140 from 107 balls and Joe Root scored 82 from 68 as England reached 364-9 from their 50 overs in Dharamsala. Pakistan worked wonders to set a record World Cup run chase to beat Sri Lanka and secure back-to-back wins.

Dawid Malan’s blistering 140 from 107 balls set England up to beat Bangladesh by 137 runs, while Pakistan set a record World Cup run chase to overcome Sri Lanka.
Malan smashed five sixes and shared big stands with Jonny Bairstow (52) and Joe Root (82), as defending champions England reached 364-9 from their 50 overs in Dharamsala to secure their first win at the Cricket World Cup.

Malan teamed up with Bairstow for 115 runs for the first wicket, and another 151 off 117 deliveries alongside Root, an improvement off his 24-run innings in the first game.

Malan and Root guided England to 266-1 and seemingly on course for a 400-plus total.
However, England lost their next eight wickets for 96 runs as they ended up on 364-9 from their innings.
Reece Topley had been brought in for Moeen Ali, and he gave England some attacking momentum with the new ball.
In the second over, two wickets in two balls from the left-arm fast bowler quickly put Bangladesh in trouble as they slipped to 26-3.
Topley finished with four wickets for 43 runs, as Bangladesh came up well short, bowled out for 227.

Chris Woakes took two wickets while the rest of the attack all chipped in with one apiece.
The win is the perfect response for England after their crushing defeat to New Zealand in the opening game of the tournament, putting them on the back foot in the round-robin stage in which every team will play each other once.
"I think it was a really good performance to bounce back from a disappointing first game and we still feel there are areas to improve," said England captain Jos Buttler.
"I thought it was a fantastic score on that pitch, it got harder towards the end but we could've got more at the back end. Some big partnerships at the start, excellent from Dawid Malan to take a lead."
England next play Afghanistan on Sunday in Dehli.
Pakistan made it two wins out of two with a record-breaking victory over Sri Lanka, who have lost both of their opening matches.
Abdullah Shafique and an injury-stricken Muhammad Rizwan starred with 176 off 156 balls as they chased a World Cup record 345 runs.
Shafique made 113 off 103 balls before being caught as Player of the Match Rizwan and Saud Shakeel managed 95 for the fourth wicket.
Rizwan needed to battle through a back issue and cramp in his calf and finished on 131 from 121 balls as Pakistan secured the unlikely win.
"It’s always a proud moment for you when you perform for your country and performances like that, when you win the match, is speechless for you,” Pakistan’s Muhammad Rizwan said. "It was difficult because when you have a chase like that it’s always special for you.
“The thing for us is that when we went to the dressing room every player had the belief that we can chase that."
Not only did Pakistan break a World Cup run chase record, but it was the first time there have ever been four centuries in a match at the tournament.
Sri Lanka’s Kusal Mendis (122 off 77) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (108 off 89), alongside Pakistan’s Rizwan and Shafique, both hit centuries.
Pakistan next face India while Sri Lanka play Australia as they continue the search for their first win.
