India vs South-Africa Head-to-Head

The two teams have faced each other total of 15 times in Twenty20 internationals. Overall, India dominate in T20 battles against South Africa as the men in blue have won nine out of 15 matches meanwhile South Africa have won six T20s. Out of 15 matches between India and South Africa, only four have been played in India before, in which South Africa have recorded three wins while India have won just one match on their own soil against SA. A very heated contest is expected as both the teams have some top-notch IPL players playing for them.

The final game of the three-match series lead by India 1-0 was set to be played at M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangaluru. Virat Kohli, the then T20 captain of India, after winning the toss elected to bat first. The men in blue couldn't make it big and scored 134 in 20 overs. Apart from Shikhar Dhawan, no other batter could cross even 20 runs. In retaliation, South Africa chased the total in just 16.5 overs with skipper Quinton de Kock's scintillating 79 not out. SA lost only one wicket and won by 9 wickets to level the series 1-1.

India chased the total with ease in 19 overs courtesy of skipper Virat Kohli's smashing 72 off 52 accompanied by Shikhar Dhawan's 40 off 31 and won the second T20 by 7 wickets and an over remaining. India led by 1-0.

In the final decider game of the three-match T20 series, South Africa after winning the toss chose to field first.

Later, South Africa fought well but were short of 7 runs as the strict bowling by Indian bowlers restricted the hosts on 165/6.
