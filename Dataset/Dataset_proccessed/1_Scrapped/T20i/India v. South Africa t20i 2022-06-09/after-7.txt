India vs South Africa, 1st T20I, Highlights: Rassie van der Dussen and David Miller played knocks of 75 and 64 respectively as South Africa pulled off a heist to chase 212 against India in the first T20I of the five-match series on Thursday at Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi. Both batters put on 131 runs for the fourth wicket, and the duo kept dispatching the deliveries for constant boundaries and Indian bowlers had no answers. In the end, Proteas registered a comfortable seven-wicket win with 5 balls to spare. Earlier, India set a massive 212-run target for South Africa in the first T20I. The hosts were put on course for a big total by Ishan Kishan's superb display of power-hitting. He departed on 76 off 48 balls. India vice-captain Hardik Pandya contributed with a 31* off just 12 balls while Shreyas Iyer scored 36 off 27 balls. India captain Rishabh Pant scored 29 off 16 balls. For South Africa, Keshav Maharaj, Wayne Parnell, Anrich Nortje and Wayne Parnell took one wicket each.  (SCORECARD)
