Tiger and Disha starred together in the 2018 film Bhaaghi 2. Ever since then, they are rumoured to be dating. While the two have not yet confirmed their relationship, they are occasionally spotted on dinner dates, family outings and go on vacations together. They are also seen frequently commenting on each other’s social media posts. Talking about reports of his relationship with Disha, Tiger previously told Hindustan Times, “If I happen to be with Disha, it obviously becomes a topic of attention! People like knowing about actors’ personal life. I enjoy Disha’s company and we get along great. Our friendship remains unaffected.”

Disha was last seen opposite Salman Khan in Radhe. She will next star in the action-drama Yodha, with Sidharth Malhotra and Raashii Khanna. She is also a part of Mohit Suri’s Ek Villain Returns, starring John Abraham, Arjun Kapoor, and Tara Sutaria. Tiger was last in Heropanti 2, co-starring Tara Sutaria.
