India vs Bangladesh Commentary
5:49 PM IST That's all that is from this particular game and series but you can keep tuned in to check out other matches in our match centre. The Women's T20 World Cup is about to reach its business end while in the Men's section, a few new series are set to kick off. West Indies' tour of Sri Lanka, New Zealand's tour of India and South Africa's tour of Bangladesh in the immediate future. You can catch all of these and much more by clicking on the different match centres. ADIOS! TAKE CARE!
5:47 PM IST That ends a difficult tour for Bangladesh. They would have come here with plenty of expectations but were mostly knocked out in nearly every game. However, they will know that life does not end here and it is just an end of a phase. Not in terms of the series but in terms of an era as well. New beginnings will need to be searched upon, to unearth the next set of diamonds. They don't have much time for a turnaround as they head back home for their next assignment - a 2-Test series against South Africa, starting 21st October, 2024. India, on the other hand, have just begun their home season. Bangladesh have been dealt with and it is time for the next challenge - New Zealand. That will be a 3-Test series, which will see the senior players return. The first Test kicks off on 16th October, 2024.
5:47 PM IST Victorious Indian captain, SURYAKUMAR YADAV, shares his thoughts, highlighting how much the team has achieved together. He emphasizes the importance of fostering a selfless mindset, with players supporting and celebrating each other's performances. The camaraderie within the group is evident. He recalls coach Gautam Gambhir's words before the series, reminding the team that no one is bigger than the game - whether you're on 49 or 99, you must stay committed to the team’s goal, just like Sanju Samson did. He stresses the need for flexibility in both batting and bowling, with bowlers contributing where needed and batters showing adaptability. Ends by saying that the team's performances have been commendable.
5:40 PM IST HARDIK PANDYA HAS BEEN NAMED THE PLAYER OF THE SERIES. 118 runs at a strike rate of over 222, a wicket and 5 catches to boot. On his mental freedom, Pandya credits it to the atmosphere in the dressing room, created by the skipper and the coach, with everyone enjoying everyone's success. On his physical fitness, Hardik says that his body is feeling fantastic. On his best shot in this innings, HP calls his shot over cover in the final over, as those shots are not easy to play.
5:37 PM IST SANJU SAMSON HAS BEEN ADJUDGED THE PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his blistering 111, to go with a catch as well. Samson expresses his gratitude for the energy and support from the dressing room. He shares how happy it makes him to see his teammates celebrate his success. Admits that it can be frustrating knowing what he’s capable of but not always delivering, though he’s learned to handle pressure and failures with experience. Having played many games, he understands the importance of focusing on the process and trusting that good performances will come. Admits that representing his country brings pressure, but he always aimed to keep things simple and take it one ball at a time. He acknowledges the leadership for their unwavering support, not just in words but in actions. Samson recalls how, after two ducks in the previous series, he returned to Kerala uncertain of what would happen next, yet here he is, grateful for the opportunity.
5:36 PM IST Bangladesh's skipper, NAJMUL HOSSAIN SHANTO, admits that Bangladesh did not play their best cricket. Details that as a group, the batting unit did not execute its plans while the bowling was not consistent, and in this game, it was a match to forget. Wants his players to forget this game, head back home and look ahead to the future, wanting to take more responsibilities. From this particular game, he wishes the seamers would have stuck to their lines and lengths, despite the carnage and the top order getting some more runs.
