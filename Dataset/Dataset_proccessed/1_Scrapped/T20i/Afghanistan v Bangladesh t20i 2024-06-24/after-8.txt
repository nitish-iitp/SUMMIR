Goodbye for now!

We will leave you with those images of the beaming Afghan players celebrating an historic night, but before we do that, let’s have a quick recap of how the action unfolded:

Before the match started, Afghanistan were in a golden position to qualify for the semifinals after India beat Australia earlier in the day but given the tricky nature of the Arnos Vale surface, Afghanistan’s batting unit misfired and they ended up accumulating a subpar total of 115.

With Bangladesh needing to knock off the total in 12.1 overs in order to qualify for themselves, they had no choice but to go for it and they started brightly. But their attacking intent, in turn, provided the opening that Afghanistan needed.

Amid numerous rain interruptions the game swayed between both sides as Litton Das held fort for Bangladesh but Afghanistan kept making inroads at key intervals.

The men in blue eventually held their nerve to pull off one of the greatest victories in the history of the T20 World Cup and realised their greatest cricketing triumph with a place in the T20 World Cup 2024 semifinals.

They will now play South Africa in just over a day’s time in Trinidad and Tobago.

We hope you enjoyed our coverage of this fascinating encounter, and on behalf of Hafsa Adil, this is Rohan Sharma signing off for Al Jazeera.

Celebrations begin in Afghanistan

True to Rashid Khan’s words, the people of Afghanistan have begun celebrating their historic win by pouring out onto the streets in Kabul, Khost and Nangarhar.

It’s just past 10am in Afghanistan, so the locals will celebrate long into the day and perhaps until their team plays its semifinal on Wednesday night.

‘It’s something like a dream for us’

Winning captain Rashid was in a jubilant mood at the post-match presentation: “It’s something like a dream for us as a team.

“It is all about how we started the tournament. The belief came when we beat New Zealand.

“I have no words to describe my feelings.

“In our mind 130-135 was a good total. We were 15-20 runs short.

“In the end we spoke about mindset and how they were going to come at us.

“If we bowl into the stump we have a better chance of getting them out.

“We just had to be very clear in our planning and effort. Effort is always there in your hands.

“For the people back home, for their happiness, that was the kind of discussion we had. That made the job easier for us.

“In T20 we have a strong base. If your bowlers start well, it gives us [spinners] an opportunity to attack the middle order.

“It is going to be a massive celebration back home.”

All of us right now! 👊🤩

‘As a batting unit we made poor decisions’

Losing Bangladesh skipper Shanto had this to say at the post-match presentation: “We bowled really well. As a bowling unit we did a lot of good things.

“As a batting unit we made poor decisions, especially in the middle overs,” he said.

“First three wickets we went hard. If we lose early wickets, then we play normally.

“The middle order didn’t execute plans, so that was the main issue today.

“The whole tournamnet we bowled really well, especially Hossain.

As a fielding group we did a lot of good things and took a lot of good catches.

“As a batting unit we need to improve a lot, especially at the top of the order.”

A moment 14 years in the making

It has taken Afghanistan just 14 years from making their debut at any ICC Men’s World Cup – 50 or 20 overs – to entering the semifinals for the first time.

The men from the then war-torn country made their ICC T20 World Cup debut right here in the West Indies in 2010.

Fourteen years and six world cups later, here they are.

Up goes Trott

Oh look, even Jonathan Trott has been propped up on the shoulders and has broken into a hearty laugh!

The Afghanistan coach has done a commendable job with this group of players, lifting them up after a close run at the 50-over World Cup six months ago, and guiding them to the semifinals.

The former England batter has played a key role in masterminding their journey in the recent past.

‘These are the games where you never know what can happen’

For taking the final two wickets to end with figures of 4 for 26, Naveen is adjudged Player of the Match: “We have worked so hard over the past few years. We were dreaming and working for this day.

“When this day comes and happens, it’s a surreal experience. I am at a loss for words,” he said.

“We always knew they were going hard in the powerplay to chase the total down in 12.1 overs.

“We knew we were in the game as long as we picked up wickets.

“These are the games where you never know what can happen. The margin of error is very small.

“We had confidence that as long as we don’t give up easy runs and pick up wickets, we can win it.”

Lap of honour for Afghanistan

The Afghanistan players are not going to stop celebrating any time soon.

They have got Gurbaz, who was out injured, on their shoulders as they soak in the applause from the crowd and then applaud them in return.

There are huge smiles on the faces of the support staff.

Attan in the stands in the stands

The handful of Afghan fans who have braved the weather and start-stop nature of the match have broken out into the Afghan Attan dance in the stands.

They are dancing with joy and with abandon. The locals join in with their own moves.

It’s a party in the stands at Arnos Vale.
