Another historic day for Afghanistan cricket as they reach the semi-finals at a World Cup for the first time, and by doing so also end the highly-fancied Australia’s campaign.

Afghanistan will now face South Africa in the first semi-final in Tarouba, with India and England set to meet in Providence the following day.

Here is the full report on how a day of high drama played out:

Afghanistan skipper Rashid Khan is understandably grinning from ear to ear:

“It’s something of a dream for us as a team. It’s all about the way we have started the tournament, the belief came when we beat New Zealand. It’s unbelievable, I don’t have the words to describe my feelings.

“We were thinking 135 was a good total on this wicket, we were a few runs short. But it’s all about the mindset, we knew they were going to come at us to try to reach the target in 12.1 overs, so if we bowled straight we could take wickets.

Rashid is already casting an eye to the semi-final showdown in Trinidad and Tobago against South Africa:

“I’m sure it’s going to be a massive celebration back home. It’s a massive achievement for us. The country will be very proud (of us), being in the semi is big for us but now we have to go in with a very clear mind.”

Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto is having his say:

“We bowled really well. But as a batting group we made a lot of bad decisions especially in the middle overs. That cost us the match.

“The whole tournament we bowled very well, spinners and fast bowlers, including new bowler Rashid. I think there are a lot of things we can take forward. But as a batting group there is a lot we can work on, the top order didn’t make enough runs.”

Naveen-ul-Haq is named player of the match after taking 4-26 including the critical two wickets in what would have been the penultimate over to wrap up the match for Afghanistan.

Skipper Rashid Khan also claimed four scalps as Litton Das (54 no) carried his bat through the innings but ran out of partners as Bangladesh finished on 105 to fall eight runs short of their revised target.

“We knew they were going to go hard in the powerplay to chase the total down in 12.1 overs,” Naveen-ul-Haq said. “But we were in the game as long as we kept picking up wickets. We had confidence that this wasn’t a high-scoring wicket, so as long as we didn’t give away easy runs we knew we would have a chance.”

Afghanistan win by 8 runs (DLS) and are through to the semi-finals

Naveen-ul-Haq traps Mustafizur plumb in front to kick off wild celebrations among the Afghanistan players, staff and fans even as the decision is reviewed.

Replays show the ball missed the bat and there was no doubt which way the decision would fall from there.

That was one of the tightest and most ridiculously tense cricket matches imaginable, with the stakes at an all-time high for Afghanistan but they somehow got there in the end.

Bangladesh had moments with their noses in front in the race for a place in the semi-finals, and even once their hopes were dashed still looked set to play spoilsport against an opponent where there is no love lost.

The result of course means that Australia are knocked out of the T20 World Cup after back-to-back defeats in the Super Eight stage starting with a first-ever loss to eventual semi-finalists Afghanistan.

Edward Mackereth has kindly summed up the past nearly-five hours as well as anyone could: “Unbelievably good sport”.

As if there isn’t enough drama, the players are off the field yet again as the rain picks up immediately after Afghanistan claimed their ninth wicket.

Afghanistan are ahead by three runs on the DLS par score of 108, but just as crucially will be bowling to Bangladesh No 11 Mustafizur Rahman with two balls remaining in the over.

The grounds staff are barely on the field before heading straight back off as the rain clears quickly – play is about to resume yet again.

WICKET! Bangladesh 105-9 (Taskin b Naveen-ul-Haq 2)

Afghanistan are one wicket away from securing a semi-final berth, as a slower ball grabs an inside edge and crashes into the stumps.

17th over: Bangladesh 102-8 (Litton 52, Taskin 1) Bangladesh are taking this down to the wire with Litton and Taskin taking no risks. Four singles in the over including a leg bye, as there is a hopefully appeal from the last ball but it clearly missed Taskin’s edge.

Bangladesh (and Australia) need 12 runs from two overs; Afghanistan need two wickets.

16th over: Bangladesh 98-8 (Litton 50, Taskin 0) REVIEW! Noor Ahmed gets one to sneak through Litton Das and it crashes into his pads. The appeals are waved away, as the ball looks to have made impact outside the line. Replays show it missed the edge but would only have just brushed the stumps, and Litton survives thanks to the umpire’s call.

Fifty for Litton Das

The Bangladesh opener brings up his half-century in style with a sweep for four. It has taken him 41 balls with four boundaries and a six in a brave knock that will become one of his most memorable if he can steer Bangladesh home.

06.47 CEST

15th over: Bangladesh 94-8 (Litton 46, Taskin 0) Afghanistan have a semi-final spot within their grasp as they make headway into the Bangladesh tail but with Litton Das still standing in their way. Bangladesh are three runs behind the DLS par score of 97, but Litton finds a single off the last ball of the over to stay on strike with only 22 to get from four overs.

WICKET! Bangladesh 92-8 (Tanzim c Nabi b Naib 3)

Gulbadin Naib has made a miraculous return from the cramps he suffered from just as the rain fell earlier, banging in a short ball and finding a top edge from Tanzim Hasan Sakib to pull Afghanistan closer to victory.

06.42 CEST

14th over: Bangladesh 91-7 (Litton 44, Tanzim 3) Noor Ahmad continues and Litton Das has reined in his attack, finding two runs with a flick through midwicket but mostly unable to get the wrist-spinner away.

06.39 CEST

13th over: Bangladesh 88-7 (Litton 41, Tanzim 3) Bangladesh see the back of Rashid Khan as the maestro finishes with what looms as a match-defining 4-23. Afghanistan are trying to keep Tanzim Hasan Sakib on strike as much as possible but the required run-rate still looks achievable at 4.33.

12th over: Bangladesh 82-7 (Litton 37, Tanzim 1) The match has been well and truly shaken up during a rain delay. Afghanistan will now like their chances of securing a semi-final berth with only three wickets to grab and after edging ahead on the DLS par score. But Bangladesh can hold onto some hope of upsetting their rivals at least while Litton Das is still at the crease.

We’re back again but Bangladesh are now out of the running for a semi-final spot, with their goal now to win for pride and have a say in whether Afghanistan or Australia progresses to the next stage.

The target has been reduced to 114 runs (DLS) but Bangladesh only have a total of 19 overs to face.

The covers are back on and as it stands Afghanistan are going through to the semi-finals if play does not resume.

Bangladesh are now 81-7 from 11.4 overs but that leaves them two runs behind Afghanistan’s par score.

The call went out from the Afghanistan bench to slow the game down just as the rain started to fall, which sent Gulbadin Naib tumbling down at first slip like an arrow had struck him in the hamstring. It was a horrible piece of acting all round, and just the sort of thing that Mother Cricket tends not to like.

David Williams, in Canada, doesn’t seem to mind it:

“Not sure what is the funniest. The sudden hamstring injury while it’s raining and they’re ahead, or two Aussies on TV lecturing about the spirit of cricket. Johnny Bairstow would like a word …”

WICKET! Bangladesh 80-6 (Mahmudullah c Ishaq b Rashid 6)

Another twist in tale of this high-stakes clash as Rashid finds the faintest of edges off the inside of Mahmudullah’s bat. It takes convincing from the substitute keeper Mohammad Ishaq to send the decision for review, but it’s the right call as Afghanistan are back in the game.

10th over: Bangladesh 77-5 (Litton 34, Mahmudullah 5) That’s drinks and this match – and the semi-final hopes of Bangladesh, Afghanistan and even Australia – feels evenly poised. Noor Ahmad bowls five dot balls but Mahmudullah finds a boundary with a stylish drive through cover.

Bangladesh need 39 runs from 13 balls to qualify for to the semi-finals.

9th over: Bangladesh 73-5 (Litton 34, Mahmudullah 1) The margins are getting finer for both sides – as well as Australia watching on – as Rashid Khan picks up the wicket of Towhid Hridoy but Litton Das remains the batter who looks like deciding more than just this game. The opener pounds a four down the ground then follows up next ball by easing a clever boundary at third man.

06.07 CEST

8th over: Bangladesh 63-4 (Litton 26, Hridoy 14) The script flips again as Afghanistan show worrying signs of falling apart in the field. Hridoy gets a thick edge of Nabi and the ball flies sky-high, Farooqi gets under it but can’t hold onto the ball. Hridoy makes Afghanistan pay with back-to-back boundaries of the next two balls, the first from another top edge, then next from a more convincing slog sweep.

06.04 CEST

7th over: Bangladesh 51-4 (Litton 26, Hridoy 2) Rashid Khan brings Afghanistan right back into the game with a typically crafty over that includes a critical wicket. Bangladesh seem content to see off the spin magician’s remaining three balls, looking for singles while bringing up their fifty.

Bangladesh are currently four runs ahead on the DLS par score of 47 - but crucially that is only to win the match, not to progress to the semi-finals.

WICKET! Bangladesh 48-4 (Sarkar b Rashid 10)

Rashid Khan waits until the end of the powerplay before taking the ball then finds a way through Soumya Sarkar. The Bangladesh batter gets on the back foot but can’t get his bat down in time to a quicker delivery as he loses his stumps.

6th over: Bangladesh 46-3 (Litton 24, Sarkar 10) Afghanistan introduce spin for the first time in the innings as Mohammad Nabi marks out his run up. The veteran tweaker has both batters all tied up, only allowing three singles from a tidy over. Bangladesh end the powerplay with their eyes still very much on snatching a semi-final berth, now needing 70 runs in 37 balls or fewer to leapfrog both Afghanistan and Australia into second spot.

5th over: Bangladesh 43-3 (Litton 22, Sarkar 9) In good news – at least for Australia – we will now have a result out of this contest rather than Afghanistan edging through to the semi-finals if the points were shared. Bangladesh have started brightly since the heavens opened up, Litton Das uppercutting a wide ball over point for four. But Naveen-ul-Haq restricts the opener either side of that shot to only give up three more.

4th over: Bangladesh 36-3 (Litton 15, Sarkar 9) A reasonably long rain delay has only added more spice to this contest. Bangladesh pick up 12 runs in the over, either side of the break, even with only one boundary as Sarkar sends a straight delivery away through midwicket.

05.43 CEST

We’re back! And we still haven’t lost any time – or overs. But if there is another rain delay, the runs required and overs available to get them in will start to reduce.

05.29 CEST

Play is set to resume at 11:43pm local time (1:43pm AEST, 4:43am BST)

Bangladesh are currently just ahead on the DLS score, with Afghanistan’s par score after 3.2 overs on 29-3. But that is for Bangladesh to win the match, not to qualify for the semi-finals, and they still need to face five overs for this to be considered a result.

If we only get to five overs, Bangladesh need to have reached 35-3 to keep their noses in front, though that would hand the semi-final spot to Australia and no doubt break more than just Afghanistan hearts.

Rain has returned and the covers are back on. Any loss of overs will make it trickier for Bangladesh to reach their target quickly enough to give their net run-rate the required boost, but after a couple of minutes of heavy showers it has started to lighten up.

Bangladesh are 31-3 from 3.2 overs, at this stage still needing another 85 runs within 52 balls to set up a semi-final clash with South Africa – reaching their target in any more than that will see Australia progress.

But with rain falling it feels more and more like Mother Cricket is siding with Afghanistan today.

Najmul Hossain Shanto is not interested in hanging around, attacking Naveen at every opportunity and quickly paying a high price.

Fazalhaq again has the most wickets in the tournament, now with 16.

1st over: Bangladesh 13-0 (Litton 11, Tanzid 0) What a start for Bangladesh as they look to chase down 116 runs in 12.1 overs or fewer! A stroke of good luck helps get them moving as Litton Das swings hard through a drive, takes a thick edge over slip and the ball only needs one bounce to clear the rope. The opener connects sweetly with the next delivery, clobbering it over midwicket for a glorious SIX! Afghanistan’s worries are mounting up as keeper Gurbaz cops a heavy blow on his knee trying to block the last ball of the innings. He looks in significant discomfort and is helped from the field. Little is going right for Afghanistan at the moment, but they can at least keep looking to the skies for some timely assistance.

Play is about to resume in this tense, high-stakes, must-watch encounter between Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

The scenarios are still the same – Bangladesh reaching 116 runs in 12.1 overs will see them through, more than 12.4 overs (it’s complication) will bring joy for Australia.

But Afghanistan just need to defend their target to progress to the semi-finals.

David Bertram has enjoyed what he has seen, and rightly so, but doesn’t seem quite as elated with what he expects to happen from here:

“Evening, England fan. Fair play to the cricket bodies, giving associate teams time to develop has been a great call. Trott has done a great job and the more tight and tricky games we see the better. We all know the Australian team will get through and win mind. It’s what they do. David”

The covers are off and we’re now waiting for play to resume, as well as news on any recalculation of the required runs for Bangladesh and overs they might need to get them in. We haven’t lost too much time though, so hopefully there is no change yet.

In the meantime, here is Rashid Khan fuming as Karim Janat is too slow to take a second run and leaves his heavy-hitting skipper stranded at the non striker’s end in the last over of the Afghanistan innings.

Bangladesh need to reach the target in 12.1 overs

Afghanistan crawled to 115-5 to leave the door open for Bangladesh to snatch a spot in the semi-final – or for Australia to pick up the scraps.

Bangladesh will go through to the knockout stages if they reach their 116-run target in 12.1 overs or fewer, though they can also take three more balls if settling on the same score as Afghanistan then hitting the winning runs with a six.

Australia will qualify for the semi-finals if Bangladesh chase down their target but in more than 12.1 (or 12.4) overs.

Afghanistan’s preferred scenario is the same as when we started – win and they’re in!

But Rashid Khan’s side have a new pathway opening up, as rain starts to fall between innings and the covers are on. A washout would of course mean one point for each team, and be enough to lift Afghanistan into second spot. This has been a mouth-watering contest so far with the stakes sky high, so let’s at least hope for any outcome other than that.

While we wait for play to resume, enjoy Rashid’s glorious six to end the Afghanistan innings.

Afghanistan set Bangladesh 116 runs to win

Rashid Khan unleashes in the last over as Afghanistan add 15 valuable runs to reach 115-5. He starts with an uppercut over point for six, then picks up a single with a leading edge. But Rashid was looking for two to get back on strike, and when Janat doesn’t respond in time his skipper goes wild and throws his bat in his teammate’s direction. Janat sheepishly hands the willow back mid-pitch, but Rashid is still fuming as he makes his way back to the non striker’s end. Rashid gets back on strike for the last ball of the innings and sends it almost out of the ground with a monster six.
