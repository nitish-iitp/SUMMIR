Bound by mutual respect: SKY and Rashid Khan praise each other’s impact
Two of the standout performers in Thursday’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup fixture between India and Afghanistan were full of praise for one another, with Suryakumar Yadav and Rashid Khan both name-checking the other in their post-match interviews.

India batter SKY put in a player of the match display with an inspired 53 from 28 balls to help lift his side to a winning total of 181/8.

But perhaps the No.4’s most significant impact was in how he negotiated and took runs of Afghanistan’s key bowler, hitting 16 runs off the six deliveries he faced from Rashid Khan.

And speaking after the match, the world’s top-ranked T20I batter said that he was aware of the need to dominate against a player he describes as the world’s best bowler.

“When he bowls it’s very difficult to pick him, so I know what shots I want to play when I am inside,” SKY said.

“The best bowler in the world, you can’t let him dominate, you have to be a step ahead. But yeah I’m happy to be on a better side today.”

One particularly notable on-field interaction between the two players came when the bowler asked SKY to stop sweeping him, making a joking reference to the shot that helped India’s POTM dominate their mini-battle.

And speaking in his media conference, Rashid Khan was full of praise for his opponent's ability to control matches:

“In the middle overs Suryakumar came in, that’s how he plays, he changed the tempo of the game.

“I think that’s something which makes him the unique player: he believes in his skills, it doesn’t matter where he plays, whatever the conditions, that’s how much belief he has in his skills.”

India’s win puts them in a strong early position after the opening game of Group 1 of the Super Eights, with matches against Bangladesh and Australia to come.

Afghanistan will hope for a better showing with the bat in their next game against Australia, having fallen well short of their target of 182, being bowled out for 134.
