1.40am What a game of cricket! A fittingly thrilling end to the Super Eight stage. And Afghanistan, who couldn't register a single win in the last edition of the T20 World Cup, now find themselves in the semi-finals of a World Cup for the first time, with Australia bowing out. You can read all about how this thriller went down in S Sudarshanan's report. There will be plenty more coverage from the match, and in the build-up to the semi-finals, so keep checking in. For now, on behalf of Madushka, Sudeep and everyone else at ESPNcricinfo, it's Abhimanyu signing off.

Rashid Khan: "It's a dream for us to be in the semi-finals. The way we started the tournament, the belief came when we beat New Zealand. It's unbelievable. The only guy who put us inthe semi-finals was Brian Lara and we proved him right. When we met him at a welcome party, I told him we won't let you down. We thought 130-135 was a good score but we fell 15 runs short. We knew they would come hard at us and we knew that is what we could take advantage of. We didn't need to do anything extra, just be clear in our plans. We wanted to make people back home happy, that was the discussion we had and everyone did a wonderful job. [On the new ball bowlers] In T20s if you get a good start, it helps us in the middle overs. They have given great starts to us in the whole competition. It makes it easier for us to go harder at the batsmen. They have delivered, they were very clear in their minds. [On the Gulbadin situation] Rain is something not in our hands but mentally we knew we have to play 20 overs and take 10 wickets. That's the only way we could win. But Gulbadin he had some cramps. But his wicket was invaluable to us. It's a massive celebration back home. It's a big achievement for us as well. We have done that at U-19 level but at this World Cup, I don't have any words to describe the feeling back home. We have to go into the semis with a very clear mind and make sure we enjoy the occasion." He signs off with a message in Pashto.

Najmul Hossain Shanto: "I think we bowled really well. As a bowling unit we did a lot of good things. But as a batting unit we made some poor decisions specially in the middle overs. Normal plan was first three wickets we go hard, especially in the first six overs, and if we lose early wickets we play normally. But we didn't execute that. Whole tournament we bowled really well, especially Rishad the new guy came and bowled really well, I am really happy for him. As a fielding team we did a lot of good things, took really good catches. As a batting unit we really need to improve a not. Going forward we need to think about our batting. [On the rain delays] It happened but we can't make excuses. Also with the ball getting wet it was coming on nicely so that was a good thing."

1.20am In 2009, Mohammad Nabi was playing in Buenos Aires in the ICC WCL Division 3. Today, he is headed for a World Cup semi-final! And he is part of an Afghanistan dance in the middle, and why shouldn't he be?!

What a match, what high drama. In the middle of this was, of course, Gulbadin Naib who went down with an apparent cramp when rain was coming on. But he was soon back on the field and bowling! Read all about it here.

So, who will Afghanistan face in their maiden World Cup semi-final? This is how the semi-finals look.

Kiruba: "As a South African fan, I am happy." Famous last words...?

Kishore : "How long since Aussies did not qualify for knock-out stage in an ICC Event?" Well, it's been a whole two years. They failed to make the semis in the 2022 T20 World Cup, so not all that long back!

Mohd Waji : "Why is Rashid not POTM?" That is a good question. His three sixes helped Afghanistan get a respectable total and then his spell in the middle really broke the game open. And that's why he is ESPNcricinfo's MVP!

Player of the match is Naveen-ul-Haq: "We have worked so hard over the past few years and we were dreaming and working for this day. I'm lost for words. [On his spell] We always knew that they were going hard in the powerplay to chase the total down in 12.1 overs so we knew we were in the game as long as we kept picking wickets. We had confidence that these wickets are not high-scoring wickets. As long as we don't give easy runs we knew we would have a chance."

Amey: "3 times Afganistan were on hat-trick. That shows how they have made comebacks regularly."

Ashish: "So one of SA or AFG will have a shot at first WC trophy, this is amazing and special for both of them."

1.10amGurbaz is in tears, there are hugs all over and Afghanistan are in a World Cup semi-final for the first time! What a thriller. Afghanistan would have felt they scored below par, and then got wickets, but Litton Das, who has carried his bat, kept Bangladesh well above the asking rate. Rashid Khan's magnificent burst in the middle overs then set Bangladesh back, while rain kept DLS scores in play with multiple delays. In the end, Litton kept losing partners and Afghanistan, despite a few dropped chances, seal a historic win! Rashid finishes with four, Naveen with another four-for after his spell against Australia. His two in the opening spell were key. There will be some broken Australian hearts as well, who are knocked out with this result.

Kiran: "So that inning from Gurbaz, slow as it was, was worth it's weight in gold. Same for the 19/10 by Rashid in the end. Potm for sure"

Naveen-ul-Haq to Mustafizur, OUT

He traps him and UP GOES THE FINGER! Afghanistan players race off in celebration, but Bangladesh have reviewed. It looked plumb. Was there an inside edge though? Nope, and that's red on all three! Length ball angles in from outside off and raps him right in front of middle. Afghanistan are through to the semis!

Naveen-ul-Haq to Taskin, OUT
