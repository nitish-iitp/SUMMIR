Betfred have been in business for over 50 years and ventured online with the launch of Betfred.com in 2004. The brand is one of the most recognised in the betting industry, having over 1,500 land-based betting shops and providing customers with an excellent online service.

New customers can claim the Betfred Sign Up Offer from which they can get £50 worth of free bets.

Betfred Sign Up Offer

Register an account at Betfred today through the website or Betfred App and you can receive £50 in free bets when placing your first bet on sports.

Claiming the Betfred sign up offer is simple and requires you to place just one qualifying bet to receive the free bets. Follow the steps below to get started.

If you don’t currently have an account with Betfred, you’ll need to create one. Simply click on the button below to visit Betfred.com and enter your details into the registration form.

It’s important that you enter a Betfred promo code on the registration form. This will opt you into the welcome offer. The promo code to use for this promotion is BETFRED50.

After registering using the Betfred promo code, make a deposit of at least £10. You’ll need at least this amount to place your qualifying bet with. Deposits made via prepaid Visa’s and Mastercard’s or e-Wallets will not qualify for this promotion so we recommend using a valid debit card.

Next, you need to place a qualifying bet. You can choose to bet on any sport you like but you need to make sure that the odds are Evens (2.0) or greater and that the stake is at least £10.

Betfred Free Bets

Once your qualifying bet has settled, Betfred will credit your account with the following:

3 x £10 to use on any Sportsbook Markets
2 x £10 to use on Accumulators (4+ selections)

That’s £50 in free sports bets!

Your free bets will be available to be used immediately on any sports in the Betfred Sportsbook. Simply add a selection to your bet slip and select the free bet to use it as the stake for your bet rather than cash.

Any winnings, minus the free bet stake, will be paid as cash.

Betfred Promo Code

As mentioned above, a Betfred promo code is required to claim the sign up offer. New customers must enter the bonus code BETFRED50 on the registration form to be eligible to receive the free bets once they have placed a qualifying bet.
