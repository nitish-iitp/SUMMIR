NRG Bet is a new betting site that has been launched by the team associated with Rhino.bet. Like Rhino, NRG Bet uses the Playbook platform which is one of the most popular betting platforms at the moment and used by several other online bookies and casinos including BetZone, Betarno, AKBETS and DragonBet.

We’ll be taking a look at the NRG Bet sign up offer for new customers and also providing a full review of the betting site to show you what’s on offer in terms of sports betting, markets, odds, casino games and more.

NRG Bet Sign Up Offer

If you’re interested in betting with this new bookie, you may be wondering what the NRG Bet welcome offer is.

Head directly to NRG Bet and you may not see a new customer offer available. However, visit the site via one of the links on this page and you’ll be able to get your hands on a £10 free bet when you place your first bet on sports!

WhichBookie is happy to reveal we have been able to secure a NRG Bet new customer offer which can be claimed by all new customers opening an account via one of the links on this page and using the NRG Bet promo code b20g10.

If you don’t have an account with NRG Bet yet, click here to be taken to their website where you’ll see the sign up offer promoted.

Enter your email address and a password for your account along with the NRG Bet bonus code b20g10 if it not pre-populated.

After opening your account, make a deposit of £20 or more. You’ll need at least this amount to qualify for the free bet.

Next, find a bet to place at odds of Evens (2.0) or above. There are plenty of sports to choose from at NRG Bet including Horse Racing, Football, Greyhounds, Golf, Tennis, Rugby, and Snooker.

To qualify for the £10 free bet, you must place a bet with a stake of £20 or more.

NRG Bet Free Bet

As soon as your qualifying bet has settled, regardless of whether it is a winner or a loser, a £10 free bet will be credited to your account automatically.

Once your free bet has been credited to your account, you will have 7 days to use it before it expires. You can use your NRG free bet on any sport, event or market in the sportsbook.

Free bets are easy to use at NRG Bet. Just add a selection to your bet slip as you would generally and then select the free bet before placing your bet.

NRG Bet Promo Code

If you want to claim the free bet as part of the sign up offer then you will need to enter a NRG Bet promo code. There is a box on the registration form to enter the bonus code and opt into the promotion. The latest NRG promo code should already be in the box if you are clicking through to the website from this page but if it isn’t, enter the offer code b20g10.

NRG Bet Site Review

NRG is a betting site that was launched in the early stages of 2024. The brand comes from the team over at Rhino.bet and so you can expect a very similar service given NRG is using the same betting platform.

Both sports betting and an online casino is available to customers at NRG.bet and we’ll be taking a closer look at both products so that you can decide whether or not you’d like to bet with them.

NRG Bet Sports Betting

Just 19 sports are available to bet on with NRG. That’s quite a few less than the 30+ that are listed on bet365, and the 40+ that you’ll find on Aspire Global betting sites. However, the number of sports shouldn’t necessarily put you off unless you’re looking to bet on the likes of Chess, Squash, Fustal or Badminton. Where NRG Bet may be able to help you is if you bet on Football, Horse Racing, Golf, Boxing, Darts, Greyhounds, or other popular UK sports. All of those sports and more are all available to bet on which means the vast majority of UK punters will be satisfied.

There shouldn’t be many complaints about the betting markets either. You’ll find Bet Builders, Handicaps, and lots more for various sports.

All sports that you can bet on with NRG Bet are listed below.

NRG Sports
American Football	Golf	Rugby Union
Baseball	Greyhounds	Snooker
Basketball	Horse Racing	Tennis
Boxing	Ice Hockey	TV / Specials
Cricket	MMA	Volleyball
Darts	Politics	
Football	Rugby League	
NRG Bet Odds

Like Rhino.bet and other bookies using the Playbook platform, the odds available at NRG Bet are very competitive.

Upon comparing NRG Bet odds with the prices at the likes of William Hill and bet365, we found many to be better at NRG. No bookmaker will offer the best odds on every occasion but if you’re looking for a bookie that consistently has good prices, NRG is a good choice.

NRG Bet Betting Offers

One area that NRG Bet currently falls short in is with their range of betting offers. Currently, there are no promotions available at NRG which means no free bets, no Best Odds Guaranteed, and no Extra Places. We are hoping that when/if NRG Bet release a betting offer, it will come alongside more promotions that existing customers can take advantage of.

NRG Bet Casino

Sports betting is the main focus at NRG Betet but customers do have access to the NRG casino. There isn’t a huge selections of games available but if you enjoy playing the occasional hand of blackjack, a spin of the roulette wheel, or trying your luck on some slot games, the game catalogue should be sufficient.

Table games include Blackjack, Roulette and Baccarat, and so long as you’re not looking for multiple variations of the games, you should find something to play.

For slots players, games are provided by Leap Gaming and Pragmatic Play. Having games from just two developers does limit the choice of games but both have released multiple popular slot titles over recent years which you’ll find available in the NRG Casino.

NRG Bet Customer Service

The NRG Bet website has four support options listed. However, with three of them being via social media, we recommend getting in touch with the customer service team via email.

Email response times are generally very quick with replies expected within 24 hours.

NRG Bet Deposits & Withdrawals

Customers at NRG.bet are able to fund their accounts via Debit Card, Cheque or Bank Transfer. All transactions are without charges and withdrawals are processed very quickly with funds expected to reach you bank account within 1-3 days.

Unfortunately, popular banking options such as PayPal, Skrill, Paysafe card and Neteller are not currently available at NRG Bet.

Conclusion

NRG Bet is still in infancy and we’re expecting a lot more from the brand as we move through 2024. We found nothing wrong with the site and think that the list of sports, markets, and standard of odds, are all very acceptable. However, there is room for improvement in many areas.

A welcome offer would be appreciated by new customers and a handful of promotions would please existing customers. We’d also like to see a larger selection of casino games which currently, is a little on the short side.

However, if you’re simply looking for a new betting site that you can do some no-frills betting with, NRG Bet is a good choice.
