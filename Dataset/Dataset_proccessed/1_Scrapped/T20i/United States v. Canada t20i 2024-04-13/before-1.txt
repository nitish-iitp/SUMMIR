DragonBet is a family run independent bookmaker that only recently launched online in 2022. However, the company behind DragonBet dates back over half a century as it is the digital brand of popular bookie John Lovell Racing which has been a prominent on-course bookmaker that was the first in the UK to computerise it’s racecourse offering.

DragonBet offers betting on over 20 different sports with hundreds of events covered each day. Customers can take advantage of competitive prices as well as regular ‘DragonBoosts’ which are enhanced prices on selected events and markets.

DragonBet Sign Up Offer

Currently, DragonBet doesn’t have a sign up offer available. However, we are expecting one in the near future and as soon as an offer is released, we’ll update this page with full details of how to claim it.

DragonBet Promo Code

When a DragonBet sign up offer was available, mew customers did need to enter a promo code in order to receive the free bets. We expect this to be the case when a new DragonBet welcome offer is released.

When you have a valid DragonBet promo code, it should be entered on the registration form when you open your new account.

DragonBet Free Bet

Although we won’t know for sure until the offer is released, when a DragonBet new customer offer becomes available, we expect it to consist of free bets. Past DragonBet welcome offers have been ‘Bet X Get X’ offers and any new one is likely to be similar.

DragonBet Review

DragonBet launched in 2022 but brings with it the history and reputation of John Lovell Racing.

John was a bookmaker for 50 years and opened his first betting shop in Cardiff back in 1968 with his business partner Norman Morris.

He grew his betting empire by opening a total of 12 shops across Wales and had pitches at Cheltenham and Chepstow racecourses.

John Lovell is considered a pioneer in the betting industry after being the first to computerise betting at British racecourses after bringing the idea over from Australia where they had a similar successful system in place.

After being elected chairman of the Welsh Bookmakers’ Association and director of the National Association of Bookmakers in 1993, he led the digital switchover in the UK.

John Lovell Racing was also the first bookmaker to offer customers betting in-shop by both over-the-counter wagers and via betting terminals which are commonly used today.

After passing in 2013, Johns legacy continues via his son James Lovell and the companies new venture, DragonBet.

Sports Betting

As mentioned earlier, DragonBet has a big focus on Welsh sport but they offer pre-match and in-play betting across worldwide sporting events.

DragonBet partnered with FansUnite who supplied them with their Chameleon iGaming platform which allows customers to bet on the following sports:

DragonBet Sports
American Football	Darts	Rugby
Aussie Rules	Football	Snooker
Badminton	Golf	Table Tennis
Baseball	Greyhounds	Tennis
Basketball	Handball	Volleyball
Bowls	Horse Racing	Waterpolo
Boxing	Ice Hockey	
Cricket	MMA	

A total of 22 sports are available to bet on which isn’t the largest selection we’ve come across but all of the most popular sports are covered and it’s great to see horse racing and greyhounds available which are often missing from newly launched bookies.

If you visit any sport category on the DragonBet website, you’ll find that there is a dedicated section for Welsh fixtures if there are any upcoming events.

For example, in the Football section, you find betting markets and odds for matches Welsh League Cup matches under the Welsh tab which is nice touch for local customers.

Horse Racing

Dragonbet has emerged as one of the top horse racing bookies. Not only do they cover races taking place in the UK, Ireland, France, and further afield. They also have some great horse racing promotions available that sets Dragonbet apart from even the bigger bookies.

Best Odds Guaranteed

Best Odds Guaranteed used to be a very common racing promotion. Although it’s still available with some betting sites, some of the big brands such as Betfair, have removed it from their offering.

Dragonbet Best Odds Guaranteed is available on all UK & Irish horse races. Simply place a bet from 10.30am on the day of an eligible race and if the starting price is greater than the price you took, Dragonbet will settle your bet at the bigger odds if it wins.

BOG at Dragonbet applies to both singles & multiples, on race winner markets only.

The only downside to Best Odds Guaranteed with Dragonbet is that the maximum additional winnings per bet is limited to £250. This may not be an issue for the vast majority of people but is worth keeping in mind if you are betting at high stakes.

Lucky 15 Bonuses

We mentioned that several bookmakers have removed Best Odds Guaranteed, but an even rarer promotion these days are Lucky 15 bonuses. However, they’re available with Dragonbet on all UK & Irish racing.

Not only are bonuses available on Lucky 15s, but also on Lucky 31s & Lucky 63s.

Lucky 15 (4 selections, 15 bets)- 10% bonus on winnings
Lucky 31 (5 selections, 31 bets)- 15% bonus on winnings
Lucky 63 (6 selections, 63 bets)- 20% bonus on winnings

The above bonuses are awarded if all selections in your multiple win. However, Dragonbet also award customers with Double Odds should just one selection win.

Betting Odds

When we review a new bookmaker at WhichBookie, we often compare the odds on offer to those of some of the more established bookies that are known for good odds.

We compared the odds available at DragonBet to those offered by Bet365 for various sports and found that they held up extremely well.

For football, DragonBet were offering the same prices or higher in many occasions on Premier League betting markets.

Horse racing odds also matched well although we did find Bet365 to be offering slightly more value on certain runners.

Promotions

Currently, there aren’t too many DragonBet promotions to take advantage of. The lack of a welcome offer is a slight disappointment but they do offer Money Back if 2nd on all races taking place at Welsh racecourses which does set them apart from other bookies in that department.

We recommend visiting the DragonBet website to view the latest promotions which will be advertised on the banners found on the homepage.

DragonBet Casino

As well as operating as a sportsbook, online customers at DragonBet have access to their online casino.

As the main focus of the brand is sports betting, the casino offering is lacking somewhat in terms of selection of games. However, the casino is a great addition to the site and the range of games should be enough to satisfy the more casual casino player.

Roulette and Blackjack are the two available table games in the casino and there are 50 different online slots to choose from with some familiar titles such as Deal or No Deal Megaways, Book of Itza, Buffalo Power Hold and Win, Pot O’ Gold, Hot Wild 7’s and others.

Customer Service

Support is available to both customers and those yet to register an account via email and live chat.

We were connected to live chat within a few seconds of the request and the support agent was extremely helpful and quick to respond.

If you would rather get in touch via email, you can use the on-site contact form which can be accessed via the ‘Contact Us’ link in the footer of the website.
