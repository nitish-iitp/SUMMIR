Types of Free Bets

Not all  free bet offers are the same and so it’s important to understand the different types available so that you know what you’re getting when claiming an offer.

Matched Bets

Many bookmakers will offer customers a free bet to the value of their first bet, or a ‘matched bet’. For example, if you signed up to a bookmaker, deposited and bet £10, you would receive a £10 free bet. If you deposited and bet £20, you would receive a £20 free bet. There is usually a limit to the maximum free bet amount you can receive so take this into account when you are placing your qualifying bet.

Risk-Free Bets

Many bookmakers run ‘risk-free bet’ promotions, not to be confused with no deposit free bets. These are when you are required to place a bet and if it loses, the bookie will refund your stake as a free bet. Technically, they’re not risk-free as you’re receiving your stake back as a free bet rather than cash. However, usually, they are still a very good offer and worth taking advantage of as they have value.

Mobile Free Bets

These are simply ones that must be used or qualified for by using a mobile device. The popularity of online betting using mobile devices has increased in recent years and some bookmakers which to become the leading mobile operators and so push mobile-only offers more than others.

Deposit Bonus

Deposit bonuses are a relatively common type of bookmaker offer but work a little differently. With deposit bonuses, when you open an account and make your first deposit, the bookie will instantly increase the balance of your account by the specified amount. That means you don’t have to place a bet first.

For example, let’s say a bookie was offering a 100% deposit bonus up to £50. You would open your account and make your first deposit. If you chose to deposit £25, the bookie would double your balance to £50. If you deposited £50, they’d double it to £100.

However, you would not simply be able to withdraw that £100 straight away. There would normally be a “turnover requirement.” This means you would need to bet the bonus amount a certain number of times before it (and any profits made from those bets) can be withdrawn.

Double/Treble Odds & Profit Boosts

This is a new type of sign up offer and works very differently to the previous types listed above. Instead of giving you a free bet, the bookmaker offers to double or treble the odds on the first bet you place. Or sometimes it might apply to your first two or even three bets. With double or treble odds, if you win any of these bets, you get two or three times as much profit as you would otherwise have made.

Bet Insurance

Some bookmakers offer bet insurance via either sign up offers or promotions for existing customers. Quite simply, if your first bet loses they give you your money back.

Usually, this type of offer gives your money back as a free bet. This means you can’t withdraw it, you need to bet it again. Any profits made using that free bet can be withdrawn as usual. Likewise, if your first bet wins, you can withdraw the profits just like with any normal bet.

List Of Bookies That Offer Free Bets

It’s harder to find a bookmaker not offering free bets to new customers than one that is. The vast majority of online bookies give free bets in some form to new customers as an incentive to sign up and bet with them. It’s not uncommon to see offers such as Bet 10 Get 50, Bet 10 Get 20 along with others. Even in the rare case of a betting site not having a sign up offer, they all generally run promotions throughout the week which usually include free bet offers.

Here are some of our top recommended bookies that offer free bets and other promotions on a regular basis:

Free Bet Bookmakers
VirginBet	Betfred	Bet365
William Hill	BetVictor	BetZone
BetUK	Coral	Fafabet
Midnite	Unibet	LiveScore Bet
RhinoBet	BetGoodwin	10Bet
Boylesports	Bzeebet	DAZN Bet
How To Claim A Free Bet

So now we’ve shown you which bookies offer the best free bets, let’s take a quick look at how to claim them. The process can vary depending on the bookie and the offer so be sure to read the terms and conditions on the bookmakers website carefully.

1. Create an Account

To claim a sign up offer, the first step will always be to create a new account. This process generally only takes a couple of minutes and requires you to enter details such as your name, address and date of birth.

2. Check if a Promo Code is Needed

Some bookmakers require customers to enter a specific promo code or bonus code in order to participate in a promotion and claim a free bet. If a promo code is required, it will be stated in the T&Cs of the offer. Be sure to check if the code needs to be entered on the registration form or when you deposit to ensure that you don’t miss out on your bonus.

3. Make a Deposit

The vast majority of bookie sign up offers require customers to make a deposit. The amount that you deposit may determine how the value of your free bet so check and make sure that you understand what the offer is and how much you need to deposit in order to claim it.

4. Place a Bet

The next, and usually last step, is to place a qualifying bet which is usually required to receive the free bet. When doing so, check the T&Cs for any minimum odds requirements and whether or not you have to bet on a specific sports, event or market in order to qualify.

5. Receive Your Free Bet

Depending on the offer, you should receive your free bet once your qualifying bets have settled. Usually, free bets are credited automatically within 24 hours but sometimes you may have to manually claim them either from within your account or by contacting the support team at the bookmaker.

Verification Documents

Due to regulations set by the UK Gambling Commission, some bookmakers may require you to provide copies of certain documents to verify your identity. Not all bookmakers will request these documents but it’s a good idea to have copies of them available so that you can verify your account promptly.

The most common types of documentation that is requested by betting sites are:

Driving Licence (Proof of Identity)
Passport (Proof of Identity)
Utility Bill (Proof of Address)
Bank Statement (Proof of Address)
Copy of Debit Card (Proof of Payment)

Some bookmakers have dedicated verification sections of their website which allows customers to upload their documents. Others request the documents via email.

Once sent, verification usually takes between 1-3 days but can depend on the betting site.

Proof of Earnings

A more recent request from some betting sites is proof of earnings. Again, this is due to regulations set by the UK Gambling Commission in a bid to reduce the number of problem gamblers by limiting deposits from players who may not be able to afford the amount they are gambling.

When requested, a copy of a bank statement is usually required.

Free Bets Terms And Conditions

As with any promotional deal, there are always terms and conditions attached. These are usually pretty standard, and will explain what you need to do to get your bonus, when it will be awarded, how long it lasts and how to use it.

For each offer listed on this page, we’ve included the significant Ts & Cs in line with UK legislation. The full terms will be visible when you visit the relevant bookmaker’s website, after you click the claim button.

You will be able to read them all in full before deciding whether you want to go ahead and open an account, and we’d advise you to spend a couple of minutes doing so. That way you know exactly how the deal works, and there will be no surprises down the line.

How To Use A Free Bet

Again this depends on the bookmaker. Normally, as soon as you’ve qualified, your freebet token is added to your account automatically. So when you come to place your next wager, the betslip will have the option to use your token as a stake, instead of taking the money from your account balance.

This is an example of how it would look at Bet365. By checking the option that says “Use Bet Credits” you choose to place the bet with your free balance, not with your cash balance. This option would only appear when you have free bets available in your account.

For other bookies the wording may differ slightly but the principle is always the same. It is pretty straightforward, but if you are unsure of anything, you can always get in touch with the bookie’s support team via live chat or email.

Bookie Promo Codes

Some bookmakers do require a promo code, and others don’t. If a code is required, it will be displayed in the table above. Simply type the code into the relevant box when you’re signing up for your new account. Or better still, copy and paste to make sure you don’t make any typos.

If no promo code is displayed in the table, it means you don’t need one.

Which Bookies Offer Free Bets To Existing Customers?

All of the bonuses listed above are for new customers only, so you can only claim them once per person. However, some bookmakers have loyalty schemes where existing customers can claim regular free bookie bets. There are also regular betting offers for existing customers available at numerous bookmakers.

Top Bookies For Betting Offers
	Betfred	Visit
	Virgin Bet	Visit
	Bet365	Visit
	Fafabet	Visit
	William Hill	Visit
	BetUK	Visit
	LiveScore Bet	Visit
	Midnite	Visit

All of the above give you the opportunity to claim regular bonuses even after you’ve signed up. These sort of offers are not available at all bookies, and they are well worth taking advantage of. They offer an incredible opportunity to continue to profit from the bookies money, long after the initial welcome bonus has been used. Again, there is no reason why you can’t join them all.

Free Bets UK

There are hundreds of free bets available for UK customers at a range of online bookmakers. The bookies which we list here on WhichBookie are all licenced by the UK Gambling Commission which gives a better indication that the site is trustworthy. However, there are many other areas which a bookie can be strong or weak in and so please always read our full bookie reviews and do your research before signing up to claim the offers.

Free Bets No Deposit 2024

There are some bookmakers that offer no deposit free bets. You can claim these without having to make a deposit or place a qualifying bet. There aren’t many of these about and they are usually for relatively small amounts. However, they are still worth claiming as they are essentially a risk-free chance of winning money.

Sporting Events

Free bet offers are available on a daily basis across a range of bookmakers but we see an increased number of offers available during major sporting events. Below are some events to keep an eye out for throughout the year when there will be more free bet offers available.

Cheltenham Free Bets

The annual Cheltenham Festival takes place in March and several online bookies are expected to run an increased number of betting offers in the run-up and throughout the festival. Here at WhichBookie, we have put together a comprehensive Cheltenham Festival section which contains information about the festival, betting tips for every race taking place and a list of Cheltenham Free Bets which you can take advantage of.

Grand National Free Bets

The Grand National is the biggest and most prestigious horse race in the world, attracting hundreds of millions pounds worth of bets on the single race taking place at Aintree in April. Because so much money is wagered on the race, bookmakers offer a large number of Grand National free bets and betting offers to attract business. We have put together a Grand National section here at WhichBookie which lists all of the latest Grand National betting offers, Grand National betting tips and everything you need to know about the race.

World Cup Free Bets

The 2026 World Cup will take place across 16 cities in Canada, Mexico, and the United States and is set to be the biggest sporting event of the year.

National teams from all around the world will battle it out in North America and there are high hopes for Gareth Southgate’s England following finishing 3rd in the 2018 World Cup, 2nd at Euro 2020 and reaching the Quarter-finals of Qatar 2022.

With the World Cup being one of the most popular sporting events ever, we can expect an increased number of betting offers available from bookies around the time of the tournament as they attempt to attract new customers and retain existing ones.

Several enhanced  sign up offers will be available as well as regular ‘bet & get’ promotions, refunds, money back specials, price boosts and more.

An official date for the 2026 World Cup has yet to be announced but we’ll be listing all of the best betting offers here on WhichBookie as well as providing World Cup betting tips for all of the matches once they have been released.

Free Bets For Euro 2024

This summer brings us Euro 2024 which will run for 1 month from 14th June through to 14th July. The event will be hosted in Germany who won the tournament when hosted in England back in 1996.

Euro 2024 is set to be the biggest football event of the year and many of us will be looking to have a punt on the tournament winner, top goalscorer, and individual match markets.

If you are planning on having a bet on Euro 2024, it’s a good idea to see what betting offers are available at the time. Several bookmakers will be offering free bets for Euro 2024 along with price boosts, refund offers, and more. Taking advantage of these promotions can significantly increase your overall returns throughout the tournament.

Along with providing Euro 2024 betting tips for every game this summer, we’ll also be sharing the best free bet offers, enhanced odds, and every other Euro 24 offer that we can find.

Premier League Free Bets

The Premier League spans August to May and although it’s not a short-term sporting event, it does attract a number of valuable betting offers. Every week, we see a number of bookmakers offer free bets, price boosts and refunds on Premier League matches and some can be extremely profitable.

Here at WhichBookie, we list the best Premier League free bet offers which are available each week.

Sportsbooks With Sign Up Bonuses

If you’re looking for a sportsbook sign up bonus then you’re in the right place. We have over 100 different sportsbook bonuses available that can be claimed when you open an account. In most cases, you will be required to either make a deposit or place a bet in order to receive the bonus from the sportsbook but with free bets of £50 and above available from some brands, they’re definitely worth claiming.

Not all sportsbook sign up bonsuses are the same. Some will vary in size, some will require a higher deposit or bet in order to receive them, and some have wagering requirements attached to the bonus. However, every step of the process along with every term and condition is detailed on our free bet pages. We’ll let you know what you need to do to claim the sportsbook bonus offers and whether or not we think they’re a good deal for new customers.

With the final group stage fixtures being played this week, knockout games will get underway on Saturday. Heading into the week, Switzerland, Germany, Spain and Portugal have confirmed fixtures & dates with the remaining participants being confirmed by Wednesday evening.

All eyes are on England who are the defending champions, having beaten Pakistan in the 2022 final. They finished 2nd in Group B behind Australia, confirming their place in the Super 8s. They head into the week after beating the United States, finishing 2nd in Group 2 and confirming their place in the semi-finals of the competition.

Keep a look out for cricket price boosts, money back specials and other offers listed here on WhichBookie.

What Is A Free Bet?

A free bet is a type of promotion offered by bookmakers and betting sites. It allows customers to place a bet without risking their own money.

Typically, a bookmaker will offer a free bet as a welcome bonus for new customers or as a promotion to existing customers. To qualify for a free bet, customers must usually meet certain requirements, such as placing a qualifying bet or depositing a minimum amount of money into their account.

Once the requirements have been met, the customer will receive a free bet which can be used to place a wager on a specific event or market. If the bet wins, the customer will receive the winnings, but not the stake. If the bet loses, the customer does not lose any of their own money.

It’s important to note that free bets often come with terms and conditions, such as expiry dates or restrictions on which markets the free bet can be used on. So, it’s essential to read the terms and conditions carefully before claiming or using a free bet.

Are Free Bets Really Free?

Although you get to place a bet without using your own cash, you usually have to qualify to receive a free bet. This generally involves placing a bet and risking your own cash first.

How Many New Account Offers Can I Claim?

There is no limit to the number of bookmakers that you can have an account with. So every bookmaker you have not yet joined means another bonus you can still claim!

Remember it only takes 2 minutes to open an account. Work your way through the list and take advantage of every bonus you can.

Can You Withdraw Free Bets?

When you are awarded a free bet, you cannot immediately withdraw it as cash. You must first use the free bet as a stake for a bet and then withdraw the winnings if your bet wins.

It’s important to note that in most cases, the free bet stake will not be included in the returns and only the winnings.

Can You Cash Out On A Free Bet?

Usually, bets placed using free bets cannot be cashed out. This is mainly to stop customers from placing the bet and cashing out immediately to convert the funds into cash.

Do Free Bets Expire?

The bookie will determine when and if free bets with them expire. Usually, free bets do have an expiration date which can be between 1 day and several weeks from them being credited to your account. However, free bets with some bookmakers such as SkyBet have no expiry.

What Can You Use Free Bets On?

Usually, you’ll be able to use your free bet on any sport or market. However, with some offers, the free bets will only be valid on specific sports, markets or events.

You should also check to see if the free bet has minimum or maximum odds requirements. eg. It may have to be used on a bet at odds of 1/2 or greater or 5/1 or above.

Do You Get Your Stake Back From Free Bets?

Whenever a free bet is given by an online bookie, you will usually see something like “free bet stake not included in returns” as part of the Ts and Cs. But what exactly does this mean?

Let’s say you place a £10 bet at odds of 2/1 (3.0 decimal) using your own money. If your bet wins, your return is £30. That’s £20 profit, plus you get your £10 stake back.

However, if you use a £10 free bet token and bet with the bookie’s money, you still get the £20 profit. But usually, you don’t get the £10 free bet stake back as well.

This is a standard term and it’s nothing to worry about. You’ll always get to keep any profit you make with a free bet, just not the stake itself. But since it wasn’t your money in the first place, you’re still doing well out of the deal.

Which Bookies have Free Bet Clubs?

There is a lot of choice when it comes to online bookmakers and most of us have our preferred ones for various reasons. With so many bookmakers online nowadays, they’re all trying to compete for your business and an effective way of doing so is by offering customers free bets and other rewards. Free bet promotions are available every day but many bookmakers offer customers weekly rewards in the form of Free Bet Clubs.

What are Free Bet Clubs?

Free bet clubs, or Loyalty Clubs, Schemes or Programmes as they are also known as, are a type of reward program some bookmakers offer. They usually require customers to place a number of bets throughout the week in order to receive a free bet the following week. The great thing about free bet clubs is that they’re available every week and you can often qualify for the free bets by just betting as normal. However, they are worth keeping an eye on as some weeks you may be a small amount off receiving a £10 free bet in which case it worth be worth placing an additional bet in order to receive it.

The Best Free Bet Clubs

Not all bookmakers have loyalty programmes, although many do. Some bookmakers reward customers in additional ways such as price boosts, ‘Bet & Get’ offers and money-back specials.

Below is a list of free bet clubs at various bookmakers which we consider to be the best and worth taking advantage of.

Bookmaker	Details	More Information
	Betfred	Learn More
	Coral	Learn More
	Unibet	Learn More
	Sky Bet	Learn More
	LeoVegas	Learn More
	Quinnbet	Learn More
	Hollywood Bets	Learn More
	Kwiff	Learn More
	The Pools	Learn More
	Vbet	Learn More
	T&C's apply for all free bet clubs	

Free Bet Club Tips

There are several free bet clubs available with some of the best being listed above. They’re worth taking advantage of as you can receive a number of free bets each week simply for placing bets as you normally would.

If you are taking advantage of multiple free bet club offers then we strongly recommend keeping a record of the bets you have placed at these bookmakers. It’s easy to forget how many bets you have placed and at what stake so by keeping a note of them, you’ll be able to mark off which free bet clubs you have qualified for each week and which ones you need to place further bets with in order to qualify before the cut off time.
