PBKS vs RR (Punjab Kings vs Rajasthan Royals), 27th T20 Match Preview

Punjab Kings’ bowling has improved, but their batting still needs work. Jonny Bairstow hasn’t been playing well, which is a problem for captain Dhawan. It seems like Bairstow has had plenty of opportunities so that it might be time for a change in the team. Prabhsimran Singh could replace Bairstow, and either Liam Livingstone or Rilee Rossouw might be kept as a player who can make a big difference in the game.

In a recent match, Rajasthan Royals surprised everyone by not using their best bowler, Trent Boult, in the final overs against Gujarat Titans. Even though Boult had only given away eight runs in two overs, he didn’t bowl later in the game. Some people wondered if Boult was hurt, and the captain, Samson, wanted to keep him safe. But there hasn’t been any official news about this. If Boult is okay to play, we don’t expect any changes in the Rajasthan Royals team.

We predict that the Rajasthan Royals will win.
