England vs West Indies Commentary
4:11 AM IST Right then, that's all from this clash of heavyweights where England lived up to the tag of the defending champions. Jos Buttler and Co. will need to keep this intensity up as they face the unbeaten Proteas next, while the West Indies will be looking to get their first points of the Super 8 when they take on fellow hosts, the USA. The Super 8 action in the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup continues on Thursday, June 20, when two Asian sides, India and Afghanistan, lock horns at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados. The first ball will be bowled at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT), but as always, you can join us in advance for the build-up. Until then, take care and goodbye!
4:09 AM IST Jos Buttler, the skipper of England says it's an important win and it was a really good performance by the boys with both bat and ball. Appreciates the team saying they prepared well and performed as a group. Says it was a decent total and they had to be at their best to chase it down. Appreciates Jonny Bairstow and says he really took off in the middle overs and also says that the partnership between Bairstow and Salt was pivotal. Adds they bowled to their plans. Says he brought Jofra Archer in the 16th over with Pooran and Russell coming in, and he restricted the run flow. Says you need to bring your best bowler and shut them. Also appreciates Adil Rashid and says he has been excellent all the time and has been an important player for a long time. Says he has a lot of variations. Further adds that people say you learn when you lose but he believes that you learn when you win as well, and concludes by saying they will reflect on the positives and put it to bed and move on to the next one.
4:04 AM IST The captain of West Indies, Rovman Powell feels that they were 15-20 runs short. Feels that they could have done better with the ball. States that they are normally good with the bat in the last 5 overs and lauds England for the way they bowled. Tells that they need to evaluate and take positives as a batting group. Hopes that Brandon King can pull through as he is an important player for them. Reckons that they strayed away from their bowling plans against Phil Salt and could have done better. Ends by saying that their destiny is still in their hands and will look to continue playing good cricket.
3:59 AM IST Phil Salt is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his blistering knock of 87 runs from 47 balls. Says he really liked it. Adds that they are not looking far too ahead and he's just happy to contribute to the team's victory. Mentions that it was a little tricky against the spinners in the mid-overs and it was all about constructing the chase. Adds it was a pretty good wicket to bat on. On being asked about Jonny Bairstow's innings, Salt says, Bairstow's innings was very crucial. Adds once Jos Buttler got out, he had to bat through and Jonny Bairstow took calculated risks in the middle. Ends up saying he is delighted with the win.
3:59 AM IST Time for the presentation ceremony....
3:59 AM IST Earlier in the game, England opted to bowl first but were a bit wayward with the new ball and could not start as they would have liked. Despite some ungainly shots, Brandon King and Johnson Charles ensured a decent start for the West Indies. King had to walk off the field due to what seemed to be a groin issue, but Nicholas Pooran quickly got into his stride and maintained the momentum. In the middle phase though, Charles and Pooran struggled to find their rhythm as England put a squeeze on. A breezy cameo from the skipper, Rovman Powell, helped the West Indies regain momentum. The loss of Powell, Pooran, and Russell in successive overs prevented the West Indies from maximizing the back end of their innings. Thanks to a late flourish from Sherfane Rutherford, the West Indies managed to reach a total of 180. For England, Adil Rashid was the pick of the bowlers with figures of 1 for 21 from his 4 overs.
