Hello Frank

Any matches involving non-ICC members (Colombia, Uruguay, if they participate) and teams fielding non-ICC eligible players will not carry ranking points status.

Thanks and regards,

You’re stating the obvious. I asked the question because last year, games involving Brazil and Peru did not have T20I status. Also, why are Suriname and Falkland Islands yet to make their respective official international debuts? Surely they should both be involved in this tournament, otherwise T20I status with ranking points is a complete farce.

Hello Austin

With the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Americas sub-regional qualifier coming up in December 2024 in Argentina, most likely all teams would like to play with status (ranking points) in this edition. Last edition, Brazil and Peru fielded ineligible players in their squads, and hence, did not apply for the games to be played with ranking points.

Thanks and regards,

Hello Rishab

There is no information available as of now, if this event will be live streamed or not. Rest assured, it will not be in Fancode.

Thanks and regards,

Apparently only the Brazil vs. Mexico match will carry T20I status. What a farce! Ridiculous!

Yeah..I expected that atleast matches involving Argentina would be a t20I but probably again other teams have fielded ineligible players… therefore only the Americas Qualifiers in December would provide some teams with official t20I records in near future

Argentina have no ineligible players, yet there play-off game today against Mexico is not being accorded T20I status, as of yet. This tournament is a farce. Scrap it.

Panama win the tournament but none of their matches were accorded T20I status. This is insane!

Hello admin
Can we know what was the reason behind the forfeiture of Uruguay against Colombia in the 7th place play-off?
