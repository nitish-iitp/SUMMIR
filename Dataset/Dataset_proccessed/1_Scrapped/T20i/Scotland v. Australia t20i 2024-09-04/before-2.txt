The much-awaited T20I series between Scotland and Australia is set to kick off on September 4, 2024, at the Grange Cricket Club in Edinburgh. The three-match series promises thrilling encounters, as Scotland takes on the mighty Australians in their backyard, hoping to showcase their talent and upset one of the giants of world cricket.
