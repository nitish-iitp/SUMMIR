Australia vs Scotland 3rd T20I Highlights: Australia beat Scotland by 6 wickets in the third and final T20I of the three-match series played at Grange Cricket Club in Edinburgh on Saturday (September 7). RCB star Cameron Green top-scored for the Aussies in the last match of the bilateral series by remaining unbeaten on 62 runs from 39 balls.

During his stay at the crease, the 25-year-old all-rounder scored two fours and five sixes. His super show with the bat came after he picked up three wickets for 35 runs in his quota of four overs during the first half of the match.

Apart from him, Mitchell Marsh scored 31 runs for the 2021 T20 World Cup winners and Tim David made a contribution of 25 runs from 14 balls.

For Scotland, Bradley Currie picked up two wickets for 20 runs in his three overs, and one Aussie batter each was sent back to the pavilion by Christopher Sole and Jack Jervis.

Earlier in the first half of the match, Scotland batters apart from Brandon McMullen failed to score big runs, and the hosts could only manage to post a total of 149 runs for the loss of nine wickets in 20 overs after being invited to bat first in the dead rubber by Marsh.

For the visitors, apart from Green, pacers Aaron Hardie and Sean Abbott dismissed two batters each, and one Scotland cricketer was sent back to the pavilion by Adam Zampa and Marcus Stoinis.

The Presentation ceremony…

Earlier in the game, Mitchell Marsh won the toss and put Scotland to bat on a used deck but one that was still pretty good for batting. It was a similar story to the first game as Scotland scored quick runs inside the Powerplay but lost a couple of wickets and couldn’t kick on in the middle. Too many starts and no real knock of substance from even one of the batters cost them dearly as they huffed and puffed to 149 runs.

There was a bit in the deck for the Scottish pacers early on and the duo of Brandon McMullen and Brad Currie were used smartly for the first four overs. However, an extra over for both turned out to be a bane and those who came in to bowl later, simply couldn’t pile on the pressure. Currie picked up a couple of wickets and there were a few opportunities created as well but Scottish couldn’t pick up wickets in a heap and were brushed aside with ease.

Chasing a target of 150 runs, Australia were shaky to begin with and young Jake Fraser-McGurk fell for a duck yet again. Travis Head played the way he does but soon perished as well before Mitchell Marsh and Cameron Green steadied the ship. They took on the bowling soon enough and got on top of the run chase. Green was the standout with an unbeaten knock of 62(39) with Marsh and then Tim David playing fine cameos as well.

A job well done for Australia and they have flexed their muscles before heading off to play their eternal rivals England in a few days’ time. Scotland showed glimpses of their greatness from a few months back in the T20 World Cup but were patchy with the bat and in their overall play as well.

15.3 – In the air…but safe! Watt smartly slows it up, full and on off, Green goes for a swipe across the line but gets a leading edge that goes straight up and in front of short third.

14.1 – A valiant effort from Matthew Cross but just beyond his reach! Sole bowls it very full, on off, Cameron Green shapes up for the scoop but the ball is too full for him to get the desired elevation. Spoons it behind the stumps where Cross back tracks and dives over his right shoulder but the ball drops away from him. A single taken.
