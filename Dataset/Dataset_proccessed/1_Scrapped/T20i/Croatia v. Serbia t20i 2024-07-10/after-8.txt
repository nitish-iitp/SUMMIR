Incidentally, this is the first time England has reached the final of a tournament that’s not being held at home and the stars seem to be convening. As many anecdote-loving football historians have pointed out, the last time England won a major football trophy, Labour’s Harold Wilson was the Prime Minister. It just so happens that after 14 years, there’s another Labour government in power, led by a Prime Minister who interrupts his NATO summit for notes on the team’s performance.

England's forward #19 Ollie Watkins (C) shoots and scores his team's second goal during the UEFA Euro 2024 semi-final football match between the Netherlands and England at the BVB Stadion in Dortmund on July 10, 2024.

There’s a long-running joke on sports Twitter about the Americans and the English explained in a simple flowchart of a meme that says that while England invents sports that everyone else is good at, the US invents sports that no one wants to play and thus helping them become world champions.


Perhaps, that explains America’s long animosity towards the world’s most popular sport football (frankly what they call football ought to be called hand-egg), until Ted Lasso came along.

Against all odds, in the bleakest days of the Covid pandemic, Ted Lasso was a source of comfort for everyone around the world thanks to its Panglossian protagonist who refused to see the dark cloud around the silver lining. Of course, like any American, he had no clue about his job and outsourced it to underpaid drones and it took him three seasons to learn the offside rule. One of the best episodes of Ted Lasso took place in Amsterdam where the fictional AFC Richmond go for a mid-season friendly. It’s a different matter that Premier League teams don’t play mid-season friendlies but let’s not quibble over imaginary split milk. The episode had lots of other fun moments: Roy Kent and Jamie Tarth bonding over bicycles and missing fathers. Colin finding a gay bar and just being himself. Van Damme demanding they go to a sex show. Dani “Life is Football” Rojas saying he wants to see just one tulip because seeing too many tulips together would be “overwhelming”.

But perhaps the best plotline was Ted Lasso – under a pseudo-hallucinogenic haze while thinking about the Chicago Bulls and triangles – unearthing a modern version of Johan Cruyff’s Total Football.
England on the other hand have been playing its polar opposite in this tournament, a style that can only be described as Total Non-Football.
After the shocking rope-a-dope comeback against the Swiss, this author had half-jokingly written: “Total Non-Football hinges on forwards not being able to attack, defenders not being able to defend and midfielders ambling about in a clueless manner. It relies on boring an opponent to death before knocking them out. With the benefit of hindsight, it’s a tactical masterclass, a Trojan horse trick right out of
The Iliad.
Play in a manner so clueless – like you were inspired by a Laurie and Fry skit – that you lull the opposition team into a sense of complete disarmament before hitting them with the one-two. It’s the footballing equivalent of the famous rope-a-dope trick employed by Muhammad Ali against George Foreman in The Rumble in the Jungle where Ali waited on the ropes as his opponent tired himself out before knocking him down.”
In the group stages, England won just one match in regulation time and if Serbia had managed to score against England, every team in the group would’ve ended up with the same number of points, goals scored, and goals against, which would have led to the group being decided by yellow or red cards received.

In the knockouts, they had not led in the 90 minutes even once, and still conjured a way to find its way to the final, no matter how absurd the circumstances. England’s performance, as one football journalist put it on Twitter, has been absolutely politically neutral: both laboured and conservative.
In previous tournaments, England were knocked out after taking leads, most memorably in the final against Italy in Euro 2020 and the semi-final against Croatia in the 2018 World Cup. Perhaps, Southgate has figured out that England can’t defend a lead over an extended period of time and insists they don’t take it with too much time to spare.
In the round of 16 against Slovakia, England were trailing till the 95th minute when Jude Bellingham, soporific for most of the game, majestically leapt to score a bicycle kick, before Harry Kane suddenly remembered they weren’t playing statue and leapt up to head England into the final in the early stages of extra-time.
In the quarterfinal against Switzerland, England didn’t lead for the entire game but knocked out the Swiss on penalties, taking them with such surety that even Boris Becker – who never misses his shots – was impressed.


And finally, against the Netherlands, Ollie Watkins waited till injury time to pull a rabbit out of his hat to break Dutch hearts. Watkins' goal was sublime, and the timing meant there was no time for the Dutch to exercise their right to reply.
Of course, one is exaggerating a little bit.
England weren’t playing Total Non-Football against the Dutch. It was one of their finer performances, nay, their only worthwhile performance at Euro 2024. Phil Foden finally looked like the Premier League Player of the Year, rebooted with Pep Guardiola’s instructions, and firing on all cylinders. Kobbie Mainoo continued to be a revelation, playing with a style that will make Manchester United fans in five years lament how they have wasted another generational talent. Sure there was a serendipitous VAR-inspired penalty that Harry Kane dispatched to exorcise the demons of his miss against France. Of course, it was lucky and arbitrary, much like most refereeing these days where one can be given an offside for having a hair ahead of the defender but given the number of times England have gotten the short end of the stick, it was a karmic Deus Ex-Machina helping to pave the way for the Three Lions.
The funny thing is that despite the brickbats and the notion that even the deepest rung of hell is too good for Gareth Southgate, he has a superlative record as English team manager. Is he too safe? Does he wear a safety vest in the bathtub? Is his amour for Kalvin Philips improper?


It doesn’t matter because other than Sir Alf Ramsey, who steered England to its only trophy in football in 1966, no England manager has a better record.
Since he took over, Southgate has formed a cohesive unit shorn off the toxicity of star players and WAG circuses who could never get along and would always under-perform at big tournaments. He has led England to two finals (Euro 2020 and Euro 2024), one semi-final (World Cup 2018) and won more knockout matches than all previous managers put together.
Perhaps disdain for Southgate is a byproduct of English hate, because much of the world – irrespective of whether they were colonised by them or not – just can’t stand them. All football fans are like the parodic Paddy Power Scot fan whose sole purpose isn’t to support their team but hope that England bottle it.
To be fair, there are various reasons the denizens of the world treat the English with severe disdain. From the most uncouth fans in the world who think firecrackers should be treated like suppositories to lecturing the world on morality despite their history of trying to colonise everyone to sell opium to a toxic press that loses its mind whenever a black person is mildly successful, there are a billion reasons to detest modern England.
In days gone by, it was said that some of us are always cursed to see the world through an Englishman’s eyes. Some of us are also cursed to support the English football team because we fell in love with it when it had some of the most hopeful talents of world football who would aways conjure to find heartbreak from nothing.
In World Cup 1998, an 18-year-old Michael Owen first wowed the world with the greatest World Cup goal since Maradona’s Hand of God before 21-year-old David Beckham was sent off for sticking a limb where he shouldn’t. It’s a habit that he didn’t completely give up as he grew up. England would go on to lose on penalties in a match that made Gareth Southgate a Pizza Hut ambassador after an embarrassing miss that leads to the Maula Maula theme playing in some people’s head whenever England wins a penalty shootout under his stewardship.
In Euro 2004, a man-child called Wayne Rooney shocked French stalwarts like Thierry Henry and Zinedine Zidane with his performance before Steven Gerrard’s customary back-pass led to a Zidane penalty and then a free-kick to conjure more heartbreak. England went on to lose after Rooney broke his leg.
In 2006, the same Rooney forgot which ball he was playing with as he stamped on Portugal’s Ricardo Carvalho before being winked off by Cristiano Ronaldo.
England failed to qualify for Euro 2008, rued another ghost goal in World Cup 2010 and got knocked out on penalties by Italy again in Euro 2012.
In Euro 2016, they were seen off by Iceland – of the thunderous claps and long beards – before a renaissance under Southgate since the 2018 World Cup tournament where England shocked everyone by reaching the semi-finals. Their performances were none too shabby in future tournaments and English fans will hope – as the entire world prays against it – that they can go one better than their last showing.
Incidentally, this is the first time England has reached the final of a tournament that’s not being held at home and the stars seem to be convening. As many anecdote-loving football historians have pointed out, the last time England won a major football trophy, Labour’s Harold Wilson was the Prime Minister. It just so happens that after 14 years, there’s another Labour government in power, led by a Prime Minister who wants his NATO meeting interrupted by updates about England's performances.
So, pump up Sweet Caroline, get out your chip butties, put out the toast and beans. Fill up your pints. Get the Shepherd’s Pie and eel sauce out, because the fates have convened that it's coming home. Unless of course, the Spanish ruin the party.
