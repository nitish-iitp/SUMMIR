Malawi Under-19 Women’s National Cricket Team has been promoted to Africa Division One after beating Lesotho yesterday in the ongoing International Cricket Council (ICC) Women’s T20 World Cup Sub Regional Qualifiers in Kigali, Rwanda.

The team has now joined continental heavyweights Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania in Division One, having impressed during series that attracted Division Two teams.

After earning promotion, Malawi have a chance to be crowned champions if they beat Kenya today.

Cricket Malawi Head of Cricket Operations Arjun Menon said they were thrilled to have joined the elite division.

“It has been an exciting journey but we still have work to do because we are playing Kenya. Kenya would be a good litmus test as they play like Division One teams,” he said.

He said the squad was talented and that it was not surprising that Malawi players dominated player of the match awards in all the five games they have played.

Esther Richard won the individual accolade Monday while Eve Kabwere and Lucy Malino also won it once.

Mercy Kudimba has won it twice.

In yesterday’s match, Malawi beat Lesotho by 154 runs to amass 10 points from five matches.
