India captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and opted to bowl against Afghanistan in the second T20I in Indore on Sunday. At the toss, Rohit announced two changes as Virat Kohli and Yashasvi Jaiswal returned after missing the series-opener. On the other hand, Shubman Gill and Tilak Varma missed out on a place in the XI. With the series against Afghanistan set to India's last assignment before the T20 World Cup in June, Rohit emphasised that the team wants to try out different things to prepare for the World Cup. As far as the changes were concerned, Rohit did not reveal any details.

"We are gonna bowl first. No particular reason. Just nature of the ground especially the small boundaries. The things we were talking in our meeting, we were able to come out and execute that in the first game. We asked specific roles from the guys and they performed accordingly. Not much, they don't have any baggage and it is all about backing them, allow them to be free on the ground. We will do things keeping the WC in mind but we know results are also important. Kohli and Jaiswal back for Gill and Tilak," Rohit said at the toss.

Virat had missed the first game due to personal reasons while Jaiswal had a groin issue, which he seemed to have recovered from.

Meanwhile, Afghanistan also made a change as Noor Ahmad replaced Rahmat Shah, who made his debut in the last match.

"We will try to bat well today and put runs on the board. Again lost the toss and I would have wanted to bowl first. We spoke about the first game and worked in the net session yesterday. We did not have a good start with the bat in the last game, we spoke and hopefully we can give a good start today. Rahmat is not playing. Noor Ahmad is playing," Afghanistan captain Ibrahim Zadran explained.
