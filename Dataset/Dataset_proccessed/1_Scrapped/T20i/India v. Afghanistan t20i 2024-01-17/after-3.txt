IND vs AFG Highlights: India will take on Afghanistan at M.Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru

IND vs AFG 3rd T20, Highlights: In a thriller at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore, India prevailed only in the second super over after Ravi Bishnoi helped the hosts defend 11 by removing Mohammad Nabi and Rahmanullah Gurbaz.

Gulbadin Naib scored 55 off 23 deliveries as Afghanistan levelled the scores off the last ball to take the game into the super over. Chasing 213, Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran also scored fifties for the visitors. Earlier, Rohit Sharma and Rinku Singh’s 190-run stand has taken India to a mammoth 212/4. India struggled at 22/4 when the duo got together, and both paced the innings to perfection.

In the process, Rohit became the only international player to reach the 5th T20I 100. Coming on the back of two ducks in the series, the batter once again started scratchily; however, as the innings went on, the Indian skipper found his mojo and showed full range. Rinku at the other end too played a crucial hand and complimented the skipper well

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Rohit erases doubts over T20 WC spot

And lastly, to wrap up what has been an incredible night, here's Tushar Bhaduri's account of Rohit Sharma the batter. (Read here)

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Player of the match

Rohit Sharma: I don't remember when was the last time this happened. I think I batted 3 times in one of the IPL games. Creating the partnership was important and we (Rinku and I) kept talking to each other to not lose that intent in big games and it was a good game for us to be in, the pressure was there and was important to bat long and deep and not compromise on the intent we want to show. The last couple of series that he played, he showed what he can do with the bat. Very calm and knows his strength pretty well. He is coming off age and doing what is expected of him and he has done really well for India. Augurs well for the team moving forward, wanted someone like that at the backend and we know what he has done in the IPL and he has carried that to the Indian colors as well.

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: AFG skipper happy with overall performance

Ibrahim Zadran: We are happy with the overall performance. We played good cricket, unfortunately we lost in the superover. We got lots of positives from this series and this experience will help us in the upcoming T20 World Cup. The boys gave their best in these 3 games. We never played this kind of cricket in T20, especially against India and in batting department as well. Really happy. We will take some positives from this series and focus on improving a little bit in the T20 World Cup.

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Player of the series

Shivam Dube: "As an all-rounder you always want to be the Player of the Series, and this is something new I achieved in my life and it feels really good. We scored a lot of runs on this ground and we thought we would win before the superover, but such is cricket and well done to both teams. There are many things I want to improve, especially in my bowling and I'm trying to get better with each passing game."

17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Bishnoi on the mic

Ravi Bishnoi: The pressure was there, the heartbeat was racing, but I was confident about getting the job done. I was told by the captain that I'll bowl - I knew it wouldn't be easy for them if I bowl back of the length ball, it would be tough to smash on the back-foot. It gives a lot of pleasure to defend during the super overs. I'm happy with the way the ball is leaving my hand. My only thought is to ensure that the batter doesn't get himself used to only one type of delivery, I've worked on my leg-spin in the nets and at the domestic levels.

23:21 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Second super over, AFG

Ball 1: Mohammad Nabi takes the strike. He goes hard after the leggie, only to find Rinku Singh at long off. Bishnoi gets a wicket off the first ball. 0/1.

Ball 2: Karim Janat is the new batter in. Yorker nailed by Bishnoi, just a single for AFG!

Ball 3: Rahmanullah Gurbaz takes the strike. Bishnoi from over the wicket again, length ball, Gurbaz goes for glory over mid off but only finds Rinku Singh at the boundary. That's that, finally! Listen to this, match tied, super over tied, India win in second super over!

23:20 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Who will bowl the second super over for IND?

With all the drama we've had in this game already, here's another: India have both Avesh Khan and Ravi Bishnoi warming up with the ball. From what the former's conversation with bowling coach Paras Mhambrey seems (we're no expert lip readers), it'll all depend on who comes in to bat for Afghanistan. It's Bishnoi India have turned to.

23:11 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Second super over, IND

Ball 1: Left armer comes over the wicket and angles a length ball away but Rohit has got a hold of this one, all the way down the ground it goes for SIX! 6/0.

Ball 2: A fuller delivery this time, still wide, the Indian captain meets it with a one handed shot which runs down backward point for four. Poor start for Afghanistan. 10/0

Ball 3: This time, Farid Ahmad gets his yorker right. Just a single for India. 11/0

Ball 4: Rinku Singh on the strike. A full delivery wide outside off and Rinku misses it on the swing. Gurbaz claims it behind the stumps and he reckons he's got his man. Rinku is halfway through to the dugout even as Afghanistan go upstairs for a review.

Ball 5: Sanju Samson is the new batter in. A swing and a miss and Rohit is keen on a run but Gurbaz finds the stumps and that'll be that for India in the second super over. 11 is what they've scored. Afghanistan need 12 to win.

23:09 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: WOW!

A second super over, ladies and gentlemen!

The reactions told a story. Rohit Sharma, who'd swapped himself for Rinku Singh for that last ball, fell back in his chair by the dugout and held his head with both his hands. He'll have to go again. This time, with Rinku Singh. The bowlers will be different. Rohit will take the strike. Not having been dismissed the first time, he can bat again. Farid Ahmad has the ball for Afghanistan.

23:02 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: IND super over

Ball 1: Azmatullah Omarzai has the ball in his hands. Rohit Sharma on strike. A swing and a miss. One leg bye completed. 

Ball 2: Another single collected, this time from Yashasvi Jaiswal.

Ball 3: Boundary needed for India here, and Rohit finds it. Whacks a fuller delivery clean over the long on fence. Six! 8/0.

Ball 4: Full toss from Omarzai and Rohit has got underneath it and this will clear the fence as well. The Chinnaswamy is on its feet. Six more. 14/0/.

Ball 5: A clever slower ball from Omarzai and Rohit gets the bat onto it. Just the one run and it'll fall on Jaiswal to finish this. Two needed off the last ball. And would you look at this. Rohit Sharma has made a superb chess move here. Retires himself to bring in Rinku Singh at the non-striker's end - he's the quicker one and India need two here. 15/0.

Ball 6: It's just a single. DEAR ME! WE'RE INTO ANOTHER SUPER OVER!

22:58 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Drama off the last ball

Both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli - who didn't even collect the ball as he saw Afghanistan run a third - let their displeasure known off that last ball. They were of the opinion Afghanistan shouldn't have had more than a run there as Sanju Samson's throw to the bowler was deflected off Mohammad Nabi's shoe down the long on boundary. 

"That doesn't sit right with me. He would've known that it hit him in the leg," says Nick Knight on the comms. 

But India will have to move on from this. 17 runs is what they need to win this one. Yashasvi Jaiswal makes his way by the boundary. No doubt as to who'll accompany him in the middle. Rohit Sharma has had a fantastic game with the bat. Can he wrap it up? Perhaps the word Rahul Dravid would've had with him the dressing room. The head coach made his way from the dugout by the boundary to have a word with the captain in the break. Off we go with the last six balls of the match, or will there be more?

22:47 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Super over, AFG innings

Ball 1: Naib on strike, Mukesh with the ball. Works the ball onto the leg side. They'll be looking for two here but Virat Kohli nails a quick throw from the deep and Naib is run out. 1/1.

Ball 2: Mohammad Nabi is the new batter in. Mukesh nails another yorker. Just the one this time.

Ball 3: Gurbaz takes the strike. And he finds an edge that runs down short third. First boundary of the super over. 6/1, it is. 

Ball 4: Gurbaz gets the ball through covers. Just a single. 7/1.

Ball 5: Nabi clamps onto this one, clears the mid wicket boundary off a flick of the wrist. 13/1

Ball 6: Nabi misses out on this altogether. Samson goes for a throw to the bowler but it ricochetes off Nabi and Afghanistan will collect another two here. Rohit Sharma is furious here. He's calling Nabi for an obstruction of the ball there but the Afghan raises his hands, it wasn't a deliberate move. Fair runs these. 16/1 is where Afghanistan finish.

22:45 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: MY MY!

Some scenes at the Chinnaswamy! So much for a dead rubber, what a game we've got here! 240 deliveries not enough to separate these two sides, we'll have to rely upon another 12. The Indian players are all smiles in a huddle. They'll have to bowl first and it looks like it will be Mukesh Kumar to bowl their share of six deliveries, as he did the last six?

In the Afghanistan camp, even Rashid Khan is part of the discussions on who will come in to bat? Gulbadin Naib, who looks all drained out, has been persuaded and he'll take the strike with Rahmanullah Gurbaz accompanying him at the other end.

22:39 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: SUPER OVER!

Right then. It's Mukesh Kumar who Rohit Sharma has looked up to for this last over. What better opportunity for the pacer to prove his mettle in the absence of Arshdeep Singh?

But he starts off with a wide and Gulbadin Naib has smoked the first legal delivery down the ground for four. And just like that, it's moved to 14 off the last five deliveries. Mukesh gets it right off the next one, a yorker nailed right wide outside the off stump. India are tempting Naib with a massive gap at the deep through the covers. Mukesh has to nail his wide yorkers here. He goes too wide and another extra is added to Afghanistan's score. 13 off the last four now. Next up, a low full toss and Naib gets it over the fielder but hasn't timed it well for a boundary. Rinku Singh collects it and Afghanistan only get the two. 11 needed off the last three. Mukesh goes again and this time, Naib clears the long off boundary. 

It's come down to five needed off the last two. And Simon Doull on the air reckons the big guns celebration is just around the corner. The yorker is nailed but Afghanistan claim two. It's three needed off the last ball. Are we going to the super over? 

A wide yorker it is from Mukesh and Naib gets it through covers and collects two. WE ARE GOING TO A SUPER OVER!

22:30 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Right down the wire it goes!

Avesh Khan to bowl the penultimate over. Najibullah Zadran starts it off with a boundary - an outside edge that runs down short third for four. Looking to clear the rope on the off side, Zadran is caught by Virat Kohli, who takes a sensational catch running 38m from the long off to almost the extra cover fence. A brilliant catch. Afghanistan lose a sixth wicket. 

But it ain't over till it's over. Sharafuddin Ashraf, the new batter in, collects a boundary through the covers and Gulbadin Naib clamps another six to wrap up another 17-run over. 19 required off the last six balls.

22:25 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: A run out but Naib keeps AFG in the hunt!

Mukesh Kumar has been entrusted to bowl the 18th over. But Afghanistan have gifted one to India. Karim Janat - charging for a quick single from the non-striker's end - is sent back by Gulbadin Naib, only to lose his bat midway through the pitch and see a direct hit from Sanju Samson claim him at the bowler's end. 

A good over is spoiled by Gulbadin Naib, who claims a couple of boundaries to wrap up the over. 36 needed off the last 12 balls.

22:19 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Nabi removed by Sundar

Washington Sundar with the breakthrough, again!

Mohammad Nabi was looking in exquisite touch - 34 off 16 - but looking to carve another boundary over deep point, he's found the fielder at the boundary and Avesh Khan takes it. A superb cameo and a breathtaking partnership comes to an end. 

Meanwhile, Virat Kohli with a spectacular moment in the deep as he saves five runs for India with a sky-high leap and a one-handed throw back in time. 167/4 after 17 overs.

22:14 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: More boundaries

Ravi Bishnoi replaces Avesh Khan but the boundaries keep on coming. Mohammad Nabi at it again. 4,4,6, and it's another over that costs 17. These two are striking it clean at the moment and Rohit Sharma - who was chuffed only a couple overs ago - now has a face of worry. Anxiety has taken over the stands at the Chinnaswamy. 162/3 after 16 overs. Afghanistan need 51 off the last 24 balls.

22:09 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Nabi takes the attack to Kuldeep

First Naib, now Nabi. It was Avesh Khan in the last over, it's Kuldeep Yadav who's hammered in this one. Consecutive sixes from Mr. President to put the left-arm chinaman on the backfoot. Another hefty over - 17 off it. 145/3 after 15 overs.

22:07 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Naib takes off from the start!

Avesh Khan back into the attack. Two new batters in the middle for Afghanistan but Gulbadin Naib - who powered to a fifty in the last match - seems to have picked off from where he left in Indore. A four and two sixes in an over that costs 20 and apologies for that blasphemous claim from the last over, Afghanistan are still very much in this game. 128/3 after 14 overs.

22:02 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Sundar nabs two in two!

Washington Sundar into his second over. Afghanistan captain Ibrahim Zadran crunches a six off his first ball. Brings up his half century. But just like Gurbaz, he is unable to stick around for long after that. A wide delivery down the leg stump lures him outside the crease and Sanju Samson behind the stumps does the rest. 

Off the very next delivery, Azmatullah Omarzai finds the fielder on the leg side boundary. It's two wickets off two balls for Sundar. Nine runs off the over but have they lost the plot in this over? 108/3 after 13 overs.

21:59 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Bishnoi with an economical over

Ravi Bishnoi continues to keep the momentum in India's favor. An economical over from the leggie following the wicket by Kuldeep Yadav. 98/1 after 12 overs.

21:51 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: First breakthrough for IND, Gurbaz perishes after scoring 50

Rahmanullah Gurbaz brings up his first fifty of the series with a six, swept with disdain over the backward square leg fence for six. But Kuldeep Yadav has the last laugh.

An attempted hard cut shot through the extra cover and Washington Sundar leaps onto it. India have their first wicket. 93/1 after 11 overs.

21:47 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Most expensive over of IND innings!

Shivam Dube continues and the Afghan openers take the attack to him. Ibrahim Zadran starts it with an attempt to lap it over fine leg, gets a leading edge instead that runs down short third for four. 

For Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Dube drops down his pace just a tad, to which the former shuffles across and collects a boundary by the short fine fence. And then, off the last ball of the over, a thumping shot over mid wicket for six. 18 from the over. 85/0 at the halfway stage.

21:41 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Gurbaz breaks the boundary drought!

Kuldeep Yadav replaces Washington Sundar. Rahmanullah Gurbaz breaks the boundary drought. Edges one that was turning away from the right hander and it runs past the Indian skipper at slips for four. 67/0 after nine overs.

21:38 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: IND in need of that first wicket!

Shivam Dube introduced to the fray. A wicket each in his appearance in the last two games, can he find one here? None come off this over - 20 since the last. But India know how dangerous these two can be. Seven off the eighth over. 61/0, Afghanistan.

21:33 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Sundar into the attack

Spin from both ends. Washington Sundar to accompany Bishnoi from the other end. The most economical over of the Indian innings so far - giving away just the three runs. 54/0 after seven overs.

21:30 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: End of powerplay

Bishnoi continues from the other end. Better from the leggie - just the six runs come off his second. Fifty up for Afghanistan and both the openers are looking solid in the middle. Game on in Bangalore.

21:28 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: The onslaught continues

A change of ends for Avesh Khan. He goes slower and further up with his length but Zadran has read him like a book and whips him over mid wicket for four. 45/0 after five overs.

21:24 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Spin into the attack

Ravi Bishnoi has been called in the powerplay - replacing Avesh Khan. Ibrahim Zadran takes him on straightaway. A cracking drive past extra cover for four. A delivery later, Bishnoi goes short again and gets punished with another boundary. 11 runs off the over. 37/0 after four overs.

21:22 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Gurbaz's attacking mode on

Also under pressure has been Afghanistan's big opener, who hasn't had a big outing yet in this series. Is it going to be tonight? The signs are looking extremely good. Mukesh Kumar gets creamed for a couple more boundaries. An overpitched delivery outside the off stump gets dealt with a four. And then, a lofted drive over long off for six. 26/0 after three overs.

21:10 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: First six for AFG!

Avesh Khan scampers in to bowl for the first time this series. Rahmanullah Gurbaz tonks him for the first six of the innings - a swivel-pull over long leg fence. Good over that for the Afghans, 10 runs come off it. 14/0 after two overs.

21:05 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Chase begins

Well, that was quite something. From 22/4 to 212/4, the Chinnaswamy Stadium saw a Rohit-Rinku special. The Indian captain came into the game on the back of consecutive ducks in his first outings since the 2022 T20 World Cup, and boy didn't he give it back to the critics with that innings! The only player with five T20I hundreds, ladies and gentlemen.

Rinku Singh played the perfect second fiddle one can expect in T20 cricket. How well has he grown accustomed to international cricket over the past few months?

Afghanistan have a job on their hands. Mukesh Kumar will get us underway. Rahmanullah Gurbaz and skipper Ibrahim Zadran get the innings underway for the visitors. Just the four runs off that first over.

17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Rohit Sharma and Rinku Singh take IND to 212/4 in Bengaluru

That is brutal hitting from the Indian batters. The innings have been paced to perfection by both Rohit and Rinku after losing early wickets. They took their time initially; however, in the last five overs of the innings, boy, oh boy, they have shown their entire range. At 61/4 during the first water break, if anyone would have said India would get what they have now, one would have laughed at their face. Well, it was the Hitman show, and he demolished the Afghan bowlers. It is a chasable total, but it will need an innings of lifetime from Afgan batters. Stay with us for all the action coming up from the second innings.

20:40 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 19 overs IND 176/4

Rohit Sharma slams his fifth T20I ton and becomes the only player to do so in international cricket. What an inning it has been. It has not been all easy peasy for the Indian batter. He initially had to bite his time, but now he is reaping the rewards.

20:36 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 18.1 overs IND 155/4

Ahmad has bowled a terrific final over here. He nailed in his yorkers to perfection. Seems like an excellent bowler, Ahmad. He has been lively with the new ball and can handle himself at the death. It is interesting why he hasn't been seen on many occasions on the international stage yet. 

20:30 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 17.2 overs IND 146/4

The partnership between Rohit and Rinku could be a match-winning one here. They got together when the team was 22/4, and now India is in a more than comfortable position. If they can get to 180 India will believe they can win this game. 

20:25 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 16.1 overs IND 135/4

Of all the changes made by Afghanistan today, Saleem has been the only change that has yet to work. He has a raw pace, but his accuracy still seems to be a work in progress, and India has capitalized on it. 

20:17 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 15 overs IND 113/4

Janat has been brought into the attack for the first time in the game. Zadran, with that last overs, has exhausted the quota of his fifth bowler. Only time will tell if it was the only over from Janat or if it is some plan to bowl him through the death overs. 

20:13 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 14.2 overs IND 106/4

Can India get to 180 from here on? It is to be seen. The wicket is getting better as the evening progresses. With the dew coming in the second innings, it might be easier to bat and tricky for spinners to bowl.

20:07 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 13.1 overs IND 97/4

After two ducks in a row, Rohit scored a fifty now. It has not been one of his most fluent innings; however, he played according to the team's requirements. The momentum has swung quite significantly here in the last 15 minutes or so. 

20:03 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 12.1 overs IND 86/4

This has been a much-improved performance from Afghanistan compared to the last two games, where they were battered in all departments. However, the job still needs to be done. There is a need to restrict India to a below-par total first if they have to win this game.

19:59 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 11 overs IND 65/4

Quais is in the middle of a brilliant spell here. The Indian batters seem to be struggling to pick the bowler. He is bowling quicker through the air and keeping the batters from lining him up. 

19:54 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 10 overs IND 61/4

We have reached the first water break, and India did well not to lose another one after the Powerplay. However, they are still way behind this game and both Rohit and Rinku need to take the bowling on post powerplay if India has to post a defendable total on the board.

19:49 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 9.2 overs IND 58/4

Rinku Singh survives a close call. Qais' delivery hit the pad of the batter, for which he pleaded, and after taking a long time, the umpire gave it out. However, Rinku sent it upstairs, and there was a spike on the ultra edge, and the decision was overturned. 

19:43 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 8.1 overs IND 49/4

Debutant Saleem has been brought into the attack, and he let all the pressure go on the batters as he delivered an expensive over. He bowled a loose one to Rohit and Rinku both were delivered into the stands. 

19:38 (IST)
17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 6.1 overs IND 30/4

Rohit is getting a bit impatient here. He is trying to play reverse sweeps, which he generally doesn't tend to do. The wicket is slower than anticipated, and the batters at the moment are struggling to cope with it.

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 6.1 overs IND 30/4

How often do we see only two bowlers being used in the Powerplay? Well, it has been that sort of day for the Afghans. They just kept chipping away as the Indians continued to play shots. Sundar is the only recognized batter left if a wicket were to fall here.

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 5.2 overs IND 26/4

Sanju Samson tried to pull the ball off the very first ball, and he departed for a duck as the ball went high in the air because of the lack of timing. Ahmad has now picked up his third wicket in his third over. Rinku Singh has entered the middle, and India needs to build a partnership.

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 4.1 overs IND 21/3

Omarzai picks up Dube. The ball moved just a touch away and got the outside edge of the batter. The wicket is stopping a bit at the moment, making it difficult to play shots for the batters. India is in a lot of trouble at the moment.

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 3.2 overs IND 19/2

Ahmed delivers a brilliant second over as he picks Jaiswal and Kohli for a duck in the same over. Both the players tried to play big shots but could not get their timing right. In form, Shivam Dube has walked in; the onus is on home to play well once again.

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 2.1 overs IND 17/0

Omarzai has taken the new ball from the other end. There has been not a lot of swing and the ball is coming on nicely onto the bat. We have to wait and see how the pitch will play when the spinners are introduced.

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: After 1.3 overs IND 13/0

We had an eventful first over as Ahmed, trying to swing the ball, drifted a couple down the pads, and Rohit tucks it down the leg-side for two boundaries. One of which, despite coming off the bat, the umpire gives it a leg-bye; hence, Rohit is still yet to get off the mark in the series.

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Let's go

There are small boundaries here. India is batting first. Expect plenty of runs today. Afghanistan is playing a weakened bowling attack. The likes of Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal will be licking their lips, given the ground's dimensions and the wicket's nature.

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Nick Knight, in his pitch report

The square boundaries are 60m and 66m respectively, 70m straighter one. The pitch looks hard and firm, there are a lot of cracks with some grass covering. It could be a bit two paced, it'll be a good pitch, win the toss and bat first

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Ibrahim Zadran at the toss

We wanted to bowl first. We have taken some positives from the series, we'll try for a few more today. We have got three changes as well

17 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 3rd T20: Rohit Sharma at the toss

We will bat first. We bowled in the first two games, so we'll bat today. Nothing to do with the wicket, just want to try some combinations and give some chances. We have ticked a few boxes, this is another opportunity to try new faces. We have made three changes -Sanju, Avesh and Kuldeep are in.

‘Bowlers have nothing to lose with short boundaries’: Arshdeep Singh ahead of 3rd T20I against Afghanistan in Bangalore

Arshdeep Singh offered a wry smile as he heard a fairly obvious question asked of a bowler before a T20I at the Chinnaswamy Stadium. How did he expect to prevail at a ground with infamously smaller boundaries? His answer offered an insight into the mind of a modern T20 bowler.

“As bowlers, we feel, we have nothing to lose here. The batsmen are always eyeing more and more boundaries, and that’s where we get an opening in the game – you can get more wickets. I guess, when the wicket is flat and the boundaries are short, there are more options of getting the wickets, so you’re always on your toes,” India’s left-arm quick said ahead of the third T20I against Afghanistan in at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Tuesday.
