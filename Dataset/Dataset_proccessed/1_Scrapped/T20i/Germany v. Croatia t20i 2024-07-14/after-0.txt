Jersey Evening Post by Elliot Corbel on 12th July 2024

INTER-insular fever has struck the Channel Islands again as the Jersey women’s national cricketers welcome their Guernsey counterparts to Grainville on Sunday.

New women’s coach Darren Thomas will experience his first taste of the Channel Island rivalry, as his young and exciting side face their old rivals in a T20 format match, scheduled for a 1pm start. Thomas said: “The girls are in a good space. “I’ve been impressed since taking the role on and we are all thoroughly looking forward to the challenge. “We won the fixture last year, but we will not take Guernsey lightly. “The inter-insular obviously brings its own motivations, so we will be going into it with positive mindsets and we are hoping for a strong performance.”
Captain Chloe Greechan also commented, saying: “We’re really looking forward to this one. “The Jersey-Guernsey rivalry is always a fixture we want to take part in, both us and the Guernsey girls. “We have it in our hands from last year and have had the better of them in recent times, but we never let that get to our heads. “We’re still a really young team, which feels weird considering how long we’ve all been playing together now. “With our massive tournament in Germany just two weeks away now, we want to use Sunday as an opportunity to sharpen our match fitness and skills. “We have been training really hard and want to put all our hard work on display. “There’s going to be a good crowd, as there always is for the inter-insular, so we’re excited to experience that again, especially here in Jersey. “Hopefully we can go out there, retain the trophy and put in a really solid and clinical performance.”

‘Sarnians happy despite suffering 104-run defeat’ by Jamie Ingrouille Guernsey Press 20th July 2024

It was far from doom and gloom in the Guernsey camp after their 104-run defeat in the women’s T20 inter insular. Guernsey captain Krista de la Mare was not expecting her side to win in Grainville, such is the current strength of the Jersey women’s team, but any improvement on the previous year’s results was welcome. De la Mare therefore returned from the sister isle happy enough to have closed the gap – together with taking several other positives. ‘It’s always a funny one with Jersey, because before Covid we were better than them and they had a very yong team of 12, 13-year-olds,’ she said. ‘They’ve developed and we’ve stood still. All of these 12 and 13-year-olds are now 15, 16, 17 and playing at a really high standard. We went into the weekend knowing we would probably have to pull it out of the bag and play the best cricket we have ever played to beat them. It’s not about the result. It’s more about the other things we can get out of it.’

Action began with the Guernsey women playing their first T10 match at this level, which also fell firmly in Jersey’s favour – by 66 runs. It provided an opportunity for relative newcomers Fiona Trabold and Rachel Merrien to gain exposure to this level of cricket. ‘It was great experience for them,’ de la Mare added.

In the T20 Jersey were first to bat and flew out of the blocks en route to a daunting score of 157. All-rounder Charlie Miles made a massive impact, scoring a very impressive 68 runs off just 42 balls – including nine boundaries. Excelling for the Sarnians was teenage leg-spinner Molly Robinson who took four wickets for just 15 runs. De la Mare had also stood out individually with four dismissals behind the stumps. ‘We bowled them all out in a T20, which is something we could not have achieved last year.’

Chasing a lofty target of 157, Philippa Stahelin, Hannah Eulenkamp and Fran Bulpitt all contributed at least 10 runs to the losing cause. De la Mare now hopes they can build on this ahead of next month’s Nordic Cup ICC tournament. ‘Happy despite the result and we have taken a lot of positives and a lot of things we now need to work on. It was productive and we got a lot out of it. Onwards to Oslo.’
