KATHMANDU: Nepal is gearing up to clash with the Netherlands in today's match as part of the tri-nation T20 series.

The highly anticipated match will kick off at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground in Kirtipur at 11:30 this morning.

Nepal, having secured only one victory in the previous three matches of the tri-nation T20 cricket series involving Namibia and the Netherlands, is eyeing a crucial win today to secure a spot in the series final.

In their last outing, Nepal clinched a thrilling victory against Namibia by a margin of three runs in the third match last Friday.

However, their journey in the series has been marked by losses, having been defeated by Namibia by 20 runs in the first match and suffering a narrow two-run loss against the Netherlands in the second encounter.

Currently, the Netherlands leads the series standings with four points, having emerged victorious in both matches played thus far.

Nepal and Namibia trail behind with two points each. Nepal holds the second position in terms of run rate, with Namibia at the bottom of the score table.

With the series reaching a crucial juncture, Nepal's cricket enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating a spirited performance from their team as they aim to secure a spot in the series final with a victory against the Netherlands today.
