KATHMANDU: The Netherlands has set a modest target of 121 runs for Nepal to secure victory in a match of the tri-nations T20 International series.

Opting to bat first after winning the toss, the Dutch side faced Nepal's bowling attack. Nepal managed to restrict the Netherlands to 120 runs, losing all their wickets in 19.3 overs.

Pratish GC led Nepal's bowling charge, claiming three wickets, while Karan KC and Kushal Malla contributed with two wickets each.

On the batting front, the Dutch team struggled to build substantial partnerships as key players Max O’Down, Michael Levitt, and Sybrand Engelbrecht were dismissed for 31, 4, and a duck, respectively.
