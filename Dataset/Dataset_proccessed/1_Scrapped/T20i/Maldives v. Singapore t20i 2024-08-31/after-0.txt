Football Association of Malawi (Fam) Vice President Madalitso Christopher Kuyera has said the demand for local coaches to obtain a Caf B Coaching Licence is high.

Kuyera disclosed this during the opening of a month long Caf B coaching course at Mpira Village in Blantyre on Thursday, saying the main agenda of the course was to ensure that there is a quality rather than quantity in the coaching set up.

The former Southern Region Football Association treasurer said the course will go a long way in helping coaches to acquire modern knowledge in football.

“Football has changed such that we need to have quality coaches with modern knowledge. As Fam, we are geared to help our local coaches with knowledge to transform the game,” Kuyera said.

Fam Technical Director Benjamin Kumwenda highlighted that a total of 25 football coaches, three women and 22 men, are undergoing the Caf B course.

Kumwenda said the association’s former technical director John Kaputa who is Caf instructor will be in-charge of the exercise.

“It is a long project and we are hopeful that this course will help us to have quality coaches who will transform the game of football,” Kumwenda said.

On his part National Football Coaches Association Chairperson Aubrey Nankhuni thanked Fam for organising the CAF B coaching course as this will ease pressure for coaches who have been waiting to get the license.

“My association is aiming at producing quality coaches by 2026. I have no doubt that this group of coaches will be more advanced with the new system of coaching style,” Nankhuni said.

The last time Fam conducted Caf B course was in 2022.
