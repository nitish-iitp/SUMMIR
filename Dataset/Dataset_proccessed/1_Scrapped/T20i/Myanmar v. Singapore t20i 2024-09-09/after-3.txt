Indian Rupee Second-Worst Performing Asian Currency in August 2024 Due to High Dollar Demand and Equity Outflows 
The Indian rupee was the second-worst-performing Asian currency in August 2024 after the Bangladeshi taka due to strong dollar demand and outflows from domestic equities.
It depreciated by 0.2% during the month.
The two were the only Asian currencies that experienced a decline against the US dollar over the month.
The rupee settled at Rs 83.86 per dollar.

Key Highlights :

Current Financial Year (FY25): The rupee has depreciated by 0.6% so far in the current financial year.
It was the third most stable Asian currency against the US dollar in FY24, following the Hong Kong dollar and Singapore dollar.
Factors Affecting the Rupee: The depreciation was influenced by a slowdown in Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) inflows, particularly in the equity segment, and increased dollar demand from importers.
Previous Financial Year (FY24):The rupee depreciated by 1.5% over FY24, a significant improvement compared to the 7.8% depreciation in FY23.
Stability was largely due to timely intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
Calendar Year 2023:The rupee showed remarkable stability against the dollar, experiencing the least volatility in nearly three decades.
It had a marginal depreciation of 0.5% against the US dollar during 2023.
Historical Context: The last time the rupee exhibited such stability was in 1994 when it appreciated by 0.4%
World Bank advises India to reassess RCEP decision to achieve $1 trillion export target        
The World Bank, urged India to re-evaluate its regional integration strategy, including its decision not to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), as part of its plan to achieve the $1 trillion export target by 2030.
India has opted out of major trade agreements like RCEP, while neighbouring countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have shown interest in joining this East Asian trade and global value chain (GVC) hub.

Key Highlights :

Re-evaluating Trade Strategy: As other South Asian economies explore trade agreements outside the region, India may need to reassess its position on regional integration, particularly regarding RCEP.
India's Withdrawal from RCEP: India pulled out of RCEP negotiations in 2019 after initial talks began in 2013, primarily due to concerns about market access and competition.
RCEP Members: The RCEP consists of 10 ASEAN members (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Laos, and Vietnam) along with six Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partners (China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand).
India’s Existing FTAs: India already has functional FTAs with 13 out of 15 RCEP members, with the exceptions being China and New Zealand.
