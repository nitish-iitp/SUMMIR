Singapore form

Singapore has been inconsistent, managing only an assortment of wins and losses throughout their last five matches. They won their latest, but before that was a defeat. Before the defeat was another loss, coming after a win, and before those another victory. The recent performances have reflected both the highs and the challenges in being resilient yet needing improvement in areas.

In Match 16 of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup Asia Sub-Regional Qualifier A, Singapore won by 5 wickets against Kuwait. Kuwait, batting first, managed 152 for 9 in their 20 overs. For Singapore, Kalimuthu Ramesh had the best bowling figures: 5 wickets for 21 runs in his 4 overs. The others useful bowler was Harsha Bharadwaj, who had figures of 2 for 16, while Akshay Roopak Puri had 1 for 30. Singhapore chased 153 and reached 156 for 5 in 18.5 overs. William Simpson with an unbeaten 46 off 39 balls was ably supported by Anish Paraam's 41 off 23 balls and Surendran Chandramohan not out 30 off 17 as Singhapore won comfortably.

Myanmar form

Myanmar's form of late has indeed been pretty tough, with this run of four consecutive defeats in the last five matches and only one win. In the wake of a small resurgence with just a single victory, Myanmar continued to struggle for a steady performance as they have suffered consecutive defeats. The recent matches of Myanmar are representative of a tough period for them in trying to build momentum with stable performances.

In Match 15 of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup Asia Sub-Regional Qualifier A, Myanmar lost the contest by a thumping margin of 9 wickets against the Maldives. Myanmar batted first and got bowled out for 51 runs in 17 overs. Htet Lin Oo was their main contributor, making 14 runs from 18 balls, while Pyae Phyo Wai added 9 runs off 23 balls and captain Htet Lin Aung scored 5 runs from 14 balls. The Maldives chased down the modest target comfortably, reaching 52 for 1 in 5.3 overs. Pyae Phyo Wai managed to take Myanmar's only wicket, giving away 14 runs in his 2 overs. Paing Danu and Thura Aung bowled an over each but wicket-less. The emphatic win from Maldives lifts them in the standings while Myanmar go in search of answers to deal with what's happening at present.

Expert Tips & Prediction Singapore vs Myanmar

The pitch at the Bayuemas Oval in Kuala Lumpur is known to have great pace and bounce, which makes it decent for fast bowlers. While the conditions still remain decent enough for pace bowlers, average batting conditions take away from it and spin bowlers get decent assistance on this surface. This is a decent pitch which has something for everyone but the pace still holds the premium.

Kuala Lumpur: Malaysia Probable Weather during match timing: overcast, 30°C. The sky will be absolutely clouded; 68 percent of rain chances can be experienced under the wind blowing around 13.10 km/h. Conditions are all bound to be clouded, with a very proper chance of rain intervening in the play.

With such great preparation for their next match, Singapore remains so confident in turning these strong performances into a winning streak. Backed by a strong lineup and impressive recent form, Singapore will be well placed for another win to come their way in the game. Their balanced squad and strategic approach will be what they need to pursue further success.
