Springboks head coach Rassie Erasmus laughing.

Rassie Erasmus left the press room in hysterics after recounting a hilarious incident during the Springboks’ victory over the All Blacks on Saturday.

South Africa emerged 18-12 triumphant over New Zealand in Cape Town at the weekend, taking them a step closer to claiming the Rugby Championship title.

But Erasmus was left red-faced in front of a supporter just prior to the match when he needed to go to the toilet.

Erasmus’ embarrassing moment

“I don’t know if it is appropriate but our coaches box is up there [at the top of the stadium]. I’ve got this medication that makes me want to go to the toilet quite often,” he said.

“As I went into the coaches’ box, I thought, ‘Na, I’m not going to make this first half’, but the coaches’ box is right near the public area.

“There are toilets there, a man’s and a woman’s, and the man’s queue was long. There was a lady stood there and she said: ‘You can go in [the women’s].’

“There was a lady in the bathroom, who was dressed – everything was fine – and I said: ‘Listen, I must get back to the coaches box.’ She said she would turn around but then I got stage fright!”

Rassie Erasmus addresses the Springboks lineout issues and where it went wrong against the All Blacks

Rassie Erasmus ahs revelaed that due to the meds he is on he is constantly going to the bathroom.

During the first half, he ended up trying to go in the women's bathroom to save time and ended up getting stage fright in front of a fan😂😂😂😂

Erasmus was referencing the “vibe” of the Cape Town crowd by telling that tale after the supporters once again played an important part in the victory.

A week after the fans in Johannesburg roared the Springboks on as they came from 27-17 behind to claim a stunning win over the All Blacks, they were also incredibly loud on Saturday.

They stuck with the team despite seeing South Africa go into the break 9-3 behind due to three Damian McKenzie penalties.

The Boks produced an excellent second period as Siya Kolisi and Malcolm Marx touched down to earn an 18-12 triumph on Saturday.

Is the current Springboks team the greatest South African team of all-time?
Yes
No

‘They’re always happy’

“That’s the vibe, the people just carried on. The one guy was like a police officer rolling me back to the coaches’ box. It was lovely what the crowd do,” Erasmus said.

“You feel that, even when it’s not going well; they keep on singing. That’s maybe the difference between the Cape Town crowd and some other crowds.

“They’re always happy, even while you’re losing, and that’s nice. Ellis Park was also amazing last week.”
