England's Bazball was given a reality check by the Indian team as Ben Stokes & Co. suffered a 434-run defeat at the hands of Rohit Sharma's side in the 3rd Test of the 5-match series. Despite going 1-2 down in the series, some England players including the veteran James Anderson and opening batter Ben Duckett have been making bold statements that haven't gone down well with some of the legends of the game. Former England captain Michael Vaughan, one of those displeased by the touring team's performance and comments, launched a scathing attack, calling some of the comments 'disrespectful'.

In his column for The Telegraph, Vaughan called out Anderson and Duckett for their bizarre statements, especially the latter for suggesting that England should get credit for Yashasvi Jaiswal's attacking batting.

"Listen to them, and you would think nothing is ever wrong. Jimmy Anderson said they would chase 600 in Vizag. Ben Duckett said "the more the better" in terms of their target this week, but they fell 434 short. Duckett also reckons they deserve credit for the way Yashasvi Jaiswal is batting as if no player in history has ever played an attacking shot.

"They talk about not playing for the draw, but to me, that's disrespectful to Test cricket. The draw is a crucial part of the game, and in five-Test contest has often provided the bedrock of some great series victories," Vaughan wrote.

The retired cricketer feels Ben Stokes' team is living in a 'bubble', but need to come down to the ground and face reality as Test cricket isn't just about 'fun'.

"They have to be careful that people around don't think they are smug, or above their station. Root's shot was another reminder that they are in a bubble. All that matters is their dressing room, and fun. There is a bit more to Test cricket than that," he said.

"This England team is hell-bent on doing things their way, and "saving Test cricket". They are giving Test cricket a shot in the arm because they are so exciting. But ultimately they have to be better than that now. They didn't win in New Zealand, they didn't win the Ashes, and if they carry on like this, they are going to lose in India. As a team, you are judged on series victories," Vaughan asserted.
