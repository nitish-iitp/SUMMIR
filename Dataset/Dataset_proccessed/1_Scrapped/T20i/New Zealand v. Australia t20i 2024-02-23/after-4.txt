New Zealand vs Australia Live Score: AUS exceptional performance 

New Zealand vs Australia Live Score: An exceptional display by the Australian team secures their victory in the series. Initially, New Zealand seemed poised to achieve the given score. Despite Australia's commendable batting performance, they appeared somewhat short on runs, giving New Zealand an advantageous position as they entered the chase. Unfortunately, their prospects were hindered by Conway's injury, and the subsequent struggles of other batsmen, including Mitchell Santner, who took on the challenge at number 3. The continuous loss of wickets created a challenging situation for New Zealand, and despite Glenn Phillips being their last ray of hope, even he succumbed in the end. The home team's performance did not meet the expectations one would have anticipated.

New Zealand vs Australia Live Score:New Zealand fight back as Australia out for 174 in second T20

Nz vs Aus Live Score: Opener Travis Head blazed 45 runs off 22 balls but Australia collapsed to be dismissed for 174 in the second Twenty20 international against New Zealand on Friday in Auckland.

The home side, inspired by the pace bowling of Lockie Ferguson, need to score 175 to square the three-match series after Australia won game one by six wickets in Wellington.

Ferguson took 4-12 from 3.5 overs, including two wickets in the final over, as Australia's innings ended with one ball remaining.

New Zealand won the toss but were on the back foot in the opening overs as Head struck five sixes and two fours, taking advantage of the short boundaries at Eden Park and some wayward early bowling.

The tourists reached 85-1 in the seventh over following the early departure of Steve Smith for 11 but their innings lost direction after Head was bowled by Ben Sears.

Five wickets fell in the space of five overs through the middle stages, with only 26 from captain Mitchell Marsh maintaining the early momentum.

Pat Cummins struck five fours further down the order in scoring 28.

Ferguson bowled with pace and accuracy, getting good support from Adam Milne, Sears and skipper Mitchell Santner, who all took two wickets.

Both teams made three changes.

Will Young, Trent Boult and Sears came into New Zealand's side while Australia recalled Smith, Matthew Wade and Nathan Ellis.

Nz vs Aus Live Score: ‘Want to be a multi-faceted, versatile cricketer’, says NZ's Rachin Ravindra

Ahead of the second T20I against Australia, New Zealand's rising sensation Rachin Ravindra said on Thursday that he is not only aiming to play the ICC T20 World Cup for the Kiwis, but also in becoming a "multi-faceted versatile cricketer".

Rachin has had really nice last five-six months or so, making an impact during the ICC Cricket World Cup in India with 578 runs in 10 innings, including three tons and two fifties. After some exposure to Test cricket, he finally played a breakthrough knock of 240 against South Africa in the first Test recently and now against Australia in the first T20I, he scored his first T20I fifty, 68 in 35 balls, with two fours and six sixes.

Now having made some strong performances in all formats of the game and after earning an Indian Premier League (IPL) deal of ₹1.8 crores with five-time champions Chennai Super Kings (CSK), Ravindra has his eyes set on not only the T20 WC, but also proving his versatility. Ravindra wants to take each game as a learning experience and help the team win and has left selection in the hands of selectors.

"Not even just looking at the T20 World Cup, being a multi-faceted versatile cricketer is what I want to be. A genuine allrounder who can help the team in different ways and affect the game in different ways. That [selection] will all take care of itself; I am not too worried about that sort of stuff," said Ravindra as quoted by ESPNCricinfo.

"If I can take each game as a learning experience and drive the team forward, that is what matters to me. If that cumulates in selection, then great. If it does not, that is okay. I have got a lot of time ahead of me," he added.
