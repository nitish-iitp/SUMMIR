NZ vs AUS, 2nd T20I Highlights: An improved performance from Adam Zampa saw Australia beat New Zealand by 72 runs in the second T20I in Auckland and clinch the three-match series on Friday. Zampa returned figures of 4/34 as New Zealand were bowled out for 102 while chasing Australia's 174-run total. Glenn Phillips did well for his 35-ball 42 but had no support from the other batters. Earlier, Travis Head hit a quickfire 45 to lead Australia's charge, before Lockie Ferguson's sensational figures of 4/12 sparked a batting collapse. (Scorecard)

That is it! Australia clinch the series. The Kiwis will hope for a consolation prize as they meet again on the 25th of this month for the final T20I. Join us at 5.30 am IST (12 am GMT). Join us for the build up. Cheers!

!

Pat Cummins is the Man of the Match. Says a lot of batters mistimed it. Adds he loves to play not as a captain. Shares the wicket helped their bowlers a bit and they enjoyed bowling.

!

Australia got away with the bat. The pitch was made up for a score of around 200. However, few of their batters played cameos which made a huge difference. Travis Head, Pat Cummins, Tim David played a handy knock to get a decent total. With the ball, Australia were right on the money with the start! All of them ended with a wicket each but the star of the show was Adam Zampa who ended with four wickets.

!

A fantastic performance from the Aussies and they win the series! New Zealand would have taken this score at the start. Australia were decent with the bat and looked a bit short of runs so New Zealand headed into the chase with an upper hand. However, they were dealt with Conway's injury. The other batters though didn't start well. Mitchell Santner promoted himself at number 3 but he struggled too. New Zealand kept on losing wickets. Glenn Phillips was their last hope but he too fell in the end. Not the performance you would hope from the home team.

!

No more participation from the injured player and there's absent hurt written against the name of Devon Conway.
