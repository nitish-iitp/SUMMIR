PREVIEW

Mali will take on Lesotho in the 11th match of the Mens T20 World Cup Africa Qualifier A. Mali are bottom of the table with two losses in two matches. On the other hand, Lesotho have lost all their three matches and will be keen to bounce back. This should be a closely fought game between these two sides.
