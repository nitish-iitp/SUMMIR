SA20 Auction: Who are the key players in the auction?
New Zealand opener Martin Guptill, Sri Lankan allrounder Kamindu Mendis, and Afghan wrist-spinner Qais Ahmad are among the notable international players on the shortlist.
Reeza Hendricks, released by the Super Kings, is the most notable South African in the shortlist, alongside fellow opener Tony de Zorzi.
"Some of the biggest names on the international T20 circuit have already signed up for season 3 and I am looking forward to see how the teams finalise their squads from this competitive auction list of players," Graeme Smith, the former South Africa captain and current SA20 commissioner, said.
SA20 Auction: What is the squad size limit?
Each squad must have 19 players, including a minimum of 10 South Africans, a maximum of seven international players, a rookie, and a wildcard player. All franchises, except the Super Kings, have announced their wildcard picks. The Super Kings have until December 30 to name their wildcard player.
The Paarl Royals have selected former India wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik as their wildcard. Having retired from Indian and international cricket in June, Karthik will be the first Indian to compete in the SA20.
SA20 Auction: When is the auction?
The SA20 Auction and Rookie Draft will take place on October 1. The auction will be broadcast live on SuperSport (Sub-Saharan Africa), Viacom (India) and Sky Sports (UK) from 1615 SAST (1945 IST/1445 GMT/1015 EST).
The tournament is scheduled to begin on January 9. Incidentally, it coincides with Australia’s Big Bash League, UAE's ILT20, and New Zealand's Super Smash.

Who is a 'rookie'?
Rookie is defined by the league as a South African player aged 22 or below on the day of the auction and who has never been contracted by a SA20 franchise before.
Players who meet this criteria can be bought during the regular auction stage. If not chosen in the regular auction, then they will be eligible for the Rookie Draft.
Rookie players have a set value, and each team must sign a youngster and it is deducted from their salary cap.
Who is a wildcard?
A wildcard in the SA20 is a South African or international player whose fee is not included in the Salary Cap. The deadline for naming a wildcard is 30 December 2024.
