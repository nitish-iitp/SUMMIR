VAN DER WALT

A weekend away from the

track doesn’t always mean

a weekend off for Formula

1, as Alpine grapples to come to

terms with the A524 that doesn’t

appear to be as “aggressive” as

Alpine’s technical director, Matt

Harman, has described it when it

first launched back in February.

Alpine currently find themselves dead last in the championship with no points and having

to brave the embarrassment of

having to retire a car on the first

lap of last Sunday’s Saudi Arabian

Grand Prix.

The latest in a long line to jump

the Alpine ship is the team’s

advisor Bob Bell. He follows

Matt Harman, the team’s technical director, and their head of

aerodynamics, Dirk de Beer, out

the door.

After the latter mentioned resignations, Alpine were quick

to announce a “restructuring”

which will see a three-way split of

the team’s technical responsibilities as they hired three separate

technical directors.

With Joe Burnell at the helm

of engineering, David Wheater

steering aerodynamics and

Ciaron Pilbeam responsible for

performance, Alpine hope to

get ahead in their fight with RB,

Kick Sauber and Williams – all

still fighting to get a single point

on the board.

If Alpine is able to claw their

way back to where they were

last year, there’s still no guarantee that they may outperform

Aston Martin, scoring less than

half the points of the fifth-place

finisher in ending sixth last year.

• The F1 world is still ablaze

after the phenomenal drive of

the Brit Ollie Bearman for Ferrari

after his last-minute replacement

of Carlos Sainz in Saudi Arabia.

Whether the musical chairs set

off by Hamilton’s move to Ferrari

might leave Bearman in a permanent seat remains to be seen,

as rumours of Kimi Antonelli’s

move to F1 have been hampered

by Mercedes team boss Toto

Wolff’s admission that he may

have “talked too much” about

Antonelli.

• Another driver lacking in lustre

appeared to be Daniel Ricciardo –

and it’s not just for his race pace.

The Australian landed himself in

hot water with his zealous female

fan base after describing misconduct allegations of a sexual nature

against Red Bull’s team principal

Christian Horner as “noise” and

“distractions”.

Ricciardo’s normally ardent audience were quick to share their

disappointment in his comments

online and flocked to his comments section on social media to

take him to task. Every attempt

by the RB team to celebrate International Women’s Day, left

fans unimpressed.

Williams’ team principal, James

Vowles, alongside McLaren CEO

Zak Brown and Mercedes lead

driver Lewis Hamilton, emerged

as the champions for women’s

rights. Vowles told the media that

F1 should, precisely due to its

reputation as a “boys club”, make

more of an effort to create a space

in which women are welcomed.

Hamilton said the recent offtrack drama “affects everybody”, noting that it may

shine a negative light on

the sport and all stakeholders involved.

• Rumours are still

rife that several key

players like Red

Bull’s chief technical director and

advisor Helmut

Marko may call it

a day. The defending world champion Max Verstappen is said to be close

behind Marko as he allegedly has

a release clause that stipulates

that he may exit his contract if

Marko leaves the team. Lights Out
