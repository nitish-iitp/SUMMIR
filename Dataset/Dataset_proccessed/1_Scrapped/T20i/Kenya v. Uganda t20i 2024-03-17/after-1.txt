If ever there was a plane firing on all 12 cylinders, it would be the Baby Spar Proteas who are yet to lose a match in the Netball World Youth Cup 2025 Africa Regional Qualifiers, boasting a health leaderboard advantage and a massive goal difference after their latest win at the University of Pretoria on Wednesday, 20 March, 2024.

Precious Mthembu’s charges came into match day four remarkably high in confidence after bagging four wins in so many matches, however their counterparts Malawi were also yet to lose a match in three games.

Ruthless Baby Proteas Extend World Cup Africa Qualifiers Winning Streak

Based on how both teams have played to date, one would expect this encounter to be a very feisty affairs, but it was the Baby Proteas who were superior and more tactically disciplined in the first quarter, and after fifteen minutes, South Africa enjoyed a ten-point lead, ending the quarter 14-4.

The second quarter was no different as the Baby Proteas continued to apply more pressure on Malawi, who were also refusing to back down from this challenge, and it became a very physical affair, frustrating Prinsloo at the South African shooting circle. 

The pressure paid dividends, restricting the Baby Proteas to only nine goals, but the pressure was also applied firmly in response by SA, resulting in Malawi only managing to score four goals, for a half-time scoreboard at 23-8 in favour of the tournament hosts.

Head Coach Mthembu made some tactical changes upfront during the championship quarter to give Prinsloo and Ingwersen some rest, introducing Renezia Andrews and Zané Bodenstein to court. 

This move seemed to pay off, with the Baby Proteas taking the quarter 10-4 and bringing the overall score to 33-12.

With the last fifteen minutes left to play, the Baby Proteas kept their discipline in what appeared to be a hard game with Malawi’s physicality, but in the end, they grabbed the much-needed victory taking the match 44-19.

In the first match of the day, Tanzania faced off against Zimbabwe. Tanzania were still in search of their first win of the tournament, and Zimbabwe were also looking at bouncing back from their loss against Namibia the night before, but it was Zimbabwe that won the match 62-17.

The day’s middle match featured Zambia against Kenya, with the former having enjoyed a rest day on Tuesday after double fixtures on Monday but with only a single win in their three encounters, while Kenya had no wins in three matches, including two demoralising defeats the day before. 

In the final summary, Zambia’s fresher legs were the dividing factor, allowing them a generous 52-32 win over Kenya, now four matches without a win.
