T20 World Cup, Bangladesh vs Zimbabwe Highlights: The T20 World Cup Super 12 Group 2 match between Zimbabwe and Bangladesh was truly one of a kind, and it was Shakib's side that managed to win the contest by three runs. On the final ball, the batter failed to connect and it seemed like Bangladesh registered a victory by four runs, the players had shaken hands and everyone was back in the dugout. But late drama unfolded, with replays showing that the keeper had collected the ball in front of stumps, and the ball was deemed a no-ball. However, the players returned and in the end, Bangladesh wrapped up a three-run win. (SCORECARD)

Here are the Highlights of the T20 World Cup match between Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, straight from The Gabba, Brisbane:

No third umpire needed to say this game comes to an end now. Officially! But don't go anywhere as we have Pakistan versus Netherlands coming up. Switch the tabs and join us there. Cheers!

!

Taskin Ahmed is the Player of the Match. He says they all were nervous as they had to get back to the ground after all the drama but they enjoyed the game. Adds he has never seen this type of game. Shares that he is just focusing on the process. Reckons he is enjoying the pitch in Australia as it is helping the seamers. Ends by saying they have a good bunch of fast bowlers and they are improving..

!

...Presentation coming up...

!

Earlier in the day, after electing to bat, on the back of a half ton from Shanto, Bangladesh got to a competitive total. They ran through Zimbabwe's top order but Williams fought a lone battle. However, it was Bangladesh who came out on top as they held their nerve towards the end.

!

For Zimbabwe, Williams fought a long battle. Yes, he got support from Burl but they needed their top order to bat better. That was not the case though but credit to them for the character they showed. They just did not give up. Excellent.

!

Mustafizur Rahman and Taskin Ahmed were brilliant for Bangladesh but the others really took a beating. Had it not been for the 8 overs bowled from the two above, we could have had a different winner. Those 8 overs won the game for Bangladesh.

!

Bangladesh were brilliant with the new ball. They did the damage early on as they got 4 wickets in no time. Sean Williams then played well along with Regis Chakabva first and then Ryan Burl to revive hopes. Williams was brilliant, he scored a fine half ton and got the equation down to 26 needed in the last two. A piece of brilliance from Shakib saw the back of him. However, Zimbabwe were still in it thanks to Burl as they needed 16 from the last over. They started believing more when it came down to 5 from 2 balls. The drama does not end here. It seemed like Hossain got two wickets in two balls to seal the deal but the last one was deemed as a no ball. It came down to 4 needed on the last ball but it was Hossain who kept his cool to come out on top.

!

The last couple of overs had more twists than a spiral! What a game that turned out to be! Never really thought it would get that close. Credit to Zimbabwe to show the fight they did but it was Bangladesh who held their nerve and have bagged vital two points.

MOSADDEK HOSSAIN TO BLESSING MUZARABANI

THIS TIME IT IS CLEAN! BANGLADESH WIN. OHH MAN, WHAT A GAME! Muted celebrations from Nurul Hasan as this time he collects the ball. No drama this time and Bangladesh win the game. Tossed up, outside off. Blessing Muzarabani swings hard again only to miss it. BANGLADESH WIN BY 3 RUNS.

!

What drama! What drama! All the players are off the field, shaking hands and NOT OUT flashes on the big screen followed by NO BALL! The stumps have to be put back again and the players are recalled. Bangladesh players have a shocked look on their face. Game on, game well and truly on. 4 needed.

MOSADDEK HOSSAIN TO BLESSING MUZARABANI

NO BALL! What have you done NURUL HASAN! What have you just done! This is out of the script. The Bangla players were celebrating, eventually shaking hands and almost it was time to end the game but the third umpire had other plans because Nurul Hasan collected the ball in front of the stumps. No ball it is. Tossed up, outside off. Blessing Muzarabani swings across and misses. Nurul Hasan whips the bails off. Blessing Muzarabani was clearly out of his crease. The umpire takes it upstairs. The replay shows Nurul Hasan collected the ball in front of the stumps. Blessing Muzarabani has a chance to win the game.

!

5 runs needed off the last ball. Blessing Muzarabani comes out to bat. Can he be the hero?

MOSADDEK HOSSAIN TO RICHARD NGARAVA

OUT! STUMPED! Richard Ngarava is gone! We have another twist! Mosaddek Hossain slows it a bit, this is full and outside off. Richard Ngarava comes down the track only to connect to the thin air around as he fails to hit the ball. Nurul Hasan is quick to remove the bails.

MOSADDEK HOSSAIN TO RICHARD NGARAVA

FOUR! Zimbabwe still in the game! Short and angling on middle. Richard Ngarava looks to pull but gets the faintest of edge and it races into the third man fence.

MOSADDEK HOSSAIN TO BRAD EVANS

OUT! TAKEN! Evans goes! Flatter, slower in the air and on middle. Evans heaves but he was targeting the longer side. Afif Hossain at deep mid-wicket is well placed and holds onto it. Good catch. Mosaddek Hossain has started well.

MOSADDEK HOSSAIN TO RYAN BURL

Leg bye!  Tossed up, sliding on the pads. Burl misses his pull. It goes off the pads to short third man for a leg bye. 15 needed now.

!
