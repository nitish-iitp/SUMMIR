Namibia vs Scotland Commentary
10:42 PM IST That is all from this game! The action keeps on coming from the World Cup. Join us for yet another match as Canada take on Ireland on the 7th of this month at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT). Join us early for the build up. Cheers!
10:41 PM IST Matthew Cross comes in place of Richie Berrington and shares the skipper has a bit of cramps. Tells they have a chance to go in the next rounf and need to win next two games. Mentions they have few bruises today but in the end the job is done. Admits Michael Leask is a guy who lets his bat do the talk. Reckons they are taking one game at a time but are looking forward  to win both matches.
10:39 PM IST Merwe Erasmus says it is a big rivalry between these team and it did slipped this time. Shares it would have been sweet had his fifty would have come on the winning side. Tells a couple of players have developed and have done well to play on the big stage.
10:37 PM IST ...Presentation...
10:35 PM IST Michael Leask wins the Player of the Match award. He says he just repayed the faith to a lot of people had on them. Adds this one feels special as they lost a couple of wickets and it got tough but his role was to find gaps and hit hard, not to over complicated. Shares he just waited for the bad ball and put some pressure on Namibia.
10:34 PM IST Namibia bowled well for most parts. They began well with the new ball and got an early breakthrough. The spinners were excellent through the middle. It was the last five where they lost it. They’ll be disappoint with the efforts of the three pacers towards the end. Had they executed their plans better, things could have been different. Earlier, it was the other captain, Merwe Erasmus who scored a fine fifty and took his team over 150 but they way Namibia played, they were looking for 170 and in the end, they dearly were short of runs to defend.
