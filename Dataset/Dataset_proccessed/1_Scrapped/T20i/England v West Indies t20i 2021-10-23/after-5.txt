Cricket - ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2021 - Super 12 - Group 1 - England v West Indies - Dubai International Stadium, Dubai, United Arab Emirates - October 23, 2021 West Indies' Kieron Pollard shakes hands with England's Eoin Morgan after the match

England vs West Indies Highlights T20 World Cup 2021: A thumping win from England as they begin their campaign in this edition with a six-wicket victory against the defending champions, although the game was nowhere near to a repeat of the 2016 Final clash. West Indies did pick four wickets, three inside the powerplay, but the total of 55 was always a chasable target for a side like England.

England lose their third wicket

A horrible mix-up and Moeen Ali is run put. Buttler declined the run when Moeen was well past the halfway mark of the pitch. McCoy collected the throw and broke the stumps comfortably. England have now lost their third wicket inside the powerplay

Oct 23, 2021 9:29 PM IST
England lose their second

Hosein has dismissed Bairstow for just 9 off 6. Carefully dragged his length back as Bairstow reached out to drive the ball. It took a thickish inside edge and landed safely into the hands of the bowler. Some silver lining for West Indies?

Oct 23, 2021 9:22 PM IST
Rampaul strikes early

Finally, something for West Indies in the game. Roy has been deceived by the slower delivery from Rampaul and he chipped it straight to Gayle at short mid-wicket. He departs for just 11.

England 21/1 in 3.1 overs

Oct 23, 2021 9:19 PM IST
Perfect start from England

Buttler punched through the cover in the fourth ball of the chase to score a boundary before throwing his hand at a widish delivery from Rampaul to cut through backward point for another boundary. Roy joined his partner to smash a six against Hosein in the third over as England amassed 21 runs at the end of three overs.

Oct 23, 2021 9:10 PM IST
59 dot balls - a record, eh?

West Indies faced 59 dot balls today in the 86 deliveries they faced. That's the second-lowest for the team in World T20, after 65 dots during a game against India in 2014. Windies had scored 129/7 in the game before losing by seven wickets.

Oct 23, 2021 9:06 PM IST
The chase begins!

Welcome back! The England opening pair of Roy and Buttler walk towards the middle. Akeal Hosein will open the attack for West Indies.

Oct 23, 2021 8:50 PM IST
West Indies 55 all-out!

Rashid finishes with his career-best bowling figures, 2.2-0-2-4 as West Indies lose their final wicket to register their second lowest T20I score and lowest in World T20. 

Oct 23, 2021 8:37 PM IST
Back-to-back wickets for Rashid

With Pollard's dismissal, Windies' final batting hope ends. Pollard looked to clear the rope, but the ball landed safely into the hands of Bairstow in the deep. Obed McCoy followed the captain, departing for a golden duck. Windies now 9 down in 12.2 overs
