Pieter Seelaar, the captain of Netherlands, says that Sri Lanka just outplayed them and the whole group. Shares that they have the South Africa and Afghanistan series coming up and they will have to go to the drawing board and work on the mistakes. Tells that they didn't nail it in this tournament and Sri Lanka bowled with a lot of heat this evening. Talking about the run out of Max O'Dowd, Seelaar says that when your best batsman gets run out in the first over then that sums up your sorry campaign. 

21:53 (IST) Oct 22

The Dutch team was steamrolled in this match. Their batting looked clueless against some quality spin and pace bowling on offer and surrendered meekly. An evening to forget for them, in fact, a tournament to forget for them. They lost all their games and never clicked as a team. Many expected them to present a good fight because of the kind of utility players they possess in their ranks but they all were disappointing. Plenty of work is needed to be done if they want to take the next step into the big league. 

21:51 (IST) Oct 22

Presentation time... Let's see who gets the Man of the Match award. Lahiru Kumara, Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana were brilliant with the ball and it's going to be a close call.

21:46 (IST) Oct 22

We look forward to your company for all the action. Cheers!

Dasun Shanaka, the victorious captain of Sri Lanka, says that the bowlers were executing really well and it was a very good performance. Adds that they have a very good bowling side and with him there, they've the sixth bowling option as well. Shares that they read the conditions really well and will know the advantages and disadvantages heading into the next stage.

21:34 (IST) Oct 22

Sri Lanka have decimated the Netherlands to storm into the next round of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2021. It was a match thoroughly dominated by their bowlers as they bundled out the Dutch team for just 44 - the second-lowest total in T20 World Cup history. After that, it was a mere formality and Sri Lanka romped home in 7.1 overs. Kusal Perera remained unbeaten on 33 and Sri Lanka will be pleased that he struck some form before the main tournament.
