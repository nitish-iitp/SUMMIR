World T20: Woeful West Indies dismantled by England in Dubai

West Indies’ title defence in the World T20 got off to a dreaded start, as they were crushed by a rampant England in Super 12 action in Dubai on Saturday.

Led by leg-spinner Adil Rashid, who returned England’s best bowling figures in a World T20, the world’s number one ranked team skittled out West Indies for just 55.

Although West Indies managed to pick up four wickets, the target was way too inadequate, as Eion Morgan’s men won with 70 balls remaining.

West Indies innings never shifted gear; both openers Evin Lewis (6) and Lendl Simmons (3) were dismissed cheaply and Chris Gayle (13) and Shimron Hetmyer (9) followed within the Powerplay, which yielded 31-4.

England went on a rampage thereafter, plucking out the next six wickets for 24 runs in 8.2 overs, with Rashid returning outstanding figures of 4-2 off 2.2 overs.

Dwayne Bravo (5), Nicholas Pooran (1), Kieron Pollard (6), Andre Russell (0), Obed McCoy (0) and Ravi Rampaul (3) were all dismissed cheaply, as West Indies faced an astonishing 59 dot balls.

Off-spinner Moeen Ali, who started the collapse in the Powerplay, ended with 2-17 off four overs; left-arm seamer Tymal Mills took 2-17, while Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes had 1-7 and 1-12 respectively.

Opener Jos Buttler then guided England to victory in 8.2 overs, ending on 24* off 22, but West Indies did make inroads, led by the impressive Akeal Hosein.

The left-arm spinner, who came in as a replacement for the injured Fabian Allen, took 2-24 off four overs bowling in the Powerplay, including a stunning return catch to dismiss Liam Livingstone.

England, with the win, go top of Group One. They next face Bangladesh on Wednesday from 06:00h, while West Indies are up against South Africa on Tuesday from 06:00h at the same venue.
