No expression, only impact

Moeen Ali isn’t the most expressive of players on the field, but he must have been elated at how his four-over spell at the start of the West Indies innings went. Figures of 2-17 would be satisfying any day, but it was a roller-coaster for the England all-rounder, the first England player to win the Indian Premier League title.

Bowling the first over, he would have been delighted after his first five balls yielded just a single. But West Indies are known to rely more on their six-hitting ability than running between the wickets, and Evin Lewis pricked Moeen’s balloon with a big hit on the last ball.

Then after he had taken an excellent catch running back to dismiss Lewis off Chris Woakes, Moeen put the choke on the defending champions when he got rid of the other opener Lendl Simmons in a wicket-maiden. But one couldn’t judge by his mostly stoic expression.

Off-spinner during the Powerplay could be a risky option, and some captains would have been satisfied with figures of 1-7 after two overs. But with two left-handers at the crease – Chris Gayle and Shimron Hetmyer – England captain Eoin Morgan gambled on a third for Moeen.

Two balls into the over, he would have wondered whether he made the right call as Hetmyer used his feet for two boundaries on either side of the wicket. But the Guyanese youngster got greedy, and after a dot ball, went for a pull off a ball that wasn’t short enough and holed out to Morgan himself at mid-on.

With the Powerplay done and the Windies tottering at 31/4, there was very little risk in allowing Moeen to finish his spell in one go and his fourth over went for just two. A total of 18 dot balls proves his prowess, and the remaining six deliveries included a six and two fours.

Having given up Test cricket, Moeen is intent on becoming as good a white-ball cricketer as he can, and he delivered for England on Saturday, even if one can’t always make out from his facial expressions.

A new dimension for England openers

It does feels like Jason Roy has developed that shot over cover for six off the spinner and Jonny Bairstow has done the same. Don’t remember either of them playing it much even a couple of years ago but it’s a feature now. Gives them both a diff dimension against spin.

21:07 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
England resume run-chase

A target of just 56 runs. Roy and Buttler are at the crease. Roy is on strike. Akeal Hosein will open the attack. Net run rate is something for England to consider here.

Emo Roller Coaster: Next change- An action-thriller?

If Pakistan and India contest doesn't hold up to its hype, a shiver would go up the spine of ICC. The opening day games were a low-quality affair. Australia vs South Africa might have thrown up a last-over finish but it was artificial respiration at best to an otherwise life-less game. The batting from both teams was pretty iffy. Worse was to follow in the West Indies vs England game. West Indies stuttered all the way through. Luckily, the fielding in both games was top notch. In the first game, there was a stunner from Aiden Markram at the boundary, leaping side-ways to his right at long-on and somehow not allowing the ball to bounce out of his hands when landing. In the second game, Moeen Ali ran back all the way from mid-off to almost near the boundary to pouch a superb catch to send back the opener Evin Lewis. Then, Dawid Malan back-pedalled from midwicket to well outside the in-ring to take a catch to dismiss Chris Gayle. The bowling in both games has been good but made to look better by some poor batting. ICC would hope that West Indies rediscover their touch and Australia improve their batting. And of course, India and Pakistan brighten up the tournament with a thriller.

Emo Roller Coaster: Backpedalling to glory

For a moment, even as he was furiously backpedalling, Dawid Malan must have thought whether he had made the right decision. Should he have instead turned back from the onset and tried to take it as an over-shoulder catch instead of backpedalling and putting himself at the risk of tripping. Chris Gayle had miscued the pull and it went over midwicket, past the in-ring. Having made the decision to backpedal, Malan to keep on doing it and just when it seemed it might be a bit too much and too long, the ball dropped and he cupped his palms up to pouch the ball and came back safely with it. In the past, we have seen many a fielder tying themselves into knots attempting such a manoeuvre and banging their head on the ground and spilling the catch. Not Malan. Though had the ball travelled a bit more, who knows whether he could still have managed to hang on to the catch.

WI bowled out!!

West Indies bowled out for 55. The lowest ever total in T20 World Cup by a full member team. Defending champions Windies castled for just 55 in their opening game vs last time finalists England.

20:40 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
WI lose their 9th wicket

Two in two for Adil Rashid, Obed McCoy falls for duck. Solitary run for the West Indies in that over, Adil gets 2, and the West Indies are 50/9 after 13. Just got to try and bat out for as long as they can, but this will surely all be over very soon.

20:39 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
Adil Rashid strikes again!

OUT! Kieron Pollard holes out to Bairstow at long-on. Are the pitches that bad or are the players just not up for it? Nobody likes to see such low scoring matches, especially in a World Cup. WI- 49/8 in 12.1 overs

20:38 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
Bowled!! Russell is out Bowled!!

Adil Rashid strikes with his first ball of the tournament - Dre Russ bowled for a duck! What a TERRIBLE COLLAPSE by WI batsmen… its all over now. This loss will affect them badly in the tournament because of the NRR. WI- 44/7 

20:18 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
Pooran departs! Caught by Buttler

Three wides and Mills tricks Pooran with one at the stumps and gets the edge to Buttler. 42/6 with Pollard and Russell to try and sort the mess out.  West Indies are getting schooled here. Their entire top order could hardly put bat to ball. Equally poor vs pace and spin. Pollard and Russell the only hope. WI-  42/6 after 9 ovs

20:08 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
WI lose half their side

The move to send Dwayne Bravo doesn't pay dividends. Jordan gets the wicket as West Indies lose their fifth. More trouble for the Windies. WI- 37/5 

20:05 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
How good was Moeen Ali tonight?

Moeen Ali: 
1st over - 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 6
2nd over - 0, W, 0, 0, 0, 0
3rd over - 4, 4, 0, W, 0, 0
4th over - 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0

4-1-17-2 || It is also the first time Moeen has bowled a maiden in a T20 International.

20:03 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
Gayle is gone!

GAYLE IS OUT!! Superb set up from Mills to get him out, and West Indies are four down, big problems for them. This is the 5th time England have picked up four or more wickets in the Powerplay during a T20 World Cup game, they’ve only gone on to win on two of those four previous occasions.

Hetmyer falls!

England persist with Moeen Ali and he gets a third over in the powerplay and he gets the job done for his captain. Hetmyer, who was looking good so far, hits two fours to start the over mistimes one and is gone for 9. WI- 27/3

19:52 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
Gayle cuts loose!

Back to back boundaries for Chris Gayle as he gets the measure of Woakes. A punch off the backfoot is followed by a cut shot, wide off backward point. Best of so far for the Windies. WI- 19/2 after 4 ovs 

19:44 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
THATS OUT!! Caught!!

WICKET! West Indies lose another one in quick succession. Moeen Ali removes Lendl Simmons for 3. Windies have lost their openers. A second over in the power play for Moeen Ali proves to be a masterstroke from Eion Morgan! Dream Start for England

19:42 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
OUT! Caught by Moeen Ali!!

Chris Woakes strikes in his first over!  Evin Lewis goes for 6 as Moeen Ali takes a fantastic catch. WI- 8/1 (1.3 ovs)

19:41 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
Let's Play!

Simmons is on strike. Moeen Ali will open the attack immons and Lewis stride out. Both teams "take the knee." Spin to begin with. Mooen Ali! HERE WE GO!

Pitch Report:

This surface might assist seamers but spinners will also have something to play with. Will the dry grass make it two paced? Only time will tell. Stay tuned as we build up to the match...

Kieron Polllard speaks at the Toss:

"Not really a blow. Toss is 50-50. We would have bowled. Russell is fit. First World Cup for Pooran, McCoy. Akeal Hosein gets an opportunity as well. With the combination of our team we do not depend on Russell bowling 4 overs every game. We have an all-round team. Just a matter of us coming together and playing. Chris Gayle, legend for us. He has been around for 20 odd years. He has done a lot for west Indies in all three formats. He has done justice to himself. Looking forward to what we can do as a team more than individuals."

19:22 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
Eoin Morgan speaks at the Toss:

"We will bowl first. Short side one side. And we can guard ourselves a bit with that dew factor. Missing out are Billings, Willey, Curran, Wood... Wood and Curran needed a bit more time to recover after the injuries in the warm-up games. Tymal Mills is playing. He was excellent for us before. We get balance with Liam and Moeen, so gives us three seamers and three spinners. Obviously missing those all-rounders who aren't here hurt us. We are excited about the start of our campaign tonight."

Team News:

No sign of Mark Wood in England's warm-ups. *Think* they're going with the extra batter (so Malan, Livingstone, Moeen all play) with Woakes, Jordan, Rashid and Mills as the four frontline bowlers. West Indies fans will be happy to know Russell rolling his arm over in the practice session.

Hello and Welcome

A destructive batting order and a balanced bowling attack means top-ranked England will start the T20 World Cup confident of adding the trophy to the 50-over title they claimed in 2019. Packed with experience in the heat of battle, England will also be spurred on by the bitter taste of defeat in the final of the last edition of the tournament in 2016.

England vs West Indies T20 World Cup.

T20 World Cup 2021: Unpredictable Windies look to recreate old magic

Spectacular one day, chaotic the next. Like yesteryear Pakistan, West Indies veer between the extremes. The T20 champions of the world, trailblazers, trendsetters, they could crash out in the first round, or blast through to the title and fill the humid Emirates air with a re-rendition of the Champions track. Twice they have been champions, but twice they have exited in the preliminary stages of the six-edition-old tournament as well. Two-time champions they might be, but they have lost more T20 games than they have won (win percentage 47.03). Only Ireland, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, among Test-playing nations, have a worse win percentage. In World Cups, though, they tend to fare better, their win percentage of 58 the third-best after India and Sri Lanka.

Suffice is to call them the unpredictables of the T20 galaxy, where their stars sparkle the brightest. Few teams could imagine, let alone, boast of the vaunted T20 firepower than that at the disposal of the West Indies. As if the format was designed with Chris Gayles, Kieron Pollards and Dwayne Bravos in mind. In them, they have the top two run-getters in this format; the top three six-hitters, and the most prolific wicket-taker too. The second-highest wicket-taker too is a West Indian – Sunil Narine, who is bizarrely not in the team. Even mega-utilitarian Jason Holder, who most teams would have installed in their playing eleven without second thoughts, can’t find a spot in the squad.
