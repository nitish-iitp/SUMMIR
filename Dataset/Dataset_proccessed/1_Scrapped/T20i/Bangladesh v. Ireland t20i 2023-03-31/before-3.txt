The economic survey revealed that Goa witnessed a growth of 9.11% (current prices) as against 0.90% the previous financial year (2020-21) and 4.42% in 2019-20 and 3.61% in 2018-19.

According to the economic survey, the gross state domestic product (GSDP) at current prices for the year 2021-22 is ₹82,603.7 crore as against ₹75,705.4 crore (provisional) for the year 2020-21 thereby registering a growth of 9.11% for the year 2021-22.

Goa, which boasts of the highest per capita income in the country among states, is also likely to see the per capita income increase from ₹4,54,172 in 2017-18 to ₹5,27,146 in 2021-22.

Per capita income is estimated by dividing GSDP at current prices with mid-financial year project population.

The survey also revealed that public debt has grown manifold and stands at 24% of the state GSDP after hovering around 19-20% of the state GDP between the years 2017 and 2020.

“The state’s public debt as on 31 March 2023 is estimated to be ₹21,940 crore as against ₹20,824.86 crore in 2021-22,” the survey said.

Nearly all of Goa’s public debt is in the form of market loans to the tune of ₹20,460 crore while ₹1,480 crore is owed to NABARD.

The state budget will be presented by chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday.
