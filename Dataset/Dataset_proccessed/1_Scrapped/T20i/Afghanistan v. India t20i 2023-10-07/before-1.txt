The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) has made a significant announcement by appointing former India cricketer Ajay Jadeja as the mentor for the Afghanistan National Cricket Team in preparation for the ICC ODI World Cup 2023. This strategic move signifies Afghanistan’s intent to harness Jadeja’s wealth of cricketing experience to enhance their performance in the upcoming tournament.

Afghanistan’s World Cup preparations and mentor’s role

As Afghanistan readies itself for the ODI World Cup 2023, they have been diligently preparing for the competition, which kicks off on October 5. Their first warm-up fixture against South Africa was unfortunately affected by rain in Thiruvananthapuram. However, they remain undeterred and are gearing up to face Sri Lanka in their next warm-up fixture, scheduled for October 3, 2023, in Guwahati.

Afghanistan’s World Cup journey officially commences with their opening game against Bangladesh, which is set to take place in Dharamshala on October 7, 2023.

To better acclimatize to Indian conditions and fine-tune their strategies, Afghanistan have enlisted the services of Jadeja as their mentor. This marks Jadeja’s first international assignment, and his role will encompass guiding and advising the team, drawing from his extensive cricketing knowledge.

His vast experience, particularly in white-ball cricket, will be invaluable in honing Afghanistan’s skills and strategies. The team aspires to make a strong impression in the tournament and aims to overcome past challenges by seeking guidance from a cricketing legend.

The ACB officially disclosed the appointment news on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter).
