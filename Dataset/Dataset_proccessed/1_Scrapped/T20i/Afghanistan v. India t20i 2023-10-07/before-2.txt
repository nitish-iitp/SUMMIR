When is Jitiya Jivitputrika Vrat?

The festival of Jitiya Jivitputrika Vrat will be celebrated from October 6 to October 8 this year. Different rituals and traditions are followed on each day of the festival.

Story of Jitiya

There are many stories related to the origin of Jitiya. One of them dates back to Mahabharata times. As per the legend, when Ashwathama's father passed away during the war, he was livid and wanted to kill Pandavas. However, he accidentally killed Draupadi's five sons and Pandavas survived. Arjuna retaliated by holding him captive and snatching the 'mani' from him. To avenge this, Ashwathama used Brahmastra to kill the unborn child of Abhimanyu's wife Uttara. While he was successful in doing so, Lord Krishna gave a new life to the dead child and he was alive again. The child who grew up to become Raja Parikshit was known as Jivitputrika due to this miracle. From then onwards mothers started to observe Jitiya fast.

Significance of Jitiya

Jitiya holds a great significance in Bihar, UP and Jharkhand and mothers observe this fast for their entire life to protect their children from untimely demise. They also pray for the happy and long life of their kids and refrain from eating or drinking during the fasting period.
