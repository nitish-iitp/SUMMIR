Springboks: Frans Steyn Warns Rassie Erasmus Of Sacha Selection Conundrum When World Cup Winner Returns
Springboks: Frans Steyn warns Rassie Erasmus of Sacha selection conundrum when World Cup winner returns

Former Springboks star Frans Steyn and Boks utility back Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu.

Springboks head coach Rassie Erasmus and the rest of his coaching staff will have a selection headache when one of their 2023 Rugby World Cup winners returns from injury.

That is the view of former Springboks star Frans Steyn who believes the superb form of rookie utility back Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu will make it difficult for Erasmus to omit him from a matchday squad for the Boks.

Ever-present for the Springboks in 2024

Feinberg-Mngomezulu has been involved in all of South Africa‘s internationals so far this year.

The 22-year-old has made six international appearances so far after coming off the replacements bench in his first four Tests – against Wales, Ireland and Portugal – before he was the Boks’ starting fly-half for their first two Rugby Championship Tests against Australia.

Apart from wearing the number 10 jersey, Feinberg-Mngomezulu is equally adept at full-back and in the midfield.

Fellow utility back Damian Willemse, who was one of the Boks’ stars during their triumphant 2023 World Cup campaign in France, is also capable of playing all the aforementioned positions and Steyn feels Erasmus will have to choose between the duo when Willemse recovers from a finger injury which he sustained while playing for the Stormers in May.

Springboks great claims SA Rugby ‘currently not sustainable’, warns stars will leave for ‘easier’ competitions

“He (Feinberg-Mngomezulu) is a very good player,” Steyn told Netwerk24. “It’s always good to have some good players in a certain position who keep each other on their toes.

“The only problem is that only 23 players (the 15 on the field and the eight on the bench) can play every weekend.

“When you have a couple of good guys in a position pushing each other, it becomes more and more difficult to decide who to pick and who not to pick. You actually feel bad about leaving someone out.

‘They are very much the same type of player’

“If Damian Willemse is back, there is a challenge. Who are you going to pick, Damian or Sacha, because they are very much the same type of player.”

Steyn, who retired last year and currently serving as the Cheetahs’ director of rugby, said the Boks’ recent victory over the Wallabies in Perth highlighted the depth in their squad as Erasmus made 10 changes to his starting line-up after they beat Australia in the corresponding fixture in Brisbane the previous week.

“Rassie and his team are doing something incredible,” he said.
