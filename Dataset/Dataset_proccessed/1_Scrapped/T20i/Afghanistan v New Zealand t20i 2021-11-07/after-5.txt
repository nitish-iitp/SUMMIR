New Zealand vs Afghanistan, T20 World Cup Highlights: New Zealand beat Afghanistan by eight wickets in their final Super 12 match to qualify for the semi-finals and send India out of the T20 World Cup on Sunday. New Zealand chased down the small target of 125 with 11 balls to spare to secure a top-2 finish in Group 2 with eight points from five matches.

The win by the Kiwis meant that India — currently with four points from four matches — cannot qualify for the semifinals even if they beat Namibia in their final Super 12 on Monday. Afghanistan ended their campaign on four points from five matches from which they secured two wins.

Captain Kane Williamson top-scored with an unbeaten 40 while Devon Conway contributed 36 not out. For Afghanistan, Mujeeb Ur Rahman and Rashid Khan took a wicket each. Earlier, opting to bat, Afghanistan posted 124/8.

New Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Daryl Mitchell, Kane Williamson(c), Devon Conway(w), Glenn Phillips, James Neesham, Mitchell Santner, Adam Milne, Tim Southee, Ish Sodhi, Trent Boult

Afghanistan (Playing XI): Hazratullah Zazai, Mohammad Shahzad(w), Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Najibullah Zadran, Gulbadin Naib, Mohammad Nabi(c), Karim Janat, Rashid Khan, Naveen-ul-Haq, Hamid Hassan, Mujeeb Ur Rahman

Rashid, the Unrushed ðŸ¤´ðŸ»...ðŸŒ€ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯......

Wicket No. 400 and he is just 23. Rashid Khan had Martin Guptill on a hook with a loopy googly and the New Zealander succumbed to the big slog sweep. But the ball never quite arrived. It dipped and Guptill lunged but could only meet thin air as the ball lit up the stumps. At the end of the game, Khan had one of his team-mates hand the ball to him and as he shook hands with the incoming Guptill, he stopped him for a short chat, and gestured the ball clasped on his left hand. Perhaps, an autograph on the ball later? The other day Dale Steyn couldn’t control an incredulous laugh when he was talking about Khan. “Just 22-23. He will play till at least 40-42. How many thousands of wickets is he going to end up with?!”

Fifty partnership

A full toss from Hamid and Williamson pushes it through the vacant extra cover region. The boundary brings up the fifty partnership. New Zealand are heading towards a win.

Back to back 4's

Conway takes on Nabi and sweeps him twice to get the boundaries. 13 runs come off the over. New Zealand firm favourites now to progress into the semis.

Â FOUR!

Williamson reads the googly and he waits for it and then guides it past the diving mid-wicket fielder. No chance for the man in the deep. Superb timing on that shot, didn't over-hit. NZ: 70/2 after 12 ovs

Rashid Khan delivers again ðŸ™Œ

Guptill goes for a big sweep against him but sees his stumps castled. That means Rashid now has 400 T20 wickets.

Leading wicket-takers in men’s T20 history:

Dwayne Bravo - 553
Sunil Narine - 425
Imran Tahir - 420
Rashid Khan - 400

50 up for Kiwis

Perfect powerplay for the Black Caps in this lowish chase. The required rate is well below run-a-ball due to this start and that means they can play Rashid as carefully as they want. How long before Afghanistan unleash their strike bowler. NZ: 50/1 in 7 ovs

Blinders, Seekers in cricket's Quidditch ðŸ–ðŸ½âœ¨

Mitchell's wishlist for superpower was flying: The blur lines between the minor muggle sport of cricket and wizarding major Quidditch are disappearing. Though it was from the country that posed as Middle Earth in Frodo's shire, New Zealand, that the top fielding effort emerged. There was no broomstick in sight, but Daryl Mitchell doesn't seem to need one to fly about when manning the feverish fences. Fanning about cow corner on the first delivery of the last over with Rashid Khan trying to set the tone, Mitchell watched Neesham's short delivery gaining elevation and dipping out-bounds, pulled by the Afghan. It's one of those fielding efforts in vain that look silly when the camera zooms into the fielder's feet that have crossed the boundary rope. But like an ace Seeker for Gryffindor, Mitchell would jump falling backwards, catch hold of the fluttering golden Snitch with the outstretched right hand and fling it safely inbounds to save a sureshot 6. Last ball, with only two runs added by Rashid, and Neesham assuming duties of an effective Beater, it was captain Kane who would pluck Rashid's mistimed ball out of air in the covers, and quieten the golden Snitch.

Mujeeb strikes â˜ï¸

Daryl Mitchell falls for 17 caught behind off the first ball of the fourth over to Mujeeb. NZ: 26/1 as Williamson arrives to join Guptill. 

17:29 (IST)
07 NOV 2021
NZ off to a good start

Martin Guptill & Daryl Mitchell off to a confident start in 125 chase. NZ: 26/0 after 3 ovs, need another 99 runs to win. Regardless of outcome, Afghanistan have played amazing cricket in this tournament. There is only forwards and upwards for the team.

Daryl Mitchell almost pulls off a one-handed catch for the ages at the ropes, but has to throw it back in... saved four runs though.

Poor Shahzad: The bus has left without him

Sat right next to the big fan at dugout, Mohammad Shahzad stared at the big screen replay of his implosion. He looked like a man who had just missed the last bus home and sighing at the departing trail of the plumes from the vehicle. Keeping in character, it was a funny dismissal too. He was aiming for an upper cut but his body wasn't willing. One foot was in the air, body though was in a awkward tilt and he tried a chop instead of a cut. The end too didn't come immediately. The wicket-keeper parried the ball, then juggled with it couple of times to raise Shahzad's hopes-- the equivalent of the bus driver staring right at you from the rear-view mirror and slowing down the bus a touch before speeding away.

15:46 (IST)
07 NOV 2021
AFG lose two quick wickets

Boult joins the party! Zazai (2) fails to read a shortish delivery, tries to work it through the on-side and ends up getting a leading edge. Santner with the catch at mid-wicket. Gurbaz and Gulbadin in the middle now. AFG: 12/2 (3.1 overs)

15:42 (IST)
07 NOV 2021
CAUGHT BEHIND!

Edged and taken! Shahzad (4) is sent back to the hut early by Milne! The batter tries to go for a flashy cut and gets an under-edge and wicketkeeper Conway completes the catch. A brilliant start by New Zealand. AFG: 8/1 (2.2 overs)

15:39 (IST)
07 NOV 2021
Shahzad comes up with early boundary

Shahzad (4*) provides a good start to Afghanistan as he smacks Southee for a lofted boundary over his head in the opening over. Boult comes into the attack next and concedes just a single. Zazai is on 1*. AFG: 7/0 (2 overs)

15:30 (IST)

Afghanistan have won the toss and have opted to bat. "It was a night game in Abu Dhabi, so we bowled first considering the dew factor. It's a day game, so we want to post a decent total. We will try our best and try to win," said Nabi.

Who can be the key players?

Mujeeb Ur Rahman: India's Ravichandran Ashwin joked a few days ago that India would send their physio to make sure Mujeeb was available for this game. Blessed with variations, the spinner plays a crucial role in the Powerplay. With New Zealand having shown a tendency to lose quick wickets at the start in a few games this tournament, Afghanistan will be keen to strike early.  

Trent Boult: The Abu Dhabi deck has helped pacers with some movement, which can be exploited by someone like Trent Boult at the start. So far, he has been effective in other phases as well, as shown by the eight wickets he's picked up in four matches. 'Trent's one of the greats going around,' said his colleague Ish Sodhi. 'He's still working on different slower balls in the nets.'

14:30 (IST)
07 NOV 2021
Who said what

Ish Sodhi, New Zealand spinner: "So far in the tournament, we've all had a lot of small contributions that have worked out really well for us over the past three games, especially. And we're just trying to remind ourselves what those strengths are. And we're very aware of the threat that Afghanistan bring. But if we do the basics really well and keep building on what we have been doing well we'll give ourselves a good chance. [Their attack is] spearheaded by Rashid Khan, and obviously, Mujeeb Ur Rahman is phenomenal as well. Mohammad Nabi is a very cagey off-spinner and bowls well through the powerplay too. That's definitely where their threat lies with their bowling attack. And I'm sure all the batsmen during the scouting meeting have taken it into consideration, as well as the threat they bring with the bat."

Hashmatullah Shahidi, Afghanistan batter: "Our spinners are really good, like especially in these conditions, Dubai. We have played a lot of cricket here and we have the benefits. But against the big teams we should bat well. Also the batsmen should take responsibility to play well against them."

If New Zealand win, they guarantee themselves a top-two finish and make it to the semi-final. If Afghanistan win, they, New Zealand and potentially India will be tied on points and net run rate will decide who finishes second.
