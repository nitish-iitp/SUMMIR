NZ vs AFG Highlights T20 World Cup 2021.

New Zealand vs Afghanistan Highlights: New Zealand have qualified for their 14th ICC semifinal as they defeated Afghanistan by 8 wickets in Abu Dhabi to qualify for the T20 World Cup 2021 final-four. With this result, India have been knocked out of semifinal contention and so are Afghanistan. In chase of 125 in 120 balls, New Zealand climbed to 45/1 in 6 overs. Despite Mujeeb ur Rahman removing Daryl Mitchell, Martin Guptill continued to attack. The Kiwis crossed 50 in the 7th over to stay on track of the chase. However, they were pegged back in the middle overs as Rashid Khan knocked over Guptill's stumps and dried up the runs to lead the Afghan fightback. Despite a few quiet overs, Devon Conway (36*) and skipper Kane Williamson (40*) stitched a match-winning 68-run partnership. In the first innings, after opting to bat, Afghanistan got off to a terrible start as they found themselves reeling at 23/3 after the Powerplay. The side lost their top three batters as Tim Southee, Adam Milne, and Trent Boult picked up a wicket each. Najibullah Zadran smashed a few boundaries to take Afghanistan past 50. Just when he looked like building a stand with Gulbadin Naib, Ish Sodhi castled the latter to leave Afghanistan reeling at 56/4 at the halfway stage. Then, Nabi and Najib stitched an impressive 50-run stand to set themselves up for a big finish and take the side past 100. In between, Najib brought up a T20I 50. Nabi and Najib (73) were dismissed in quick succession as Afghanistan posted 124/8 in 20 overs. Trent Boult finished with figures of 3/17 in 4 overs.

End of a tournament for India, end of T20I captaincy for Kohli tomorrow

Be it the 10-wicket loss and a historic streak coming to an end with it or be it Virat Kohli losing the toss again and again (in a tournament like this), not much has gone India's way. Having said that, there is no denying that in crucial moments during the first two matches, the 'Men in Blue' did not play the best cricket possible. As a result, they have been shown the exit doors.

Tomorrow, they take on Namibia in a consolatory game but it will also mark the end of Virat Kohli's T20I captaincy.

NZ vs AFG Live Updates: India and New Zealand, two contrasting tales

NZ vs AFG Live Score: Kane Williamson, the winning captain, speaks

"It was a strong performance. They have got match-winners in all departments. It was nice to set the tone with the ball straight up, restrict them to a below-par score on a 150-155 surface. In second innings, we tried to suck things up and get as close as we could. We would have batted first today."

NZ vs AFG Live Score: Mohammad Nabi, the losing captain, speaks

"It was our plan to bat first and put a decent total on the board. We didn't start well, early wickets, we built partnerships but didn't finish well. We were 30 runs short on this pitch. We were eyeing 140-160, that would have been a decent score. Our bowling is strong, but we didn't get a good total. We tried our best and bowled really well in this game. We have a lot of experience playing in the UAE, we take a lot of positives from this tournament."

New Zealand vs Afghanistan Live Updates: Trent Boult is the player of the match

For his 3/17, Boult has been awarded the 'Player of the Match' Award. “Nice to tick off the performance here this afternoon. Now we move forward for the business end of the tournament. Boys are feeling good. There is a big difference between the day games and the night games. We have been playing good cricket. Hopefully we can keep it going. It’s just about adapting (to the toss), executing well and chasing it down properly was what we talked about, glad that we got the job done," said Boult.
