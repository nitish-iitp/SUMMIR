India vs Zimbabwe 3rd T20I Highlights: Chasing 183 runs in the third T20I against India at Harare, Zimbabwe could only score 159/6 runs in 20 overs and lost to India by 23 runs. With this win, India now lead the 5-match T20I series by 2-1.  The fourth T20I of the series is slated on Saturday, 13 July, while the fifth is on 14 July.

Washington Sundar was announced the 'Player of the Match' for picking up three wickets for India.

For Zimbabwe, Dion Myers scored a half century of 45 balls and was unbeaten at 65 off 49 balls. While, Clive Madande scored 37 off 26 balls. Apart from this, no other batter could last long in the crease.

For India, Washington Sundar picked up three wickets, Avesh Khan took two wickets and Khaleel Ahmed picked one.

After winning the toss in the third T20I at Harare while playing against Zimbabwe, Gill decided India will bat first and gave a target of 183 runs for Zimbabwe to chase.

Absent for first T20I matches, Yashasvi Jaiswal joined the India playing XI and opened for the team. He scored 36 off 27, while skipper Shubman Gill (66) scored his first T20I half century in just 36 deliveries as T20I skipper.

Ruturaj played a beautiful innings and scored 49 off 28 deliveries, and missed his half century by just one run. India scored 182/4 in 20 overs.

For Zimbabwe, both Blessing Muzarabani and Sikandar Raza picked two wickets.

India's Shubman Gill won the toss for the third T20I at Harare while playing against Zimbabwe. Gill decided to bat first. As expected Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal opened the innings for India. 

Shubman Gill-led team India will take on Zimbabwe for 3rd T20 match at the Harare Sports Ground today. The series is currently evenly poised with both teams winning one match each and the bilateral trophy still being up for grabs. 

Shubman Gill's side will be more emboldened with the addition of World Cup winning trio of Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson and Sanju Samson. However, with new players coming into the side, it could be the end of series of some youngsters like Sai Sudarshan, Dhruv Jurel and Riyan Parag. Moreover, there could also be a change in the batting lineup, with Yashasvi Jaiswal set to take the opening berth. 

Zimbabwe, on the other hand, would look like to make a strong comeback after facing a 100 run defeat in the last encounter. In particular, this young Minnows lineup would need to improve their batting performance if they want to stand any chance of defeating the World Champions.

India vs Zimbabwe 3rd T20I: Playing XIs

India: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill(c), Ruturaj Gaikwad, Sanju Samson(w), Shivam Dube, Rinku Singh, Washington Sundar, Ravi Bishnoi, Avesh Khan, Khaleel Ahmed

India vs Zimbabwe Live Score: What Shubman Gill said after the match!

India vs Zimbabwe Live Score: India skipper Shubman Gill said, as quoted by Cricbuzz, “Definitely it feels very good, it was a crucial game for us, the way we started with the bat and ball was good. The wicket was a bit double-paced, the odd ball was gripping and it was not easy to hit the length balls, that's what we discussed with our bowlers. We know that if there is something in the wicket, it will be more with the new ball, and as the ball gets old it's a bit easier to score. Everyone is contributing and that's a good sign."

India vs Zimbabwe Live Score: What Sikandar Raza said after the match!

India vs Zimbabwe Live Score: After losing by 23 runs to India, Zimbabwe's skipper Sikandar Raza said, as Cricbuzz quoted, “I think it's the fielding again, we are proud of our fielding but the wheels came off today, we gave away 20 extra runs and we lost by 23 runs. We still have problems at the top but I have utmost faith in them that they will come good some time. We have tried 15 different partners (openers) in the last year and a half or so. There is a lot of cricket going on in the country and club cricket has revived. It's time that our players including myself take up the responsibility. The youngsters making mistakes is acceptable but the senior players need to step up. You cannot fix a problem by creating another problem, we have picked 3 openers for a reason. The openers that have been picked up should be given a run. (On Muzarabani) He he has been outstanding, sometimes the rewards don't come but in the long run the rewards do come."

India vs Zimbabwe Live Score: Washington Sundar becomes 'Player of the Match'

India vs Zimbabwe Live Score: India's Washington Sundar was announced the 'Player of the Match' for picking up three wickets for India. At the post presentation he said, as quote by Cricbuzz, “Feels amazing and every time I play for the country, it feels amazing. It was definitely a better wicket, in the first two games there was more for the bowlers compared to this game, our batters batted well. (On the partnership between Myers & Madande) It did put a lot of pressure on us and we wanted to execute our plans the best we can to restrict them. Hopefully, we get to see a lot of places in Zimbabwe and explore more, hopefully we can seal the series on Saturday."
