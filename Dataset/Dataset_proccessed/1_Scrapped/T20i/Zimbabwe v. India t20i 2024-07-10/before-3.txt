Sony Sports Network gets exclusive television rights for MLC' 24 in India

Culver Max Entertainment Private Limited, which owns and operates Sony Sports Network, one of the pioneering sports broadcasters in India, has announced the acquisition of exclusive television rights for T20 cricket spectacle Major League Cricket (MLC) for a tenure of one year in India. The second edition of the league will begin with reigning champions MI New York facing Seattle Orcas in the opener at Church Street Park, Morrisville and will be live telecast in India on July 6th, 2024. The grand finale of the tournament will be played at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and will be live telecast in India on 29th July 2024.

A major share from the ongoing cricket revolution in the United States can be attributed to MLC, which has attracted eyeballs of India’s evergreen cricket fraternity. The participation from Indian cricket franchises Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings brings a whole new level of excitement for fans of the respective teams. Some of the most popular cricketers including Quinton de Kock, Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran are expected to feature in the upcoming edition of the league.

 The MLC’s second season features an all-star lineup of announcers, including the former captain of the Indian national cricket team and great batsman Sunil Gavaskar, Pakistani legendary bowler Wasim Akram, former New Zealand and Auckland cricketer Danny Morrison, alongside Daren Ganga, Pommie Mbangwa, Matthew Hayden, Chris Morris, Natalie Germanos, Scott Styris, and Mike Haysmen. 

The inaugural edition of MLC attained critical success with six teams participating i.e. San Francisco Unicorns, Washington Freedom, Texas Super Kings, Seattle Orcas, Los Angeles Knight Riders and MI New York. Team MI New York was crowned champions after they defeated Seattle Orcas in the final played at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas. Nicholas Pooran, who featured for the champions, registered 388 runs and was adjudged the Player of the Season last year.

 With the acquisition of television rights for Major League Cricket, Sony Sports Network has asserted its solid footprint in broadcasting cricket properties. The broadcaster’s cricket portfolio already boasts of rights for New Zealand Cricket, England Cricket Board, Sri Lanka Cricket & the recent addition of India Tour of Zimbabwe T20I series.
