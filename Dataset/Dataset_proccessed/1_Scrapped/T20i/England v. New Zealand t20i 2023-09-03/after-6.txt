ENGLAND
HIGHLIGHTS | England v New Zealand | 3rd Men’s Vitality IT20 2023
3 September 2023
England were outplayed by a resurgent New Zealand who won the third T20 international by 74 runs at a sold out Edgbaston.

After opener Finn Allen struck 83 in New Zealand’s 202-5, the tourists tied down England’s vaunted top order. Jonny Bairstow was caught for 12 from 16 balls, Dawid Malan struggled for 11 balls for only two, while the in-form Harry Brook holed out for eight.

Jos Buttler gave England fans hope with 40 from 21 balls but his dismissal, caught and bowled off Mitchell Santner, effectively ended his side’s hopes.

They were bowled out for 128 in the 19th over with leg-spinner Ish Sodhi taking 3-33 and seamer Kyle Jamieson an excellent 3-23 on his return from a back injury.
