Hosts Pakistan haven’t played a single international game since the T20 World Cup held in South Africa in February. The World Cup campaign was quite disappointing for them as they finished second last group, winning just 1 game out of 4.

On the other hand, the Proteas, just like Pakistan, played their last international match in the T20 World Cup. Quite contrasting to the hosts, Proteas had a largely successful campaign, losing out in the finals to the quality Australian side. The Proteas had a campaign they should be proud of, becoming the only South African side to reach the finals of a major ICC event.
