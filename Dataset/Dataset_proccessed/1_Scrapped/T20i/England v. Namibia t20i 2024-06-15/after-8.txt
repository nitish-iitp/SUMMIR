Namibia vs England Commentary
10:14 PM IST Right then, England got the job done, there were nervous times for them throughout but eventually, we had a completed game, a shortened one but we got a result and it was the result England wanted. Now all eyes are on the Aussies. If they do manage to beat Scotland, England go through, anything other than that, it is the Scottish who’ll proceed. That game begins at 6 AM IST (12.30 AM GMT). You can join us an hour early for the build-up. Until then, cheers and have a good time.
10:11 PM IST Jos Buttler says he’s relieved. Mentions the performance was good. Adds he felt they had enough as the ball was sticking in the wicket. Mentions Brook and Bairstow played really well. States they have dealt with everything well and done what they could have.
10:10 PM IST Harry Brook is the Player Of The Match for his match-winning knock of 47 in just 20 deliveries. He says that the players were anxious with a lot of rain but thankfully it stopped and they got the game going. Adds they knew it was going to be tough for Namibia as the pitch was wearing a bit. Adds that there was some spin and he just tried to stick around. Credits Jonny Bairstow for his smashing knock.
10:09 PM IST The losing skipper of Namibia, Merwe Erasmus is up for a quick chat and says the target was a lot to ask for. Adds that David Wiese was brilliant with the bat and he has been a great servant to the nation and this being his last game it was good to see him bat like that. Mentions that they are happy to represent Namibia on the bigger stage but their motive was to advance and they will take a lot of learning from these games.
10:01 PM IST Stay tuned for the presentation...
10:01 PM IST Namibia really needed a special knock from someone but it did not come. However, Michael van Lingen and Niko Davin lacked the intent to begin with but Wiese really batted with a lot of intent and struck some meaty blows but they needed a lot more. In the end, a convincing show by England.
