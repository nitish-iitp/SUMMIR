England and Australia face each other on June 8
Namibia will be aiming to spring some surprises
Oman and Scotland will be aiming to make a big impression

Group B for the T20 World Cup 2024 will be housing the defending champions England, who will be looking to defend their crown and avoid the same fate they suffered in India last year. England came in to the tournament, high on confidence, but got battered in the end. They now come into the T20 World Cup with some players in form and a returning Jofra Archer. However, they will have a date with their arch-rivals Australia, early on in the tournament.

The Aussies will prove to be the biggest early threat to England in their title defence but Namibia, Oman and Scotland will be looking to impress on the big stage. Namibia did get a big win against Sri Lanka during the 2022 edition, while Oman and Scotland have the ability to spring a couple of surprises.

With that in mind, let's take a look at how the teams pan out for the T20 World Cup from Group B.

Despite not making it to the knockouts of the home T20 World Cup last time around, the Aussies come into the tournament as one of the favourites. The form of Travis Head, Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins, who enjoyed a fine IPL 2024 campaign, will be some of the key players. Josh Hazlewood also hit prime form during the Namibia warm-up game as he bowled 3 maiden overs and picked up 2 wickets.

This could turn out to be the farewell for veteran opener David Warner and Australia will also be hoping that Glenn Maxwell can put behind his poor IPL 2024 form and get back firing.

Squad

Mitchell Marsh (c), Ashton Agar, Pat Cummins, Tim David, Nathan Ellis, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Starc, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade, David Warner, Adam Zampa

Fixtures

England

The defending champions, much like Australia, do have the likes of Phil Salt and Jos Buttler carrying their IPL 2024 form heading into the campaign. The biggest plus point for them is the return of Archer, who did play in the Caribbean to get into fitness ahead of the tournament.

England's middle-order has some big names like Jonny Bairstow, Harry Brook and Liam Livingstone in their mix, with the young Will Jacks being a trump card for them.

Squad

Jos Buttler (c), Moeen Ali, Jofra Archer, Jonathan Bairstow, Harry Brook, Sam Curran, Ben Duckett, Tom Hartley, Will Jacks, Chris Jordan, Liam Livingstone, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Reece Topley, Mark Wood

Namibia

Namibia qualified for the T20 World Cup 2024 on the back of stellar Africa Regional Qualifier stage and as they secured wins over six teams including Uganda and Zimbabwe. David Wiese will once again be the main man for Namibia, but he will find support from the likes of JJ Smit and Gerhard Erasmus, who have made a big impact on the international stage in recent times. Upsets are something Namibia would be aiming for as they look to topple the Aussies and the English.

Squad

Gerhard Erasmus (c), Zane Green, Michael Van Lingen, Dylan Leicher, Ruben Trumpelmann, Jack Brassell, Ben Shikongo, Tangeni Lungameni, Niko Davin, JJ Smit, Jan Frylinck, JP Kotze, David Wiese, Bernard Scholtz, Malan Kruger, PD Blignaut

Oman

The only Asian team in the group, Oman will be looking to continue their progress in international cricket. Aqib Ilyas, the new skipper, will be the main man with bat and ball and former captain Zeeshan Maqsood's presence will be great for the team.

Oman will be looking for some big performances and target a win against Namibia, a team they have beaten in recent times.

Scotland

Richie Berrington and Co do have some players who have got T20 experience across the glove and Mark Watt will be a key player for them. Watt is known for the way he uses the crease and Scotland did give a tough challenge to West Indies and Sri Lanka during the T20 World Cup qualifier last time around.
