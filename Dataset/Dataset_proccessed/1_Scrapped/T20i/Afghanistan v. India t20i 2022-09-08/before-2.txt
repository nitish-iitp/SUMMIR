Onam 2022 History and Significance:

Onam is a harvest festival celebrated in Kerala. It also marks the return of King Mahabali/Maveli in Kerala, as the demon king once ruled the state. According to mythology, the kind-hearted King Mahabali defeated the Gods and began ruling over all three worlds. He was a generous and wise leader, but the Gods got insecure about his popularity. They asked Lord Vishnu to step in and help them out. Therefore, Lord Vishnu took his fifth avatar - the Brahmin dwarf Vamana.

Then, Vamana paid a visit to King Mahabali. The generous King asked the Brahmin what he wished for, to which Vamana responded, "Three pieces of land." Then, Vamana grew in size, and in his first and second steps, he covered the sky and the netherworld.

When Lord Vishnu's fifth avatar was about to take his third step, King Mahabali offered his own head to God. Pleased by his sacrifice, Lord Vishnu granted King Mahabali the right to visit his kingdom and people, every year during Onam.

Onam 2022 Celebrations:

Onam is celebrated with much enthusiasm in the state of Kerala. People mark the 10-day festivities by taking early morning baths, deep cleaning their homes, decorating them with flowers and lights, making Pookalam (a floral pattern) outside, and eating Onam Sadhya - a huge feast served on banana leaves. It features over 26 dishes prepared with the help of all the family members and eaten with hands.

Additionally, the women of the household wear a white and gold saree called the Kasavu saree. People also enjoy different activities like Onakalikal (various games played during the festival), Vallamkali (boat race), Pulikali (a tableau with actors dressed as tigers and hunters), and archery during Onam.
