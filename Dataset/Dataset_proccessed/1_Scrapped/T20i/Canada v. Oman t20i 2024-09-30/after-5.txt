PREVIEW

Canada will be up against Oman in the third match of the Canada T20I Series. This match will be played at Maple Leaf North West Ground. Oman lost their previous match against Nepal. They will be keen to bounce back. On the other hand, Canada won the opening match of the series against Nepal by 14 runs. This should be an exciting match between these two sides.
