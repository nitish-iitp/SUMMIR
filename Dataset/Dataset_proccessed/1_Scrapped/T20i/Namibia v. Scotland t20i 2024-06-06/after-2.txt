USA vs PAK, NAM vs SCO: T20 World Cup 2024 team news
USA news

USA played the tournament opener against neighbours Canada in what is still the highest-scoring match of this T20 World Cup so far. Aaron Jones was the star with an unbeaten 94 off 40 deliveries, as the USA chased down 195 with 14 deliveries to spare. The co-hosts will be looking to build on that performance against Pakistan.

Pakistan news

Ahead of their first fixture in this tournament, Pakistan may have a couple of tough calls to make regarding team selection. They was not at their best during the recent series against New Zealand and England, but will remain confident in overcoming this potentially dangerous USA side.

Namibia news

Namibia’s first tournament match was a low-scoring thriller, as they restricted Oman to 109 in 20 overs. Despite failing to chase down the target, they eventually took home two points as David Wiese starred with both bat and ball in the Super Over.

Scotland news

One of three Associate members in Group B, Scotland put up a promising showing with the bat against England on Tuesday, before rain meant the match was washed out. Securing a point in that match can be vital, as wins over Namibia and Oman will put them in a strong position for qualification to the Super Eight stage.

USA vs PAK, NAM vs SCO: Prediction for today’s T20 World Cup match

Pakistan will start as favourites against the USA. The 2009 champions may see the match as a must-win to avoid the India game being so instead. The pitch in Dallas looked a belter in the previous game played here, which may work in Pakistan’s favour given their more skilled bowling attack.

Namibia have played Scotland three times before, winning comfortably on every occasion. However, the most recent of those matches came in 2021. Scotland will be buoyed by their batting performance against England and should look for more of the same to get them over the line against the ‘Eagles’.
