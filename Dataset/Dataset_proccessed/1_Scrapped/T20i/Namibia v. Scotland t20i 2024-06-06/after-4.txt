Scotland beat Namibia to continue impressive World T20 run

Scotland continued their impressive start to the T20 World Cup with a five-wicket victory over Namibia in Barbados.

With 40 needed from the last four overs in pursuit of 156, Michael Leask struck the experienced David Wiese for two sixes in the 17th over to swing the game in Scotland’s favour with 19 runs coming from six balls.

Leask crashed another six in the following over before falling for 35 from 17 balls, but with only nine more needed the decisive hand had been played.

Captain Richie Berrington ended 47 not out as Scotland won with nine balls to spare when he hit another six.

Earlier, and having had the better of Tuesday’s washout with England, Scotland took crucial wickets with the new ball and again at the death to hold Namibia to 155-9.

Seamer Brad Wheal took 3-33, including JP Kotze, who fell to the third ball of the match, and later the dangerous Wiese for 14.

Captain Gerhard Erasmus was Namibia’s highest scorer with 52 from 31 balls.

Victory in their next game against Oman in Antigua on Sunday would put Scotland right in the mix for qualification from the group that also includes England and Australia.

They are top of the early group stage table although either England or Australia could replace them when they meet on Saturday. (BBC Sport)
