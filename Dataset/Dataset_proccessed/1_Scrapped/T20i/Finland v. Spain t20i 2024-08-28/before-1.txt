FCB Nyasa Big Bullets can breathe a sigh of relief after the Super League of Malawi (Sulom) postponed their TNM Super League game against Creck Sporting Club which was scheduled for Wednesday at Kamuzu Stadium Bullets officials and coaches have been lamenting fixtures congestion following the team’s involvement in the Caf Champions League, FDH Bank Cup and TNM Super League.

Sulom issued a statement on Sunday evening indicating that the People’s Team’s match against Creck had been shifted to a later date, without giving reasons.

“The Super League of Malawi regrets to inform all stakeholders that the match between FCB Nyasa Big Bullets and Creck Sporting Club, which was [scheduled for] Wednesday, 28th August 2024, has been rescheduled due to unforeseen circumstances.

“We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may cause. The new date for this encounter will be communicated in due course,” the statement reads.

Bullets Chief Executive Officer Albert Chigoga hailed Sulom for arriving at the decision, which, he said, would give them time to rest, having returned from Lusaka, Zambia, where the side lost 2-0 to Red Arrows to bow out of the race 3-2 on aggregate.

“We are very grateful for this. Our players are tired and badly needed rest after returning from Lusaka. This is a football decision,” he said.

The move will also help Bullets prepare for the FDH Bank Cup final against Premier Division side Blue Eagles, slated for Sunday at Bingu National Stadium.

However, football analyst Roy Abramo M’dechi felt the decision was made late.

“This is pure football administration and stakeholders must be commended for this decision. In the first place, the midweek game between Bullets and Moyale last week should not have taken place as the quadruple winners were scheduled to travel to Zambia for the second leg against Red Arrows.

“To play again on Wednesday after they also played on Saturday in Zambia, with the FDH Bank Cup fixture on Sunday, September 1, was total injustice to the health of the players who deserve rest,” M’dechi said.

Meanwhile, Creck spokesperson Rhemo Malunga has said they are yet to discuss Sulom’s stance.
