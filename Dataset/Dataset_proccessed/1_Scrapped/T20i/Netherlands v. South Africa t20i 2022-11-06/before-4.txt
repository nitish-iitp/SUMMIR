Team Analysis:


South Africa:


Amid severe criticism South Africa skipper Temba Bavuma played a fine knock of 36 runs in 19 deliveries against Pakistan. The likes of Rilee Rossouw, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen and Tristian Stubbs will form a strong middle-order for South Africa. 

Kagiso Rabada has excelled in the field and has taken couple of great catches in the tournament. Rabada must be added in the fantasy squad. Meanwhile, Anrich Nortje, Lungi Ngidi and Tabraiz Shamsi can be considered as well.


Probable playing XI:


Quinton de Kock (wk), Temba Bavuma (c), Rilee Rossouw, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, Tristan Stubbs, Wayne Parnell, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, Anrich Nortje, Tabraiz Shamsi


Netherlands:


Netherlands features great set of batters in their squad and if they make a collective effort the side can easily cause an upset. Max O'Dowd, Tom Cooper and Colin Ackermann have been making valuable contribution in the side. 

Meanwhile, all-rounders like Bas de Leede and Scott Edwards will be key for the side. Logan van Beek, Fred Klaassen, Paul van Meekeren, and Brandon Glover makes a strong bowling attack for Netherlands. Although, Netherlands is not regarded as a strong team against South Africa, but a right mindset and proper implementation can do wonders for the side.


Probable playing XI:


Stephan Myburgh, Max ODowd, Tom Cooper, Colin Ackermann, Bas de Leede, Scott Edwards (c & wk), Roelof van der Merwe, Logan van Beek, Fred Klaassen, Paul van Meekeren, Brandon Glover
