Kangana Ranaut says her make up artist believes she resembles Indira Gandhi physically. The first look of the film Emergency, released recently and showed her as the late Indian PM.

Kangana Ranaut has said that her make up artist on Emergency, David Malinowski, had told her her jawline and are similar to those of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

Kangana makes her directorial debut with Emergency. Before Emergency, Kangana essayed the role of a real life person in Thalaivi. She played the titular role of former chief minister of Tamil Nadu J Jayalalithaa.

Speaking with Mid Day, Kangana said, "David and his team are astute professionals. An entire team flew down from London. We had a series of meetings to ascertain the final look, and did a bunch of look tests. David took the calls on how to go about it. In fact, he pointed out that I physically resemble Mrs Gandhi a lot, including the skin texture and jawline. I told him that in India, people believe I am the perfect person to play Mrs Gandhi.”

Having worked in popular Hollywood films such as World War Z (2013) and The Batman (2022), David Malinowski has also won several awards including the 2018 BAFTA and Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling in the 2017 film Darkest Hour, where he transformed Gary Oldman into British PM Winston Churchill.

Kangana was recently seen in Dhaakad, which proved to be a box office dud. She has Tejas next in line. She will be seen as an Indian Air Force officer in the film directed by Sarvesh Mewara.

Kangana will also make her debut as a producer with Nawazuddin Siddiqui- Tiku weds Sheru. Set for a digital release on Amazon Prime, it also features Avneet Kaur.
