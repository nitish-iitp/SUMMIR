We are back for the chase! The umpires are out in the middle as the West Indian players can be seen in a huddle. Skipper Regis Chakabva and Wesley Madhevere are the openers for Zimbabwe. Kyle Mayers will get proceedings underway with the ball for West Indies.

... The Run Chase ...

!

West Indies need wickets with the new ball to defend this total and stay alive in this edition's ICC Men's T20 World Cup. While Zimbabwe need to bat with intent, they will require their top order to step up this evening. Should be a riveting chase. Stay tuned...

!

The Zimbabwean bowlers were unable to use the new ball to their advantage. However, once the ball got old, the spinners came into play and that triggered a mini-collapse. Sikandar Raza was Zimbabwe’s most effective bowler accounting for 3 wickets while the rest of the bowlers also put in a decent effort.

!

Opting to bat first, the West Indian openers got their side off to a decent start. Johnson Charles held the innings together for them. At 97-3, when West Indies were starting to slow down and needed him to stay there in the middle, a mix-up between him and Powell resulted in his untimely departure. West Indies kept losing wickets at regular intervals from there and as a result, couldn’t really recover from that collapse. The stand between Rovman Powell and Akeal Hosein though helped them to a total with which they can at least fight.

!

Right then, a couple of lusty blows in the final over and West Indies have managed to post a target above 150. Having chosen to bat first, Pooran will be somewhat disappointed with his side’s effort with the bat. Zimbabwe, on the flip side, will certainly be happy with the fightback from their bowlers as at one stage, West Indies were in a dominant position.

BLESSING MUZARABANI TO ODEAN SMITH

Excellent delivery to end by Blessing Muzarabani. The giant bowler nails the yorker on the leg stump line, Odean Smith just about manages to jam it out on the off side and they scamper through for one. West Indies finish with 153/7 on the board.

BLESSING MUZARABANI TO ODEAN SMITH

TWO LEG BYES! Slower one, on a fuller length and angling into the pads. Odean Smith looks to back away and flick it leg side but misses. The ball hits the pads and goes past the stumps and past the diving keeper towards third man. The fielder in the deep picks it up as the batters come back for two runs.

!

Odean Smith arrives with two legal balls left.

BLESSING MUZARABANI TO ROVMAN POWELL

OUT! TAKEN! The change of length has worked for Blessing Muzarabani and he gets his revenge on Rovman Powell, who has done the damage though. This is pitched up around the off stump and Powell yet again looks to whack it across the line. Powell loses his shape and ends up slicing it high and towards the extra cover region. Richard Ngarava over there moves to his left and keeps his eyes on the ball before pouching it safely. Powell departs after a few lusty blows and Muzarabani has his second wicket.

BLESSING MUZARABANI TO ROVMAN POWELL

SIX! OUTTA HERE! Another short ball by Blessing Muzarabani and Rovman Powell is just waiting for it. Powell stands tall and just smokes it a long way over the mid-wicket fence. That hit went a massive 104 meters, staggering!

BLESSING MUZARABANI TO ROVMAN POWELL

WIDE! An attempted yorker at the toes but it is spilled down the leg side. Wided.

BLESSING MUZARABANI TO ROVMAN POWELL

Swing and a miss! Fuller and close to the off stump. Rovman Powell hangs deep and has a wild swing across the line but loses his shape and fails to make any sort of connection with the ball.

BLESSING MUZARABANI TO ROVMAN POWELL

SIX! Smashed away! Short ball, over middle but it doesn't rise high enough. Rovman Powell muscles it flat over the square leg fence for a maximum. Good start to the over for the Windies.

RICHARD NGARAVA TO AKEAL HOSEIN

Excellent running! Full and straight, Akeal Hosein drills it straight back past the bowler. The fielder from long on cuts it out as the batters come back for the second run.

RICHARD NGARAVA TO ROVMAN POWELL

This is in the blockhole, around off and angling away. Powell tries to get under it but only manages to hit it to wide long on for a run.

RICHARD NGARAVA TO ROVMAN POWELL

A slight fumble and they get two. A low full toss, around off, Rovman Powell drags it towards wide long on and a slight misfield by the fielder over there allows the batters to come back for two.

RICHARD NGARAVA TO AKEAL HOSEIN

Lucky! Richard Ngarava attempts the yorker but ends up serving a high full toss on off stump. Akeal Hosein backs away and only manages to get it off the inner half of the bat towards deep mid-wicket for a single.

RICHARD NGARAVA TO AKEAL HOSEIN

FOUR! Up and over! Slower one, on a hard length and around off. Hosein picks it up and thumps it over mid off to pick up a much-needed boundary for his side.

RICHARD NGARAVA TO AKEAL HOSEIN

Good aggression from Richard Ngarava. This is a bumper, around off and rises up high as well. Hosein looks to leap and cut it away but misses.
