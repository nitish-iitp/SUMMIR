Right then. That's it from the coverage of this game. The T20 World Cup action continues on Wednesday, 19 October 2022. Another double-header coming your way with Scotland taking on Ireland at 9.30 am IST (4 am GMT). Followed by a game between West Indies and Zimbabwe which will be played at 1.30 pm IST (8 am GMT). But as you all know you can join us early for the build-up. Until then, take care and goodbye!

!

Dasun Shanaka, the victorious skipper is in for a chat. He says that the crowd follows them and he is thankful to them for their support. Mentions that he is really disappointed with the way they ended the innings as they could have easily got to 180 or 190. Adds that he and Bhanuka Rajapaksa didn’t click in the middle overs and that cost them a few runs. Claims that coming into this game it was important to get the win and they didn’t worry about net run rate. Adds that they were able to put up a good score on the board and Dushmantha Chameera and Wanindu Hasaranga did well to restrict the opponents. Credits Pathum Nissanka for an outstanding innings and adds that he has always had the talent and they are proud of him. Ends by saying that hopefully everything will be fine with Dushmantha Chameera.

!

Chundangapoyil Rizwan, the skipper of United Arab Emirates says that they restricted the opponents to a decent total. Admits that they could have bowled better in the first half of the game but they did well to get back in match. Credits Karthik Meiyappan for bowling beautifully and adds that getting a Hat-trick in the World Cup is exceptional. Mentions that they usually play in hotter conditions but need to adapt to the different climates. Ends by saying that the batters could not get going as the Sri Lankan fast bowlers bowled well with the new ball and they need to work on their skill sets to do better.

!

Pathum Nissanka wins the Man of the Match award for his incredible knock of 74 runs. He says along with Kusal Mendis he was able to build a good opening partnership. Adds that all the other batters helped him build his innings. Claims that he is happy to play a game like this in the World Cup and thanks the crowd for their support.

!

Stay tuned for the presentation...

!

Earlier in the innings, Sri Lanka seemed to be on track to score around 180, although they could not keep the ante up and only posted 152 on the board. It was the brilliant effort of the UAE bowlers that helped them to pull things back. It was majorly because of Karthik Meiyappan who turned the game on its head with his Hat-Trick. Later though UAE could not turn on the heat with the blade and got bundled out for 73 runs.

!

Sri Lanka ripped the hearts of the UAE outfit. The bowlers never allowed the batters to have a breather at the crease. It was Dushmantha Chameera who opened the floodgates and boy, he was enjoying his time back from injury. Although, to break the hearts of Sri Lankan fans he was unable to complete his spell of 4 overs, as he went off the ground after picking up a niggle in his run-up. Hopefully, he should be back soon and it does not affect Sri Lanka's journey. Dushmantha Chameera was the star with 3 wickets. Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana also did the trick with the ball and combined for 5 wickets.

!

United Arab Emirates could not turn up with the blade tonight. It looked like they will put up a solid fight with the way Chirag Suri started the innings, although things went bad very soon as they lost 4 wickets inside the Powerplay. Later, on only Aayan Khan played a gritty knock and Junaid Siddique entertained the crowd with his aggressive approach. Apart from them, no other batter could live up to the task.

!

Sri Lanka record their first win of the campaign in front of the buoyant Sri Lankan fans. United Arab Emirates tried their very best with the ball but the early collapse with the bat took the game away from them. Although there are a lot of sweet memories that UAE will take from this game.

MAHEESH THEEKSHANA TO JUNAID SIDDIQUE

OUT! CAUGHT! Maheesh Theekshana wraps up the game for Sri Lanka and celebrates the wicket in style with a bow and arrow celebration! This is bowled in line with the stumps on a fuller length, Junaid Siddique gets his front foot to the leg side and heaves the ball toward the leg side. He slices this to long on where Pathum Nissanka takes an easy catch and it fitting that he ends the game after his outstanding knock in the first inning. Sri Lanka have won by 79 runs and this has been a walk in the park for them.

DASUN SHANAKA TO JUNAID SIDDIQUE

This is a fraction fuller and outside the off pole, Junaid Siddique pushes at the ball and gets an inside edge towards short fine leg for a single.

DASUN SHANAKA TO JUNAID SIDDIQUE

WIDE! Dasun Shanaka bowls a slower bouncer just outside off, Junaid Siddique is deceived by the pace but the umpire calls this wide for height.

!

OH NO! A huge blow for Sri Lanka. Their big man Dushmantha Chameera is struggling at the moment with an injury. He pulls out of his run-up and makes his way out of the field. The physio will surely have a closer look on the injury. Hopefully, it is nothing major.

SIX! Junaid Siddique is not hanging around here! The ball has been dispatched out of the stadium for the longest six in the tournament so far! Dushmantha Chameera bowls this full on the pads, Junaid Siddique gets his front foot out of the way and plunders this over the deep square leg for a 109 meters biggie!
