ALL-ROUNDER Jason Holder said the West Indies players relish "big games" as a win against Ireland on Friday will seal a spot for the regional team in the Super 12s of the 2022 International Cricket Council T20 World Cup.

On Wednesday, West Indies defeated Zimbabwe by 31 runs in a qualifying match in Hobart, Australia, to keep their chances alive of advancing.

Looking ahead to the match against Ireland, Holder said, "We've got one solid game to play against Ireland and that is what we intend to do. I think we have shown some good attributes in the last game and we brought a very good vibe and attitude...looking forward to this game against Ireland. I think it is a big game and we like big games. I am sure the guys are really up for it and we are looking to win this game solidly."

The match between West Indies and Ireland will bowl off at midnight (TT time), on Friday.

Against Zimbabwe, West Indies posted 153/7 in 20 overs with opener Johnson Charles cracking three fours and two sixes in his innings of 45 off 36 balls.

Vice-captain Rovman Powell chipped in with 28 off 21 deliveries and Akeal Hosein contributed 23 not out off 18.

Sikandar Raza was the chief destroyer for Zimbabwe grabbing 3/19 in four overs and Blessing Muzarabani picked up 2/38 in four overs.

In reply, Zimbabwe made a rollicking start getting to 47/1 in the fifth over with opener Wessly Madhevere leading the way.

Zimbabwe then lost wickets regularly and were reduced to 64/5 after 7.2 overs.

Zimbabwe never recovered and were dismissed for 122 in 18.2 overs.

Luke Jongwe scored 29 off 22 balls and Madhevere hit 27 off 19.

Fast bowler Alzarri Joseph snatched 4/16 in four overs and Holder took 3/12 in 3.2 overs.

Holder said the West Indies players knew how crucial a victory was over Zimbabwe. "We were all pumped up for the game and we knew what was at stake and the importance of the match...it is just basically us showing that passion and love that we have grown through the years playing this sport and it was important that we brought the right energy towards the game yesterday (Wednesday.)"

Holder commended Joseph for his effort against Zimbabwe and said he is one of the key players.

"I am extremely proud of his progression. I see him as a leader and I think he is leading this attack at a young age and showing his great attributes as a leader. His performance don't surprise me because of the work he has put in, his discipline, his dedication towards the cause and his business-like attitude."
