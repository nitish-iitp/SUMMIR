The ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 is set to feature an exciting Group C, where two-time champions and co-hosts West Indies are poised to face off against formidable opponents.

Two-time champions West Indies, aiming to leverage their home advantage, will kick off their campaign against Papua New Guinea on Sunday, June 2, at the Providence Stadium. With a mix of seasoned veterans and dynamic newcomers, the West Indies are eager to showcase their prowess in front of their home crowd. New Zealand, another heavyweight in Group C, will also look to establish their dominance early on. Known for their consistency and depth, the Kiwis are expected to be strong contenders for the top spot in the group.

However, Afghanistan, Uganda, and Papua New Guinea are not to be underestimated. Afghanistan, with their potent spin attack led by Rashid Khan, can upset any team on their day. Uganda, riding high on an impressive win percentage and strong recent form, will be keen to make a mark in their World Cup journey. Papua New Guinea, known for their spirited performances, will aim to spring surprises and challenge the more established teams.

Here's how the individual teams line up.

WEST INDIES

A series victory against defending champions England towards the end of last year showcased the potential of a full-strength West Indies team. Despite their lackluster performance in the 2022 edition, the Rovman Powell-led side now poses a significant threat.

The team is well-balanced, featuring several all-rounders and big hitters capable of changing the course of a game, adding to their X-factor. Notably, the squad includes Shamar Joseph, who, although uncapped in T20Is until his recent debut against South Africa, demonstrated his talent during the Test series in Australia earlier this year.

The West Indies also benefit from a relatively easier start to the tournament, facing lower-ranked teams PNG and Uganda in their initial matches. A strong start could position the co-hosts as favorites to top their group.

NEW ZEALAND

New Zealand's squad for this edition remains largely unchanged from 2022, showcasing their consistency and well-rounded unit. With 36 T20Is played since the last World Cup, the most among full-member teams, they are well-prepared. Their depth was evident when a second-string squad leveled a recent series in Pakistan. Kane Williamson, in his sixth T20 World Cup, leads a team blending experience and youth, including standout performers Rachin Ravindra and Finn Allen.

Veterans Trent Boult and Tim Southee head the pace attack, supported by Lockie Ferguson and Matt Henry. The spin options feature Mitchell Santner, Ish Sodhi, Michael Bracewell, and Ravindra. New Zealand starts their campaign against Afghanistan in Guyana, followed by a match against co-hosts West Indies in Trinidad.

AFGHANISTAN

Afghanistan, ranked 10th in the ICC Men’s T20I Team Rankings, are more than capable of securing significant wins. Since the last T20 World Cup, they have achieved series victories against UAE (twice), Pakistan, and Ireland, and reached the final of the Asian Games Men's Cricket Competition, narrowly losing to India.

The squad is strengthened by the return of Rashid Khan from a long injury layoff. He heads a versatile spin department featuring Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Noor Ahmad, Nangyal Kharoti, and veteran Mohammad Nabi. Afghanistan will kick off their campaign against Uganda in Guyana on June 3.

With plenty of all-rounders in the squad, PNG have a versatile unit that can test the bigger teams in the group. Papua New Guinea kicks off their campaign with a challenging opening match against the host nation, West Indies, on June 2. They then face Uganda on June 5, followed by matches against Afghanistan and New Zealand.

Uganda secured their spot in the T20 World Cup by defeating Rwanda decisively in their final match of the Africa region qualifier. With five wins in six games, Uganda, alongside Namibia, emerged as the standout team in the Africa Qualifier. Heading into the tournament, Uganda boasts an impressive record, winning 41 of their last 49 T20Is, with a win percentage of 83.67%.

Led by Brian Masaba, Uganda brings a wealth of experience to the tournament. The squad includes the 43-year-old Frank Nsubuga and Alpesh Ramjani, who was nominated for the 2023 ICC Men's T20I Cricketer of the Year. Uganda will play their first three games in Guyana, with the potential to surprise from Group C.
