PNG vs UGA Live Streaming Details: Papua New Guinea and Uganda look for first win. (AP/PTI)

Papua New Guinea vs Uganda ICC T20 World Cup 2024 Live Streaming: Papua New Guinea will look to build on their impressive performance against the West Indies in the opening match when they take on a wounded Uganda outfit at the Providence Stadium in Guyana on Thursday.

PNG had almost given hosts West Indies a late scare when their bowlers led by captain Assad Vala put the two-times champions under tremendous pressure in a 137-run chase. WI needed the combined experience of Andre Russel and Roston Chase to get to a tricky target after losing a couple of quick wickets.

Uganda, meanwhile, was thoroughly thrashed an Afghanistan unit by 125-runs on Tuesday after they were bundled out for 58 while chasing 183. Playing in just their second R20 World Cup, Uganda would hope for a win against PNG in order to improve on their previous performance where they had won 1 match.
