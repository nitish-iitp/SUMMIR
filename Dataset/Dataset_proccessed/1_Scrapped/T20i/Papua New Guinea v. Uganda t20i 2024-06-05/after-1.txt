WORLD T20: History beckons for PNG and Uganda in all-Associate clash at Providence

History beckons when Papua New Guinea take on Uganda in an all-Associate clash in Group C with one of them set for their first win in a T20 World Cup.

Both teams know Wednesday’s game will be their best shot at collecting two crucial points, having been placed alongside strong teams such as Afghanistan, West Indies and New Zealand in the group.

Both PNG and Uganda are coming off defeats in their opening-round fixtures, but that may not necessarily dent their confidence. PNG, who made their T20 World Cup debut in 2021, had lost all of their four matches then but threatened to pull off an upset against co-hosts West Indies a few days ago.

A strong team in the East Asia-Pacific region, especially in the shortest format, PNG are capable of handing Uganda- in their first World Cup appearance in any sport- a thrashing.

Uganda are a high-energy team. One of the biggest highlights in their journey to the Caribbean was qualifying ahead of Zimbabwe via the Africa Region Qualifier last year, where they beat Zimbabwe by five wickets. Cut to 2024, up against Afghanistan in the opener, they folded for 58 in chase of 184, and it underlined the gulf between the two sides.

Come Wednesday, the gulf may not be massive, thus providing a realistic hope for Uganda- who have played a total of 92 games in this format since achieving the T20I status in 2019 – to etch their name into World Cup history. But can they put up a better show with the bat will be the question?

Team news

Norman Vanua, PNG’s highest wicket-taker in T20Is, was expected to lead the pace attack but missed the first game. It remains to be seen if he will make it to the XI against Uganda.

PNG (probable XI): 1 Tony Ura, 2 Assad Vala (capt), 3 Lega Siaka, 4 Sese Bau, 5 Hiri Hiri, 6 Charles Amini, 7 Kiplin Doriga (wk), 8 Chad Soper, 9 Alei Nao, 10 Kabua Morea, 11 John Kariko

Uganda went in with an experienced XI and used as many as seven bowlers against Afghanistan. With three spinners and four pace-bowling options, they might stick with the same XI.

Uganda (probable XI): 1 Ronak Patel, 2 Simon Ssesazi (wk), 3 Roger Mukasa, 4 Riazat Ali Shah, 5 Dinesh Nakrani, 6 Alpesh Ramjani, 7 Robinson Obuya, 8 Brian Masaba (capt), 9 Bilal Hassan, 10 Cosmas Kyewuta, 11 Henry Ssenyondo (ESPNcricinfo)
