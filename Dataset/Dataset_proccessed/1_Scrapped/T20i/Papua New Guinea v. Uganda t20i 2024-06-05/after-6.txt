Right then, that is it from this entertaining game where Uganda registers their first-ever World Cup win while Papua New Guinea still have to wait for that achievement. However, the action in the T20 World Cup continues as another match is going on where Australia is taking on Oman. You can just switch tabs to enjoy all the coverage of that game. Cheers!

!

Brian Masaba, the victorious skipper of Uganda says it is a special win, the first win at the World Cup and it couldn't get better than this. Adds it's been 3-4 years of hard work from all the players. Tells they got the plans and execution right as compared to the last match, the bowling team set up the win today. Mentions it's a real scrap out there chasing such a low score but credit to Miyagi and Shah for taking the team home. Admits back home they are not expecting them to win the cup but they appreciate the support they are getting.

!

Assad Vala, the captain of Papua New Guinea says that if they got anything around 100, that would have given them a better chance. Adds that losing too many wickets did not help them and they also gave away too many extras. Mentions that they also could not take the chances and those are the areas that they need to work on going forward.

!

Riazat Ali Shah is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his match-winning knock. He says it was not easy to bat and he had to stay in there as they lost a lot of wickets. Shares the plan was to stay in and rotate the strike. Tells that the first win of the World Cup is special. Appreciates the support from the crowd and also from back home in Uganda.

!

Presentation Time...

!

Earlier in the game, Papua New Guinea posted a well below-par total and only three batters crossed the single-digit mark. Uganda were sensational with the ball and except for Brian Masaba, every other bowler picked up a couple of wickets each. Frank Nsubuga also bowled the most economical spell in the T20 World Cup giving away just 4 runs in his four overs. While chasing, Uganda found themselves reeling at 26/5, but found a saviour in Riazat Ali Shah whose knock got them home.

!

Papua New Guinea, on the other, will be disappointed as they had Uganda in a spot of bother and were probably ahead in the game. However, some poor fielding and catching proved to be very costly. Charles Amini dropped Riazat Ali Shah on 8 and that was the turning point in the game as he took the game away from them. They also gave away too many extras and when you are defending a low total, you cannot afford to do that. Alei Nao and Norman Vanua picked up a couple of wickets each while Chad Soper and Assad Vala chipped in with one each. They will feel like this was a missed opportunity for them but we have to give credit to them to take the game this deep.

!

Uganda suffered early blows once again which put them under immense pressure. The openers couldn't make much impact and they lost four wickets inside the Powerplay which turned into 26/5 not long after. It was Riazat Ali Shah who showed his experience and held one end strongly. He did get a life and used that to full advantage and found good support from Juma Miyagi as they added 35 crucial runs together that shifted the momentum towards them. A miscommunication cost the latter his wicket but Shah stayed there and scored 33 runs but could not finish the game. Kenneth Waiswa hit the winning runs to etch his name in the history books.

!

UGANDA CREATES HISTORY! They get their first World Cup victory in only their second-ever game. It is all smiles in their hut, and the fans present in the stadium are dancing around to celebrate this famous win. It is once again so close, yet so far for Papua New Guinea as they showed great fight defending this low score but their catching and extras let them down in the end.
