AFG vs SL T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights: Sri Lanka beat Afghanistan by 6 wickets, Afghanistan knocked out of WC

AFG vs SL T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights: Check latest updates of Afghanistan vs Sri Lanka T20 World Cup Group A clash, Brisbane weather report.

DNA Web Team

Updated : Nov 01, 2022, 12:56 PM IST | Edited by : Ashish Kapoor

Sri Lanka defeated Bangladesh by 6 wickets as Dhananjaya De Silva played a unbeaten knock of 66 in 42 deliveries to chase down the target of 145 with 9 balls to spare.

Sri Lanka pretty happy to keep this to 144. Afghanistan surely should have got at least 15-20 more for the base set by Gurbaz and Ghani. Gurbaz played some delightful shots, so did Ibrahim. But both got out swinging down the ground to Kumara. Najib struggled to middle the ball for most parts, while Gulbadin and Nabi couldn't give that extra lift towards the end.

Afghanistan skipper Mohammad Nabi won the toss and has opted to bat first in the match 32 of ICC T20 World Cup against Sri Lanka.

TRENDING NOW

As teams in Group 1 of the Super 12s deal with washouts and unexpected results, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka have reached the proverbial edge of the cliff. One wrong step and they'll have to pack their bags and return home.

 

READ: HUGE blow to France as Paul Pogba set to miss FIFA World Cup in Qatar due to injury

Sri Lanka have one win in three games and Afghanistan's two points are from two washouts, and yet there's very little to separate the two sides. They've had recent tussles against each other in the Asia Cup and each side will take confidence from their respective wins in that tournament.

 

In the one game they've played, Afghanistan were uncharacteristically timid with the bat. The top-order flamboyance went missing and the tentativeness percolated through to all phases of the game for them.

Clinical from Dhananjaya who fittingly hits the winning runs. Sri Lanka's bowlers bowled really well in the back end of the innings to restrict Afghanistan to a below-par score. In reply, the Asian champions got off to a slow start. They lost both their openers to spin and were 63/2 at the halfway stage. After the drinks break, Dhananjaya decided to up the ante and went about his business in style.

01 Nov 2022, 12:51 PM

Fazalhaq Farooqi to Dhananjaya, FOUR, Sri Lanka win by 6 wickets! That's a stunning shot to finish the match. Overpitched delivery, Dhananjaya stylishly carves it over extra cover for a boundary. Afghanistan have been knocked out!

01 Nov 2022, 12:43 PM

17.6 Mujeeb to Rajapaksa, out Caught by Gurbaz!! Rajapaksa is walking. A wicket off the final ball for Mujeeb but it's too little, too late. It's the in-turner and Rajapaksa tries to late-steer it backward of square on off-side. Hits his glove and lobs up off the keeper's arms. Gurbaz takes a safe catch. Rajapaksa c Gurbaz b Mujeeb 18(14) [4s-3]

Overs - 18  Runs - 142/4

01 Nov 2022, 12:33 PM

16.2 Fazalhaq Farooqi to Dhananjaya, FOUR, overpitched outside off and Dhananjaya drives it aerially over extra cover. Stylish stroke off the front foot and he poses for the photographs

Overs - 16.2 Overs - 127/3

01 Nov 2022, 12:32 PM

14.3 Gulbadin to Rajapaksa, FOUR, 101kph, slow and overpitched, Rajapaksa waits and lifts it over mid-off for a one-bounce four

Overs - 14.3  Runs - 114/3

01 Nov 2022, 12:28 PM

14.2 Gulbadin to Rajapaksa, FOUR, 128kph, from round the wicket, Gulbadin strays a short of a good length ball onto the batters' pads. A hopping Rajapaksa looks to glance and gets a faint inside edge that eludes the diving keeper to his right

 

01 Nov 2022, 12:26 PM


13.4 Rashid Khan to Rajapaksa, FOUR, 88kph, leggie, but Rashid Khan errs with his line. Strays onto the pads and Rajapaksa tickles it very fine. Dribbles away to fine leg and Rajapaksa gets off the mark with a boundary

01 Nov 2022, 12:24 PM

13.3 Rashid Khan to Asalanka, out Caught by Azmatullah!! Holes out! The 54-run stand has been broken. Sees the length on the fuller side and Asalanka decides to loft it over long-on by clearing his front leg. Made good contact but didn't get the required elevation. Azmatullah, at long-on, takes an overhead catch. Asalanka c Azmatullah b Rashid Khan 19(18) [4s-1]

Overs - 13.3  Runs - 100/3

01 Nov 2022, 12:21 PM

12.6 Azmatullah to Dhananjaya, 1 run, 126kph, off-speed short ball, Dhananjaya swivels and pulls along the ground to backward square leg. 10 runs off the over!

Overs - 13  Runs - 99/2

01 Nov 2022, 12:19 PM

12.4 Azmatullah to Asalanka, FOUR, 132kph, hit-the-deck-hard shortish delivery, Asalanka wafts his bat hard probably in an attempt to go over point

Overs - 12.4  Runs - 97/2

01 Nov 2022, 12:18 PM

11.6 Nabi to Dhananjaya, 2 runs, Dhananjaya stays back, waits for the ball to do its bit and short-arm-jabs it over mid-wicket for a couple more.

Overs - 12  Runs - 89/2

01 Nov 2022, 12:16 PM

11.3 Nabi to Dhananjaya, SIX, shot! Dhananjaya shimmies down the track, gets close to the pitch of the ball and lofts it straight down the ground for an 89m six!

01 Nov 2022, 12:15 PM

10.6 Rashid Khan to Dhananjaya, 1 run, wrong 'un, cut to deep backward point. Good over for Sri Lanka - 14 runs off the over!

Overs - 11  Runs - 77/2

01 Nov 2022, 12:13 PM

10.3 Rashid Khan to Dhananjaya, SIX, this one's off the meat of the bat. Dhananjaya gets down on one leg and nails the slogsweep dispatching it over deep mid-wicket for an 81m six!

01 Nov 2022, 12:00 PM

10.2 Rashid Khan to Dhananjaya, FOUR, 93kph, Dhananjaya gets down to sweep this leggie and gets a thick inside edge that

Overs 10.2  Runs - 68/2

01 Nov 2022, 11:59 AM

7.6 Rashid Khan to Asalanka, 5 wides, quick and down the leg-side, was the leggie and Asalanka missed the glance. Gurbaz can't stop it and the ball dribbles away to fine leg. Five bonus runs

Overs - 8  Runs - 51/2

01 Nov 2022, 11:56 AM

7.5 Rashid Khan to Kusal Mendis, out Caught by Gurbaz!! Rashid Khan strikes in his first over! 90kph, full and on the stumps, Kusal Mendis goes for the premeditated sweep and only manages a top-edge. The ball ballons up towards the square leg region and two Afghanistan players (keeper and 1st slip) run towards it. Gurbaz, the man with the gloves, calls for it and takes a safe catch. Kusal Mendis c Gurbaz b Rashid Khan 25(27) [4s-2 6s-1]

 

01 Nov 2022, 11:55 AM

6.6 Fareed Ahmad to Dhananjaya, FOUR, sublime! 135kph, on a length and marginally outside off, Dhananjaya hangs back and punches it superbly beating the mid-off fielder to his left. Exquisite timing and the ball speeds away to the fence. 16 runs off the over!

Overs - 7  Runs - 44/1

01 Nov 2022, 11:47 AM

6.3 Fareed Ahmad to Kusal Mendis, SIX, stand and deliver! 138kph, Fareed Ahmad goes full, Kusal Mendis stays in his crease, gets under it and tonks it over straight mid-off. Goes all the way. Top-class!

 

01 Nov 2022, 11:46 AM

Overs 1-5

Mujeeb knocks over Nissanka with a carrom ball

Farooqi bowls a maiden in his second over

Mujeeb bowls another tight over as Sri Lanka are pegged back

Farid bowls a quick first over but is put away for a couple of fours

Overs - 5  Runs - 23/1

01 Nov 2022, 11:45 AM

4.4 Fareed Ahmad to Kusal Mendis, FOUR, back-to-back pull shots over mid-wicket and the pressure has been released. Short of a length delivery, sits up nicely, Kusal powers it over the infield

01 Nov 2022, 11:39 AM

4.3 Fareed Ahmad to Kusal Mendis, FOUR, now that is a crunchy pull shot. The sound off the bat was sweet. Short delivery, Kusal pulls and sends this aerial over mid-wicket. Finally gets going

01 Nov 2022, 11:36 AM

2.6 Fazalhaq Farooqi to Kusal Mendis, no run, full and attacking off stump, Kusal respects with a forward defence. Maiden over to back up Mujeeb's wicket-taking over

Overs - 3  Runs - 12/1

01 Nov 2022, 11:35 AM

1.6 Mujeeb to Nissanka, out Bowled!! Knocked him over. Carrom ball, gripping and turning away, Nissanka playing well inside the line and missed it by a mile. Wears a puzzled face. But this was literally coming. First a leading edge, then found the outer half of the bat and now completely goes past the bat to hit off stump. Mujeeb couldn't read Mujeeb's carrom balls and Afghanistan are pumped. This is home ground in fact, plays for the Heat in the BBL. Nissanka b Mujeeb 10(10) [4s-2]

Overs - 2  Runs - 12/1

01 Nov 2022, 11:28 AM

1.2 Mujeeb to Nissanka, FOUR, that is a drab hit me short delivery wide of off stump, Nissanka happily accepts the gift and cuts past cover-point

Overs - 1.2 Runs - 12/0

01 Nov 2022, 11:27 AM

0.2 Fazalhaq Farooqi to Nissanka, FOUR, nothing short of a powerful square drive this time. Fazalhaq Farooqi went very full looking for swing and also offered width, Nissanka leans forward and cracks the drive to perfection

Overs - 0.2  Runs - 4/0

01 Nov 2022, 11:22 AM

Nissanka and Kusal Mendis are at the crease. Nissanka is on strike. Fazalhaq Farooqi will open the attack

01 Nov 2022, 11:14 AM

Sri Lanka will be pretty happy to keep this to 144. Afghanistan surely should have got at least 15-20 more for the base set by Gurbaz and Ghani.

01 Nov 2022, 11:12 AM

19.6 Hasaranga to Mujeeb, out Stumped!! Easy stumping. Again Hasaranga drops it short on seeing the batter step out, Mujeeb slogs and totally misses it. Kusal waits and knocks the bails off. Mujeeb st Kusal Mendis b Hasaranga 1(2)


Overs - 20  Runs - 144/8

01 Nov 2022, 11:09 AM

19.3 Hasaranga to Rashid Khan, out Bowled!! Smart from Hasaranga. Saw Rashid stepping out and bowled it very short to ensure Rashid can't get to the pitch of the ball. Rashid had no choice but to slog hard, missed the ball completely and the ball hits middle and off. Rashid Khan b Hasaranga 9(8) [4s-1]

Overs - 19.3  Runs - 142/7

01 Nov 2022, 11:08 AM

18.5 Rajitha to Nabi, out Caught by Shanaka!! This time Shanaka takes a skier. Slower wide full delivery, Nabi lofts but toe-ends. Extra-cover runs back to complete a good catch. Nabi c Shanaka b Rajitha 13(8) [4s-1]

Overs - 18.5  Runs - 140/6

01 Nov 2022, 11:07 AM

18.4 Rajitha to Rashid Khan, 1 run, dropped again. This time the captain is the culprit. Sri Lanka's fielding has been a let down. Slower full delivery outside off stump, Rashid absolutely smashed that flat, one of those in between ones for Shanaka as it came around chest height. Went reserve cup when it wasn't really high enough and he put it down

Overs - 18.4  Runs - 140/5

01 Nov 2022, 11:06 AM

18.2 Rajitha to Rashid Khan, 2 runs, edged but put down, tough for Mendis. Full delivery outside off stump, Rashid slogs, gets a thick edge, was travelling and Kusal Mendis jumped to grab that one-handed, tips it to third man

01 Nov 2022, 11:05 AM

18.1 Rajitha to Rashid Khan, FOUR, freebie for Rashid Khan. Allowed him to free the arms with a full juicy easy ball. Rashid lofted that over cover to begin the over on a high

Overs - 18.1  Runs - 136/5

01 Nov 2022, 11:04 AM

17.4 M Theekshana to Nabi, 3 runs, brilliant batting. Don't loft and give him a wicket, just knock it around in the gaps and push. This time Nabi flicks wide of long-on and Rashid Khan puts his skates on to push for the third and so does Nabi as the throw came to the bowler's end

 

01 Nov 2022, 11:03 AM

M Theekshana to Nabi, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!

17.2 M Theekshana to Nabi, out Gulbadin Run Out!! 1 run completed. Unfortunate end for Gulbadin. Nabi just wanted to play out Theekshana, so he nudged this along the ground to mid-wicket. Gulbadin wanted the second, but Nabi wasn't keen as it was tight. Gulbadin slipped while hitting the brakes and lost the bat too. Then he tries to roll back into the crease but the keeper had enough time to knock the bails off. TV ump wasn't even needed. Gulbadin run out (Nissanka/Kusal Mendis) 12(14)

01 Nov 2022, 10:53 AM

Dhananjaya to Najibullah, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

15.6 Dhananjaya to Najibullah, out Caught by Hasaranga!! Just as you wondered if DDS was needed, Sri Lanka have Najibullah. Najibullah c Hasaranga b Dhananjaya 18(16) [4s-1]

Overs - 16  Runs - 113/4

01 Nov 2022, 10:52 AM

15.2 Dhananjaya to Najibullah, FOUR, and he finally times the ball. Short, hit me ball from DDS, Najibullah camps back and pulls this nicely behind square on the on-side, splits deep mid-wicket and deep backward square leg to perfection

01 Nov 2022, 10:51 AM

Overs 11-15:

- Ghani pulls and holes out at deep mid

- Ibrahim Zadran goes after Theekshana; 17-run over

- Kumara removes the dangerous Zadran

- Hasaranga bowls a quiet over

- Another tidy over from Pramod Madushan

01 Nov 2022, 10:48 AM

14.6 Pramod Madushan to Najibullah, 2 runs, swung away in the air, no timing, luckily doesn't carry to long-on. Short of a length delivery, Najibullah swings hard and mistimes. Oh hang on, just as Pramod Madushan was running in to deliver, umpire Ahsan Raza had his arm stretched to the right like they would to signal a no ball. Not sure what that was about. Maybe some confusion about ball count

Overs - 15  Runs - 104/3

01 Nov 2022, 10:43 AM

13.6 Hasaranga to Gulbadin, 1 run, oh played for the leggie as he lunged forward to defend, massive bat-pad gap but Gulbadin is very lucky that the inside edge didn't disturb the stumps behind, rolls towards mid-wicket for a run

Overs - 14  runs - 99/3

01 Nov 2022, 10:42 AM

12.6 Kumara to Najibullah, 3 runs, short ball, outside off, the batter slaps that past cover and they come back for the third. They took the third one on the throw and a direct hit would have had the batter. The ball went over the sticks and the bowler also wasn't able to gather the throw. A better throw and Najibullah would have been in trouble

Overs - 13  Runs - 96/3

01 Nov 2022, 10:37 AM

Kumara to Ibrahim Zadran, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

12.2 Kumara to Ibrahim Zadran, out Caught by Rajapaksa!! And the skipper's decision of bowling out Kumara has worked. That was a back of a length delivery, Ibrahim Zadran wanted to go over mid-off but cue-ended it straight to the fielder at mid-off. The idea was right but the execution was far from being perfect. The length also wasn't there. Kumara gets his second scalp. Ibrahim Zadran c Rajapaksa b Kumara 22(18) [4s-1 6s-1]

01 Nov 2022, 10:36 AM

11.6 M Theekshana to Najibullah, 1 run, well lured up delivery, Najibullah drives the ball down to long-off for a single. 17 runs off the over as Afghanistan look to up the ante
17 runs off the over

Overs - 12  Runs - 89/2

01 Nov 2022, 10:36 AM

11.3 M Theekshana to Ibrahim Zadran, SIX, straight down the ground for a sixer! Was a tossed up delivery, Ibrahim Zadran knelt down and slammed it down the ground. Was a good muscular hit from Ibrahim Zadran as the fuller length allowed him to get under it

01 Nov 2022, 10:26 AM

11.1 M Theekshana to Ibrahim Zadran, FOUR, backs away and biffs it hard. The man at cover dived and so did the man at deep cover but both were beaten. That was hit ferociously

01 Nov 2022, 10:23 AM

10.2 Hasaranga to Usman Ghani, out Caught by Shanaka!! The googly, touch of bounce on it and the pull wasn't controlled. The extra bounce just put the batter off and he couldn't hit it with power. Usman Ghani c Shanaka b Hasaranga 27(27) [4s-2 6s-1]
Hasaranga to Usman Ghani, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

Overs - 10.2  Runs - 68/2

01 Nov 2022, 10:19 AM

9.6 M Theekshana to Ibrahim Zadran, 2 runs, was a clumsy effort from Rajapaksa and he has allowed only a couple. He chased it down, picked up the ball just before it touched the ropes but then almost went over the ropes with the ball in his hand. But he managed to release it in time to allow only a brace. The Lankan ground fielding at best has been sloppy today
