In Short
Sandeep Lamichhane reached West Indies to play in the T20 World Cup
Lamichhane is 2 wickets short of 100 T20I wickets
South Africa are also through to the Super 12

Kagiso Rabada said that he is wary of the threat Sandeep Lamichhane is likely to pose to the South African batters. On Saturday, June 15, the Proteas will lock horns with Nepal in their last and final Group match at the Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown, St Vincent. Lamichhane did not play in the matches in the United States after he was denied a visa to enter the nation.

The 23-year-old Lamichhane, however, arrived in the West Indies with the hope of playing for Nepal in their last 2 Group matches. Rabada hailed him as a ‘mystery spinner’ and said that the Proteas may not find it easy facing him.

“Yeah, he's a mystery spinner, so any mystery spinner is going to be tough to play. But I know the guys are really looking forward to facing that challenge,” Rabada said in the pre-match press conference.

In 52 T20Is in his career since his debut back in 2018, Lamichhane has picked up 98 wickets at an economy rate of 6.29.

‘Not taking Nepal lightly’

South Africa have already made their way through to the Super 12, having won all 3 of their matches against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Netherlands. However, Rabada refrained from

“Yeah, it's another it's another international match, another fixture, and we're not taking them lightly and we're going to try and play some more of the same cricket or even better that we've been playing in the tournament,” Rabada said.

Rabada is also looking to bowl on sporting pitches after plying his trade on bowling-friendly tracks in New York.

“As a bowler, I must say, yeah, I have enjoyed it, 100%. But conditions will probably level out now,” Rabada added.

Rabada has taken 4 wickets from 3 matches in the ongoing World Cup at an economy rate of 5.58. He along with Anrich Nortje has created a lot of troubles for the opposition batters with their pace and accuracy.
