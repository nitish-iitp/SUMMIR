KATHMANDU, June 14: With the group stage of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 now complete, the competition heats up as eight teams vie for four semi-final spots in the next phase.




The teams advancing to the second round include India (Group A), Australia (Group B), Afghanistan (Group C), West Indies (Group C), and South Africa (Group D). India, Australia, and Afghanistan will compete in Group 1, while West Indies and South Africa will battle in Group 2. These teams have remained undefeated in their respective groups, setting the stage for an exciting second round.




The second round kicks off in Antigua on June 19. A key match between unbeaten India and Afghanistan is set for June 20 in Barbados. India will play their first match in the Caribbean during this tournament. Afghanistan aims to avenge their close loss to Australia in last year's ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup when they face off on June 22 in St Vincent. West Indies, the co-hosts, will take on South Africa in a crucial Group 2 clash on June 23 in Antigua. The historical dominance by the Proteas over the West Indies was overturned last month when the Men in Maroon swept the three-game T20I series. Another marquee matchup features finalists India against reigning champions Australia on June 24 in St Lucia.




The second round will see 12 matches played across Antigua, Barbados, St Lucia, and St Vincent.
