South Africa vs Nepal, T20 World Cup 2024 Highlights: South Africa defeated Nepal by one run after a final ball run out in a T20 World Cup Group D thriller on Saturday at the Arnos Vale Stadium in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

Heinrich Klaasen’s superb flicked throw at the stumps to run out Gulsan Jha on the final delivery sealed victory for the Proteas and dashed Nepal’s hopes of a famous upset at the Arnos Vale Stadium in St Vincent.

Nepal finished on 114-7, falling agonisingly short of South Africa’s modest total of 115-7.

Earler, inspired by the return of their champion leg-spinner, Nepal’s array of slow bowlers exploited a turgid surface to limit South Africa to 115/7 batting first.

Sandeep Lamichhane, denied a visa to enter the United States which kept him out of the first two matches, went wicketless through four overs but his mere presence seemed to lift his teammates with leg-break bowler Kushal Bhurtel (4 for 19) and off-spinner Dipendra Singh Airee (3 for 21) doing the damage after their captain, Rohit Paudel, won an important toss and put the Proteas in.

Already assured of a place in the Super Eight phase of the tournament and looking to close out the group campaign with a fourth win in as many matches, none of the South African top-order were able to get on top of the bowling, although opener Reeza Hendricks managed to give the innings some sort of stability with a top-score of 43 off 49 balls (five fours, one six).

Seeking to gain a measure of respectability against these powerful opponents after a frustrating campaign in the United States where they lost to The Netherlands and saw their match against Sri Lanka washed out, the Nepalese bowlers were in their element throughout the innings with only a late effort by Tristan Stubbs (27 not out off 18 balls) causing them some concern before Bhurtel closed off the innings with the wickets of Marco Jansen and Kagiso Rabada off successive balls.
