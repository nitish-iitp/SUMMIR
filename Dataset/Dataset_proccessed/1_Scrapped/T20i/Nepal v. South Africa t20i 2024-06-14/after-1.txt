However, Shami's spell turned the tables in the favour of the Proteas as they clinched the victory on the last ball by restricting Nepal to 114/7. Apart from Shamsi, Anrich Nortje and Aiden Markram also scalped one wicket each. For Nepal, Aasif Sheikh scored 43 runs. With this defeat, Nepal have been eliminated from the Super 8s race.

Right then, what a fabulous contest we have witnessed here at the Arnos Vale Ground in St Vincent and the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup just keeps giving us these humdingers which the neutrals certainly enjoy a lot. Also, in Tarouba, New Zealand have demolished a hapless Uganda side by 9 wickets in what is a consolation win for the Kiwis. There's still group stage action left in the tournament and next up, it will be India taking on Canada in Lauderhill on Saturday, 15 June at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT) but as usual, you can join us a lot sooner for the build-up. Till then, take care and goodbye!

!

Aiden Markram, the South African skipper says that he is grateful to have got the win. Adds that they were not at their best and were on the back foot for the most part of the game. Mentions that pace is their strength and they want to back it. Shares that it was challenging for the Nepalese batters when the pacers hit the right lengths. Lauds the Nepal bowling made it tough for them and the run-scoring was difficult. Adds that Nepal are a quality side. States that they want to prepare well going forward as the conditions in the Caribbean will be different from those in the USA. Shares that they need to assess, adapt, and develop their plans going forward. Ends by saying that they wanted to give Tabraiz Shamsi, some gametime and with Keshav Maharaj in the mix, both the spinners will play a key role going forward.

!

Nepal's skipper, Rohit Paudel says that he is very proud of the unit given the way they bowled and even batted. Adds that they knew the wicket would have been on the slower side and once they got a bit of a feel while bowling, they knew spinners would be the way to go. Reckons that they didn't quite manage to do well in the crunch moments and if they keep up the good work, next time, they will get over the line. On the fans, he says that he wants to thank everyone who has come in from so far and even those at home who watch them and support them.

!

Tabraiz Shamsi is the Player of the Match for his terrific spell. He says that he is definitely relieved as they came into the game with the intention of making four out of four. Adds that the game got close but they came out on the winning side. Lauds the Nepal side as they used the conditions well and played a wonderful game. Mentions that they have been put under pressure and came out victorious which is a positive for them. Ends by sharing that they want to take one game at a time.

The Presentation ceremony...

!

After having bowled brilliantly and restricted South Africa to just 115 runs, Nepal knew that a decent start in the Powerplay would help them a lot and they did get just that. Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh played and missed a few deliveries early on but managed to get away a few lovely boundaries as well. Bhurtel was the first one to fall and skipper, Rohit Paudel soon followed. Aasif Sheikh however stayed on and gave Nepal real hope of an upset. Anil Sah supported him well but when things got tight, neither of them could stay at the crease and it was left to the tail-enders to get the job done. Sompal Kami and Gulshan Jha gave it a fair fight in the last couple of overs but it just wasn't meant to be.

!

South Africa have pulled out another rabbit out of the hat and this team just seems to find a way but they will know that they certainly need to up their game, especially on the batting front if they are to keep winning in the next stage of the competition. On a pitch that aided the spinners, they only had one proper option with skipper, Aiden Markram acting as the part-timer. The Powerplay proved that pace wasn't the right way as they failed to pick up a single wicket. The wickets did come in the middle overs as Tabraiz Shamsi picked up a couple and Markram got one too. Still, the Proteas needed something special and with the required rate under run-a-ball, it had to be something special. Shamsi stepped up once again and bowled a gem of an 18th over, picking up a couple of more wickets and right at the very death, Ottneil Baartman managed to hold his nerves to keep the unbeaten record going.

!

SOUTH AFRICA HAVE DONE IT AGAIN AND IT IS HEARTBREAK-HOTEL FOR NEPAL! The Proteas have played 4 games and after the first game, all remaining three games have been low-scoring thrillers which they have managed to win whilst not being at their best but they have managed to win every single game and that's the mark of a good side. Nepal though, were so close to getting their first T20I win against a Test-playing nation and they will feel, they let it slip right at the death and this loss means, Bangladesh are all but through to the Super 8s alongside South Africa but Netherlands are still in with an outside chance in Group D.

OTTNEIL BAARTMAN TO GULSHAN JHA

OUT! RUN-OUT! SOUTH AFRICA HOLD THEIR NERVE! AGONY FOR NEPAL! They have fallen short by just one run. Ottneil Baartman bowls it short again, around off. Jha plays and misses again. The batters look to scamper for a bye as de Kock throws it at the bowler's end but the ball hits the back of Jhas. Heinrich Klaasen collects it quickly and knocks down the stumps. Gulshan Jha is short of his crease and Nepal fails to get over the line. Soo close and yet so far for Nepal.

!

What happened here? Drama right at the death, wow! That could probably be the most heartbreaking way for Nepal to lose the game. De Kock's throw ricocheted off the batter but Heinrich Klaasen was right there and he flicked the ball onto the stumps at the bowler's end. The replays show that Gulshan Jha was just short of his crease and OUT comes up on the big screen. Even if Klaasen had missed, South Africa might have appealed for obstruction of field as well given Jha ran straight down the middle of the pitch.

!

2 required off the final ball! Are we heading into a Super Over?
