Right then, that’s it from this game and the series. The trophy has been handed over to Mitchell Marsh who joins his team and poses for some pictures. Australia will now prepare for the New Zealand tour which is about to begin in a couple of weeks while the West Indies players will join the various franchise leagues. Until then, goodbye and cheers!

!

Mitchell Marsh the skipper of Australia is up for a chat. Marsh says that they were in a great position in the first innings but couldn't kill the game. Adds that Windies are a formidable side and they were on the wrong side of it in this game. Mentions that it is nice to win the series and see the young guys doing well. Ends by saying that Bartlett has had a great year and he will only get better from here.

!

Rovman Powell, the West Indies skipper is up for a chat. Powell says that it was great to come here and win as Australia is always strong at home. Adds that they had good plans but just could not execute in the first two games. Mentions that they had a chat about how good are the Aussies but they cannot let them score 240 in a T20I. Tells that it is good for the players to have confidence, Rutherford was struggling in the first two games, but he was much relaxed in this one and got the result. Further says that as a young captain, he has a lot to think about and they may need to look at the players who are doing well in the franchises. Ends by saying that he is off to Dubai and hopes that Dubai Capitals wins the Eliminator so that he can play in the next game.

!

David Warner is the Player of the series. He says that it started well for them in this series and it is good to see some guys get the break and freshen up before the New Zealand series and then the World Cup. Adds that it will be great to spend time with his family and especially with his daughters. Mentions that there will be bigger boundaries in the Caribbean and he has prepared for that. Ends by confirming that he will retire after the T20 World Cup and this was the last time he played a T20I in Australia.

!

Andre Russell is the Player of the Match. He says that they did not start the series like they wanted to and had to catch up but played good cricket in this game. Adds that it was a total team effort and he is just happy to contribute. Mentions that the early blow on his hands acted as a wake-up call for him and the wicket was good with good bounce on it. Tells that he was ready for the challenge and credits Rutherford as well for his performance and says he never had any doubts about him. Further adds that he is glad that they are peaking at the right time and consistently scoring 200 runs in this series is a good thing and they just need to work on their bowling which will make them a serious threat.

!

Time for the post-match presentation...

!

Roston Chase is up for a chat. He says that they had a team talk and did not want to leave Australia without a win. Adds that the boys gave their all and they got the victory which feels good. Tells that he thought it was a good score and they decided to bat first to put runs on the board and put pressure on the Aussies. Mentions that Warner is a wonderful player and it felt good to pick up his big wicket. Praises Russell for his knock and says that they call him Superman and that 19th over shifted the momentum towards them.

!

West Indies were much better with the ball today and they did the job when it mattered. The batters set up an excellent score for them and the bowlers backed it up very well. Romario Shepherd, Alzarri Joseph, and Roston Chase picked 4 wickets among them and did not go for plenty. Earlier today, the Windies made 220 on the back of runs from Sherfane Rutherford and Andre Russell while Roston Chase also played his part and had an excellent outing in both departments. West Indies came close in the first two games but will be pleased with this result and have finished the series on a winning note.

!

A commanding all-round effort by the West Indies sees them defeat the mighty Australians by 37 runs. Chasing a mammoth score of 221 for the win, Australia started well with David Warner (81 off 49), going all guns blazing and attacking the pacers from the word go. However, once the spinners came in, the scoring became difficult and the required rate went up. Hardie, Maxwell, and Inglis struggled to get going in the middle order. Tim David tried hard at the backend but fell short. Both teams have played some fine cricket throughout the series but it was the Men in Maroon who came out victorious today.
