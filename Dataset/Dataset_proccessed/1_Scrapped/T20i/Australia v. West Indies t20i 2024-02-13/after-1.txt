In short
: The West Indies have finished their tour of Australia on a high note with a 37 run victory in the final T20 internationalA strong first innings total of 220 put the Windies on top with Andre Russell top-scoring with 71 as a valiant Australian effort, led by David Warner, fell short
What's next?
The match marks Warner's final international on home soil

David Warner's brave knock was in vain as the West Indies powered their way to a 37-run victory over Australia in the third and final T20 clash at Perth Stadium.

Warner confirmed he will retire from international cricket after the T20 World Cup, but he ensured his final knock for Australia on home soil was a memorable one.

Before Tuesday's T20 match against the West Indies, Warner told his teammates it was his final international match in Australia.

Warner will take part in the upcoming T20 series in New Zealand and this year's T20 World Cup before bringing his glorious international career to a close.

The West Indies posted a monster 6-220 in Tuesday night's match following blistering knocks from Andre Russell (71 off 29 balls) and Sherfane Rutherford (67no off 40 balls).

In reply, Warner overcame a scary knock to the chin to post 81 off 49 balls to give Australia a chance of victory in front of 17,018 fans.

But the loss of 3-3, in which Aaron Hardie, Warner and Josh Inglis all departed in the space of 10 balls, signalled the end of Australia's hopes, with the home side finishing at 5-183.

The result denied Australia a clean sweep of the three-match series, with the hosts instead winning 2-1 ahead of the tour of New Zealand.

The West Indies crashed to 3-17 following an early onslaught from debutant paceman Xavier Bartlett (2-37).

Russell came to the crease with his team in big trouble at 5-79 in the ninth over.

He combined with Rutherford for a 139-run stand that changed the complexion of the match.

It was the largest sixth-wicket stand in a T20 international.

But it wasn't until the penultimate over — bowled by Adam Zampa — when Russell took the damage to the next level.

His three consecutive sixes to finish the over came after Tim David dropped a diving catch on the boundary.

If that catch had been taken, Zampa would have had figures of 2-43 with three more balls left in his spell.

Instead, he finished with 1-65 — the most expensive figures of his 77-match T20I career.

Russell, who copped a painful hit to his glove early in his innings, finished with seven sixes and four fours to his name.

Mitch Marsh's promotion to opener didn't last long, with the skipper holing out for 17.

Warner was on 21 when a rising Russell delivery crashed into the underside of his helmet grille.

The 37-year-old received on-field treatment to check for concussion or any signs of damage to his jaw, but he was given the green light to continue.

Warner cut the next ball for four, and reached his half-century in 25 balls with a big six down the ground.

But when Hardie (16 off 16) chopped Romario Shepherd onto his stumps, it triggered a collapse that Australia failed to recover from.

Warner holed out in the deep, and Inglis was sent packing when Roston Chase (2-19) pulled off a sharp catch off his own bowling.

Glenn Maxwell (12 off 14 balls) couldn't get going, but Tim David (41no off 19 balls) was at least able to provide the crowd with some late fireworks.
