As of today, February 13, 2024, the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 has not formally announced a league-wide brand ambassador. Traditionally, the IPL hasn't always appointed a single brand ambassador for the entire tournament. Instead, individual teams often have their own brand ambassadors.

However, some teams recently announced new brand ambassadors:

Chennai Super Kings (CSK): Katrina Kaif was announced as their brand ambassador in November 2023.
Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB): Currently doesn't have an official brand ambassador, but has had various brand partners and promotional campaigns

What are the stupidest money mistakes most people make?

Where do I start?

I’m a huge financial nerd, and have spent an embarrassing amount of time talking to people about their money habits.

Here are the biggest mistakes people are making and how to fix them:

Not having a separate high interest savings account

Having a separate account allows you to see the results of all your hard work and keep your money separate so you're less tempted to spend it.

Plus with rates above 5.00%, the interest you can earn compared to most banks really adds up.

Here is a list of the top savings accounts available today. Deposit $5 before moving on because this is one of th

What is the name of the IPL ambassador?

As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, the name of the Indian Premier League (IPL) ambassador for the 2021 season was Bollywood actor and youth icon, Ranveer Singh. However, it's important to note that the IPL may appoint a different ambassador for each season, so the ambassador for future seasons may be different.

Is there a secret to auto insurance that will save money?

I once met a man who drove a modest Toyota Corolla, wore beat-up sneakers, and looked like he’d lived the same way for decades. But what really caught my attention was when he casually mentioned he was retired at 45 with more money than he could ever spend. I couldn’t help but ask, “How did you do it?”

He smiled and said, “The secret to saving money is knowing where to look for the waste—and car insurance is one of the easiest places to start.”

He then walked me through a few strategies that I’d never thought of before. Here’s what I learned:

1. Make insurance companies fight for your business

How do I get a job as a brand ambassador?

There are three steps to getting hired as a brand ambassador.

Choose the market segment where you want to become a brand ambassador. Depending on how famous you are you might need to choose niche and specialty brands rather than major consumer brands. A famous guitarist will often be asked to endorse instruments, amplifiers, effects, strings and so on. A climber might get asked to represent climbing equipment. You don’t need to be broadly famous; you just need to be a recognized name in your specialty.
Build a strong platform in your chosen segment. This means that you don’t just need to be good
