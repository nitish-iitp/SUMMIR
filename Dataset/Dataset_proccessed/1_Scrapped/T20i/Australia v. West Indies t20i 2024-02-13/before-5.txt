ACC WOMEN’S PREMIER CUP 2024
Match 5: Kuwait vs Singapore | Squads | Players to watch | Fantasy Playing XI | Live Streaming | Pitch Report
February 9, 2024  Team Female Cricket

Kuwait and Singapore are slated to lock horns in the 2024 ACC Women’s T20 Premier Cup in match no. 5 at the Bayuemas Oval, Kuala Lumpur, on the 10th of February, 2024, at 11:00 AM Indian Standard Time (IST).

Match 5: Kuwait vs Singapore
Squads:

Kuwait – Amna Tariq (C), Maryyam Ashraf, Suchitha D’Sa (WK), Venora D’Souza, Siobhan Gomez, Mariamma Hyder, Maria Jasvi, Zeefa Jilani, Khadija Khalil (WK), Glenda Menezes, Priyada Murali, Maryam Omar, Balasubramani Shanti, Madeeha Zuberi

Singapore – Shafina Mahesh (C), Ada Bhasin, Riyaa Bhasin, Haresh Dhavina, Diviya G K, Devika Galia, Piumi Gurusinghe (WK), Vinu Kumar, Sara Merican, Jocelyn Pooranakaran, Johanna Pooranakaran, Damini Ramesh, Roshni Seth, Vathana Sreemurugavel

Players to watch out:
Priyada Murali

The 30-year-old all-rounder, from 35 outings, has accumulated 442 runs, including the highest of 35, and has also taken 19 wickets from 27 outings. Priyada in the series against Malaysia earlier this month managed starts with the bat, and it’ll be hoped she builds on these scores while carrying forward her rewarding bowling form.

Amna Tariq

The 34-year-old all-rounder has added 301 runs and scalped 24 wickets from 36 T20I appearances and produced bests of 32* and 4/9. In the Malaysia series, Amna registered successive scores of 32* and 19, while also sending down economical spells, though picking just a wicket. It’ll be expected of her to make the most of this form, delivering the goods.

Diviya G K

The 37-year-old all-rounder, from 33 T20Is, has managed 445 runs, including the highest of 77*, and bagged 26 wickets, including the best being 3/8. Diviya struggled for runs in the recent series against the Philippines; however, she compensated with the ball, registering figures of 1/0, 1/13, and 0/14. She’ll be backed to find her batting mojo.

Ada Bhasin

The 17-year-old all-rounder, from 20 T20I outings, has scalped 24 wickets, with the best being 5/6, while also chipping in with the bat, scoring 159 runs. Ada, in the Philippines series, registered her best of 50*, while with the ball, an inning apart, returned figures of 3/10 and 5/7. The team will count on her to capitalize on her recent success.

Pitch:

The wicket at Bayuemas Oval heavily favors the spinners, creating ideal conditions for bowling, evident from the average score in the 80s. Batters, when they settle in and find their rhythm, can accumulate runs effectively.

Weather:

The conditions in Kuala Lumpur are expected to be pleasant for the game, with clear, bright skies and a minimal chance of rain during match hours. The temperature is forecasted to be around 33°C, with light winds and humidity at 63%.

Fantasy playing XI:

Piumi Gurusinghe, Balasubramani Shanti, Riyaa Bhasin, Shafina Mahesh, Ada Bhasin, Johanna Pooranakaran, Priyada Murali, Diviya G K, Maria Jasvi, Roshni Seth, Amna Tariq
