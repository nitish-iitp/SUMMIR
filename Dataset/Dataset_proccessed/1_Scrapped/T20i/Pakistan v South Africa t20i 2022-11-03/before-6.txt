Analysis:

The South Africans have emerged as one of the favourites to win it all in Australia after two resounding wins in Group 2. South Africa has a well-rounded squad with stars in all departments. Their batting has many explosive batters like David Miller, Rilee Rossouw and Quinton de Kock. Similarly, they have a top-drawer pace attack with the likes of Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, and Anrich Nortje. 




Pakistan, after defeating the Dutch, registered their first win of the Super 12 stage as they are almost out of contention for the knockout stage. The batting hasn’t fired altogether as Mohammed Rizwan remains their most consistent batter. Whereas, their bowling remains to be one of the best in the world with Mohammad Wasim Jr, Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf and Naseem Shah firing on all cylinders.
