Pakistan vs South Africa, T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights: PAK beat SA by 33 runs, stay in race for semi-finals

Pakistan vs South Africa, T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights: South Africa fell 33 runs short of the revised target and Pakistan recorded a huge win in the context of the race for the semi-finals. 
Pakistan vs South Africa, T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights: Shadab starred with both bat and ball

Pakistan vs South Africa, T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights: Shadab Khan first turned the game around in Pakistan's favour with the bat and then he did the same with the ball as his side recorded a crucial win against South Africa in Sydney on Thursday. Shadab's 22-ball 52 is what pushed Pakistan to a score of 185/9 after a disastrous powerplay. He then took two wickets in the eighth over just before rain interrupted play. That led to South Africa needing to chase down a revised target of 142 in 14 overs. The Proteas fell short in the end and Pakistan have kept themselves in the chase for a semi-final spot.

Pakistan vs South Africa Live: SIX! Nawaz switching gears

Lovely sweep shot, sends it over the square leg area and into the crowd. First six of the match for Nawaz.

PAK vs SA T20 World Cup Live: FOUR! Markram misjudges the catch!

Is this a domino effect? Nawaz not able to nail that lofted cover drive, Markram leaves his post to come running in but the ball goes over his head for four. Fourth boundary for Nawaz.

PAK vs SA Live score: FOUR! Pakistan 82/4 in 12 overs

Back to back fours to end the 12th. 11 runs have come in it and considering it is the extremely dangerous Ngidi bowling, that is a very good result indeed.

T20 World Cup live: MISFIELD AND FOUR!

Stop the press! South Africa have made a mistake in the field! Nawaz guides the short ball outside off from Ngidi towards third man where Shamsi makes a schoolboy error in picking the ball. It rolls away to the boundary. 

Nov 3, 2022 2:21 PM IST
Pakistan vs South Africa Live: 10 overs gone, Pakistan 68/4

Pakistan on shaky ground here. Nawaz and Iftikhar have put up 25 runs for the fifth wicket off 24 balls. Danny Morrison had said in commentary that there was a speckle of rain as the light faded away but no problems caused by it at all. 

Nov 3, 2022 2:19 PM IST
PAK vs SA T20 World Cup Live: FOUR!

Iftikhar drives Rabada on the up to send the third ball of the 10th over to the boundary. The first ball of the over had also gone for four after which the batter ran two. Rabada has been quite expensive today, 33 runs off him in 2.3 overs already. 

Nov 3, 2022 2:15 PM IST
PAK vs SA Live score: Pakistan 50/4 in 8 overs

Shamsi will be back into the attack. Mohammad Nawaz and Iftikhar Ahmed in the middle. Both are players who can score runs quickly but here, Pakistan will need them to stay till the end. 

Nov 3, 2022 2:06 PM IST
T20 World Cup live: GONE! 

Pakistan are crumbling here. Slow one from Nortje after he bows two thunderbolts first up, a prod from Shan Masood and he spoons it to Bavuma at mid-off. Pakistan in dire trouble now. 

Masood c Bavuma b Nortje 2 (6), Pakistan 43/4 in 6.3 overs

Pakistan vs South Africa Live: End of powerplay, Pakistan 42/3

42 in the powerplay is not exactly a bad score but it is not great either. Add to that the fact that they have lost their top three and that means South Africa may have edged it in this powerplay. It's now Iftikhar Ahmed and Shan Masood in the middle.

Nov 3, 2022 1:58 PM IST
PAK vs SA T20 World Cup Live: OUT! Babar falls, what a catch from Rabada!

Rabada, you beauty. Babar goes aerial, the shot has the height but not the distance. Rabada runs towards the boundary from midwicket, stretches out his hands and catches the ball while moving. 

Babar Azam c Rabada b Ngidi 6 (15), Pakistan 40/3 in 5.2 overs
