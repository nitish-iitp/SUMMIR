Zimbabwe host Ireland for limited-overs series - watch live in India
Zimbabwe host Ireland for limited-overs series - watch live in India
The ODI series won’t be a part of the Cricket World Cup Super League.

January 10, 2023

The Zimbabwe cricket team is all set to host the Ireland cricket team in two limited-overs bilateral series beginning from January 12, 2023.

The series comprises three T20Is followed by just as many ODIs, with all the matches scheduled to be played at the Harare Sports Club. 

The ODI series won’t be a part of the Cricket World Cup Super League. This will be the two teams’ first assignment after the T20 World Cup 2022.

The two nations were slotted in the same group in the qualifying round. Both sides managed to make it through Round 1 after winning two and losing one match. 

Moreover, Ireland recorded a famous nine-wicket victory over West Indies to progress to the Super 12s, eliminating the two-time champions in the process.

However, the two teams couldn’t progress beyond the Super 12s, despite Zimbabwe and Ireland managing to register memorable wins over eventual finalists Pakistan and England respectively.

Meanwhile, Zimbabwe toured Australia for a three-match ODI series before the World Cup. Although they lost the series, the Chevrons clinched a stunning five-wicket win in the final ODI to record their first-ever victory against the Aussies on Australian soil in any format

On the other hand, Ireland played a five-match T20I series against Afghanistan at home prior to the T20 World Cup in August 2022, which they won by 3-2.
