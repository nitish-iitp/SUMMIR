Bangladesh will kick start their Asia Cup 2022 campaign when they meet a high-flying Afghanistan side in Match 3 of Group B in the competition at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium in Sharjah on Tuesday, August 30, 2022. The Bangla Tigers have a new T20 captain in the form of veteran Shakib Al Hasan, who is all set to play his milestone 100th T20 international match in their tournament opener. Bangladesh are one of the three sides in this group with the other being Sri Lanka, who suffered a hammering from the hands of Afghanistan in the opening fixture.

Speaking more about the performance of Mohammed Nabi-led Afghanistan against the Lankan Lions in the first match of the tournament, Fazalhaq Farooqi and the other bowlers blew the opposition away as they dismissed them for just 105 in 19.4 overs. Farooqi delivered his career-best spell of 3/11 in 3.4 overs while skipper Nabi and Mujeeb Ur Rahman took two wickets apiece. It turned out to be the fourth-lowest team total in Asia Cup (T20 format).

The chase seemed a mere formality for the Afghan openers as both Hazratullah Zazai and Rahmanullah Gurbaz looked in a hurry. The former remained unbeaten on 37 while Gurbaz played brilliant innings of 40 off just 18 with three fours and four maximums. They reached the target in just 10.1 overs to seal a comfortable victory in the opening match.

The Bangla Tigers will be wary of the threat Afghanistan possess which Sri Lanka already witnessed and Shakib and his men would look to start their campaign on a winning note. On the other hand, Afghanistan will search for a victory that will surely send them to the next round of competition.

Meanwhile, here are some of the important stats and numbers ahead of Match 3 between Bangladesh and Afghanistan in the Asia Cup 2022:

Head-to-Head: Bangladesh and Afghanistan have met each other in eight T20 internationals so far with Bangladesh emerging victorious on just three occasions and Afghanistan on five. At a neutral venue, both teams have clashed in three matches with Afghanistan winning all three of them.
