Chennai: Once a state with high filariasis prevalence, Tamil Nadu is now preparing dossiers to claim elimination status for the disease, the directorate of public health has declared.
Three rounds of transmission assessment surveys conducted in 2014, 2016, and 2018 showed the microfilaria rate was 0.18%, 0.21%, and 0.10%, senior public health officers wrote in the state medical journal.
“We are now preparing the dossiers, which will be submitted for verification before TN is certified a lymphatic filariasis-free state,” said director of public health, Dr T S Selva Vinayagam, who is the first author of the study.


Lymphatic filariasis, also known as elephantiasis, is a debilitating disease caused by parasitic worms transmitted through adult female culex mosquito bites. Tamil Nadu was one of the nine states which contributed to 95% of the total burden of filariasis in India. In 1996, Tamil Nadu launched the mass drug administration at Cuddalore. Diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) is administered at a dosage of 6 mg/kg of body weight. Based on results, the program has been extended to the other 25 endemic districts. In 2001, 400 mg of albendazole was added to the regimen. The state saw a consistent decline in the microfilaria rate from 0.11 in 2014, said Dr Barani Kumar, one of the co-authors.

In 2022, more than 2.8 lakh night blood samples were collected in 45 HUDs for a one-time confirmatory mapping, and three samples – one each from Chengalpet, Cheyyar, and Erode – tested positive for microfilaria. After a test using a night blood smear test, positive cases were treated with a single dose of diethylcarbamazine citrate and albendazole. In 2023, around 44,208 migrants were tested with night blood smear, and 152 (0.3%) tested positive.

The state organized disability prevention camps and performed hydrocele surgeries. The state issued protocols for the management of patients with swelling on the legs (lymphoedema) in addition to giving them financial assistance of ₹1,000.
The authors admit migration from other endemic regions will continue to remain a challenge. Another challenge will be to prevent complications among existing patients.
