PAK vs NZ Scorecard
Pakistan vs New Zealand Commentary
5:57 PM IST That's all! The scores are levelled! We go into the fourth game with nothing to separate. Join us on 25th of this month at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT) and earlier for the build up. Cheers!
5:55 PM IST Michael Bracewell says he is happy with how they learned from the last game. Tells the two debutants were brilliant with the ball. Reckons Ish Sodhi bowled really well but his over went for a few. They were though happy to chase around 180 though. Mentions the openers played well, appreciates the knock from Chapman and hopes it continues.
5:53 PM IST Mark Chapman is the Player of the Match. He says it’s nice to level the series. Adds he likes coming here. Credits the bowlers for the way they bowled. Mentions they lost wickets in heaps. Ends by saying he knows Pakistan have a great bowling attack but he’s happy they came out on top.
5:53 PM IST Babar Azam says they were 10 runs short, Mohammad Rizwan's injury was a set back but still had a par score to defend it down. Tells Shadab that could come up depending on the situation, he played his game well today. Reckons they bowled well in the start but dropped a couple of catches of set batters and the Kiwis made most of the opportunity.
5:47 PM IST ...Presentation next...
5:40 PM IST Pakistan bowlers just weren’t at their best in this game. Also, with the dew coming later on, it did not help their cause. They failed to produce wicket taking deliveries and in the end, the visitors managed to level the series. A lot to learn for the Pakistani bowlers from this game.
