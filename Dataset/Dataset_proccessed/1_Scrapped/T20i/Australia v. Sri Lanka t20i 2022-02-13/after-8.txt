Steve Smith has been ruled out for the remainder of the T20 series against Sri Lanka after suffering a concussion in a frightening fielding incident.

Smith was fielding on the boundary in a manic final over of Sri Lanka's chase which saw the tourists score 18 runs off Marcus Stoinis' bowling to force a super over.

The 32-year-old was stationed at cow corner on the third-last ball of the innings when Sri Lankan spinner Maheesh Theekshana slogged a Stoinis ball towards the boundary.

In an incredible display of athleticism, Smith dived full-length, managing to catch the ball in his right hand and throwing it back into the field of play while airborne before crashing to the turf, with his head directly hitting the ground upon impact.

Smith was helped off the SCG by the trainers after hitting his head on the turf following an incredible fielding effort Getty

Unfortunately for Smith, Sri Lanka was awarded six runs as replays showed the Aussie star had stepped on the boundary line before jumping and making his safe.

The former captain laid motionless on the turf after his crash landing and was immediately attended to by a number of players and team doctors from both Australia and Sri Lanka.

While Smith was able to walk off the field, Cricket Australia confirmed after the match that he'd suffered a concussion.

"(Smith) will be subject to low level protocols for the next few days and full recovery in 6-7 days," the CA statement read.

"He will miss the remainder of the series. No replacement in the squad is planned at this stage."

The third match of the series will take place in Canberra on Tuesday night before a double-header in Melbourne on Friday and next Sunday.
