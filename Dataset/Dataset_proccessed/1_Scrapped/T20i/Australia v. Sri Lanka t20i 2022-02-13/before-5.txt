The IPL 2022 auction is set to take place on February 12 and 13, 2022, with 590 cricketers going under the hammer: here are the most expensive IPL buys from each of the previous auctions from 2008 to 2021.

IPL 2022 auction: Here’s the full list of players registered for the auction this year.

The currency mentioned reflects that used at the auction, and indicates the actual amount from that year.

Here’s the list of most expensive IPL players so far in the auction:

IPL 2008 – MS Dhoni (CSK)
USD 1.5 million

Chennai Super Kings went all out to acquire India’s rising star, MS Dhoni, ahead of the inaugural edition. Among other teams, Mumbai Indians had their eyes on him, but couldn’t afford him since they already had Sachin Tendulkar, a marquee player [who would have cost 10 per cent more than their biggest buy]. Dhoni’s gone on to become central to Chennai’s success, leading them to the title four times.

Next costliest player: Andrew Symonds (Deccan Chargers) – USD 1.35 million

IPL 2009 – Andrew Flintoff (CSK), Kevin Pietersen (RCB)
USD 1.55 million

The England duo of Flintoff and Pietersen became the costliest IPL players ever when they were acquired for USD 1.5 million by Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bangalore respectively. Flintoff’s stint was a forgettable one, ending with a knee injury after just three games.

Next costliest player: JP Duminy (Mumbai Indians) – USD 955,000

IPL 2010 – Shane Bond (KKR), Kieron Pollard (MI)
USD 750,000

A total of 11 players were sold ahead of IPL 3, with Shane Bond and Kieron Pollard being tied at maximum bid prices. A tie-breaker rule followed, with teams making secret bids, but their prices were eventually capped at USD 750,000.

Next costliest player: Kemar Roach (DC) – USD 720,000

IPL 2011 – Gautam Gambhir (KKR)
USD 2.4 million

Gambhir, who became a World Cup winner just months later, was the costliest pick of the year, moving to Kolkata Knight Riders from Delhi Daredevils. Gambhir went on to lead KKR to two title wins – 2012 and 2014 – before returning to Delhi for one season in 2018.

Next costliest player(s): Yusuf Pathan (KKR), Robin Uthappa (PWI) – USD 2.1 million

IPL 2012 – Ravindra Jadeja (CSK)
USD 2 million

Banned for a year ahead of IPL 2010 for attempting to negotiate his contract against rules, Ravindra Jadeja became the costliest buy of 2012 after being snapped up by the Super Kings. It’s a team that the all-rounder continues to serve – ahead of the 2022 auction, he was retained for the maximum possible sum of INR 16 crore.

Next costliest player: Mahela Jayawardene (Delhi Daredevils) – USD 1.4 million

IPL 2013 – Glenn Maxwell (MI)
USD 1 million

Maxwell, still uncapped for Australia, broke the bank in the 2013 IPL auction by becoming the only million-dollar buy that year. It wasn’t a fruitful relationship though, and next year, he changed teams.

Next costliest player: Ajantha Mendis (Pune Warriors India) – USD 750,000

IPL 2014 – Yuvraj Singh (RCB)
INR 14 crore

Yuvraj Singh became the costliest player ever to be bought in the auction when Royal Challengers Bangalore acquired his services for the 2014 season.

Next costliest player: Dinesh Karthik (INR 12.5 crore) to Delhi Daredevils

IPL 2015 – Yuvraj Singh (DD)
INR 16 crore

A year on, Yuvraj broke his own record, getting a whopping INR 16 crore deal from Delhi. Once again, it was only a season-long association, with Sunrisers Hyderabad buying him the following year.

Next costliest player: Dinesh Karthik (Royal Challengers Bangalore) – INR 10.5 crore

IPL 2016 – Shane Watson (RCB)
INR 9.5 crore

A draft was done ahead of the auction to incorporate players from suspended franchises CSK and RR, with a formal auction following it for the rest of the players. Shane Watson, who retired from international cricket that year, became the most expensive buy.

Next costliest player: Pawan Negi (Delhi Daredevils) – INR 8.5 crore

IPL 2017 – Ben Stokes (RPSG)
INR 14.5 crore

Ben Stokes entered the IPL auction for the first time and created a splash, becoming the most expensive overseas player following a bumper deal by Rising Pune Supergiant. Tymal Mills, his England teammate, wasn’t far behind.

Next costliest player: Tymal Mills (Royal Challengers Bangalore) – INR 12 crore

IPL 2018 – Ben Stokes (RR)
INR 12.5 crore

Once again, Ben Stokes proved to be the top buy, moving teams to play for Rajasthan Royals, a team he continued to be associated with until 2021.

Next costliest player: Jaydev Unadkat (RPS) – INR 11.5 crore

IPL 2019 – Jaydev Unadkat (RR), Varun Chakravarthy (KXIP)
INR 8.4 crore

Unadkat was a sought-after entity once again in 2019, returning to Rajasthan Royals as that year’s biggest auction buy. Chakravarthy, uncapped, became Punjab’s most expensive purchase that season.

Next costliest player: Sam Curran (KXIP) – INR 7.2 crore

IPL 2020 – Pat Cummins (KKR)
INR 15.5 crore

Pat Cummins’ rising stocks as a world-class quick served him a bumper deal in the 2020 auction when he became the most expensive overseas signing ever. It was a two-way bid between Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore before KKR made a late entry to snap him up.

Next costliest player: Glenn Maxwell (KXIP) – INR 10.75 crore

IPL 2021 – Chris Morris (RR)
INR 16.25 crore

A surprise to some, Morris became the most expensive buy last year, going to Rajasthan Royals for a massive sum of INR 16.25 crore, which beat the auction record for the highest sum paid for an overseas player. Morris retired from all cricket this year.

Next costliest player: Kyle Jamieson (RCB) – INR 15 crore
