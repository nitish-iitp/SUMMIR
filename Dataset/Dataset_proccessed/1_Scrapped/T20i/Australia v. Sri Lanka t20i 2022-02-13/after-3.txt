Talk about SQUAD goals!

Now, as Australia braces itself to host the biggest global event Down Under – the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in 2022 – fans can experience these emotions in the lead up to the event by joining their very own SQUAD.

Launched today on Monday 14 February, SQUADS is a growing online community for people to gather and connect right across Australia.

Whether you join SQUAD Australia, SQUAD India, SQUAD England or SQUAD Bangladesh (just to name a few!), it’s a safe space for people to share stories, promote what’s happening in their community and of course, share a funny meme or two.

Hosted on Facebook and connected to the ICC’s global channels, SQUADS encourages members to post their own content, stories, photos, updates and start conversations about what they love not just about cricket, but their culture and community too.

While getting behind your team in the lead up to the World Cup might be the reason you join, the SQUADS are bigger then encompassing food, art, music, dance, entertainment and much more.

The ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2022 Local Organising Committee CEO, Michelle Enright, was one of the first to sign up to SQUAD Australia and said this initiative aims to connect people all over the country.

“We can’t wait to host the World Cup later in the year and SQUADS gives people a place to connect, share in the excitement and keep up to date with what’s happening in their community in the build up to the event,” Enright said.

“We want to create a safe online space for people to come together and chat not only about their passion for cricket, but their culture, traditions and family too.

“The T20 World Cup is going to be the biggest global event Australia hosts in 2022 and no matter where you live or how you support your team, SQUADS gives you a place to get involved and feel a sense of belonging.”

It’s not only the fans who are getting in on the action, SQUAD Australia has already received a video message from reigning T20 Australian Captain, Aaron Finch, who welcomed new members into the SQUAD.

Live from today, now is your chance to get involved and join your SQUAD. To get in on all the action join your SQUAD here sign up. We can’t wait for you to join us and discover your community!
