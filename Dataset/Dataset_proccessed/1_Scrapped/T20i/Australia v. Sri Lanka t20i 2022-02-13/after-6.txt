AUS vs SL, 2nd T20I highlights: Australia clinched a thrilling victory in the super over after being tied with Sri Lanka at the end of the stipulated 20 overs each for both sides in the second T20I of the five match series at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG)  on Sunday. After Australia posted 164/6, Sri Lanka scored 164/8 in their chase. In the super over, Sri Lanka could only manage 5/1, which the hosts chased down in three deliveries. Earlier, Josh Hazlewood struck twice inside in the first powerplay, before Pat Cummins struck in the fifth over. For Australia, Josh Inglis top-scored with a fine 48 as Australia posted a total of 164 for six. Australia had earlier lost both their openers Aaron Finch (18) and Ben McDermott (25) for cheap. Glenn Maxwell also failed to impress as he was dismissed on 15. Earlier, Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bowl at the SCG. Australia now lead the series 2-0. (SCORECARD)

We are back for the chase! The players stride out to the middle. Pathum Nissanka and Danushka Gunathilaka are the openers for Sri Lanka. Josh Hazlewood to start with the ball. Here we go...

!

... THE CHASE ...

!

Now then! The pitch is looking a good one to bat on but Sri Lanka need their batters to step up this time around. They were clinical with the ball in the first T20I as well but were let down by their batters. Australian bowlers would be confident of defending this total with Adam Zampa, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Kane Richardson in their line up. Do join us to see how the chase unfolds.

!

Excellent death bowling by the visitors! Sri Lankan bowlers leaked runs upfront but just when Australia looked more dangerous, Nuwan Thushara got rid of Ben and scalped his maiden wicket in international cricket. After that, Wanindu Hasaranga also got a wicket and shifted the momentum towards them. The bowlers got timely wickets and tightened the screws on Australia. They were super at the death overs as well and would be the happier team heading into the break.

!

Australia again failed to deliver with the bat. Ben McDermott and Aaron Finch started off well and scored runs at a brisk pace but the former departed inside the Powerplay. Finch who was looking solid too departed later. Glenn Maxwell could not do much damage while Josh Inglis looked set for a good knock but fell in the 14th over. The partnership between Marcus Stoinis and Steven Smith also never got going but they have still managed to go past 160 this time.

!

Sri Lanka have replicated their bowling performance from the first match. Some excellent death bowling from the visitors and they have restricted the Aussies for a par total. No Australian batter could fire at the end. Matthew Wade did hit a couple of boundaries and helped his side go past 160. With a quality bowling attack, Australia would fancy their chances here.

19.6
1
NUWAN THUSHARA TO MATTHEW WADE

Well bowled! A yorker, on off. Wade can only jam it out towards mid off for a single. 16 off the last over and Australia finish with 164/6!

19.5
6
NUWAN THUSHARA TO MATTHEW WADE

SIX! First maximum of the night and it couldn't have come at a better time. Around off, Matthew Wade stays deep in his crease and launches it high and handsome over the long on fence for a biggie.

19.4

NUWAN THUSHARA TO MATTHEW WADE

Full and wide, this is squeezed through covers for a couple. Good running.

19.3

NUWAN THUSHARA TO MATTHEW WADE

FOUR! Just short but maybe Wanindu Hasaranga should have looked to save the boundary at this stage. Fullish, going across off and Wade heaves it aerially towards the square leg fence. Hasaranga runs to his left and dives in to take the catch but the ball eludes him and bounces over the ropes.

19.2

NUWAN THUSHARA TO PAT CUMMINS

How did Cummins get it over there? Another slower one, on the pads. Pat Cummins is set up to swing across but has to check his shot in the end. The ball pops up off the splice of the bat and goes over the keeper's head. The batters run three before the ball is cut off.

19.1

NUWAN THUSHARA TO PAT CUMMINS

A slower yorker, very close to off stump. Pat Cummins clears the front leg and looks to swipe across the line but is completely undone by the lack of pace.

18.6
1
DUSHMANTHA CHAMEERA TO PAT CUMMINS

Length this time, around off. Cummins mistimes the loft over extra cover and picks up a single. What a penultimate over from Chameera, just 3 runs and a couple of wickets off it.

18.5
2
DUSHMANTHA CHAMEERA TO PAT CUMMINS

No hat-trick! Full and wide, this is slashed away behind point for a couple.

!

Pat Cummins walks out to bat.

18.4

DUSHMANTHA CHAMEERA TO MARCUS STOINIS

OUT! CAUGHT! Two in two for Dushmantha Chameera and he's on a hat-trick! Very smart bowling from Chameera. Short of a good length, dragged wider. Marcus Stoinis tries to fetch it and pull it across but only manges to get a top edge on it. The ball loops up and goes straight into the hands of Maheesh Theekshana at short third man. He makes no mistake and both set batters are now dismissed.

!

The new batter in is Matthew Wade.

18.3
W
DUSHMANTHA CHAMEERA TO STEVEN SMITH

OUT! TAKEN! This has been a brilliant fightback by Sri Lanka in the last couple of overs and they are rewarded with a wicket as well. A slower length ball, well outside off. Steven Smith stays leg side and reaches out. He throws everything at it but only manges to lift it towards the extra cover fence. Danushka Gunathilaka settles under it and takes a simple catch. Smith's hot and cold inning comes to an end.

18.2
0
DUSHMANTHA CHAMEERA TO STEVEN SMITH

Brilliant! The Lankan pacers are keeping slower and dragging it wider. This is fairly wide of off and Steven Smith just can't quite reach it to turn it on the leg side. A dot ball.

18.1
1
DUSHMANTHA CHAMEERA TO MARCUS STOINIS

Slower delivery, dragged outside off. Stoinis fetches and heaves it onto the leg side for a single.
