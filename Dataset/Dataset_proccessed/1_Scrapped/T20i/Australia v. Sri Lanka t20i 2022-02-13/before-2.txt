Potential team XIs and how each team did
The IPL trophy on display at IPL 2022 auction day in Bengaluru•BCCI

Let's have a quick gander at possible team XIs, and what each team did well, and where the gaps are.

Chennai Super Kings: Ruturaj Gaikwad, Devon Conway, Moeen Ali, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja, Shivam Dube, Deepak Chahar, Bravo/Santner/Jordan, Adam Milne, Asif/Deshpande.

They've managed to keep a large part of their core together, and also given themselves options to bat deep with a lot of bowling options - courtesy all-round talent. As always, a team not to be taken lightly.

Delhi Capitals: David Warner, Prithvi Shaw, Mitchell Marsh, Rishabh Pant, Mandeep/Sarfaraz/Bharat, Rowman Powell, Axar Patel, Shardul Thakur, Lalit Yadav, Anrich Nortje, Chetan Sakariya.

They've got superb firepower through their top order, right down to Rovman Powell at six. They can pick a bowling attack of five bowlers where three can bat. If Mitchell Marsh also bowls, it's almost a bonus. They look good.

Gujarat Titans: Jason Roy, Wriddhiman Saha, Shubman Gill, Vijay Shankar, Abhinav Manohar, Hardik Pandya, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Jayant/Sai Kishore, Lockie Ferguson, Mohammed Shami.

They've got some gun players in the XI, but they'll probably need outstanding seasons from both Hardik and Rashid, who have to lead the way in this team.

Kolkata Knight Riders: Venkatesh Iyer, Ajinkya Rahane, Shreyas Iyer, Nitish Rana, Sam Billings, Andre Russell, Pat Cummins, Sunil Narine, Shivam Mavi, Umesh Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy.

The batting looks a bit thin at the top, as it did last year. Unless one of the uncapped buys KKR picked up towards the end of the auction pay off for them, they'll probably need their top order to show more urgency. The bowling could still win them games.

Lucknow Super Giants: KL Rahul, Quinton de Kock, Manish Pandey, Deepak Hooda, Marcus Stoinis, Krunal Pandya, Jason Holder, K Gowtham, Ravi Bishnoi, Mark Wood, Avesh Khan.

A potent first XI, and they still have back-ups in Dushmantha Chameera, Shahbaz Nadeem and Evin Lewis. The batting has variety and depth, the bowling likewise. A superb performance in their first ever auction.

Mumbai Indians: Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Tim David, Kieron Pollard, Fabian Allen/Daniel Sams, Sanjay Yadav, M Ashwin/Mayank Markande, Tymal Mills, Jasprit Bumrah.

Despite lacking Jofra Archer's services for 2022, Mumbai brought out the big hits at the end and have once again built a squad that can challenge for the title. It's not as awe-inspiring as the 2018-2021 version was, but that could change in IPL 2023, when Archer is back.

Punjab Kings: Shikhar Dhawan, Mayank Agarwal, Jonny Bairstow, Liam Livingstone, Prabhsimran/Bawa/Jitesh, Shahrukh Khan, Odean Smith, Harpreet Brar, Kagiso Rabada, Rahul Chahar, Arshdeep Singh.

They had the biggest purse coming in, and have they made it count. Punjab have a potential XI that's power-packed right through the order. In addition, their bowling has variety and depth. Not since 2014, have Punjab entered an IPL season with a squad so full of exciting possibilties.

Rajasthan Royals: Jos Buttler, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Devdutt Padikkal, Sanju Samson, Shimron Hetmyer, Riyan Parag, Neesham/Coulter-Nile, R Ashwin, Trent Boult, Yuzvendra Chahal, Prasidh Krishna

Rajasthan had a superb Day 1 at the auction, which meant most of their pieces were in place. They can put out a good XI on the field, with the batting particularly looking good. The bowling has some outstanding names too, with the only possible grey area being the death bowling.

Royal Challengers Bangalore: Faf du Plessis, Virat Kohli, Anuj Rawat, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik, Lomror/Sisodia, Wanindu Hasaranga, Harshal Patel, Shahbaz Ahmed, Josh Hazlewood, Mohammed Siraj

The Royal Challengers will be happy with their squad. They can put out an XI that has plenty of quality bowling options, and have a batting line-up that runs deep-ish too. They also have the likes of Finn Allen and Sherfane Rutherford as back-ups, as well as David Willey.

Sunrisers Hyderabad: Abhishek Sharma, Rahul Tripathi, Kane Williamson, Aiden Markram, Nicholas Pooran, Abdul Samad, Washington Sundar, Romario Shepherd/Marco Jansen, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan, Kartik Tyagi/Umran Malik.

They overloaded on bowling options, staying true to type, but a middle order of Williamson, Markram and Pooran is pretty good, all things considered.

And each team will feel that they have done well in their own ways... However, there's going to be only one winner at the end of the day. And less than half the teams will have 'successful' seasons - if success is measured by making the play-offs.

We'll bring you all the snap analysis of each franchise in a moment.

Chennai Super Kings' auction explained
IPL 2022 auction•BCCI

The Chennai Super Kings CEO Kasi Viswanathan spoke about the defending champions' auction to host broadcaster Star Sports.

Retaining the core: At the end of yesterday, nine of ten were ex-CSK players. We had planned as always. Credit to the skipper and coach, who work on the balance of the team.

On missing out on Faf and Shardul: He has been the most consistent player for us over the years and has done well with the bat. Knowing about his performances and the kind of player he is, we thought we must go after him. Disappointed to miss out on Faf. Both of those were crucial players of our team and Faf was with us over a decade. But we were disappointed to not have enough money for them. We thought the best replacement for Faf can be Conway, as he is doing well in all formats. Fleming knows about his credentials. Milne was in the IPL earlier and we needed a quick bowler replacing Hazlewood.

On Shivam Dube: He is an Indian all-rounder who is available. As far as the XI goes, it is up to the captain and the coach and I have no say.

On the team combination: I will never say we are a champion side every year. We will set the process right. We have a balanced team, as far as we are consistent, the result will come.

Andy Flower speaks
Lucknow Super Giants' pre-auction picks on display•BCCI

Andy Flower has been one of the smartest T20 coaches going around, finding success across leagues and franchises. With him at the helm, Lucknow Super Giants did pretty well for themselves. Speaking to host broadcaster Star Sports, Flower outlined his franchise's strategy:

On splitting roles with Gambhir during the auction: Gautam’s got a great cricket brain. I have enjoyed spending time with him. Looking forward to working closely with him. I respect his thinking about the game. He has a vast experience with IPL auction.

Multi-faceted players’ focus: There are a number of all-rounders. We have a potential of having K Gowtham at 8 or Holder at 7, which will stand us in good stead. Avesh Khan is a superb operator, looking forward to Mark Wood haring in. We have a lot of attacking options and that is the sort of cricket we want to play.

Getting Quinton de Kock at the price they did: We budgeted for a little more for Quinton, so we think we got a good deal. He keeps well, and a left-hander, which is a nice balance to have with KL Rahul.

On the pace attack: Mark Wood is one of the quicker bowlers in the world, seen recently in the Ashes where he clocked 150kmps. With him getting rest between IPL games, exciting to see him bowl. Having seen Avesh Khan over the last few years, looks very exciting. I think they should be a potent combination.

Only six teams in the running

Both CSK and PK have exhausted their upper limit of players, and have 25 players each.

Lucknow Super Giants, on the other hand, have exhausted their budget, so they're out too. SRH have also practically exhausted their budget because they have only 10 lakh left, and the minimum base price is 20 lakh.

So it will be only Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bangalore.

Each team can submit only 2 names, so we're going to have a maximum of only 12 names coming under the hammer.

"Harshal Patel was one [of our targets]. Ishan Kishan the other… But once it went beyond our reach… The way the set allocation is and the randomness within that means that it is a lot challenging.

"He [Archer] was in our thoughts. But when we saw the purse remaining with MI we knew that we couldn’t get him, even without looking at our purse."

"I’m up in York at the moment seeing some friends for a few days and we were in the town centre," he tells ESPNcricinfo. "We'd just had breakfast and got the stream up. I stopped outside a Greggs when I and watched it on my phone. A different setting to most people, for sure..."

Gujarat and Rajasthan still need players
The Rajasthan Royals table at the IPL 2022 auction•BCCI

The Titans have 17 players, so need one more at the minimum. And that one has to be a keeper, you'd think. They still don't have one. Of course, they can buy more than one, but they need to prioritise a keeper.

The Royals have only 14, so need four more. They have a good squad, so need to make some intelligent back-ups.

The other franchises have got to the 18-player size, but that doesn't meant they won't be looking to pick up good players still.

Alzarri Joseph is one of West Indies' brightest fast bowling prospects•AFP/Getty Images

Base price 75 lakh. He'll surely get bids. Mumbai and Delhi jump right into it. Remember, Alzarri took 6 for 12 - the best ever IPL figures, when playing for Mumbai a couple of seasons back.

In the India-West Indies ODI series just gone by, he also took the wickets of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli in one over - twice.

Not surprising he's in demand, as Gujarat Titans jump into the fray. They're up against Punjab, with MI and CSK having bailed early.

Gujarat and Punjab have taken Alzarri into the 2 crore territory.

Gujarat are sitting pretty on an 11 crore plus purse, so they can get him if they really want to. And they do.

Akash Ambani on Mumbai's auction
Mahela Jayawardene and Akash Ambani have a chat during the second day of the IPL 2022 auction•BCCI

The Mumbai Indians' owner explains his franchise picks.

"When we were sitting for our retention discussions, the third choice was so hard. Between Ishan, Hardik, Surya, we really had sleepless nights about which one to keep. We wanted at least one of them back. Of course Hardik is captaining Ahmedabad and we wish him all the best. Very happy to have got back Ishan.

"Jofra has been a player Mahela gave his first professional debut too. So happy to have got him. So happy to have Jof and Boom making a lethal bowling attack, although next year.

"We thought Tymal would go for a lot more. He’s an experienced death bowler. He’s one of the main picks we had this season so that we manage to stay competitive this season too. Mahela coaches him at the 100. He’s remained injury free too.

"Tim David is going to partner Pollard at 5 and 6. Fortunately he got a good spell at RCB last year, so he got the experience of IPL and knows what it is all about."

He also has a message for fans: "Yesterday might have been frustrating, but now you know who we were waiting for", and adds that if before the auction he had been told they would get both Ishan Kishan and Jofra Archer, he'd have thought he was dreaming.

Catch your breath

It's been a comeback and a half from Mumbai Indians, in particular. They've splurged on Jofra Archer, even though he won't be available this year, most likely. But they also splurged on Tim David, and got Tymal Mills at a bargain rate of 1.5 crore. Imagine, if you will, facing a T20 attack that has Jasprit Bumrah, Jofra Archer and Tymal Mills.

Lots of other franchises shaping up well too. But Gujarat Titans *still* need a wicketkeeper. Perhaps they'll get someone like Sam Billings when the unsold players come back?

"When I reached till 14 [crore], I was thinking I should not go for more than this," he tells Star Sports. "If CSK pulls out, then I will feel very sad. I wanted to play for CSK because I've not imagined myself playing in any other colour than yellow. At one time I was thinking it's too much. As a CSK player, I also want that we should build a good team, so after 13 [crore], I was actually thinking the bidding should stop and then CSK can buy some other players"

Gautam Gambhir sheds light on the Lucknow buys
Avesh Khan in his follow-through•BCCI

The Lucknow Super Giants team mentor, to host broadcaster Star Sports:

"We are satisfied… we bought players with experience who can walk in (to the playing XI). Yes, you can invest in a younger player, but you want players who can straightaway come into the XI.

"See we wanted someone like a Quinton, because we wanted to free KL up from his keeping responsibilities. Sometimes being a keeper, captain and opening batsman can be strenuous. Then we wanted Stoinis a batting allrounder, and then we went for a bowling allrounder in Jason Holder to split between them. Then we took Manish Pandey. Deepak Hooda can chip in with a few overs. Gowtham clearly from a perspective that Hooda is a batting allrounder, Gowtham is a bowling allrounder. And we are using only 3-4 stadiums, so wickets may turn later in the season. Plus we always wanted pace. Imagine if you have Mark Wood and Avesh Khan bowling at 140-145, that will always be a luxury.

"We wanted one of the two - Prasidh Krishna or Avesh Khan. Lots of people may say that he has gone for higher than what he should've gone for (Avesh)… but he is 23-24. We went really hard for Prasidh, and when we didn't get him, we went for Avesh Khan. Exactly the same reason why Sunrisers went for (Umran) Malik - his pace."

The analysis that led to the Liam Livingstone bid
Liam Livingstone warms up•BCCI

He was always expected to fetch a good price, and here, Matt Roller tells us the ins and outs of the value Livingstone brings:

Liam Livingstone was a base-price pick-up at 75 lakh for Rajasthan Royals last year and had a quiet season for them, hitting 42 runs in five innings in the UAE. 12 months on, he sparked a five-way bidding war in 2022 and ended up selling for 11.5 crore, the fourth-highest fee for an Englishman at an IPL auction.

There are two main reasons for the explosion in Livingstone’s salary. Firstly, 2021 was a breakout year for him with the bat: he forced his way into England’s T20I team after a four-year absence and hit 103 off 43 against Pakistan in his third innings back, before becoming the Hundred’s MVP in its inaugural season. He hit 86 T20 sixes in 2021, second only to Glenn Phillips.

Secondly, teams have recognised that Livingstone’s versatility - a quality on which he prides himself - is a huge asset. He has recent experience everywhere from No. 1-7 and has developed his ability to finish an innings in particular, while his bowling - a mixture of offbreaks and legbreaks in the same over, depending on match-ups and dimensions - has come on significantly. “People call him a part-timer,” Eoin Morgan said at the World Cup. “He's not. He's an allrounder.”

A notable subplot in the Livingstone bidding war was the role of Dan Weston, one of Punjab’s analysts. Weston pushed hard for Birmingham Phoenix to pick Livingstone up in the first round of the Hundred draft back in 2019 - he was the only domestic player picked in the draft, despite his limited England experience at the time - and this buy has his fingerprints all over it.

He has had some patchy form at times, but the left-arm angle, pace and bounce he can generate can be valuable. The teams clearly think so, because his bid is past 5 crore now.

New bidder: Sunrisers Hyderabad. They raise the bid up to 1.8 crore. Some deliberations at the Lucknow Super Giants table. SRH in the lead at 2 crore. When will KKR enter this bidding for Odean?

Kings are back in the mix. SRH bid again and drag it up to 3.2 crore. Kings try to outbid SRH. Neither franchise is backing out yet. WI allrounders have always been in demand at the IPL and the trend continues.

Royals are the new bidders for Odean. Can they fight off SRH? SRH in the lead at 4 crore. Still in the lead at 4.4 crore.

Punjab Kings come back with 4.6 crore. SRH raise it up to 4.8 crore. Kings bid again; it's with him at 5 crore. Odean had originally set his base price at 2 crore and then cut it down to 1 crore. He was always going to attract attention.

The bid has touched 5.75 crore after SRH had raised their paddle. Kings aren't pulling out as they take it up to 6 crore. That's the winning bid. Sold to Punjab Kings for 6 crore

The England power-hitter enters at 1 crore. He can bowl offbreaks as well as legbreaks. KKR make the opening bid. Some activity at the CSK table. KKR and CSK steadily raise their paddles as the bid touches 2 crore

The bid rapidly soars past 4 crore; it's with KKR. CSK deliberate and seems like they're out of the bidding. There's a new bidder: Punjab Kings as the bid jumps to 4.8 crore. KKR still in the lead.

Hang on, Ness Wadia raises the paddle and the bid to 5 crore. Venky Mysore isn't backing out yet. KKR back in the lead at 5.25 crore

This is getting giddy. KKR send the bid rocketing to 6.25 crore. Will Kings bid further for Livingstone? Yes, they do as the furious bidding war resumes between KKR and Kings.

KKR take a moment and pull out. Gujarat Titans make a late appearance and compete with Kings. Titans in the lead at 7 crore. Punjab Kings come back with 7.25 crore.

Whoa! The bid soars past 8 crore and then past 9 crore like how Livingstone cranks up the tempo in the slog overs. Kings in the lead at 10.25 crore. SRH make a late appearance with 10.75 crore. Kings look to outbid them. Kings back in the lead at 11.5 crore

Among English auction buys, Livingstone's fourth now: Stokes 14.5 to RPS, 2017 + Stokes 12.5 to RR, 2018 and Mills 12 to RCB, 2017. Livingstone sold to Kings for 11.5 crore. Whopper.

Harshal Patel unplugged
Harshal Patel broke through for Royal Challengers Bangalore•BCCI

“We’d rather you get 9 crore in the auction instead of 6 crore via retention” – RCB to Harshal Patel

Speaking to host broadcaster Star Sports, Harshal Patel was remarkably candid.

On his price tag They basically told me if we retain you we have to pay to 6 crores and 9 crores will be deducted from our purse since you’ll be the fourth player. We don’t want to do that. We would rather that you earn that money in the auction, we’ll try to get you back. That was the only communication. Even before that. When they traded me from Delhi, they gave me a responsibility that I was not expecting myself to fulfill. They backed me, they’ve seen something in me. That means a lot. The price tag is absolutely huge but the amount of faith they’ve shown in me means a lot.

Who will captain RCB? I haven’t had a chat with anybody but I think Faf is a great captain. He has led SA very well, he could be a potential candidate.

On bowling with Hazlewood I really admire Josh because he is one of those bowlers who continuously bowls in that channel day in, day out. I have tried to do that in red ball cricket and have had success in the past couple of years. But he is somebody I really look up to. I have a great rapport with Siraj, we did well bowling in tandem last season.

Royal Challengers Bangalore and Sunrisers Hyderabad
RCB squad after first day of IPL 2022 auction•ESPNcricinfo Ltd

They went big after players they really wanted, shelling out huge sums for Harshal and Hasaranga, and a substantial amount for du Plessis too. They need an Indian middle-order bat. Their overseas signings leave them with less wiggle room to target an overseas middle-order batter, particularly if they make du Plessis the captain. That means all four overseas spots will be fixed. So they need to go after the Indian talent. They might need an offspinner too.

SRH squad after first day of IPL 2022 auction•ESPNcricinfo Ltd

They had a lot of budget, and went after more of the bowling options than batting ones. That's given them a reasonable bowling attack - though they still lack a game-breaking T20 bowler. The batting will need some attention though. Kane Williamson and Pooran together with talented youngsters is promising, but Williamson's elbow injuries have been nagging, and ideally, you would want more sturdiness in that batting line-up.

How Punjab Kings and Rajasthan Royals shape up
PBKS squad after first day of IPL 2022 auction•ESPNcricinfo Ltd

They had a large budget and used it to pick up some good players. They still need some fast-bowling nous, ideally with the new ball because Rabada and Arshdeep can take care of the death overs between them. Some batting depth wouldn't be amiss either, with the batting a bit inexperienced after the top three.

RR squad after first day of IPL 2022 auction•ESPNcricinfo Ltd

For my money, possibly the franchise that had the best outing on Day 1. They've got a potent spin-bowling pair in Chahal and Ashwin. The new-ball bowling looks competent with Boult and Prasidh. What they need is someone who can take care of the death overs. If they can get someone who can do that and bat a bit, it'll balance their squad nicely. They might also want an Indian middle-order bat.

Lucknow Super Giants and Mumbai Indians on Day 1
LSG squad after first day of IPL 2022 auction•ESPNcricinfo Ltd

They've practically got a first XI, and a good one at that, already. Their issue is a purse of just 6.90 crore, and at least 7 players left to buy to hit the minimum squad size of 18. While they could pick up 4-5 of those at base prices, that still means they can't really go beyond roughly a 4 crore bid for any gun player they want to add.

MI squad after first day of IPL 2022 auction•ESPNcricinfo Ltd

Operation 'Get Ishan Kishan' was successful. It depleted Mumbai's purse, but their squad construction still leaves them a lot of flexibility. Their core of Rohit, Bumrah, Suryakumar and Kishan are all Indians, which means they can go for some of the explosive overseas options. A fast bowler to partner Bumrah, a middle-order hitter, perhaps even a spinner.

How Gujarat Titans and Kolkata Knight Riders look
GT squad after first day of IPL 2022 auction•ESPNcricinfo Ltd

There's a lot of gun players, but there's no wicketkeeper yet. Will they pick up a Sam Billings or Matthew Wade in the accelerated auction? Or go for an Indian name? Somewhat puzzlingly (to me), they didn't bid strongly for the likes of Prabhsimran Singh, Jitesh Sharma, Anuj Rawat and co, who came late on Day 1. They also need some Indian middle order bats. Of their overseas picks - Rashid Khan, Jason Roy and Lockie Ferguson should be lock-ins for the first XI, so they have only one overseas spot left. That should go to a middle-order gun ideally, although if they get an Evin Lewis, they could make that work too.

KKR squad after first day of IPL 2022 auction•ESPNcricinfo Ltd

They need an opener, or if they decide to have Nitish Rana open with Venkatesh Iyer, then middle order bats. Openers are a more common resource in T20 cricket though, and if Rana can be their No.4, they might find it easier to get an opener. Their only keeping option is Sheldon Jackson, so they might be shopping around for at least one more wicketkeeper too.

The CSK squad•ESPNcricinfo Ltd

That's who CSK have after Day 1. The roles they'll be looking for: a gun overseas pace bowler or two. At least one of them handy with the bat. They'll certainly add some local Indian bowling talent. Robin Uthappa can open with Ruturaj Gaikwad, but last year, he was only their back-up. So an overseas opener could be on the radar.

DC squad after first day of IPL 2022 auction•ESPNcricinfo Ltd

Day 2 is here

Day 2 is here. Franchises would have had time to sleep on their choices on the first day. Adjust their strategies based on which players are coming up. Look at the holes they need to fill up. And avoid the mistakes - if they felt they made any - on Day 1.

There was big money splurged on the first day, which has left budgets depleted. But that still doesn't rule out a couple of big-ticket buys on Day 2. There's plenty of T20 performers, talents and potential superstars slated to come today.

While a lot of stars are in the regular auction, the accelerated one will have a certain Jofra Archer. Who will he go to? Will there be a bidding war, despite his likely unavailability?

There's also the accelerated auction. Each team would have submitted a list of 20 players from beyond Set 18, and those players will form part of the accelerated auction. Several who went unsold yesterday will make a reappearance.

Among the Indians, there's the veteran pair of Ajinkya Rahane, Ishant Sharma and Cheteshwar Pujara. Will they find bids? There's also younger talent like Jayant Yadav, Chetan Sakariya. Veteran IPL hands like Saurabh Tiwary, Jaydev Unadkat.

And that's just scraping the surface. For now, this is Saurabh, signing off on behalf of Deiva too.

What we can expect on Day 2

Chennai Super Kings: They splurged on getting Deepak Chahar back, perhaps rightfully so. They still need some solid bowling options, and there's plenty overseas to pick from. Expect them to target two overseas bowlers. If one of them can bat, all the better. The batting looks okay, with Ruturaj Gaikwad, Ambati Rayudu, Robin Uthappa, Moeen Ali, MS Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja.

Delhi Capitals: A top four that's mouth-watering. Prithvi Shaw, David Warner, Mitchell Marsh and Rishabh Pant. There's good supporting talent in KS Bharat and Sarfaraz Khan. They have bowlers who can bat in Axar Patel, Shardul Thakur and even Kamlesh Nagarkoti. Their two spinners are Axar and Kuldeep Yadav, so a right-arm offspinner maybe needed. One more strike bowler to partner Anrich Nortje wouldn't be amiss either.

Gujarat Titans: They've picked up only 10 players. But most of those are first XI candidates. They do need to shore up the batting though. Only Jason Roy and Shubman Gill are the established batters, with Abhinav Manohar exciting but untested. Hardik Pandya can wield a mean willow of course. But they'll probably need some batting cover. The bowling looks solid with Rashid Khan, Lockie Ferguson, Mohammed Shami, Sai Kishore and Noor Ahmad. Tewatia could be the balancing factor. Most crucially, they don't yet have a wicketkeeper in the squad.

Kolkata Knight Riders: They've bought only 9 players, and while their bowling is solid, they need some more batting options. Among established batters, they have only the Iyers - Venkatesh and Shreyas, and Nitish Rana. Their only keeping option is Sheldon Jackson, so they might want some more of that.

Lucknow Super Giants: A potential top seven of Rahul, QdK, Pandey, Hooda, Stoinis, Krunal and Holder looks really solid. They went hard for Mark Wood, but given his injury history, will want some cover. The problem is, they have only 6.90 crore left, and only 11 players picked. They need 7 more - the minimum squad size is 18 - and because of their budget, need to pick a lot of them at base price. Or all of them.

Mumbai Indians: It was almost as if Mumbai came on Day 1 with just one agenda: Get back Ishan Kishan. They did that. But they have only 8 players, so 10 more to pick. They do have a healthy budget though, because they didn't really buy much other than Kishan. Because of the already strong core, they still look in good shape. They need bowling back up for Bumrah though. The overseas picks could provide that.

Punjab Kings: They've got a solid top three in Dhawan, Agarwal and Bairstow. The middle order has some promising, but still raw candidates. The bowling looks in fairly decent shape with Rabada complemented by Arshdeep, Rahul Chahar and Harpreet Brar, as well as Ishan Porel.

Rajasthan Royals: They came in wanting to get a full bowling attack, and acquired Chahal, Ashwin, Boult and Prasidh Krishna. They also got Shimron Hetmyer, so all in all, will be feeling pleased with how the day went.

Royal Challengers Bangalore: They went big on two of their old players, Hasaranga and Harshal, and got them both. Dinesh Karthik at the price he came was a bit of a bargain. Perhaps the one thing they might want is explosive power with the bat up top, although an Anuj Rawat could grow into that role.

Sunrisers Hyderabad: They got back a lot of their young stars in Abhishek Sharma, Priyam Garg and Natarajan. They also got back Bhuvneshwar. The batting might still be brittle, depending on the condition of Kane Williamson's elbow.

This could be fun. Avesh has set his base price at 20 lakh. CSK make the opening bid. Lucknow Super Giants enter the fray and compete with CSK. The bid steadily rises towards 1 crore. It passes 1 crore as CSK bid for him once again.

Both CSK and Lucknow keep raising the paddle. Wonder when MI would enter to make this a three-way bidding war. Lucknow in the lead at 3.4 crore.

Oh hello! Mumbai come in as the bid jumps past 4 crore. Lucknow take it up to 5 crore. Wow, it passes 6 crore before I could type out the next update.

Mumbai and Lucknow locked in a bidding war for Avesh. Lucknow in the lead at 8 crore. Mumbai are bidding aggressively for Avesh, looking to pair him up with Bumrah.

Lucknow escalate the bid up to 9 crore. Sunrisers Hyderabad enter the bidding as the bid reaches 9.75 crore. Lucknow hold the bid now at 10 crore. Will SRH snatch Avesh away from Lucknow? Sold to Lucknow at 10 crore. Avesh is now the most expensive uncapped buy at an IPL auction. CSK had forked out 9.25 crore for K Gowtham previously.

Kartik Tyagi wheels away•BCCI

The Indian fast bowler enters at 20 lakh. Delhi Capitals make the opening bid for Tyagi. CSK compete with them. CSK's Sundar Raman takes it past 40 lakh. Steady paddle raising at the Delhi table too as Tyagi sparks interest. CSK's turn to push the bid beyond 1 crore. CSK in the lead at 1.1 crore.

Okay, SRH make a belated entry and tussle with CSK. CSK come back at 1.8 crore. Sunrisers and CSK take it past 2 crore. CSK in the lead at 3 crore.

More intense bidding for Tyagi. CSK ask for a moment and deliberate. SRH have the bid for Tyagi at 3.6 crore. MI are targeting quicks, so they look to take Tyagi too.

The bid touches 4 crore. CSK are perhaps out of the race. MI are out too. SRH in the lead at 4 crore and that's the winning bid

The Delhi keeper-batter asks for bids from 20 lakh. SRH make the first move for Rawat. RCB join the bidding and compete with RCB. He's a big-hitting in the Indian domestic cricket circles. Perhaps, that's why RCB and SRH continue to battle is out to snap him up.

RCB raise the bid up to 75 lakh. The bid steadily crosses 1 crore. RCB still in the race with RCB as the bid touches 1.8 crore, it's with SRH. Still with SRH at 2 crore.

Titans make a late entry and push the bid past 3 crore. RCB and Titans try to outbid each other. There's a bit of a pause and then RCB come back in at 3.4 crore.

RCB open the bidding for their multi-skilled player. KKR also want him. Another home state vs old IPL franchise tussle. Shahbaz plays for Bengal in domestic cricket. KKR can't go beyond 1 crore, but SRH can, and they enter.

An under-rated cricketer, is Shahbaz. Has done well in all the limited opportunities he's got. SRH and RCB tussling for him takes him to 2 crore.

Shahbaz Ahmed goes to RCB for 2.4 crore. He'll stay with his old franchise.

Harpreet Brar roars after taking a wicket•BCCI/IPL

Should be some demand for him. 20 lakhs base price. RCB open the bidding. Punjab Kings want their left-arm spinning allrounder back too. Harpreet's price rises quickly. Punjab drop out before 1 crore, but KKR want Harpreet too, so it's them vs RCB now.

Oh like Arnold, Punjab Kings are back. They bid 1.30 crore. RCB still in the bidding. Harpreet's price goes past 2 crore. He is a crafty left-arm spinner and can bat a bit too. Gujarat Titans, with their fashionably late entry at 2.40 crore. They have taken Harpreet past 3 crore.

Punjab thought they had him. But Gujarat make a last minute bid at 3.60 crore. Punjab make it 3.80 crore. And they get Harpreet for that price.

Hapreet Brar goes back to Punjab Kings for 3.80 crore.

RCB and CSK open the bidding and it's flying past. Rahul Tewatia gave the IPL possibly the best ever match it had seen.

He's up beyond 1 crore now. The bidding slows as it goes towards 2 crore. And Gujarat Titans make their trademark entrance late, once it's past 2 crore. The bidding quickens again and Tewatia is past 3 crore. CSK still bidding. Tewatia up to 4 crore, and moving to 5 crore. One crore for each of those sixes in an over against Sheldon Cottrell? Yes! He's crossed 5 crore.

He's not stopping at 5 crore. Rather, the franchises aren't. Powering past 6 crore. Then 7 crore. Rahul Tewatia is an IPL millionaire. He did give us a one in a million match. Gujarat have just upped the bid to 8 crore. Whew. I may have whew-ed too early. Because the Tewatia bidding is still on. He could touch 9 crore. He *does* touch 9 crore. And that's where the ride ends.

Rahul Tewatia sold to Gujarat Titans for 9 crore.

Shivam Mavi•BCCI

Base price of 40 lakh. KKR make the opening bid for the pacer they've had the last three years. But RCB are going to battle them for him.

RCB exit, Punjab Kings enter. Mavi is above 1 crore. The bidding is still steady, but it's slower. Not too slow though, as Mavi enters the 2 crore territory.

Gujarat Titans make a late entry again. Mavi past 3 crore. It's Knight Riders vs Titans. But the Titans are dropping out. The Capitals are interested too now. KKR holding on. Here come Lucknow Super Giants. Every new entrant and Mavi moves into the next crore territory.

Mavi is eyeing a million dollars. Lucknow have bid 7 crore for him.

Shivam Mavi is sold to KKR for 7.25 crore. So they managed to ward off the competition and get him back.

Strap in. The money that’s saved up will be spent here. CSK get off the blocks first at a 40 lakhs base price. A long pause. Strange long pause. KKR then jump in. Now the bids are moving quickly.

In less time than it took to go from the first bid to second almost, Shahrukh’s price has gone above 2 crore.

CSK and Punjab in a slugfest. The price goes past 7 crore and Shahrukh is going to be a millionaire too.

He's at 8.50 crore now. Can he threaten K Gowtham's price of 9.25 crore, the highest for an uncapped player? Not quite. CSK don't have the budget. He's still the second highest uncapped player though.

Shahrukh Khan is sold to Punjab Kings for 9 crore.

The bids go past 1 crore, steadily rising. Still steady, and he crosses 3 crore. Neither Punjab nor Sunrisers want to let Abhishek go easily. They’ve taken him past 4 crore too. They’re still not letting up. Obviously, the franchise scouts have also seen the value in Abhishek Sharma. He’s touched 5 crore now.

A new entrant at 5.75 crore in Gujarat Titans.

Expect lots of demand for Rahul Tripathi. Starting at 40 lakhs. CSK open the bidding. KKR go up against them.

Bids are flying thick and fast. Tripathi is above 3 crore in a jiffy.

And very soon it's gone up to 6 crore too. KKR and CSK slugging it out. And SRH enter at 6.50 crore. CSK still going strong.

SRH have caused CSK to pause with a bid of 8 crore right now. CSK go to 8.25 crore. SRH are debating. They need India batters, so they up it again. Other franchises know they need them. So SRH naturally will confer at the table and make as if 8.50 is their upper limit. Could really be too.

Explaining the Mark Wood bid
Mark Wood is quick•Getty Images

Matt Roller has a detailed analysis of why Mark Wood fetched a price:

Mark Wood has played a single game in the IPL, conceding 49 runs from four overs for CSK back in 2018, and pulled out of last year’s auction at the last minute in order to spend time with his family. He is one of very few multi-format England players in this auction but is expected to be available for the vast majority of the season.

He was expensive in last year’s T20 World Cup but impressed in the T20Is against India this time last year. Wood said earlier this year that he was looking to put himself in “pressure situations” to help fulfil a “burning desire” to win more trophies for England, after seeing other fast bowlers - he cited Anrich Nortje as an example - improve quickly thanks to the IPL. With 7.5 crore (£730,000 GBP approx.) heading his way, the money won’t hurt either.

Delhi come back at 4.20 crore. The bidding war continues for Chahal. Mumbai escalate it to 5.25 crore. No activity at the RCB table. Sunrisers make a late entry to bid for Chahal. Mumbai in the lead at 5.75 crore. Sunrisers tap out. Any other teams interested in Chahal? Yes, Royals are in at 6 crore. How about Ashwin and Chahal at Royals?

Mumbai bid again and compete with Royals for Chahal. Royals outbid Mumbai to pick up Chahal for 6.5 crore. That's a steal as far as I'm concerned. Chahal will combine with R Ashwin there

Royals now bid for Chahar. How about R Ashwin and R Chahar there? Delhi, however, escalate the bid to 3.2 crore. Punjab Kings come back in at 3.4 crore.

Mumbai Indians make a belated entry and take the bid up to 3.6 crore. Punjab Kings back in at 3.8 crore.

Thakur's bid rapidly zooms to 9 crore. Punjab Kings are back into the lead. Delhi Capitals aren't letting up either.

Kings raise the paddle again, Capitals challenge them again. The bid hits 10 crore, it is with Punjab. Delhi now in the lead at 10.25 crore. Seems like Punjab Kings are out of it. Nope, they're back in at, forcing Delhi to come back at 10.75 crore. Sold to Delhi Capitals for 10.75 crore

Nicholas Pooran goes to SRH
Nicholas Pooran•BCCI

Base price 1.50 crore. An incredible T20 talent, but one who has blown extremes of hot and cold in the IPL.

SRH open the bidding, CSK up against them. Both of them take it past 4 crore pretty quickly. Eases past 5 crore too. It's a typical Pooran innings, there's a big flourish at the start. And the question is - will he sustain it?

KKR enter the bidding at 5.50 crore. SRH hold firm. It's past 7 crore - if KKR buy him, they'll have to buy only base price picks after this maybe. They've just bid 8 crore for Pooran. Another dollar millionaire in this mega auction.

KKR have just bid 9.50 crore for Pooran. SRH not letting up. Pooran will earn double digit crore figures. Past 10 crore. Do KKR know how much purse they have left? They do, which is why the bid is with SRH at 10.25 crore with Sunrisers right now. KKR confer. And they raise the bid! But Hyderabad's deep pockets win out.

Sunrisers Hyderabad get Nicholas Pooran for 10.75 crore.

Dinesh Karthik sets off•BCCI

Starting price 2 crore. Ending price? I'd say can touch double digits. RCB make the opening bid. He could be a captaincy candidate too. CSK now come in.

Steadily rising bids, although RCB seem to be having a bit of discussions around raising the price. They currently have it at 3.60 crore.

DK is one of the rare players who can fit easily into a late middle-order role. T20 has a surfeit of top-order batters - it's the easiest position to bat in. DK does a difficult job and though he's ageing now, he's done it superbly.

The bidding slows up a bit in the 4 crore bracket. Lots of deliberations at both CSK and RCB tables, but DK has touched 5 crore.

Dinesh Karthik goes to RCB for 5.5 crore. Great buy.

At 1.50 crore. He should also go for plenty. Delhi Capitals make the first bid. Strange reticence even after the first bid, but then Punjab get in and the pace picks up.

Bairstow now past 3 crore, with Punjab v Delhi still on. Delhi pull out when it goes beyond 4 crore. Here comes SRH, Bairstow's old franchise. The bids roll on. SRH almost nonchalantly raising the paddle. They've got the bid at 5.5 crore. Punjab don't want to top that. No wait, they do. Bairstow motors on past 6 crore.

He's terrific value, is Bairstow. Can open, can bat in the middle order, can keep wickets. Has upped his game against spin too. And can give the ball a mighty biff.

Punjab Kings get Jonny Bairstow for 6.75 crore. Great price for him I think.

He's back. Ishan Kishan unfurls the big hits once again•BCCI

This should be fun. Well not so much fun if you're typing it out... Ishan is above 5 crore in less time than it took me to type this out. Punjab Kings vs Mumbai Indians.

Ishan Kishan is a millionaire. Of course he is. He could be a double millionaire too. For now he's crossed the 7.5 crore mark. Mumbai going strong. Punjab drawing on their vast purse. But they pull out before 8 crore. That means Gujarat jump in. On the bidding goes. Past 9 crore. Past 10 crore with the speed with which Ishan goes from 20 to 50.

Mumbai make a show of conferring when it's still 10.75 crore, and of course they raise the paddle. I'll be shocked if they stop anywhere below 12 crore for Ishan. And now Ishan has crossed into the 12 crore territory. Ishan Kishan is the most expensive player in the IPL 2022 auction. Past Shreyas Iyer's 12.25 and almost into the 13s. So here come SRH with their mega purse. Onwards and upwards goes Ishan's price. Touching Yuvraj Singh 2014 at 14 crore.

He's still going on. Yuvraj's 16 crore mark and Chris Morris's 16.25 in sight. For now, he's crossed Ben Stokes' 14.50 price. SRH now having a think if they want to bid 15.50 crore. Looks like they don't want to. But if this auction is anything to go by, they might still get back in.

Mumbai Indians are pumped. They've got Ishan Kishan for 15.25 crore.

Marsh was one of the stars of Australia's T20 World Cup win of course. He's seemed to find himself as a T20 player. Not surprising that there's good demand for him.

Delhi have the bid at 6 crore, at which point Sunrisers think they don't want to go beyond. Oh wait, they do. They're back in the thick of the bids. Oh to be a fly on the table of one of the teams to know why they say they're out, but then jump back in with a bid. Change of mind? Strategy to bleed money from other franchises? We don't know, but Marsh goes to Delhi.

Will Gujarat and Mumbai slug it out for him? It's Chennai and Punjab to start things off first. Krunal's price has darted upwards of 4 crore in the blink of an eye. CSK tap out when it goes beyond 5 crore. That's when Punjab enter the fray. Punjab also drop out, but Lucknow pick up the baton. Krunal's beyond 6 crore now.

Lucknow still battling with Sunrisers with Krunal above 7 crore. Sunrisers drop out with the bid at 7.25 crore.

And here come Gujarat Titans into the fray. If it's between the two new teams, Krunal will either link up with brother Hardik, or have to be team-mates with Deepak Hooda. Either way, he'll be a millionaire. Because the bids have crossed 8 crore.

Krunal Pandya is sold to Lucknow Super Giants for 8.25 crore. So he'll be team-mates with Hooda again, after the fracas they had at Baroda.

Expect another fierce bidding battle for Washington. He kept his base price only 1.5 crore. The franchises continue to show reticence in making the first bid. Gujarat Titans do the honours. Now Punjab enter the fray, and the bids steadily rise.

Gujarat and Punjab slugging it out at a non-frenetic pace. Washington goes past 3 crore with a bid from Delhi now. Delhi staying true to the pace of an opening combo of Prithvi Shaw and David Warner, have taken it quickly to 5 crore.

It's still going back and forth between Gujarat - who have been in it from the start - and Delhi. The bid's with Delhi at 7 crore. And now SRH enter at 7.75 and the bids keep going up. Washy's also a millionaire.

Just when SRH think they have him, Lucknow get in and Washy goes beyond 8 crore. Still rising. He's like one of those blue-chip stocks. The start might have been slower, but you *know* he's going to rise to heights.

Why Hasaranga has fetched such a high bid (and is not done yet)
Wanindu Hasaranga is IPL's latest millionaire•Ishara S.Kodikara/AFP/Getty Images

We'll be resuming the auction with the Wanindu Hasaranga bid. To refresh, he was at a whopping 10.75 crore bid with RCB, the franchise he played for in the second half of IPL 2021.

Why so high? Matt Roller, who tracks T20 better than franchise scouts, has an answer:

"The depth of India’s spin-bowling talent means that it is rare for an overseas spinner to spark a bidding war at the IPL auction but Wanindu Hasaranga has proved an exception. The 10.75 crore bid is already a record fee for a Sri Lankan player.

Hasaranga, the legspinning allrounder, made his international debut as a teenager back in 2017 but has taken his game to another level in the last 18 months. His MVP-winning performances took Jaffna to the title in the inaugural LPL and he starred in T20Is: nobody took more wickets in 2021 and he was the leading wicket-taker at the World Cup in the UAE.

Hasaranga’s biggest strength is his googly, which is particularly hard to pick due to his loose grip: 15 out of his 16 World Cup wickets were from googlies. His collapsed front leg also gives him an unusually low release point and he has excelled bowling in all three phases of a game.

He played two games for RCB as a replacement for Adam Zampa in the UAE leg of IPL 2021, going wicketless and conceding 60 runs in six overs, but they are willing to pay over the odds to get him back. He is a livewire fielder and a handy batter - Sri Lanka used him as a floater in the World Cup - so helps balance the side. Notably, both RCB and Punjab Kings - then Kings XI Punjab - were involved in a bidding war for Rashid Khan, another sought-after overseas spinner, in the 2018 auction before Sunrisers Hyderabad used their right-to-match card."

The SL allrounder has listed his base price at 1 crore. He has impressed for SL and various T20 leagues around the world. SRH make the first move for Hasaranga. Sunrisers' Hemang Badani has worked with him at Jaffna in the LPL. Punjab Kings enter the bidding and tussle with Sunrisers.

Sunrisers take the bid up to 1.8 crore. Kings raise the paddle, as do Sunrisers. Moody chats with Kavya Maaran and they raise it up to 3.2 crore.

The bid quickly reaches 4 crore now. It's been a while since a Sri Lankan has attracted this much interest at an auction. However, Hasaranga is such an attractive T20 package and has a ripping googly in his repertoire.

Punjab Kings in the lead at 4.2 crore. RCB jump in - there's a new bidder for Hasaranga. He was part of their side last season. Kings and RCB tussle for Hasaranga.

Hesson, Malolan and co. chat at the RCB table and bid again; it's 5.75 crore now. Rhodes asks for a moment after which Kings raise the paddle once again, pushing the bid up to 6 crore.

Kings in the lead at 7 crore. RCB aren't backing out. RCB escalate the bid up to 7.75 crore. Kings take a moment and return to bid for Hasaranga.

Kings and RCB are locked in a bidding war for the legspin-bowling allrounder. Kings are ready to shell out 9 crore for him. However, RCB desperately want him back. This is getting interesting. RCB back in the lead at 10.25 crore. Big payday for Hasaranga as the bid rockets towards 11 crore.

Oh, Hugh Edmeades, the auctioneer, has collapsed while the bidding was on for Hasaranga. The auction has been paused. RCB in the lead at 10.75 crore

Matt Roller weighs in on the frenetic bidding for Hasaranga: "The depth of India’s spin-bowling talent means that it is rare for an overseas spinner to spark a bidding war at the IPL auction but Wanindu Hasaranga has proved an exception. The bidding had reached Rs. 10.75 crore when the auction was paused, which would be a record fee for a Sri Lankan player.

Hasaranga, the legspinning allrounder, made his international debut as a teenager back in 2017 but has taken his game to another level in the last 18 months. His MVP-winning performances took Jaffna to the title in the inaugural LPL and he starred in T20Is: nobody took more wickets in 2021 and he was the leading wicket-taker at the World Cup in the UAE.

Hasaranga’s biggest strength is his googly, which is particularly hard to pick due to his loose grip: 15 out of his 16 World Cup wickets were from googlies. His collapsed front leg also gives him an unusually low release point and he has excelled bowling in all three phases of a game.

He played two games for RCB as a replacement for Adam Zampa in the UAE leg of IPL 2021, going wicketless and conceding 60 runs in six overs, but they are willing to pay over the odds to get him back. He is a livewire fielder and a handy batter - Sri Lanka used him as a floater in the World Cup - so helps balance the side. Notably, both RCB and Punjab Kings - then Kings XI Punjab - were involved in a bidding war for Rashid Khan, another sought-after overseas spinner, in the 2018 auction before Sunrisers Hyderabad used their right-to-match card."

Deepak Hooda to Lucknow Super Giants
Deepak Hooda shows off his India cap•BCCI

Rajasthan Royals make the first bid for Hooda. Will he play for his home franchise this season? Hold on, RCB raise the paddle and make life difficult for Royals. Royals in the lead at 1.5 crore.

RCB, though, bid fairly aggressively for Hooda. He could shore up their middle order and bowl a bit of offspin too. RCB are out. Mumbai swoop in to bid for Hooda; it's at 1.8 crore. More competition: CSK enter the bidding for Hooda. Sundar Raman keeps the paddle up. MI and CSK are battling it out for Hooda now at the auction.

Oh well, Lucknow enter and shake it up further. The bid reaches 4 crore. CSK tap out. Lucknow in the lead at 4.8 crore.

CSK back in, escalating the bid further. Sunrisers jump in just when Lucknow were close to snapping him up. Hooda is eventually sold to Lucknow Super Giants for 5.75 crore

Sunrisers jump in and tussle with RCB. Kavya Maaran raises the paddle and takes the bid up to 6 crore. How much will Harshal end up earning? The bid has soared to 7 crore, it's with Sunrisers

RCB jump back in and bid for Harshal. Okay, Kavya chats with Moody and escalates the bid up to 8 crore. Harshal is a millionaire and looks good for more.

RCB are pretty firm. They want their designated death bowler back. They need to outbid SRH. SRH escalate it further to 10 crore. Big payday for Harshal as the bidding war continues between RCB and SRH.

RCB outbid SRH to snap up Harshal for 10.75 crore.

CSK raise the bid up to 5.25 crore. Finally, Mumbai drop their paddle. Royals take over at 5.5 crore. Lucknow Super Giants bid for Holder too. This is interesting. Royals and Super giants battle it out for Big Jase.

Lucknow Super Giants are ready to shell out 6.75 crore for Holder. Royals aren't tapping out yet. Super Giants raise the bid up to 7.75 crore. Royals hold on for a few moments before bidding again. As expected, Holder has activated a bidding war.

Delhi back in the lead; the bid is at 2.4 crore and it quickly jumps to 3 crore, with Royals leading. Quick, decisive raising of the paddle at both tables. Royals are ready to shell out 6 crore for Hetmyer. Delhi say 'leave my man alone'.

Hetmyer has had some fitness issues in the recent past, but there's plenty of interest for him at the IPL auction tables. Royals raise the bid to 7 crore. Delhi back in; the bid is at 7.25 crore.

The bid for Hetmyer has touched 8 crore; Royals back in the lead. Delhi take the bid up to 8.25 crore. Royals are refusing to tap out. It is Delhi who tap out ultimately. Hetmyer sold to Royals for 8.5 crore

Marquee set done

So that was a fairly hectic marquee set. Lots of bids - I think de Kock and Warner were got at bargain prices.

So here's the franchises who were in action:

Punjab Kings: Shikhar Dhawan (8.25 crore), Kagiso Rabada (9.25 crore). So they've got an opening partner for Mayank Agarwal and a new-ball attack leader.

Rajasthan Royals: R Ashwin (5 crore), Trent Boult (8 crore). They needed bowlers, having retained only batters, and they've got two experienced ones.

Kolkata Knight Riders: Pat Cummins (7.25 crore), Shreyas Iyer (12.25 crore). They've spent a big part of the purse. Got a captain in Iyer - or even Cummins possibly.

Gujarat Titans: Mohammed Shami (6.25 crore). Solid experience to add to the core they have.

Royal Challengers Bangalore: Faf du Plessis (7 crore). Solid performer, but I'm wondering about him and Kohli opening together, they're both similar sorts.

Lucknow Super Giants: Quinton de Kock (6.75 crore). Great buy, and perfect complement to KL Rahul as opener.

Delhi Capitals: David Warner (6.25 crore). What an opening combo he'll make with Prithvi Shaw.

David Warner tunes up•BCCI

Will SRH make a bid? The opening bid is by Delhi. CSK make the second bid rather late, after which the bids flow like boundaries. CSK want to take some time to think, and Mumbai jump in. Warner past 6 crore soon.

Delhi Capitals get David Warner for 6.25 crore.. That's a bigger steal than Quinton? Or same level. That's all our pre-IPL auction predictions out the door too. We thought Warner and QdK would be dollar millionaires for sure, and possibly get double digit crore figures too.

Delhi was the franchise that Warner made his IPL debut for. Homecoming of sorts for him, and under Ricky Ponting too.

Opening bid at 2 crore by Lucknow after a looooong pause. But once the opening bid is made by Lucknow, CSK jump in quickly. QdK now rising steadily and going past 4 crore.

Mumbai enter when he's past 4 crore. And then Lucknow Super Giants slug it out with Mumbai, as QdK goes past 5 crore too. MI take a pause but decide they can't risk saving their budget for Ishan Kishan I think, and continue bidding. QdK up to touching 7 crore. But not quite.

Quinton de Kock sold to Lucknow for 6.75 crore. That's a bit of a steal of a price. Opening batter, left-hander, wicketkeeper, proven performer. And a perfect complement to KL Rahul to open.

Delhi are out for now, and RCB holding the bid. Will CSK jump back in the fray? They can't because Delhi change their minds and get back in the bidding. Just for one bid though. Maybe they just wanted to eat into RCB's budget.

Faf du Plessis goes to RCB for 7 crore. So the tradition of an Affies boy at RCB continues. No AB de Villiers, but his schoolmate will be there.

Shreyas Iyer to KKR
Shreyas Iyer's price rises dramatically•BCCI

Shreyas Iyer. How far will he go? RCB make the first bid. Before I finished typing that sentence, they've already taken it past 4.2 crore - bidding between RCB and Delhi, Shreyas' old franchise.

This is not a tag-team match, it's a Royal Rumble. Seamless paddle raising when one team goes out. Between Delhi and Lucknow now and past 6 crore. And here come KKR, and another round of furious bidding means Iyer is past 9 crore too. But Delhi are not giving up that easily.

Will we have the first double digit crore figure of the day? We will, because Gujarat enter at 10 crore. Onwards we go. Everytime a new franchise enters the bidding, the price rises quicker than any silky smooth drives from Iyer's bat. He's at 12 crore now. Frankly, it would have been a shocker if he had gone below 12.

Shreyas Iyer sold to KKR for 12.25 crore. They've probably sealed their captain too with that bid. Bit of a headache for scorers when Venkatesh Iyer and Shreyas Iyer are batting together though.

Still between RCB and Royals, but Boult is past 5 crore now. RCB exit after that, which is the cue for Mumbai to jump in. Boult quickly goes past the 7 crore mark. Mumbai like their past players, but not beyond a certain budget point. They tap out at 8 crore, which is the Royals bid.

Franchises are not very keen to make opening bids. Perhaps they think it will tip their hand? Anyway, Delhi make the opening bid for their bowler. Titans then jump in immediately. Rabada goes from 2 crore to 4 crore in a jiffy.

Then goes from 4 crore to 6 crore pretty smoothly too. Still Gujarat and Delhi knocking it back and forth between each other. And past 7.5 crore, so another dollar millionaire.

Delhi slide out at 8 crore, but Punjab take up the baton. Punjab make their second big splash.

I think he deserves that much just for how he handled the whole Justin Langer situation. Now we can start bidding on his (considerable) cricketing skills too.

KKR take the bid to 5.75 crore, at which point, Gujarat tap out. They're tag-teaming with the other newbies though. Lucknow enter quickly and Cummins has gone beyond 7 crore.

Pat Cummins is sold to KKR for 7.25 crore. Stays with his old franchise at half the price. Still considerable. Just short of a dollar millionaire.

Still between Royals and Capitals for now, and Ashwin is inching towards 5 crore.

Both RR and DC still in it as Dhawan's bid crosses 5 crore. And that's when Punjab Kings enter the bidding. They've got the biggest purse. Dhawan's gone past 6 crore now. Discussions at the Delhi table, and they're out.

Okay they're not quite out, they come back into the bidding and raise Dhawan's price above 7 crore. Between Punjab and Delhi, as Dhawan goes past 8 crore. First bid of the day is already an IPL dollar millionaire.

Mumbai Indians' Zaheer Khan bids for a player at the IPL 2021 auction•BCCI

So we have the man I like to call our stats genius here, Gaurav Sundararaman. He's rather more well-known for having his finger on the pulse of IPL auctions like few others. Not surprising, given he's been in team backrooms, helping them hone strategies. He also wrote this #mustread piece on the building blocks of a good auction strategy. If any franchises haven't read it yet, you still have time. Welcome G-Stats.

Gaurav Sundararaman: (G-Stats) Hi Saurabh... exciting day ahead. Lots of cricketers are going to make a lot of money. One of the most challenging auctions in my view thanks to no RTM (right to match cards)

Saurabh: That's true. Strategically, this has to be the most challenging one - no RTM and 10 teams. Let's get the obvious questions out of the way first: who will perform best in the auction and why will it be CSK?

G-Stats: I think we have reached a stage that CSK don’t rely on auctions to win the league. Like their CEO Mr Kasi said, “Thaliavan Irrukan”, which translates to the leader is there. Why worry?

Saurabh: Haha, absolutely. So for the less serious stuff - give us your picks (and reasons) for the most expensive bid, the most expensive overseas player and the most expensive uncapped player. And which franchise you think will get them.

G-Stats: Ishan Kishan and Quinton De Kock/David Warner. Tough to go past these names. Purely from a skill set and role fitment point of view, this seems practical but hey - when have auctions gone based on logic…

Saurabh: I like those picks. Coincidentally all left-hand batters who are best suited to the top of the order. Okay, give me a wishlist for each franchise. Just one player that they'll be more keen to get, more than any other?

G-Stats: CSK - Deepak Chahar; RCB- Prasidh Krishna; KKR - Rahul Tripathi; LSG- Kagiso Rabada; GT - Ishan Kishan; MI - Ishan Kishan; DC - Shikhar Dhawan; SRH-Quinton De Kock; RR- Jofra Archer; PBKS – Warner

Saurabh: I'm curious about the Jofra Archer pick for RR. A fit Jofra might have challenged your picks for top buy... but this year too?

G-Stats: He can be retained… If you can get him then it is good for continuity.

Saurabh: That brings me to the next question about Jofra Archer. Why - if you're Jofra Archer - do you put yourself in this auction, knowing that you can fetch triple or more if you come in the next auction?

G-Stats: This is a million dollar question. May be some team wants him back or even Royals for that matter may want him back and since they have backed him all these days he is repaying his faith for them. Tough question to answer. I am just speculating

Saurabh: Right. Moving to the next bit - tell me your hidden gems in this auction. The guys who are under the radar, but who can potentially fetch huge value for franchises. What I like to call the Dre Russ picks - since he was picked by KKR for just 60 lakhs. One of mine that I know you also think will be a good one, is Abhishek Sharma. Who are the others?

G-Stats: Some of the bargain buys I recommend: Abhishek Sharma, Lalit Yadav, Prashant Solanki, Alex Hales, Devon Conway, Reece Topley, Jayden Seales

I gotta run for the live show!! have a great one SS!

Saurabh: Thanks G-Stats, this was fun!

New additions
Deepak Hooda shows off his India cap•BCCI

On the eve of the auction, Rajasthan batting allrounder Deepak Hooda, who recently made his international debut for India, has been upgraded into the capped category. Ten other uncapped players have also been added to the list, including Australian ambidextrous fingerspinner Nivethan Radhakrishnan.

Believe it or not, Nivethan can bowl seam as well, having done it in league cricket in Chennai. The 19-year old has been a squad member in the Tamil Nadu Premier League and has also been a reserve bowler at Delhi Capitals under Ricky Ponting's watch. Nivethan has a rookie contract with Tasmania as well. Nivethan continues to create opportunities with both hands

IPL 2022 auction: day one
The IPL 2021 auction will take place in Bengaluru on February 12 and 13•BCCI

Are you ready? The IPL mega auction is back after four years and the addition of two news teams will alter the dynamics.

But, hey, there's some perverse joy in knowing what others are earning, right? We're still about two hours away from the auction, which will kick off with the marquee set at noon. However, we have a smorgasbord of reading - and video - material to keep you occupied and get you up to speed. Welcome to ESPNcricinfo's blow-by-blow account of the IPL 2022 auction. I'm Deivarayan Muthu and I'll be joined by Saurabh Somani to bring you all the updates.
