The Central Broward Regional Park Stadium in Lauderhill, Florida, is regarded as one of the most beautiful venues across North America. Despite being in the United States, the venue has regularly hosted international cricket matches, being home to the West Indies and the USA. 

Inaugurated in 2007, the venue in Florida has costed around 70 Million US dollars. Broward Park hosted its first-ever T20I game in 2010, between New Zealand and Sri Lanka. 

The venue will host four matches at the T20 World Cup 2024. As we turn onto the final rounds of the group stage game, Florida will host co-hosts United States, heavy-weights India and Pakistan, among other teams.

How many T20I games has Central Broward Regional Park Stadium hosted?

The Central Broward Regional Park Stadium has hosted 18 T20I games so far, with the previous one being in August 2023, between India and West Indies. 

Of the four matches that were scheduled to be played during the T20 World Cup 2024, three of them have been abandoned due to rain, so far.

How many spectators can the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium hold?

The Central Broward Regional Park Stadium has a seating capacity of about 25000 spectators.

Central Broward Regional Park Stadium: Pitch Report

The pitch at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium is regarded as a batting pitch. Contrary to the other venues in the USA so far, the pitch in Florida could bring the fans some joy. The venue has witnessed some high-scoring games, and the average score at the venue is as high as 166.

That being said, it is not a chasing ground, if the legend were to be believed. Historically, teams bating first are handed a massive advantage over the opposition. The ball grips onto the pitch, making it difficult for the batters to score runs freely.
