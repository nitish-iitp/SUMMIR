PAK vs IRE Scorecard
Pakistan vs Ireland Commentary
6:31 PM IST Right then that's it from the final game of Group A and it is India and USA that advance through it. Pakistan ends the tournament on a winning note while Ireland goes home winless. The action continues from the ICC Men's T20 Cricket World Cup with Bangladesh set to play Nepal in a key game of Group D at the Arnos Vale Ground, Arnos Vale, St Vincent on 17th June 2024 at 5 AM IST (11.30 PM GMT, Previous day). You can always join us an hour early for the build-up. Until then cheers and stay safe.
6:28 PM IST Babar Azam, the captain of Pakistan says that they finished well but feels that after taking early wickets, they didn't capitalize and even with the bat they didn't finish quite well and had to depend on tailenders. Adds that with the bowl they were good and there were a few mistakes with the bat in a few games and that hurt them. On him batting at number 3, he says that if the team needs him to open or bat at number 3, he will do whatever the team needs. Adds that they have a bit of a break and then a series at home which they will be eager to do well in and ends by saying that there have been positives in the tournament but as a team, they didn't play well.
6:25 PM IST The losing skipper of Ireland, Paul Stirling is up for a quick chat. He says they played well in patches after not starting well and closing the batting innings well to back that up with a bowling performance as such it give a lot of boost to the side. Adds that they were far from playing their best cricket and that's the reason why they are out of the tournament. Also adds that it's been a couple of weeks full of difficulty but they'll look to take positives and bounce back soon.
6:17 PM IST Bowling from Ireland was good a bit sluggish to start with but they were splendid in the middle phase. Barry McCarthy was the pick of the bowlers as he picked up 3 wickets for 15 from his 4 overs while Curtis Campher took a couple as well. Mark Adair and Ben White took one wicket each too. With seam options running out, they were forced to bowl spin at the death and Gareth Delany even made things interesting with the wicket of Abbas Afridi but by then, just a couple of big hits were needed and the opposition managed to get them.
6:17 PM IST Shaheen Afridi is the Player of the Match for his stellar bowling and a crucial couple of sixes at the end as well. He starts by saying that the wicket supported the new ball and they looked to hit the good areas. Adds that every bowler is different and generally prefers to bowl fuller. Mentions that they haven't played good cricket which is demanded of them and they have to improve and get better. Ends by saying that the crowd always supports them and thanks them for sticking around even in times of difficulty.
6:15 PM IST Time for the presentation...
