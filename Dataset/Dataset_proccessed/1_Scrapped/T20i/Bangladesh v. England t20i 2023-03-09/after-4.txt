Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan: "The way we approached the game was fantastic. We were under the pump when bowling but didn't panic, and stuck to our plans. Apart from my dropped catch we did really well in the field.

"With the bat in T20 cricket when you don't think too much you can perform well. That's how we said we wanted to be in the dressing room. We showed that out on the ground and hopefully we can continue to show that. Hopefully we can build on this win in the next few games against England."

Jack Anderson: Strange captaincy by Jos Buttler, it was clear that spin was the way to go but he brought Moeen Ali into the attack after four quicks. Perhaps Moeen and Adil Rashid bowling after over four would have got us into the game.

Player of the match Bangladesh's Najmul Hossain Shanto: "I thought he batted really well. I just watched the ball and played cricketing shots. I wasn't thinking about us losing two wickets.

"The way all the bowlers bowled was outstanding. They all bowled really well and that helped the batsman to just bat normally.

"We started well with the bat and that helped the other batsman. It is always about starting well in T20 cricket."

That six-wicket win is Bangladesh's first over England in a T20.

Sounds like quite an achievement, right?

Remarkably it's the only the second time the two sides have faced each other in a T20 since the format was introduced in 2005.

'Not enough runs'

England captain Jos Buttler: "I thought they finished their innings well with the ball. We were probably 20 short from where we wanted to be. We didn't quite make enough runs and couldn't save that in the field.

"The pitch played as expected with low bounce but was consistent. The extra runs would have made it easier. Bangladesh took the game on and that put us under pressure.

"We had a different balanced team. It's just different and we played with a number of all-rounders it's a nice position to be in the field."

Francis Edwards: Do England need seven bowlers? Moeen at five, Curran at six, Woakes at seven is just utter disrespect to Bangladesh and they have deserved a loss. If some bowlers aren’t good enough to bowl four overs, then they shouldn’t be playing international cricket.

Shakib Al Hasan finishes with a slice through third man for four to wrap up victory by six wickets with two overs to spare.

Not the most beautiful way to finish the game but the Bangladesh captain will not care one bit.

Jofra Archer into the attack as the T20 World Cup winners look for a bit of magic.

Archer drops it short to Shakib Al Hasan with his second ball. The Bangladesh skipper helps it round the corner down to fine leg. The ball hangs in the air and age but thuds safely into the turf between two fielders.

Afif Hossain then plays arguably the shot of the day off Archer's penultimate delivery. A beautiful front foot drive, crisply struck through the covers for four. Glorious. Bangladesh finishing this in style.

Shakib Al Hasan and Afif Hossain content to prod, poke and sweep Moeen Ali's first three balls. However, the Bangladesh skipper then looks to grab this chase by the scruff of the neck.

First he skips down to the pitch off the ball and chips it back over Moeen's head and down the ground for four. It's followed by a second boundary as he drops on the back foot and slaps it through the covers.

Good use of the crease from Shakib to the spinner.

Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan thrashes Chris Jordan's first ball for four through point, but the England seamer comes back strongly with just one run off the next four balls.

He draws a leading edge off Shakib's bat with his penultimate delivery but is not quite able to get to it on his follow through.

Bangladesh need 29 off 30 balls to win.

Shakib Al Hasan picks up an early boundary off Moeen Ali but England miss a tough chance to take another wicket off the final ball of his over.

Afif Hossain pings a reverse sweep at a rate of knots to Dawid Malan at point. Malan is able to dive to parry the ball in the air one handed, but is unable to grab the catch at the second attempt.

Boiling up into an interesting finish in Chattogram with two new batters.

Mark Wood with a fast bumper to Afif Hossain which he evasively paddles behind him.

The ball spoons up and Jos Buttler sprints off top his right in the direction as Wood bellows "catch catch", but the England skipper is not quite able to make up the ground.

Huge wicket for England as Mark Wood strikes!

A similar dismissal to Ben Duckett's in England's innings as the pitch does for the Bangladesh batter.

It's just slightly back of a length from Wood and it stays low on Najmul Hossain Shanto. The balls skids through to knock out his middle stump.
