REPORT
DAY 1

Virender Sehwag racked up the fastest double-century on the subcontinent to put India in control of the first Test at Multan. Sehwag’s blistering knock – he brought up 150 off as many balls and later 200 off 222 – exposed the Pakistani bowling attack on a pitch capable of driving fast bowlers to cricket suicide. India galloped to 356 for 2, and the sight of Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar well set will do nothing to help the sagging morale of Pakistan’s tired bowlers. Rahul Dravid, standing in for Sourav Ganguly, who was ruled out with a back injury, did his team the huge favour of winning the toss. That done, Sehwag and Aakash Chopra took over. The two, fire and ice, blunted the three-pronged pace attack. Shoaib Akhtar steamed in and delivered one frustrated bouncer after another. Mohammad Sami found that shortening his run-up did nothing to improve his accuracy. Shabbir Ahmed tried and tried, but even his high-armed action did not threaten the batsmen as there wasn’t a hint of movement in the air or off the pitch. [READ MORE …… ]

DAY 2

The second day of the Multan Test will be remembered as the one in which Virender Sehwag became the first Indian to hit a Test triple-century, and Sachin Tendulkar was left 6 short of an impeccable double-century. However, it should also be remembered as the day when John Wright’s belief in putting the team ahead of the individual was clinically put into practice, as India declared on 675 for 5, giving themselves an hour of bowling against Pakistan’s openers. There is a jaunty air to Sehwag’s batting that belies the thinking and effort that goes into crafting innings like the one he played. You do not score 309 against a Test attack, even on the flattest track, by clattering away at every ball as though it is the last you will face in your life. That he edges a delivery straight to slip, sees the catch dropped, and plays a blistering square cut off the very next one, as he did to go past VVS Laxman’s 281, does not mean that presenting slip fielders with catch practice does not bother Sehwag.

DAY 3

India inched closer to getting themselves into a position that would allow them to dream of a first-ever Test win in Pakistan. They ended a day of gently seesawing fortunes with the advantage, having taken six Pakistani wickets at intermittent intervals throughout the day, the last coming off the final delivery. India haven’t quite got a grip on this game, but there were signs of Pakistan choking under the sheer volume of runs. Yet they might just have kept India out in the field long enough to make them think twice about enforcing the follow-on even if they do have the option. At 364 for 6 by the close, Pakistan were 311 runs adrift of the mammoth Indian total. The two best batsmen in the Pakistan team, Inzamam-ul-Haq and Yousuf Youhana, were both extremely unhappy at being given out by Simon Taufel. Inzamam was at the wrong end of a bat-pad catch while Youhana was dismissed trying to flick a ball slipping well down the leg side. On a flat pitch, under the glare of the exceedingly hot Multan sun, it was not easy for the bowlers, and they were grateful for any help that they received. [READ MORE ….. ]

DAY 4

On a day when wickets fell at an astonishing rate, Yousuf Youhana scored a fighting century to keep the jaws of defeat from snapping shut. India rose like giants and were on the verge of their first Test win on Pakistani soil. The pitch, now four days old, hardly crumbled, but India’s bowlers stuck to their guns with such great application that Pakistan’s batsmen withered and slumped to 207 for 9 after following on. They were still 61 runs adrift of India. Kumble, with 6 for 71, had once again turned on the heat when India needed it the most.The day began with Pakistan in difficulty at 364 for 6, and ended with them staring defeat in the face. [READ MORE ….. ]

DAY 5

It took India just 12 balls on the final morning to put the lid on their historic maiden Test win in Pakistan. If Rahul Dravid, leading the side in Sourav Ganguly’s absence, had sat down and written a script for his dream Test match, it would have been exactly as this one played out. Pakistan were bowled out for 216 after following on, and India won by an innings and 52 runs. After 52 years of India-Pakistan encounters, 49 years after India first toured Pakistan, they could finally savour the sweet taste of victory here. [READ MORE …. ]
