Following a turbulent 2023 for tech investment and talent, the early months of 2024 signal a renewed optimism for technology's power to drive advancements within the ecosystem. The digital disruption is for real and is here to stay encompassing lives and businesses. This ongoing transformation is poised to usher in what many consider the next industrial revolution, propelled by a multitude of technological advancements. Key emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning are reshaping nearly every sector, from health care, agriculture, and manufacturing to the banking and finance industry.

Simultaneously, it's imperative to address the last mile in this progression. Bridging the skill gap for marginalised individuals and communities lacking access to technology or skill development opportunities is crucial for true inclusivity. Ensuring that everyone, irrespective of their background or location, has the opportunity to acquire technological skills and engage in the evolving ecosystem is paramount. This inclusivity not only enriches the industry but also enables empowerment for marginalised youth, women and jobseekers from remote areas thereby, helping reduce the talent deficit in the country.
