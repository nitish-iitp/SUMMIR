Right then, thats it from the 2nd T20I between Sri Lanka and Afghanistan as the hosts defeat Afghanistan by 72 runs. Sri Lanka leads the three-match T20I series 2-nil and the third and final game of this bilateral series will be played on 21st February at 7 pm IST (1.30 pm GMT). You can join us an hour early for the build-up. Till then cheers!
The skipper of Sri Lanka, Wanindu Hasaranga starts by crediting the batters for the way they batted. Adds that openers and Sadeera Samarawickrama did their job. Mentions that with the total they had, he had the trust in their bowlers to get the job done. On reaching the landmark of 100 T20I wickets, he replies that there is still a long way to go for him. Ends by saying that having sealed the series, they will look to test their bench strength in the next game.
The skipper of Afghanistan, Ibrahim Zadran says they were good till the 15th over in the first innings but they got a bit too many in the last 5 overs. Adds that the batters failed them and did not execute their plans that costed them the game. Mentions that they planned to create partnerships in the middle but failed to do so and fell short of the target. Closes by saying that it is all about the mindset and at the end of the day the players need to execute the plans and they failed to do that today.
Angelo Mathews is the player of the match for his knock of 42 and picking up a couple of wickets. He says that he is feeling pretty good. Mentions that he had to undergo a fitness test before the game due to a tightness in the hamstring. States that he looks to adapt himself to the situation. Credits Sadeera Samarawickrama for the way he batted. Adds that the plan was for Sadeera to anchor the innings. Shares that the knock from Sadeera allowed him to bat freely. Ends by thanking the Dambulla crowd for their support.
Stay tuned for the presentation...
Earlier in the game, after being asked to bat first, Sri Lanka started nicely but fell behind in the middle phase. The Lankans were 122 for 5 after 15 overs but a brilliant injection of pace from Angelo Mathews and Sadeera Samarawickrama at the end helped the side post 187 on board that was a bit above par on this tricky track. Every batter apart from Charith Asalanka got a start and made their cameos count. Sadeera Samarawickrama was the top scorer as he scored 51 for the side. The bowlers of Afghanistan went for many but it was an economical effort from Mohammad Nabi as he picked up a couple at an economy under 7.
It was a lethal bowling performance from the Lankan bowlers as they kept things tight and took wickets regularly. The willy old fox Angelo Mathews was brilliant with the ball and picked up couple early on in his spell and ended up with figures of 2-0-9-2. Binura Fernando soon followed his footsteps and picked up a couple in the same over as he ended up picking 2 wickets. Wanindu Hasaranga and Matheesha Pathirana did the cleaning at the end with a couple to their name as well. Maheesh Theekshana and Dasun Shanaka took a wicket each as well.
Chasing down a big total of 187, Afghanistan were down and out early in the Powerplay as the side were 5 down on 31 inside 5 overs. The Sri Lanka bowlers broke the back bone of the chase and pinned the Afghan batters to the wall. Mohammad Nabi and Karim Janat then tried hard and knit up a partnership of 39 for the 6th wicket but the target was way too much for them. The batters did get starts but failed to make them count and faltered massively with the bat.
The brilliance from Angelo Mathews with both bat and ball helps Sri Lanka seal the T20I series as they go 2-0 up in the 3 match series.

OUT! TAKEN! THAT'S IT! All over for Afghanistan! Matheesha Pathirana finishes things off! Bowls it on a length, outside off, Fazalhaq Farooqi backs away and shapes up to go up and over on the off side. He fails to get the desired connection as the ball comes off the bottom half of the bat and lobs towards cover. Dasun Shanaka stationed there, times the jump to perfection and takes it over his head to his left. Sri Lanka win by 72 runs and have sealed the series!

OUT! CASTLED! Matheesha Pathirana has done what he does best! He goes through the defence of Naveen-ul-Haq and Sri Lanka are now a wicket away from sealing the series. Angles it in, on middle and leg stump line, on a fullish length. Naveen-ul-Haq does get his bat down in time but the ball tails back in to go past the inside edge and rattles into the leg stump.

Half a shout for LBW but there looked to be bat involved. Goes full and straight, at the stumps, Noor Ahmad hurriedly brings his bat down to keep it out on the leg side. Gets an inside edge onto the pads and they cross as the ball rolls to the off side. Pathirana does not spot the inside edge and Sri Lanka want to try their luck with the review. The UltraEdge shows that there is bat involved.

Starts from over the wicket and hurls it at 146 clicks, on a length, on off, Noor Ahmad pushes it back to the bowler.
