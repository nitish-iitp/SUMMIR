SL vs AFG Live Telecast in India: Sri Lanka and Afghanistan will feature in the second T20I on Monday.

SL vs AFG 2nd T20 Live Streaming in India: Sri Lanka will host Afghanistan for the second T20 International in the three-match series at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in Dambulla on Monday.

Having achieved a 3-0 clean sweep in the ODI series, the Lankans started the T20Is with a thrilling four-run win over Afghanistan in the first match.

Sri Lanka was bowled out for 160 in just 19 overs after the Afghans opted to bowl. Led by skipper Wanindu Hasaranga’s career-best 67 off 32 deliveries, laced with seven fours and three sixes, Sri Lanka made up for a poor start. Pacers Fazalhaq Faroogi and Naveen-ul-Haq had run through the top-order, leaving Sri Lanka hanging at 55 for four before Hasaranga’s onslaught.

In reply, Hasaranga’s counterpart, Ibrahim Zadran anchored the chase with an unbeaten 67 off 55 balls but failed to take his team across the line. Seamer Matheesha Pathirana was the pick of the bowlers for the hosts, registering figures of 4/24 in his four overs. The Afghans required 11 runs in the final over but left-arm seamer Binura Fernando only gave away six runs to snatch a win for his side.
