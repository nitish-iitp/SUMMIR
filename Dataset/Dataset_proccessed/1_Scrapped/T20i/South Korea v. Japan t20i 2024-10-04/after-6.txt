Israel-Iran war live updates: Israel issues wider evacuation warnings in Lebanon, signalling escalation

Israel-Iran war live updates: The Israeli military on Thursday issued warnings for residents to evacuate a city and several communities in southern Lebanon, located north of a U.N.-designated buffer zone. This move suggests that Israel may expand the ground offensive it initiated earlier in the week against Hezbollah, Associated Press reported.

The evacuation orders include Nabatieh, a provincial capital, and surrounding areas north of the Litani River, which marks the northern boundary of the U.N. Security Council's border zone established after the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. Both sides have accused each other of breaching the resolution.
