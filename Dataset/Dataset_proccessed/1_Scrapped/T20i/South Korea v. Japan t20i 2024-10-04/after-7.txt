Virat Kohli GOAT, 'Hell Of A Difference' With Babar Azam : Ex Pakistan Stars Reflect On 'Pointless' Debate
Virat Kohli and Babar Azam are two of the biggest names in world cricket and the comparisons between the two has been going on for the past few years. But former Pakistan star cricketers feel that Kohli is way ahead when it comes to performance and people comparing him with Babar is actually baseless.

The debate between Virat Kohli and Babar Azam raged after Pakistan defeated India by a comprehensive margin of 10 wickets in the T20 World Cup 2021. Babar Azam peaked since then and went onto create records just like Kohli. But recently or in the past two years, Azam has not been able to be perform, facing severe criticisms and even stepped down from the captain role twice in a span of one-year. Kohli on the other hand after giving away his captaincy responsibilities has been fairly impressive across formats.
Kohli in the last decade or so has dominated world cricket and Babar Azam has a huge job in hand if he wants to enter into the elite list. Former Pakistan stars in Zaheer Abbas and Mudassar Nazar have echoed the same thought and feels that the comparisons between the two cricketing stars as 'pointless' pointing out the 'hell of a difference' when it comes to stature.
Ex star all-rounder Mudassar Nazar said that Virat has already established himself as one of the greats of the game, while Babar still has to make a name for himself to be considered great.
"I mean, there is a hell of a difference between the two players. Virat will be remembered as one of the greatest who has graced the game. Babar has still got to make a name for himself," Nazar told PTI.
Zaheer Abbas, one of Pakistan's greatest ever batsman didn't mince his words on Babar. He felt that if the star player of the team is not scoring runs then there is no place for him in the team.
"He (Babar Azam) should be dropped from the team if he's not scoring runs. He's our main batsman. If he's out of form, he should be out of the team," he told.
As far as comparisons with Kohli is concerned, he sets the record straight and asserted that the comparison doesn't make any sense and the one who scores runs should be considered bigger and Babar is not one of them.
"The comparisons are pointless. Virat Kohli scores in every match, the other player (Babar) doesn't score in any match, so then how can you compare? The person who scores, he is the bigger player," Abbas told as quoted by multiple outlets.
Babar Azam is presently going through a turbulent time due to the collective performance of his team and himself, specially the 2-0 whitewash on the hands of the Bangladeshis at home in a Test series. Kohli, after winning the T20 World Cup had a poor ODI series against Sri Lanka and an average Test series against Bangladesh, where the Rohit Sharma-led side won 2-0.
