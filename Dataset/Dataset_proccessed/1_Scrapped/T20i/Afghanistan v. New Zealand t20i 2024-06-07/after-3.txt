Right then, that's all from this game, where Afghanistan registered a statement win and are sitting pretty at the top of the Group C standings. As far as New Zealand are concerned, their NRR has taken a big hit early in the tournament and will now face the West Indies up next in a crucial encounter. Meanwhile, over in Dallas, two Asian rivals, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, are currently locking horns. It is shaping up to be yet another entertaining game. You can switch tabs and enjoy the coverage of that game. Cheers!

!

Rashid Khan, the skipper of Afghanistan says it is one of the greatest performances from them in T20 against a world-class team. Adds the openers started well, they didn't throw the wicket away and that was the time they did well to take the game deep. Shares at the halfway mark, they had set batters in so the talk was to play the natural, positive game and avoid more dot balls in the next 10 overs. Tells with the bowling unit they have, a par score is enough as all the bowlers used their skill to put pressure on the opposition. Reckons the effort was there right from the start, they way Gurbaz and Zadran opened, it gave them a lot of energy. Appreciates the way Farooqi bowled, but mentions there is room for improvement.

!

The captain of New Zealand, Kane Williamson starts by congratulating Afghanistan for the win. Adds that the opposition outplayed them in all facets of the game. Feels that their batters played beautifully on a tricky surface. States that they will review this loss and need to move on quickly as games continue to come thick and fast in the tournament. Tells that the most frustrating part was their fielding in the first 10 overs where they could not convert their chances. Further says that facing West Indies in the next game is a big challenge and his side knows that they can play better than this.

!

Rahmanullah Gurbaz is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his brilliant knock of 80 runs from 56 balls. He says they have been waiting for this victory for the last three years, they had the belief right from the start of the tournament. Tells he was frustrated with the way he started with the bat, the wicket was not easy but Ibrahim Zadran and Azmatullah Omarzai played well and eventually, the bowlers did the job. Mentions they were hoping for a score around 130-140. Shares the conversation is good between him and Zadran which helps them a lot. Reckons the management always says to be active and encourage the bowlers and keep high energy in the field.

!

Time for the presentation ceremony...

!

Earlier in the game, after being inserted into bat, Afghanistan were off to a brisk start. Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran got early boundaries away and put New Zealand under pressure. The Kiwis, showing signs of rustiness from not having played together for some time, were erratic in the field and failed to capitalise on their opportunities. The Afghan opening pair slowed up a bit after the Powerplay before putting the foot on the pedal from the halfway mark. After Azmatullah Omarzai fell following a quickfire knock, Gurbaz struggled to find support from the other end and eventually got out for 80. As a result, Afghanistan had to be content with 159 on the board. Mitchell Santner was New Zealand's most economical bowler but went wicketless. While Matt Henry was expensive, Trent Boult and Lockie Ferguson stepped up in the pace department.

!

As for New Zealand, they never truly seemed up for the challenge, which is uncharacteristic for the Kiwis. Whether with the ball, in the field, or with the bat, their struggles due to the lack of game time as a unit were evident. In New Zealand's pursuit of 160 runs, they were rocked early, losing both openers inside the first three overs. Daryl Mitchell and Kane Williamson too looked out of sorts and could not have any sort of an impact. It went from bad to worse for the Kiwis as wickets kept tumbling as their batters failed Afghanistan's trial by spin. In the blink of an eye, New Zealand were shut out for just 75, the fourth lowest total in their T20I history.

!

HISTORY CREATED IN GUYANA! Afghanistan have absolutely outplayed and outclassed the Kiwis to hand them a humbling defeat, and by doing so, they have made it two wins out of two in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, 2024. While not necessarily an upset given Afghanistan's rise, this is certainly a night to savour for the Asian side. They not only defeated New Zealand for the first time in T20Is but did so emphatically. Despite the century-opening stand, Afghanistan couldn't rest easy with their total and had to be precise with the ball. Fazalhaq Farooqi set the tone by taking three wickets in his opening spell, continuing his form from the game against Uganda. Rashid Khan struck with the first ball of the night and, along with Mohammad Nabi, spun a web around the Kiwi batters. The spin twins took the game by the scruff of the neck and never allowed the opposition to breathe easy, The man who started it all, Farooqi completed the formalities to end with four wickets on the night. Rashid Khan also had four wickets to his name while Mohammad Nabi took 2 scalps.
