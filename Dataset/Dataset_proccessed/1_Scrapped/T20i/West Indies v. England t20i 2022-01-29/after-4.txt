Over by Over
Right then! That concludes the proceedings for the fourth T20I. One game to go in the series. The fifth and final game will be played on the 31st of January at 1.30 am IST (8 pm GMT, Previous Day). The build-up will begin much in advance. Do join us for that. Until then, take care and goodbye!
Moeen Ali, the victorious skipper and the Man of the Match, says, there were occasions when they batted well. This is what they exactly wanted, to keep scoring under pressure. Mentions he is happy to share for the team and hopes to get off the mark the same way in the next game. Adds, Adil is getting better as he is getting older. He is a crucial player in the side. Mentions, Rashid is difficult to read and thankfully he was able to get rid of Powell. Adds that the death bowling was fantastic and the bowlers stuck to the basic plan.
Kieron Pollard, the skipper of West Indies, is in for a chat. He says that it was the game of two halves, it didn't spin that much in the first innings. Also, Drakes was a bit unlucky as a couple of edges came off his bowling, he would have probably gone for fewer runs. Mentions that, the nature of a T20 game is that it takes only six balls to change the game. Says that they were slow in the middle while batting and could improve upon. Adds that Adil Rashid has been exceptional and says that tomorrow is going to be a good game.
Stay tuned for the presentation...
Earlier in the innings, England started off well with the blade and Ali made sure the end was fiery as well. This allowed them to cross the 190-run mark. Thanks to a fantastic knock by Ali. West Indies with the reply could not keep with the pressure that was built by the spinners. Eventually, they lost track and came out on the losing end.
What a comeback by England. This is the second time they are coming back from behind in this series. They gave away some runs at the start, but once the spin-trio comes into the middle, runs came in at a slow rate for West Indies. Also, the first four wickets came through the spinners. Moeen Ali was the pick of the bowlers with 2 wickets. In the death over Topley got one as well. The spin did the trick for the visitors.
It looked like West Indies ran into a brick wall. Their opening pair started off nicely with Mayers being the aggressor. The pair had notched up 56 runs in the Powerplay, but in the next 4 overs, they only scored 20 runs and lost 2 wickets as well. There was a period when the West Indies innings had a boundary draught. Enough batters got starts but could not make it count in the end.
A clinical performance by England with the ball. They never let West Indies get ahead in the game. Ali has led his side over the victory line here. West Indies lost their track in the middle overs.
