No young players again. Youths did well in the trails yet can't get a look. No progress when the WI teams are struggling. Only the capt an maybe C Holder in this group can make a WI team. What does that tell you about Barbados continued poor selection policy.

Interesting too see Ramon Simmonds at least as a reserve. In the local U19 tournament prior to the last WC he looked the most impressive and quickest of the young pacers. Even more impressive than Seales.

There was warm up series against Sri Lanka (I think) and Simmonds looked way below top form & pace whilst of course Seales started to look really good. Despite this he went to the WC and again looked flat & below par.

I gather he looked sharp & impressive in the trial game (the 2nd trial game was cancelled) and of course has been at least partially rewarded.

I liked the look of him (at his best) and I hope he continues to regain form, confidence & pace etc…always like a good lefty.

Springs was injured, he was one of the bright spots with bat and ball in the trial match, and against England and the West Indies.

I hope this guy springer performs I always like him
He was one of the main players 2016 youth world cup win since then his development has been very disappointing I know he suffered injuries I am also disappointing to see the name of Carter time to move to some younger players, Guyana is the worst with that

Greaves made that team?

I am glad to see Nurse is not part of that 4-day team.
These guys have played very little cricket in the last year, since the last regionals, one trial match and two T20 matches.
I am following a practice match now.
Kraigg's X1 53-1 at lunch vs Carter X1.

Demetrius Richards should have been given a look to get some experience.

At least Simmonds is in the reserves but the same recycled batting.

With very little cricket being played at home, it is hard for me to have issue with the players selected.
Carter may be there for experience, especially with the test series coming and Kraigg will not be available to Barbados.

I totally agreed with your comments, The only players I would have included is the twin spinners of Boyce and Bishop. The next 2 years they should be many changes.

Almost all the players are experienced. Only Jonathan Drakes and Shamar Springer are probably under 25 years old.
Even those two have played on this level before. They need to be some younger players included to get some experience.
Guess there is no young batting talent in Bim.

How many players on the team have 3-4 years regional experience?
The experience players on the team are, Kraigg, Carter, Reifer and Warrican.

Is Dominic Drakes related to Jonathan Drakes?
