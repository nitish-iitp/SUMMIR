Jason Holder took four wickets in four balls to consign England to a 17-run defeat in the fifth and deciding T20I at Kensington Oval on Sunday.

Chasing 180 for victory and requiring 20 off the last over, England batters Sam Billings, Chris Jordan, and Adil Rashid were all caught before Holder bowled Saqib Mahmood to win the match and the series for the West Indies.

Akeal Hosein took 4 for 30 to reduce England to 119 for 6 before Billings (41) kept the visitors briefly in the hunt.

Earlier, Rovman Powell (35 not out) and Kieron Pollard (41 not out) fired West Indies to 179 for 4.

West Indies took the T20I series 3-2 and will next face England in a three-Test series in March.

Holder said after the game that he was pumped up playing in front of his home crowd.

"I love playing at Kensington Oval. We have the best fans in the world. Want to thank the England fans as well for coming out. The atmosphere is electrifying," Holder said.

The Barbadian all-rounder was named Players of the Series and revealed he still has many areas in his game he would like to improve on.

"An area I need to improve is my death bowling and variations. I'm improving in the nets, and the captain has the confidence in me. That does a lot for my confidence. People are seeing what I can do and giving me the responsibility. I feel really good about my role, I'll pass on the peripheral noise," said Holder.

West Indies skipper Kieron Pollard praised the work of his team to claim victory in the T20I series.

"Every time we won a game there was something against us but we came out and rallied. Empty vessels make the most noise. The guys have worked tirelessly after coming from Jamaica, and we've bounced back pretty well. We understand what we want to do as a team, and we saw the results tonight," said Pollard.

England stand-in skipper Moeen Ali was gracious in defeat.

"I thought West Indies were the better team and overall we didn't adapt that well, but we played some good cricket and it was a very good series," said Moeen.

Holder was the fourth man in history to take four wickets in four balls in men's T20I.

Summarized scores: West Indies 179/4 in 20 overs (Pollard 41, Rashin 2/17, Livingstone 2/17) vs England 162 in 19.5 overs (Vince 55, Holder 5/27, Hosein 4/30). West Indies won by 17 runs
