The first ODI of the three-match ODI series between Ireland and South Africa will be played on June 11 at Castle Avenue in Dublin. Prior to the ODI series, the two teams locked horns against each other in a three-match T20I series, which South Africa won 2-1.

This ODI series will be a part of the 2022-25 cycle of ICC Women’s Championship (IWC). Only the top six teams from the 10-team IWC will qualify for the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup in 2025. Therefore, this ODI series will be equally important for both the teams.
