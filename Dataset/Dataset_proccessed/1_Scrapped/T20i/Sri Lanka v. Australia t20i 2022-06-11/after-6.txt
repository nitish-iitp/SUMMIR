Sri Lanka vs Australia 3rd T20I Highlights: Dasun Shanaka smashed 54 off 25 deliveries to help Sri Lanka register a thrilling win in the third and final T20I against Australia. Albeit a consolation, with Australia taking the series 2-1, the win came in unlikely circumstances, with the hosts down to 108/6 in the 16th over. However, Shanaka's blitzkrieg saw them score 69 runs in the last 25 deliveries to chase down the 177-run target and snatch a win from the jaws of defeat. For Australia, David Warner had a 43-run stand with skipper Aaron Finch (29) and then a 42-run stand with Glenn Maxwell, but then Sri Lanka got three wickets in three deliveries, with Maxwell falling for 16 off 9, Warner for 39 off 33 and Josh Inglis for a first-ball duck. However, Marcus Stoinis then hit 38 off 23 deliveries to get the visitors' innings back on track. Even as he fell in the 16th over, Steve Smith's 27-ball 37 and Matthew Wade's 13 off 8 helped power Australia to 176/5. For Sri Lanka, Maheesh Theekshana picked two wickets, while Wanindu Hasaranga and Praveen Jayawickrama claimed one scalp apiece. Australia came into the match with a 2-0 series lead. (Live Scorecard)

Aaron Finch has been handed the trophy, he collects it and hands it to his team. They all celebrate the series' victory. Right then! that is all we have from this exciting game and the T20I series as well. We now move to the ODI series. The first ODI is all set to begin on Tuesday 14th June 2022 at 2 pm IST (8:30 am GMT). But as you all know our build-up will begin in advance. So do join us then. For now, goodbye and take care!

!

Aaron Finch the captain of Australia is named Player of the Series! He says they have a lot of bases covered. It was an unbelievable knock by Dasun Shanaka. Shares that the pitch slowed up after their innings, but he feels the toss doesn't make much difference. Mentions that in the past year they didn't have had a full quota of the squad to pick up but they are really comfortable with the depth of their team.

!

Dasun Shanaka the skipper of Sri Lanka is the Man of the Match. He says at the initial moments he wanted to take some balls and read the wicket and just make sure he doesn't throw it away. Adds that toss is always important and Australia took a brave decision to bat first and he feels it is not best to bat first in the Asian conditions. Shares that he told the boys that momentum is important and they are on the right path. Tells that it was crucial to get some runs, the previous tour was not good enough but he feels better after this series.

!

Stay tuned for the presentation...

!

Earlier in the match, Australia put up a fighting total of 176 on this slow wicket. They were clinical with the bat and it was a combined effort from their batters. David Warner and Aaron Finch dominated the Powerplay. Marcus Stoinis controlled the middle phase and Steven Smith and Matthew Wade finished things off nicely for them. They were probably the happier side after the first innings. Australia started the second innings on the right foot, dominated the middle phase but lost their way in the end. For Sri Lanka the bowlers failed to step up, but the batters got the job done. Mainly, it was Dasun Shanaka for Sri Lanka. Australia are the deserving winners of the T20I series, but Sri Lanka have done well to avoid a whitewash at home.

!

Coming into bat for the chase, Sri Lanka did get off to a pretty good start. They lost Danushka Gunathilaka early, but Pathum Nissanka and Charith Asalanka put up a score of 49 at the end of the Powerplay. Post that, Sri Lanka lost wickets at regular intervals. Australian bowlers controlled the middle phase and capitalized well. They had the momentum till the 16th over but they lost their way after that. They had absolutely no answers to the brutal hitting displayed by Dasun Shanaka. Sri Lanka scored over 65 runs in the last three overs. Dasun Shanaka was definitely the main architect of this chase. He scored an unbeaten 54 off 25 balls and guided his side to victory. Australia's best bowler, Josh Hazlewood was also taken to the cleaners towards the end. Ashton Agar though was exceptional he grabbed a wicket and gave away only 23 runs in his spell. They would be disappointed with leaking runs in the slog overs.

!

SRI LANKA WIN! Yes, you read that right! Who would have thought? Dasun Shanaka has played an absolute blinder here and has given the people of his country a lot to smile about! Take a bow, Dasun Shanaka. A true captain's knock. Australia might have won the series, but Sri Lanka have won the final game and have gained much-needed confidence before the ODI series.
