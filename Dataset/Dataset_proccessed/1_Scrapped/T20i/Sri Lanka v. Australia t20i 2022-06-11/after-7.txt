After losing the first two T20Is of the series, Sri Lanka look to salvage some pride as they take on Australia in the 3rd and final T20I of the series at Pallekele on Saturday.
After losing the opening T20I by 10 wickets, Sri Lanka did put in a better show in the second but couldn't prevent the Aussies from claiming a win by 3 wickets.
Sri Lanka were dismissed for a paltry score of 124 in the second T20I but their bowlers did well in keeping the team in the game for a long period. The hosts would look to build on that performance to win at least one match in the series.
My Dream11 for SL vs AUS 3rd T20I:
Matthew Wade, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Kusal Mendis, David Warner (c), Aaron Finch, Pathum Nissanka, Charith Asalanka (vc), Wanindu Hasaranga, Josh Hazlewood, Kane Richardson, Jhye Richardson
Sri Lanka likely playing 11:
Pathum Nissanka, Danushka Gunathilaka, Charith Asalanka, Kusal Mendis (wk), Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Dasun Shanaka (c), Wanindu Hasaranga, Chamika Karunaratne, Dushmantha Chameera, Maheesh Theekshana, Nuwan Thushara
Australia likely playing 11:
Aaron Finch (c), David Warner, Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Steven Smith, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade (wk), Ashton Agar, Jhye Richardson, Kane Richardson, Josh Hazlewood
Squads:
Sri Lanka: Pathum Nissanka, Danushka Gunathilaka, Charith Asalanka, Kusal Mendis(w), Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Dasun Shanaka(c), Wanindu Hasaranga, Chamika Karunaratne, Dushmantha Chameera, Maheesh Theekshana, Nuwan Thushara, Matheesha Pathirana, Nuwanidu Fernando, Praveen Jayawickrama, Lakshan Sandakan, Kasun Rajitha, Ramesh Mendis, Lahiru Madushanka
