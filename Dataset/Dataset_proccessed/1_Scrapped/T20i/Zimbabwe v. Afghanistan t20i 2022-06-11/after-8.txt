We are back for the chase! The umpires are out in the middle and so are the players of Zimbabwe. Hazratullah Zazai and Rahmanullah Gurbaz are ready to open the innings for Afghanistan. Tendai Chatara to start proceedings with the ball here.

!

... The Run Chase ...

!

Right then, 158 is the par score on this ground batting first and Zimbabwe have just about managed to surpass it. The wicket is good but the ball is holding a bit in the surface. Given the destructive batting lineup of Afghanistan, they should be able to get the win here but if the hosts bowl and field well then who knows what might happen. Stay tuned for the run chase.

!

Afghanistan skipper, Mohammad Nabi is up for a quick chat. He says it is a decent pitch for batting. Mentions it is good total but is confident that his side could chase it down. Further adds he is happy with the performance of Nijat, they got him into the side for the World Cup preparation.

!

Afghanistan will be happier of the two sides going into the break but they have lost a bit of momentum in the last couple of overs, which might just make a difference when they come out to bat. The debutant Nijat Masood was the pick of the bowlers, picking up three wickets whereas Faroozi and Rashid were economical as always. The visitors' fielding was on point as they inflicted a couple of sensational run-outs at crucial stages of the innings and will be looking to chase down this total.

!

In the end, Zimbabwe have got to a defendable total, all thanks to a bit of a blitz from the ever-dependable Sikandar Raza. The hosts lost Innocent Kaia early in the innings but both Wesley Madhevere and Craig Ervine were timing the ball sweetly. The issue with their innings was the regular loss of wickets and the hosts just couldn't get a substantial stand to take them to a big score. But cameos from Regis Chakabva and Raza have given them a good chance in the game and it will now depend on how they bowl.
