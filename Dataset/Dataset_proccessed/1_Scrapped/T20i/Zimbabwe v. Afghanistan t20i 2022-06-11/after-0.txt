Defending champions Barbados remained on course for a successful defence, thrashing Windward Islands by 10 wickets on Saturday as Round Three action commenced in the Cricket West Indies CG United Women’s T20 Blaze.

Playing at the National Stadium, Providence, Barbados restricted the Windward Islands to 87-6 and then raced to a commanding victory in just 11.3 overs.

The win was the Bajans’ third in as many games in the tournament, and they sit top of the table with a healthy net run rate.

Openers Hayley Matthews and Kycia Knight knocked off the target with ease, handing Windward Islands their second defeat in three games.

Matthews continued her fine form with 41 not out off 34 (4x4s), while Knight was unbeaten on 32 off 35 (2x4s, 1×6).

Earlier, Shanika Bruce took 3-13 and Aaliyah Alleyne 2-6 as Windward Islands were kept to 87-6 after Barbados opted to bowl first.

Afy Fletcher and Zaida James provided the substance to Windwards innings with a second wicket partnership of 64, as extras were a healthy 28.

Fletcher topscored with 30 off 46 (1×4), while James made 23 off 40 (2x4s).

Round Three continues on Saturday with Guyana and Jamaica going head to head from 14:30h and Trinidad and Tobago and the Leeward Islands facing off from 19:00h.

All matches are being played at the National Stadium, Providence.
