India vs New Zealand 2nd T20I Highlights: New Zealand managed to drag the match down to the second last ball despite the fact that they were defending just 100 runs. 
India vs New Zealand 2nd T20I Highlights

India vs New Zealand 2nd T20I Highlights: If India were trapped in New Zealand's spin trap in the first T20I, they returned the favour in Lucknow. Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Washington Sundar and Deepak Hooda have all struck to leave New Zealand at 48/4 at the end of the first 10 overs. New Zealand were eventually restricted to a score of 99/8 but the Kiwis then made sure that India had anything but an easy chase in their hands. They punished the hosts for every small mistake they made running between the wickets and it was only Suryakumar Yadav's four off the fifth ball of the 20th over that took India to victory.

IND vs NZ 2nd T20I Live score: Suryakumar wins it for India! The hosts win by six wickets

Suryakumar whips it over the infield and sends it down the ground for four to win the game for India. Take a bow New Zealand, they have taken this game down to the second last ball of the match despite the fact that they were defending just 100 runs. Not often you get to see a T20 match as low scoring as this get such a dramatic ending but here we are! Just three players did not bowl for New Zealand as Mitchell Santner extracted as much spin as he could from his squad.

IND vs NZ 2nd T20I Live score: DROPPED!

The second ball is a dot, India need 5 to win off 4. Then the third is smashed right back to Tickner by Suryakumar, it wasn't much of a chance but at this stage, they all count. India take a single, need 4 to win off 3.

IND vs NZ Live score: India need 6 runs to win in last over

Blair Tickner bowling the last over, Hardik Pandya on strike. That four has helped India a great deal but who would have thought this match would come down to the last over. This match belongs in a different era of T20 cricket.

India vs New Zealand Live score: FOUR! That's an actual boundary!

A fantastic 19th over from Lockie Ferguson spoiled as Pandya latches on to a straightish delivery and pulls it away square to the boundary. India need 7 off 7!

India vs New Zealand 2nd T20I Live score: India 13 to win off 12 balls

Well there is a biggish discussion here between the New Zealand players. India seem to have sort of dug themselves into a hole here. All of a sudden, the runs needed are more than the balls left. 

Jan 29, 2023 10:12 PM IST
IND vs NZ 2nd T20I Live score: Into the last four overs, India 77/4

The fact that this chase has gone into the last four overs shows just how difficult this pitch has been for batters and just how resilient New Zealand have been. SKY is on 16 off 24 balls, if anything he has got a chance to show that he has the temperament to play the longer formats, while Pandya is on 2 off 4. They need 23 to win off 24. They have taken it as slow as slow innings can get.

IND vs NZ Live score: OUT! Mix-up and Washington Sundar pays

Well that is just ridiculous from Suryakumar Yadav. Loud appeal for LBW against him and he just sets off, ignoring all the calls of "No" from Washington Sundar and insisting that the latter should set off. In the end, both batters end up at the same end and Sundar just steps forward a little bit to sacrifice his wicket. That one is on SKY. There was no need for a single there and Sundar was very quick to ask him to go back. 

Sundar run out (Tickner) 10 (9), India 70/4 in 14.3 overs

Jan 29, 2023 9:46 PM IST
India vs New Zealand Live score: FOUR! India 55/3 in 11.2 overs

Washington Sundar has walked in ahead of Hardik Pandya and he hits a straight and full delivery from Phillips past short fine leg for a boundary.

India vs New Zealand 2nd T20I Live score: OUT! India lose a third

Rahul Tripathi goes for a big sweep after two dot balls off Sodhi, Phillips runs to his right at deep midwicket and pouches the ball. 

Tripathi c Phillips b Sodhi 13 (18), India 50/3 in 10.4 overs

IND vs NZ 2nd T20I Live score: GONE! A run out ends Kishan's stay

Oh a run out and a wicket from nowhere for New Zealand. Kishan tried running a second but bowler Phillips runs after the ball and sends it to Santner standing right at the stumps. Replays show that Kishan couldn't quite get anything behind the stumps. New Zealand are up against it here but they never give up in the field.
