India vs England Commentary
8:26 PM IST Right then, it's the two unbeaten teams that will lock horns in the grand finale. Incidentally, it is the first time South Africa will be playing in the final and their best finish came in 2014 when they lost to India in the semis. India on the other hand are also back in the final for the first time since 2014 and that makes for an even fiestier contest. The Men's T20 World Cup Final, 2024 will be played at the Kensington Oval in Barbados between South Africa and India on Saturday, 29 June and there will be a reserve day in place if rain tries to play spoilsport. That game will begin at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT) but you can join us a lot sooner for the build-up of that massive clash. Until then, take care and goodbye!
8:24 PM IST The captain of India, Rohit Sharma says that it is a very satisfying win. Mentions that everybody worked really hard and it was a great effort. Feels that the team adapted to the conditions really well and it has been their success story. Adds that if you play the conditions well, things fall into place for you. Shares that at one stage during their batting effort, they thought 140-150 would have been enough but as the runs started to flow, they thought that they needed 20-30 runs more. Mentions that the bowlers were fantastic and the spinners knew what to do and how to execute. Further says that the talk at the halfway mark was to try to keep the stumps into play as much as possible. On Virat Kohli's form, he replies that the form of Kohli is never a problem and jokingly says that he might be saving it for the final. Ends by saying that staying calm helps you in making big decisions and it will be key for them in the final.
8:20 PM IST Jos Buttler, the captain of England says that India certainly puyplayed them and feels they let India get 20 runs or so more but they were outplayed to be honest. Adds that a couple of years on from that victory (the semifinal win in Adelaide),  the conditions were different and India deserved to win. Mentions that with the rain around, they felt conditions wouldn't change much and they didn't and it's just that India bowled really well. Adds that India have fantastic spinners and even their two spinnes bowled well and could have bowled Moeen Ali in the first innings. Adds that given how the tournament has panned out, you can only play who's in front of you and have played good cricket in patches.
8:19 PM IST Axar Patel is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his superb all-round performance. He says that he likes to bowl in the Powerplay and with the ball stopping in the surface, he just had to bowl in good areas and not try too much. He says that since the wicket was slower, it was important for him to keep it slow as the quicker balls were easier to hit. Shares that the feedback from the batters was that the surface was not easy to hit the big shots. Further says that the partnership between Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav was magnificent. Says that he will celebrate this award first and he is not thinking about the final at the moment.
8:18 PM IST The Presentation ceremony...
8:17 PM IST Earlier in the day, the players were greeted by torrential rain in Guyana and we had a fairly delayed start. After being inserted into bat by Jos Buttler, India lost Virat Kohli early yet again but skipper Rohit Sharma kept on pressing and after getting a couple of streaky boundaries away, Rohit started to find his rhythm. Along with Suryakumar Yadav, Rohit managed to keep the English spinners at bay and that run rate started to rise as well. However, England did come back with the ball and it required a couple of cameos from the likes of Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja that took India over the 170-run mark. For England, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone bowled well and were economical whereas the pacers were erratic and predictable with their slower balls. They did a decent job of closing out the innings but it wasn't enough.
