India (IND) vs England (ENG) Highlights, T20 World Cup 2024 Semi-final: India beat England by 68 runs in the final of the T20 World Cup 2024. The Rohit Sharma-led side scored 171/7 after batting first and later bundled out England for just 103.
India vs England

Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the T20 World Cup semi-final between India and England.

India are once again in a T20 World Cup semi-final. The last time they were there, India were hammered by England by 10 wickets in Adelaide. Rohit Sharma's men have an opportunity to avenge that defeat as they will be facing England. The weather has cleared up and England have opted to bowl. Both teams are unchanged. Keep in mind, there is no reserve day for today's game. There is an additional 250 minutes for the game to be completed. If rain abandons the game or forces a no-result, India will qualify for the final as they had more wins than England in the Super 8 stage.

That's it from us in India Today for this game. Catch you people for the final of the T20 World Cup 2024 between India and South Africa.

Virat Kohli saving strength for final: Rohit Sharma

Very satisfying to win this game. We worked really hard as a unit. To win this game like that was a great effort from everyone. We adapted to the conditions really well. It was a challenge and we adapted. We played the conditions really well. If the players play according to the conditions, things falls in place. Very pleasing with how we came through. At one stage, 1450-150, as the game went on, after that partnership, we said another 25 runs. I can set the target in my mind, but I don't want to let anyone know about it, to the batters. They are all instinctive players. I thought 170 was a very good surface. They (Axar and Kuldeep) are gun spinners. It's difficult to play some shots, the pressure is on them as well but they were calm and knew what to bowl.

He (Kohli) is a quality player. Any player can go through that. We understand his class and his importance. Form is never a problem. The intent is there. Absolutely (backing Kohli for the final). We have been very calm as a team. We understand the occasion (final). Staying composed helps you make good decisions. That'll help us making the game through. You got to play good cricket. That's what we want to do in the final.

England captain Jos Buttler speaks

India certainly outplayed us. We let them get 20-25 runs too many. It was a challenging surface, they played well on. They fully deserved this win. Very different conditions (than 2022), credit to India. They played a very good game of cricket. With the rain around, didn't expect the conditions to change too much. Don't think it really did. They outbowled us. They had an above-par score. Don;t think toss was necessarily the difference between the teams. They've got some fantastic spinners. In hindsight, should have bowled Moeen in that innings with the way spin was bowling. We are really proud of everyone's effort. We stuck together, came up short when it mattered the most.

Axar Patel speaks

I have bowled in the powerplay in the past, so I had to bowl in the powerplay, that was the plan. The wicket was stopping and keeping low, so tried to bowl in the right areas. The wicket was slow, so I tried to bowl slower in this match, it worked for me. Wouldn't have worked had I bowled quicker, would have been easier for their batters. Our batters told us that the wicket wasn't easy, so 160 was a good total according to us. That partnership (between Rohit and SKY) was magnificent, they scored the occasional boundaries and rotated the strike. Not thinking about Barbados at the moment, will celebrate this player of the match award first.

T20 World Cup: India storm into final, blow away clueless England in perfect payback

IND vs ENG: A tale of complete domination

Rohit Sharma's India put in a superb performance with the bat after losing the toss. India put up a strong 172-run total which gave them massive confidence midway through the innings. Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav were the main stars of the batting effort, while others played superb supporting roles.

In the bowling front, India were unplayable after the first couple of overs as Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel ruled the roost. Axar won the player of the match award for his 4-0-23-3 in Guyana.

India bowl out England in just 16.4 overs

India have hammered England to exact a perfect revenge of the 2022 T20 World Cup. Jasprit Bumrah traps Jofra Archer in front of the wicket to complete the demolition job.

India are in the finals of the T20 World Cup 2024 and they will play against South Africa for the title.

Direct Hit and Rashid Departs

England are falling apart right now. After silly dismissals, there are two back to back run-outs for England. Adil Rashid gets run-out by Suryakumar Yadav. India have been brilliant in all three departments today and England lose their ninth wicket.

Awful confusion and Livingstone is gone

Liam Livingstone has been run out in the 15th over. Jofra Archer gets an underage from Axar's good length ball. Livingstone storms out for a run as the ball rolls down to short-fine leg. It is Livingstone's call from the non-striker end, but Jofra Archer is ball watching and sends him back.

Livingstone gets caught in the confusion and gets run out in the non-striker's end while returning back.

Kuldeep completes a sensational spell

Left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav completes a riveting spell of 4-0-19-3 in the semi-final of the T20 World Cup 2024. Remember, he did not play a single match in the group-stage of the tournament, but the Indian management stressed that he was carried for a reason. Kuldeep has already taken 10 wickets from 4 matches and is in terrific form ahead of the assured final's spot.

3 for Kuldeep now

Kuldeep Yadav traps Chris Jordan in front of the stumps and claims a simple LBW dismissal. England have lost their 7th wicket now.

Bowled 'em around the legs

A premeditated reverse-sweep from Harry Brook and Kuldeep Yadav has crashed into the stumps of Brook. He got hit for a boundary in the previous ball and this time around, Kuldeep straightens his line much more. England lose their sixth wicket and this seems like a done deal.

India heavily dominate in first 10 overs

India are all over England at the 10th over mark in the semi-final of the T20 World Cup 2024. England have lost 5 wickets with Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel dominating the proceedings. England have been reeling under so much pressure that several wickets have looked like brain-fade moments.

Here's the dismissal of Moeen Ali that would portray an accurate picture of how the match is going on.

Five wickets down for England

England are on the verge of a collapse in Guyana. They lose their 5th wicket inside the first 10 overs of the match. Googly from Kuldeep Yadav against Sam Curran. Curran fails to read the ball and it smashes into his pads. The umpire has no hesitation and gives it out. Curran takes a review but the third umpire says that it is three reds.

3 for Axar Patel

Third first ball strike for Axar Patel and this one is a shocker. Axar bowls a fairly normal delivery. The ball hits Moeen's pads and rolls it towards Pant. Moeen, for some inexplicable reason, tries to get out of his crease and Rishabh Pant picks the balls up and breaks the stumps.

Maybe Moeen was not sure about where the ball was going, but what we are sure of is that this was a proper brain-fade moment for the English all-rounder.

England 39/3 in the powerplay

A successful powerplay from the Indian team as the not only keep the runs in check but also pick 3 wickets. Axar Patel is the star of the show with two wickets of Buttler and Bairstow and Bumrah supports him well removing the dangerous Phil Salt.

AXAR STRIKES AGAIN

Axar Patel strikes once again. Two first ball strikes for Axar Patel in back to back overs. Bowls it slower through the air. The ball grips on the surface and turns. Bairstow is completely outfoxed and gets bowled out.

England are in huge trouble.
