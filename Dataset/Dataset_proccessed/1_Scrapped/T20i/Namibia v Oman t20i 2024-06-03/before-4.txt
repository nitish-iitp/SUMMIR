Big big match at the Mecca tonite - Namibia vs Oman
 
Narper 2024-06-02 21:57:32 

Namibia vs Oman



Where: Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados

What to expect:
Kensington Oval has heavily favoured teams batting first in T20Is, only 7 of 23 chases successful despite a modest average first innings score of 156. Should be said that only seven of those games were under lights, though the trend holds true, and any dew factor is likely to be moot given the passing thunderstorms expected to roll through.

Expect capacity attendance at the first match at the newly renovated stadium complete with more lights and ice baths .

All kicks aside, all the best to everyone involved. Hoping for great and thrilling entertainment to celebrate the renovated stadium’s inaugural match.

The Barbados pitch does not look in great shape for the first game of the tournament, it looks very dry. I thought it was raining in B/dos recently.

Rubbish wicket for t20.

 
Drapsey 2024-06-03 02:34:36 


Namibia in no hurry at all to get to the 110 needed to win the game.

 
JOJO 2024-06-03 03:58:21 

This is some weird cricket.

South Africa 2 beats Oman in a superover

Cracking low scorer in the end.

South Africa 2? So where the players of African descent aka the black players?

In reply to analyst-kid

I asked this question during the last World Cup.
This year even less black players on the team. There are seven SA born players on the Namibian team. I will recount the responses from the apologist posters; “The population too small “, “black Namimbians prefer football “.

Yuh know...I did not realize the makeup of the Namibian team was mostly South Africans. I was wondering if Namibia was mostly white people when I turned on the game

 
SnoopDog 2024-06-03 13:23:42 

In reply to ray

Namibia has a sizeable White population. They also consider themselves as "Afrikaans" like the Whites of South Africa and Zimbabwe.

I remember all their previous WC ODI teams to be comprised of mostly Whites.

A lot of people were killed in Namibia about a century ago, the Black population is still recovering from that genocide. However I was disappointed with the state of the Barbados pitch, it would not have been okay for a first day of a Test match, much less a T20 international, unpredictable bounce, the last ball of the match caused the super over because of the unpredictable bounce.

 
Narper 2024-06-03 13:49:02 

OMAN 109 (19.4)

NAM 109/6 (20)

Match tied (Namibia won the super over)

 
Logic 2024-06-03 14:12:19 

I thought it was a decent crowd given the two teams on show and the bad weather during the day. But the pitch was disgraceful. Seems like the folks spent all the money prettying up the stands and neglected to check the readiness of the most important element of a cricket ground.

You watching the New York collapso? All the pitches so far are inconsistent and uncertain in bounce, grip and pace according to the commentators. There is little value for ground strokes on the grassy outfields. The pitches are sporting pitches only the skillful teams will survive.

 
dayne 2024-06-03 17:17:50 

Well, it is a surprise, but the Dallas pitch and the Guyana pitch have been the most consistent ones of the tournament so far
