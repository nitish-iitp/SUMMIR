Bangladesh vs Afghanistan, 1st T20I, Highlights: Nasum Ahmed claimed four wickets while Shoriful Islam took three as Bangladesh defeated Afghanistan by 61 runs in the first of a two-match T20I series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur on Thursday. Batting first, Bangladesh rode on a half-century from Liton Das to post a total of 155/8 after a poor start against Afghanistan. In replay, Afghanistan batters failed to rise to the occasion and got out tamely without troubling the opposition at all. Hosts Bangladesh had won the three-match ODI series that preceded the T20Is by a margin of 2-1. Earlier this week, Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Rashid Khan starred as Afghanistan defeated Bangladesh by seven wickets in the third one-day international to avoid a whitewash in the three-match ODI series on Monday.

That's a wrap to this game. There is one final T20I left in the series and it's on Saturday, 5th March 2022 at 2.30 pm IST (9 am GMT). Do join us in advance for all the action. Cheers!

!

Mahmudullah, the winning captain of Bangladesh, says that it was a very pleasing performance, the way they fought with the bat and ball and the energy was great. Mentions that it was a defendable total and his bowlers did a great job. He praises Nasum Ahmed for his spell and calls it a match-changing spell. Lauds the batting effort of Liton Das as well and says that once he gets going, he is very pleasing to the eyes. Tells that he is happy for his boys, it was an important win for them and hopes to turn up and win the next game as well.

!

NASUM AHMED (4-0-10-4) IS THE PLAYER OF THE MATCH! The spinner says that his target was to remain economical and pick wickets in the Powerplay and is delighted to deliver. Adds that the plan was to dry up the runs, create pressure and pick up the wickets.

!

Mohammad Nabi, the captain of Afghanistan, says that they bowled really well on this pitch and it was a chaseable target. Adds that they threw away too many wickets in the Powerplay and were under pressure as a batting group. Hopes to come back strongly in the next match.

!

Stay tuned for the presentation...

!

Bangladesh will be relieved. They have finally stopped their losing run of 8 matches with this win. The hosts ticked most of the boxes in the field but there is still a big room for improvement in their batting. Nasum Ahmed was an absolute star with the ball, claiming the first four wickets to fall, and he sucked the life out of Afghanistan's chase. The rest of the bowlers capitalized after that and it was a very meticulous and clinical show from them. This is their third-biggest win in terms of runs in T20Is.

!

A thumping win for Bangladesh! No one would have predicted that at the halfway mark when they managed an ordinary total on the board but the way the Bangla Tigers bowled in the Powerplay, especially Nasum Ahmed, completely took the wind out of the Afghan sails. It was a meek surrender from their batters and this defeat will hurt them badly.

OUT! Wicket number 8 goes down! The Fizz delivers his trademark slower one, at 113.3 kph, it's a bit short and around middle and off, Azmatullah Omarzai tries to heave it over the leg side but is way too early into his shot.
