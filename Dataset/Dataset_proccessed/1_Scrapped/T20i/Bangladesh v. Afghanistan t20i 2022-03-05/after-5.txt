COMMENTRY
Right then. That’s it from the coverage of this game and well, we conclude this series as well. The hosts won the ODI series, while they share the spoils in the T20I series. Hence, Mohammad Nabi and Mahmudullah get presented with the T20I trophy, as the series ended 1-1. Both the teams get together for a group picture with the trophy placed in front of them. This shows the real spirit of this game, to be honest. We will see Bangladesh soon in action as the squad will travel to South Africa for 3 ODIs and 2 Test matches. Afghanistan, on the flip side, have no fixtures announced yet and have ample time to work on the T20 World Cup later this year. They will certainly use this time to focus on developing their young players and increase their bench strength. Till then, please feel free to follow some rollicking Test matches happening across the globe and let us not forget about the ongoing Women's World Cup, 2022 which is being held in New Zealand. Until next time, take care and goodbye!
Mohammad Nabi, the victorious skipper, is in for a chat. He says, the boys played really well. As a bowling group and showed great effort in the field as well. Adds that in the first game they did not show up with the blade and this time around the boys made sure to work on the mistake. Says they are trying to strengthen their squad by getting young players on the bench and their development is the priority.
Fazalhaq Farooqi is adjudged as the MAN OF THE SERIES. He is in for a chat. First of all he starts by congratulating everyone back at home for this victory and is really happy to perform against such a talented side. Adds, they just wanted to try their best and did just that.
Azmatullah Omarzai wins the MAN OF THE MATCH AWARD for his incredible effort with the ball. He thanks the Almighty and says he is really happy to deliver for the side. Mentions, he tried to put pressure with the dot balls and thanks god for believing in him.
Mahmudullah, the skipper of Bangladesh, is in for a chat. He says, it was a good wicket to bat on and they failed to put on a good score on the board. Adds probably it was not a 150-run wicket but surely it was a 130-run wicket and was achievable. Says, he and Rahim tried to built a partnership and if they could’ve added a few more runs things could’ve been different. Says, the team needs to work on the fielding. Ends by saying, the team will play some series in June/ July to get them prepped up for the T20 World Cup.
Stay tuned for presentation...
Bangladesh have only themselves to blame for this loss. The hosts went into the chase looking for early wickets and well they manage to get one quickly. Although, they could've gotten two only if Nasum Ahmed was able to hold onto the catch of Hazratullah Zazai. Later, the bad form continued for Bangladesh in the field as they went on to drop a couple more catches. The trajectory of the game could've been different if those catches were taken. In the end, no bowler had a good day with the ball, as they leaked aplenty.
No hiccups for the visitors! Rahmanullah Gurbaz started off in a very hesitant manner. He was aggressive from the word go and lost his wicket pretty early on. Although, Hazratullah Zazai made the most of his reprieve and ended his innings with 59*, while Usman Ghani supported him really well in the middle. The pair stitched a 99-run stand for the second wicket and got their side closer to the finish line. In the end, Darwish Rasooli came in and applied the finising touches to get his side over the line and level the series.
What a top class performance by Afghanistan. First with the ball and later with the ball as well. After losing the first game by 61 runs, Afghanistan have comeback stronger and they have levelled the series with a win by a margin of 8 wickets. They will surely head back home with a smile across their faces. Bangladesh, on the other hand, did not have enough runs on the board and perhaps with some better fielding, things could've been different for the hosts.
