Sudan Hero... . . Sudan played a goalless draw against Ghana in Match day 3 of the 2025 AFCON qualifiers, which puts them in a good position to qualify for the AFCON. The hero of the game was goalkeeper Mohamed Mustafa, who made several World Class saves to keep the game tie. This solidifies his role in Sudan's campaign, keeping 3 cleansheets in all games he has played so far #AFCONQ2025 #Ghana #Sudan #BlackStars #AfricanFootball
