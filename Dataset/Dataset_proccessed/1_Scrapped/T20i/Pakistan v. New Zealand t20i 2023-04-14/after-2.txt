LAHORE: Fakhar Zaman and Saim Ayub lifted Pakistan to 182 all out batting first in the opening T20 international against New Zealand in Lahore on Friday.
Captain Babar Azam fell for just nine in his 100th T20I appearance, but Zaman and Ayub scored 47 runs apiece and put on a 79-run partnership for the third wicket after Pakistan won the toss.
Scorecard: Pakistan vs New Zealand
Zaman struck four fours and two sixes in his 34-ball knock while Ayub's rapid 28-ball innings featured two sixes and six fours.

Matt Henry was the pick of the New Zealand bowlers with 3-32, as Pakistan were bowled out on the penultimate ball.
Pakistan and New Zealand will play five T20s and as many one-day internationals.
