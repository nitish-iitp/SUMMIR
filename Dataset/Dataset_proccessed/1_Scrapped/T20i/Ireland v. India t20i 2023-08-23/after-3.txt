India vs Ireland 3rd T20 Live Score: India creates history

On Wednesday, India scripted history as ISRO’s ambitious third Moon mission Chandrayaan-3’s Lander Module (LM) touched down on the lunar surface, making it only the fourth country to accomplish the feat, and first to reach the uncharted south pole of Earth’s only natural satellite.

In a big boost to India’s space prowess, the LM comprising the lander (Vikram) and the 26 kg rover (Pragyan), made the soft landing near the south polar region of the Moon at 6.04 pm,,less than a week after a similar Russian lander crashed.

With this touchdown on moon in second attempt in four years, India has become the fourth country to master the technology of soft-landing on the lunar surface after the US, China and the erstwhile Soviet Union.

India vs Ireland 3rd T20 Live Score: Mukesh Kumar for Arshdeep

Arshdeep Singh has been in India’s go-to bowler in the T20I, since making his debut in July last year. The left-arm seamer has bagged 49 wickets in the 32 outings. But his death bowling has been a major concern in the recent past. He gave away 22 in the final over as Barry McCarthy smashed two sixes and a four in the last over. India might rope in Mukesh Kumar, who has recently made his debut in the all three formats in the West Indies. Mukesh was used only in the death overs by Hardik Pandya against West Indies and the Bengal pacer has impressed everyone with his yorkers. India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey says pacer Mukesh Kumar has shown potential to serve India in all three formats.
