23 Aug 2023 India vs Ireland 3rd T20I was abandoned due to rain. India wins the 3-match T20I series by 2-0.

Team India's next assignment after the tour of West Indies is the 3-match T20I matches in Ireland. India vs Ireland 2023 series will start on 18th August and end on 23rd August 2023. India toured Ireland in 2018 and 2022, winning the T20 series both times by 2-0.

With the 2024 T20 World Cup to be played in the West Indies and the USA less than a year away, this will be a good learning experience for the new and less experienced players in the India T20I squad.
