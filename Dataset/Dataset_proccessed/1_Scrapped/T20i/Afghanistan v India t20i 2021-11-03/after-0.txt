Despite the annihilation of Afghanistan, India's semifinal prospects remain hanging in the balance thanks to the back-to-back drubbing against Pakistan and New Zealand inside eight days of the tournament proper. (AP)

India vs Afghanistan Highlights: India beat Afghanistan by 66 runs in their Super 12 match of T20 World Cup here on Wednesday to keep their slim chance of reaching semifinals alive. Openers Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul hit half centuries to help India post 210 for 2 after being invited to bat and then restricted Afghanistan to 144 for 7 in their 20 overs.

Mohammed Shami took three wickets while Ravichandran Ashwin got two. Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja grabbed one wicket each. For Afghanistan, Karim Janat top-scored with 42 not out while Mohammad Nabi contributed 35.

Earlier, Rohit (74) and Rahul (69) stitched 140 runs from 14.4 overs for the opening wicket to set up India’s big total. Hardik Pandya and Rishabh Pant Pant remained not out on 35 and 27 respectively. For Afghanistan, Karim Janat and Gulbadin Naib took a wicket each.

IND vs AFG, T20 World Cup 2021 Highlights: India defeat Afghanistan by 66 runs in Abu Dhabi.

Virat Kohli speaks

Much better wicket to be fair. We spoke about the fact that in the other games, if we just had two overs of free-flowing batting, then that sends a message to the opposition that we are going to put you under the pump. When we do that, we know how we can play. Sometimes, you do fall to the pressure and have to accept that. T20 cricket is a very instinctive game, in batting, bowling and decision-making. We do make decisions on the go. Top three is mostly settled unless situations like today when the openers batted all the way through and the power-hitters were ready. We don't always decide early to go hard, but we do back ourselves and when we do get going, we know what we can do.

23:25 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
Rohit Sharma says:

The idea was to go after it, and get off to a good start, which didn't happen in the first two games and lay the platform for the others. Exceptional batting from Rahul, and that partnership was vital. We were prepared to field first, and it was a good pitch to bat on. Getting to a respectable total was important, and the NRR could come into play so we had to win by a good margin, so glad we got that. Today it was necessary to get off to a good start, and that's not my natural game - I usually like to get in. So I made an effort to settle in, play cricketing shots, and put up a big total.

Janat six juggernaut 6ï¸âƒ£ðŸ”„ðŸ’«ðŸŸï¸

Karim Janat would know the pain of being struck for sixes. The other night, Pakistan’s Asif Ali had smeared four in an over of his. But Janat knows a bit about hitting sixes too. In a lost cause against India, he struck arguably the most ferocious of all sixes. Shardul Thakur had just strayed into his body on a fuller length and he just moved his front foot away and whipped the ball over the leg-side with a furious flick of his bottom hand wrists. A semi-helicopter shot that was struck so high that it almost vanished in the flood-lit sky. Like Asif, he comes with a six-hitting reputation striking one in every 10 balls he faces in T20 cricket. Maybe, one night, he will find his night of retribution too by hitting sixes and not getting hit with sixes.

23:12 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
India win by 66 runs

Last over now. This is all but over. AFG were valiant but this was too huge a mountain to climb. And Janat starts with a 4. 3 off the next 3 balls. And a 6 to finish by Janat. India win by 66 runs in Abu Dhabi.

TWO WICKETS, ONE ALMOST

And what a blinding catch. Oh my god. That was a beauty. Two wickets in quick succession for India as Afghanistan struggle. But they are now checking the catch. No. It's given not out. Hard luck for Jadeja. Jadeja has to run in a long way from the boundary, and he sprints there in super-quick time - not too many would get there as quickly. He still needs to dive full-length to reach it in the end, and replays show that he's held on to the ball but brushed it into the ground upon landing. No wicket, but what an effort! And Rashid is taken now. Out for a duck. AFG 127/7 after 18.3 overs.

22:59 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
18 done

The 18th over is about to begin. The last two overs had some boundaries. 11 off the 17th and 10 off the 16th. And they have started this over like a thunderstorm. 4 and 6 off the first 2 balls. Shardul is getting hit. 16 off this over. AFG 125/5 after 18 overs.

22:43 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
15 done

Bumrah in to bowl the 15th. A blistering throw from Jadeja and direct hit but seems like Nabi is in. Great all round bowling. 3 runs off this over. Afghanistan struggling. AFG 88.5 after 15 overs.

22:38 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
Good over by Ashwin

14th over begins. The last over went for 10 runs. AFG need to hit big shots but they don't have enough batters for those and now they are running out of overs. It's a weird conundrum. Ashwin is bowling this one. Just 5 off it ultimately. AFG 85/5 after 14 overs.

22:31 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
WICKET!!!

Is this another wicket? Nabi drives uppishly, and Rohit dives forward and to his right at extra-cover. Comes up with the ball in both hands, but he isn't sure if it carried... The umpires are having a look now. And no, it's not out.  And Zadran is gone in the next ball. Ashwin takes it. AFG 69/5 after 11.5 overs.

22:25 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
Decent over by Shardul

11th over starts. Shardul to bowl. 4 runs in the first five balls. Turning out to be a good over. 5 off it ultimately. Afghanistan really need to get a move along. AFG 66/4 after 11 overs.

22:18 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
WICKET!!!

10th over starts. And Gulbadin goes. Big appeal and this looks plumb. Carrom ball, full and headed for middle stump. Naib gets down for the sweep and cops this on the back thigh, right in front of middle stump. He won't bother reviewing that. His struggle against spin is over. AFG 59/4 after 9.3 overs

Plumb!

Ravichandran Ashwin traps Gulbadin who is gone for 18. #T20WorldCup | #INDvAFG | https://t.co/ZJL2KKL30i pic.twitter.com/yZstZE4A94

WICKET

Afghanistan lose their third as Hardik takes the catch. Goes up miles in the air....has it gone long enough??? Nope! Hardik circles under it and takes the skier just near the ropes. Jadeja get one now. AFG 49/3 after 7 overs.

22:06 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
Powerplay done

Last over of the powerplay. Starts with a 4. Hardik was bowling. And another boundary to follow in the 4th ball. 9 off it. AFG 47/2 after 6 overs.

21:59 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
Shami expensive

The 5th over starts. Shami in to bowl his third over. And Gulbadin hits a 4 in the second ball. And two sixes follow suit. Afghanistan are giving this a hell of a chase. And 4 more to end it. 21 off it. AFG 38/2 after 5 overs.

21:49 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
WICKET!!!

And Zazai also departs. Bumrah gets his wicket. Bagged by mid-on running to the left. Thakur calm under it. Offcutter at a good length on middle stump, gets low and looks for the slog sweep again, but ends up slicing this. AFG 13/2 after 3.1 overs.

Zazai follows suit.

Bumrah gets his first scalp as Afghanistan lose their second. #T20WorldCup | #INDvAFG | https://t.co/ZJL2KKL30i https://t.co/VRhSULtq3P

21:46 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
WICKET!!

And Shahzad is gone. Afghanistan lose their first wicket. Taken at mid-off. Shahzad looked out of sorts in his short stay. This is good length and swung into his legs. He's static as he closes the face to try and flick in square leg's direction. Gets a leading edge that's pretty easy for Ashwin. AFG 13/1 after 3 overs.

21:40 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
Run chase begins

Hazratullah Zazai and Mohammad Shahzad are at the crease. Hazratullah Zazai is on strike. Shami will open the attack. And the second ball is hit for a 4. And a 6 to begin the second ball of the second over. AFG 12/0 after 2 overs.

21:24 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
When Immovable Shahzad meets Unstoppable Hardik ðŸŽï¸ðŸšŒ ðŸ’¥

Ironically, the one time Mohammad Shahzad - he, of, 'must I move?' fame - moved considerably, to gather a ball in the penultimate over, he collided with Hardik Pandya who was haring down the ground for the second run, and the pair tumbled on the pitch in the most awkward manner. Needless to say, it took an eternity for Shahzad to drag himself back on his feet. And with a little help from Pandya.

21:24 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
Shahzad's princely pace of being ðŸšŒ

Mohammad Shahzad takes minimalism to its extreme. The Afghanistan wicket-keeper moves from his perch only when it’s utmost urgent. He has to, between overs -- occupational rigour -- or when pressed into receiving throws from the fielders. On both instances, it’s a stroll than a sprint. No urgency, no fuss, not even a faint attempt at lunging or diving. If another fielder can collect the ball, he always lets them be, even if he’s closer to the ball than they are. Even when the ball strays to the leg-side, he doesn’t move in sync with the direction of the ball. He just plants his foot and flails his arms. But he rarely fumbles or drops a catch. Why move when you needn’t, could be his logic. Just like his logic for not dieting. “Jitna lamba chhakka Kohli maarte hain, main unse zyadaa maar saktaa hoon, zaroorat kya hain unki tarah itna diet karne ki (I can hit bigger sixes than Kohli so why do I need to follow his diet?),” he said. Not that he has not made any attempt. But found himself in trouble, as a fat-loss supplement contained a banned drug. After that, he quit all his efforts to lose fat. “Dekhiye hum fitness bhi poori karte hain aur khaate bhi poora hain (I work a lot on my fitness but I don’t compromise on food).”

21:20 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
India post 210

The 20th over starts. Pant has started hitting them as 200 comes up for India. That somewhat takes care of the NRR. A 6 and a 4 to start the over. And Hardik has now hit one. What a shot. And a bye to finish. IND post 210/2 after 20 overs.

21:15 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
IND score highest runs of the tournament

Naveen in to ball the 19th over. And they have dropped a catch. How much more costly will that be? And Hardik has hit a big six. Afghanistan are leaking runs at the moment. And highest total of the tournament comes up. As Hardik hits another 6. IND 194/2 after 19 overs.

21:07 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
18 gone

In the 17th over Gulbadin was hit for two sixes by Pant. This team has finally found its group. Bith ends have cut lose. And Hamid has been hit for a 4 in the first ball of the 18th over. And two more fours in the 4th and the 5th ball. Hasan is getting roasted there. 15 off this over. IND 175/2

21:00 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
Rahul goes

And bowled. Up go the biceps! Rahul was targeting short fine leg there, and he moved across for the scoop, but he's beaten by the slower yorker, and zing go the bails. India 2 down. IND 147/2 after 16.3 overs.

20:51 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
Rohit gone

Finally Rohit departs. Gone, straight to extra-cover. Fullish, just outside off. Was there to drive on the up, but he ends up hitting it straight to the man at extra-cover, flat and at around waist height. Who will India send in now? IND 142/1 after 15 overs.

20:45 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
DOUBLE SIXES

Rashid in to bowl the 14th. Good over so far except for THAT. Massive 6 by Rohit. He charges down  and reaches out and swats this one bottom-handed over cow corner for a gigantic six! And another ball has been sent to the stands. Another massive 6 from Rohit to end the over. 16 off the over. IND 135/0 after 14 overs.

20:40 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
Lucky 13 for India as Rahul also gets his 50

And Rahul hits a 4 to get his half century. Even quicker than Rohit eventually, though he made a slower start. Has to wait just a little, and he holds his shape, steps inside the line, and lofts it inside-out over extra-cover. And another boundary to end the over. 12 off it. IND 119/0 after 13 overs.

20:36 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
Naveen's rough and turf lessons, ðŸ˜Œ&ðŸ˜

Still taking baby steps as an international cricketer, Afghanistan pacer Naveen-ul-Haq's internet footprints aren't too overwhelming. But in the short period, he has caught the attention of clickbaiters because of his "viral video" launch last year. In the clip that allegedly "killed the internet" Naveen was seen giving a sheepish look and Pakistan legend Shahid Afridi had that look - one that can make even battle-hardened veterans quiver. In a Sri Lanka T20 league game, Naveen had a running battle with Mohammad Amir, who was Afridi's team mate. At the end of the game while the players performed the "meet and greet" ritual, Afridi gave Naveen a piece of his mind. Later, when the Pathan's anger had subsided, he would tweet that juniors should respect seniors. Naveen seems to have learnt his lesson. The other day he was all smiles during his intense battle with Shoaib Malik. And today against India, he was bowling to his hero Rohit Sharma. He would get pilloried in his first two overs, Rohit would hit him for 3 fours and a six. After his second over, where he conceded 16 runs, Naveen would stare at the Abu Dhabi turf and walk to his fielding position.

20:36 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
Rohit's 50, India's 100

Naveen returns to the attack. He has been expensive thus far. Painful blow to Rohit. Rohit just slaps the next ball away to the left of the sweeper, who has a lot of ground to make up and ends up fumbling the ball into the rope on the dive. And that brings up Rohit's fifty. And a 6 by Rahul. 100 comes up. And another 4 to follow. They are just eating Naveen alive in this match. IND 107/0 after 12 overs.

Decent over:

Shot. Gulbadin wants to deny him the room to play but Rohit makes plenty of room, and opens his bat face to dab it very fine, bisecting the keeper and short third. A great four. A relatively decent over nonetheless. 6 off it. IND 91/0 after 11 overs.

20:21 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
Halfway mark done

The 10th over will be bowled by Rashid. And he is hit for a four straightaway by Rahul. It is perfectly placed, finding the backward square boundary. 11 off this over. IND 85/0 after 10 overs. We gop for drinks now.

Decent over for India

Ashraf to bowl the 9th over and he is driven for a 4 by Rahul in the 3rd ball. India will be looking to convert it into an 8 or 9 run over. And 9 off the over. Decent over from India's perspective. IND 74/0 after 9 overs.

This is the first time since January 2020 that India have batted the first nine overs of a T20 innings without losing a wicket.#T20WorldCup

Couple of good overs for AFG

8th over starts. The last over went for just 6 runs. Now Rashid Khan has been brought on. First bowler today to get a slip. 5 off the first five deliveries. Last ball also went for one. Good couple of overs from Afghanistan's perspective. IND 65/0 after 8 overs.

20:04 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
Ditching the knee ðŸ¤ðŸ˜

Both India and Afghanistan ditched the knee in their group league match in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. India didn’t perform the gesture in their last match against New Zealand also, although the Kiwis took the knee. 

In terms of taking the knee, India did it before the start of their first match against Pakistan. It came on the heels of the International Cricket Council giving every team at the T20 World Cup the opportunity to show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement and send a message against any form of racial discrimination. Accordingly, Cricket South Africa made it mandatory for their players to take the knee before every game and after his initial reluctance to do so, Quinton de Kock, too, followed his cricket board’s directive.

India, meanwhile, asserted that their stance against racism and discrimination remained unshakable. “The Indian cricket team took a knee during their opening game of the (T20) World Cup and its stance against racism was well registered and documented. There’s no scope for racism or any form of discriminatory behaviour in sport,” a source close to the team told this paper on Sunday.

20:02 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
Powerplay done

The last over of the powerplay starts. Hamid to bowl. Can he repeat what he did in his last over? Subdued appeal for lbw before a late decision to review. Rohit was down on one knee trying to ramp a yorker. He was struck in front of leg stump, on his back boot. And Rohit survives. Afghanistan lose a review. Just 1 off the over. India 53/0 after powerplay ends.

19:57 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
50 up in the 5th over

Penultimate over before the powerplay. Naveen to bowl. And a no ball to start. Just one off the free hit though. This is India's best start to the powerplay in this tournament. Aaaaaaand another four to follow. Rohit just sets up deep in the crease and chucks his hands at it to slash past point. Afghanistan are leaking runs at the moment. And it's a 6 in the 5th ball. Sweetly struck and it goes over the ropes. And a 4 to end the innings. Naveen is getting served. 50 up for India. IND 52/0 after 5 overs.

 

19:50 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
Quiet over

Hamid in to bowl the 4th over. Can he save some runs and check these Indian batters? Makes a good start. Just 3 off the first four balls. Well, he did whatever he was brought on for. 5 off this over. IND 35/0 after 4 overs.

19:45 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
3rd over gone

Naveen to bowl the 3rd over. One dot and 2 singles to start the first 3 balls. And the 5th ball is sent straight to the boundary. In the gap. The change of pace does not help. Rohit nails the pull over midwicket. 7 off the over. IND 30/0 after 3 overs.

19:40 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
India get blazing start

Oh well placed. Pre-meditated lap sweep from Rohit. He was down early, the ball was at a length outside off. He gets on one knee and angles it fine. Looks like Hamid Hassan was the man at short fine. The ball was away from him quickly. Sharafuddin is having a pretty rough time. And that one is hit for a massive 6. Rahul nails it. Clears the front leg and swings this handsomely over mid-on and about 83 metres deep. And it ends with a four. Just the start India wanted. IND 23/0 after 2 overs.

19:37 (IST)
03 NOV 2021
Here we go!!

Rahul and Rohit are at the crease. Rahul is on strike. Nabi will open the attack. And Rohit ends with a four in the first over. IND 7/0 after 1 over.

T20I Head to Head:Â 

India 2 - 0 Afghanistan. Both the games were played at T20 World Cups in 2010 and 2012. In one match, India batted first and won and in the other, they batted second and came out victorious. Will be curious to see what they choose this time.

After another underwhelming performance in a must-win – virtually knockout – game, the contrast couldn’t be starker. India is the best team going around, across formats, home and away, when it comes to bilateral series. But the trophy cabinet has been vacant ever since the 2013 Champions Trophy, as far as major ICC events are concerned. Why?

Here's a closer look: ?

Both have either failed to play impactful innings when it has mattered most or have been overshadowed by far superior batting by opposition.

What to expect:

How does a team bounce back from two morale-crushing defeats when its cricket is not brave enough, by Virat Kohli’s own admission? How does a team return to winning ways when its bowling unit has taken only two wickets in two matches? How does a team motivate itself knowing that its fate at the T20 World Cup is no longer in its own hands?

Read our preview ?:

Will have to record a big win on Wednesday, before easier games versus Scotland and Namibia, to have any chance of making the last four.

India ditched leg-spin in the first two matches at #T20WorldCup21 , a tournament where wrist-spin is making its presence felt. So after two wicketless outings, Varun Chakravarthy might make way for Chahar. Likely #PlayingXIs ?

Hello and welcome

Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the match between India and Afghanistan in the T20 World Cup in Abu Dhabi. Virat Kohli will try to figure the combination that can bring his team’s floundering campaign back on track. India’s run has been derailed after two crushing defeats against Pakistan and New Zealand and the performance that they have put in is not worthy of a semi-final spot even though mathematics keeps their hopes alive. Afghanistan have expectedly won their two games against Scotland and Namibia and were in the contest against Pakistan for the better part before Asif Ali took the game away with four sixes in one over. Can they pull off an upset tonight?

How does a team bounce back from two morale-crushing defeats when its cricket is not brave enough, by Virat Kohli’s own admission? How does a team return to winning ways when its bowling unit has taken only two wickets in two matches? How does a team motivate itself knowing that its fate at the T20 World Cup is no longer in its own hands? Inclusion of fresh faces could help; some new players coming into the playing eleven against Afghanistan without carrying the excess baggage of back-to-back losses. Then again, it’s a double-edged sword. Axing is easy, the message it would carry might not be palatable. (READ FULL STORY)
