IND vs AFG Highlights, T20 World Cup Match Today

India vs Afghanistan Highlights: At last, after 10 days and 2 matches, the Indian team finally managed to secure their first victory of the showpiece event. They beat Afghanistan by 66 runs. In chase of 211, AFG lost two early wickets at the start of their chase as Jasprit Bumrah removed Zazai (13) and Mohammed Shami got the wicket of Mohammad Shahzad (0). However, Gurbaz and Gulbadin took the attack to the Indian bowlers to take the total to 47/2 after the powerplay. Soon after, Gurbaz was sent packing on 19 by Ravindra Jadeja. Just as Gulbadin Naib threatened to take off, he was trapped LBW plumb in front by R Ashwin. Afghanistan reached 61-4 after 10 overs. R Ashwin, before finishing his spell with figures of 2/14 in 4 overs, cleaned up Najib as Afghanistan reached 98/5 after 16 overs. Eventually, Mohammed Shami bagged two more, en route to three wicket-haul as India restricted Afghanistan to 144/7 in 20 overs. Earlier in the first innings, India posted 210/2 in 20 overs after being asked to bat by Afghanistan. Courtesy of a flurry of boundaries unleashed by openers KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma, India posted 53/0 by the end of the first innings Powerplay. Afghanistan bowlers pulled things back for three overs before a few timely boundaries from KL Rahul helped India post 85/0 at the halfway stage. Soon after, the duo brought up their 4th T20I century stand and Rahul also brought up another half-century. The Indian openers then went on to add 140 runs for the first wicket, a new record for India in T20Is, before Karim Janat dismissed Sharma on 74. Rahul was dismissed on 69 soon after by Gulbadin Naib but that did not deter Hardik Pandya (35*) and Rishabh Pant (27*) to put on a show. The two put on 63 runs off 21 balls to take India to the massive total.

IND vs AFG: 3 things India need to do right to beat AFG ( 3 of 3)

Plan but also be prepared to break the set pattern

Be it batting, bowling or fielding, there seems to be a set pattern in everything that India do in T20Is, which is not the ideal thing in this format, where the game is largely depended on instincts. Teams like England, Pakistan have definite plans against each of their opponents but they are also ready to improvise based on the match situation. This has been missing in India's case. Firstly, their plan A (if their was one) hasn't worked at all against any of the New Zealand or Pakistan players. The same left-armer dismantled their top-order, the same Trent Boult, Ish Sodhi, and Mitchell Santner gave them troubles. And when their first plan failed, they appeared clueless. While defending 110, the idea to start with Varun Chakravarthy was good but the field he got in no way suggested that India were going for wickets.

IND vs AFG: 3 things India need to do right to beat AFG ( 2 of 3)

Stop treating 150 as a safe total even on slow tracks

When you have a top three comprising Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli. Throw in Ishan Kishan there too, the opposition should be on the defensive, not the other way around. But Rahul, Rohit and Kohli have sort of pre-decided a safe total in their minds before even walking out to bat. Their approach of ‘getting their eyes in’ before attempting shots has never allowed India to get off to a start. In 2021, it is a strict no no to have three world-class players whose first instinct is to accumulate and then go for shots in T20 cricket. That seemed to have rubbed off in the rest of the Indian batting unit. The pitches in UAE are not conducive for strokeplay on the up, especially when batting first but that in no way means there won't be intent. If India's batters can bat without the fear of losing wickets then they can be as destructive as anyone, something that they desperately need to bring their campaign back on track.

IND vs AFG Live: 3 things India need to do right to beat AFG (1 of 3)

Get the selection right

India had picked five spinners and only three specialist seam bowling options in their initial 15-member squad. Question marks over Hardik Pandya's bowling forced them to replace Axar Patel with Shardul Thakur. Even then, they were left with four genuine spinners, meaning their thought process before the tournament was to strangle the opposition with spin. And rightly so. The slow nature of the UAE pitches, the bigger boundaries make spinners a match-winning option. But for reasons unknown, there has been no sign of that in their XI in the first two matches. They went with two spinners and decided to bench Ashwin and Rahul Chahar - perhaps their best bets to pick wickets in the middle. The choice of seamers too haven't been that convincing. Yes, Bhuvneshwar Kumar has not been at his best but he provides extra options at the death. With the XI that India went in with against New Zealand, there was no bankable option apart from Bumrah at the death. Even if India had somehow managed to give a 150-plus target, it would have been very difficult to defend.
