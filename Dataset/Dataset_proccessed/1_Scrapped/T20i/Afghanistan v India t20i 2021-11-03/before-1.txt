Not only communal people and the cricket fans took to social media and posted their opinions about the Afghanistan VS Pakistan match in T20 World Cup but also the politicians.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in a Twitter post has praised Afghanistan national cricket team as the only team that rise so rapidly in the cricketing world.

Imran Khan who himself has risen as a cricket player and skipper of the national team called the cricket of Afghanistan against Pakistan impressive.

“IMPRESSIVE CRICKET BY TEAM AFGHANISTAN. NEVER HAVE I SEEN A CRICKETING NATION RISE AS RAPIDLY AS AFGHANISTAN IN INTERNATIONAL CRICKET & BECOME SO COMPETITIVE.” READS THE TWEET.

Though Afghanistan lost the last night’s match against Pakistan, PM Imran Khan has been impressed and said that the future of cricket is bright in Afghanistan.

In the meantime, Pakistan’s President Arif Alvi has commiserated Afghanistan team and said that the side has world’s best spinners.

The nail-biting match between Afghanistan and Pakistan was surely one of the most exciting games in the ongoing World Cup that upset the Afghan fans.

Social media activists in Afghanistan though praised the overall game played by the national team, lashed on Karim Janat as he conceded 24 runs in the penultimate over of the game.

As I said on November 3, 2021 at 4:33 PM

“So the fact that Pakistan,Kiwis,Aussie,England will be in the semis,is a no brainer and not a prediction”

And it is done !

The Afghans have BURIED THE INDIANS !

No resurrection here ! There is no Lazarus,Dionysus,Jesus ….

In the context of resurrections – it is relevant to quote the gems of Judas Thomas,as under:

According to the “apocryphal Acts of St. Thomas” , the apostles drew lots and the Apostle Judas Thomas, who was a carpenter, got India. When Jesus appeared to him, in a vision that night,Thomas said, “Whither soever Thou wilt, our Lord, send me; only to India I will not go.”.

THE KEY WORDS “ONLY TO INDIA,I WILL NOT GO” – I CALL THIS “TRANSCENDENTAL TRUTHS” !

The Indian Media were praying for Afghanistan,and extolling the Indian links of the Afghan players. Endless Love ! The Mount Meru Syndrome !

If the Afghans had played against India,like they played against the Kiwis or Pakistan – the Afghans would be somewhere else.

The Kiwis and Afghans have blown a HOLE into the sponsors and advertisement projections of the T20.Indian Cricket is history – and that will make the entire cricket business model unviable – as Indians will not like to see,their team eviscerated.

Like GeoPolitics and Diplomacy – whoever bets on the Indians is doomed.And in this case,it is the T20 sponsors.The TRPs will crash ! dindooohindoo

It is time for the world sports associations,to think of an option to the IPL – as the destruction of Indian Cricket,will also damage the IPL sponsorships and profits – and will be permanently hostile,to Pakistani Players
