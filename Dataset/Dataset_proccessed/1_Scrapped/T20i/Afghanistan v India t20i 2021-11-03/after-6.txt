That's our lot for today. Thanks for joining us for another day of T20 World Cup action.

In case you missed it, Scotland put on a spirited display earlier today but lost by 16 runs to New Zealand and were knocked out of the competition.

And then Rohit Sharma's delightful 74 from 47 balls led India to a one-sided 66-run victory over Afghanistan. Read Jack Skelton's report to find out more!

We'll be back tomorrow with live text commentary, radio coverage and in-play clips of Australia v Bangladesh (10:00 GMT), followed by West Indies v Sri Lanka (14:00).

Goodnight!

India, apparently a top team beat a minnow. Whoop, whoop.

India captain Virat Kohli: "T20 cricket is a very instinctive game, we make a lot of decisions on the go. The top three is more or less set unless something happens like today when the guys batted brilliantly through to over 14 and then our power hitters played brilliantly. Sometimes it doesn't come off but when it does, it shows how we can bat.

"But give credit to the opposition, they bowled really well and didn't let us get away with anything.

"We are looking in a very optimistic way at what lies ahead and we will play this way for sure. We knew that we have some kind of chance and we have to focus on that chance instead of thinking of what's gone bad. We are a positive side."

On what he is most pleased with: "The return of Ashwin. It is something he has really worked hard for. I'm really happy to see him in rhythm because when he bowls like that you control the middle overs."

Afghanistan captain Mohammad Nabi: "We wanted to bat second because of the dew, and the wicket looked really good for batting. In the end there wasn't that much dew, but India batted really well on this pitch and put our bowlers under pressure. We didn't rotate strike well in the middle, and we threw away our wickets and got under pressure."

Afghanistan pretty much gave up any hope of victory a third of the way into their run-chase. But they certainly played their shots at times, with one eye on their net run-rate.

India batter and player of the match Rohit Sharma: "We wanted to get off to a good start which we didn't do in the first two games. So it was a conscious effort to lay the platform for the other batters to come out and express themselves as well. Exceptional batting from KL Rahul at well at the other end. That partnership was crucial from a team perspective.

"It was a good pitch to bat on. Getting off to a good start and getting a respectable total was very important. We knew that run-rate could come into play so we wanted to win by a big margin. We are glad we could pull that off."

After long periods of nothing but singles and dot balls, we had an entertaining penultimate over of the innings! And we got to see the many faces of Virat Kohli, which is always fun.

Dan O'Brien: Looked like a drop to me.

Rashid c Hardik b Shami 0 (Afg 129-7)

But Rashid Khan goes this time!

It's a slower ball from Mohammed Shami and the batter swings hard. Hardik Pandya calmly walks round the boundary from long-on to take a good catch.
