Malawi Under-19 Women’s Cricket has started its campaign for the International Cricket Council (ICC) Women’s T20 World Cup Sub Regional Qualifiers impressively in Kigali, Rwanda after winning opening three games.

In their opening match against Eswatini on Wednesday, Malawi won by nine wickets with Eve Kabwere winning the player of the match after scoring six wickets, five runs and four overs.

On the same day, Malawi defeated Sierra Leone by eight wickets. Malawi’s Mercy Kudimba was named player of the match after contributing 36 runs.

Malawi continued with the winning start on Thursday when the side defeated Mozambique by 10 wickets.

Lucy Malino was voted player of the match after supplying three wickets, six runs and four overs.

Cricket Malawi Head of Cricket Operations Arjun Menon said the side would not get complacent in their bid to qualify for the finals.

“Well as you can see they have been quite outstanding. All three games very dominant wins. Beating Sierra Leone was a big one as they have been quite a decent team at U-19 level in past tournaments,” Menon said.

Menon said the side needs to win three games to finish at the top.

“It is a very good start and we need three more wins to finish top of the round robin. Botswana and Kenya are the key matches here as history suggest in past tournaments. The game against Botswana tomorrow will be crucial. Win that and we are in a very good position as a victory against Lesotho after that would mean certain qualification as one of the two sides going through,” Menon said.

As we went to press Friday, Malawi was at the top with six points from three games while Kenya were second with four points from two games.

Botswana lie third with four points from two games as well while Mozambique are fourth with two points from three games.

The bottom three teams have no point having played two games each.

Sierra Leone are fifth while Eswatini are fifth. Lesotho anchor the group.
