Play the same team.

Never change a winning team.

Are you insinuating he bought the farm?

Whoever the West Indies bring in to replace Charles would have to work from scratch. I would be concerned about the replacement's

mindset if the opposition asked the West Indies to bat first. His eye and hand coordination will have to adjust instantly; that is not good

when the middle order is counting on him to take advantage of those six powerplay overs.

He usually has a game or 2 up his sleeve. Which ones, I wait to see. St. LUCIA pitch looks CHARLESISH.

If there were no good spinners, I'd agree!

Lol....yuh reckon successful teams like India an OZ dnt ever change a winning team???...so i guess you would disagree with the changes OZ made against Scotland in what was a dead rubber for them!!!

A game or 2 during a calendar year?

I far as I can remember WI always had that stupid philosophy of "never change a winning team".

 
googley 2024-06-17 14:37:17 

In reply to SnoopDog

Correct! Same way they believe that WI always produce talented players.....and they virtually ignore developing players at the school level.

Charles would be a better pick on the flat tracks and the wind factor at the sammy

 
CCW 2024-06-17 15:26:08 

In reply to doosra

It's not or shouldn't be about that in what is effectively a dead rubber....IT SHOULD BE about exploring other options to combat the more difficult tasks that lie ahead ....its called forward thinking an as i have alluded to this is the difference somewhat between successful an mediocre teams!!

 
googley 2024-06-17 15:27:15 

In reply to doosra

and if Charles fails at the Sammy?

 
doosra 2024-06-17 15:36:46 

In reply to googley

did he not earn his spot?

 
googley 2024-06-17 15:45:53 

In reply to doosra



Not in my book. He is too inconsistent. In 2024 he played 9 T20i games. Total runs 191, avg 21.22 (below his overall T20i average). Strike rate 146.

 
jacksparrow 2024-06-17 16:41:49 

if they drop Charles for this game, they would be saving/protecting him.

So he can get some form for the Super 8.

Johnson Charles is the highest run getter at this venue in T20s, with 939 runs in 31 innings at a strike rate of 135.10


A feisty contest awaits us when Johnson Charles squares off against the two wrist spinners - Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmed. Against their ilk, the West Indies opener has scored at strike rates of 166.07 in 10 innings but has also been dismissed six times by them in T20Is since 2021.

Shimron Hetmyer has struggled against wrist spinners too, scoring 115 runs off 142 balls at a strike rate of 80.99.

The Afghans might start off by bowling spin from both ends. Charles seems to like the ball coming on to bat...

lb 2024-06-17 21:43:46 

Critics of Charles's current performance points have merit. That said tonights match is his rubber: He has to survive the 1st 6 overs and give windies a start irrespective of his score. Windies need to be at min 45 for 1 max after 6. If Charles and or the top 3 does this then Charles stays for rest of tournanent. If windies are 35 for 3 or worse after 6 and Charles is out then he goes for rest if tournament.

How you plan on convincing Sammy to drop him, if he fails tonight?

 
doosra 2024-06-18 00:48:50

doosra 2024-06-18 01:16:02 

Charles did his job

100 after 8

If he do "his job" again on Wednesday then he justifies his selection
