I switched to it when I remembered, then switched to Women's Euro when I see the cutarse sharing.

Bumrah has been making the white ball sing so far in the one T20 and ODI he played. If he continues England in for some trouble.

Jadeja is probably one of very few players that can play all 3 formats and do consistently well as an all rounder.

Jadeja is a genuine all rounder, not these clowns running around as bits and pieces cricketers and thinking they are all rounders. WI cricket has ALOT of them.

Seems NZ Ireland 3rd ODI is the only international match on today. NZ made a solid 360-6.
After this NZ comes to the WI for a 3 match ODI series which follows WI home series against India.

Packed month and a half for the WI.

Allya please shed a tear for those fans who spent good money for that WI vs IND ODI series taking place at the Oval in T&T. I hope all they are there for is for partying and don't care to watch the shite show that WI gonna put on.

West Indies are hopeless in ODIs. Seems that they generally can't bat the full fifty overs very often. Meanwhile Ireland almost chase 360 and set a 300 target in two of their three games against NZ.

Seeing a story that Sunil Narine and national FC cricketer Terrance Hinds lose a case in court against a man for unpaid rent but also who they supposedly threatened with pics of gun and thing.

Will read the judgement when I get some time.

English cricketers play an absolute ton of cricket and they tend to go early.
Cook retired at 33 by which time he already played 161 Tests.
Trescothick retired at 30 and by that time he played 76 tests.
Ian Bell went at 33 and played 118 tests; Strauss retired at 32 (but I think his wife's Cancer had something to do with that) and 100 tests.

Joe Root might retire from some form of cricket soon. He's 31 but has played 121 tests, 156 ODIs and 32 T20s. That's crazy.

Why do WI always choose to chase whenever they win a toss in ODI's?
Only for the opponent to embarrass them most times, let's see what happens today...
