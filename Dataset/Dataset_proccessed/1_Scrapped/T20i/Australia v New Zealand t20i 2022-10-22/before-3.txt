Details about the Sydney Cricket Ground

T20 World Cup 2022: The stage is set and we are closing in on yet another T20 World Cup, the biggest cricketing event of the year. This time around 16 teams are participating in the ongoing World Cup and the main round will feature the top 12 teams from the globe as they have a go at each other for world dominance. The World Cup is being played across seven Australian cities and is all set to be a visual spectacle with a high-octane contest on the cards. The World Cup opener will be played between Australia and New Zealand at the legendary Sydney Cricket Ground on October 22, 2022.

The Sydney Cricket Ground aka the SCG hosted the first Test which was an Ashes match played between Australia and England in 1882. Since then, Sydney has been host to the popular 'New Year Test' that is always played in the first week of January. The ground also has a reputation for hosting important One Day International (ODI) matches. The ground hosted the semi-final in the 1992 World Cup. One of the popular sporting venues across the globe, the Sydney Cricket Ground is the same venue where Sir Donald Bradman ended up scoring his highest-ever first-class score of 452 for NSW (New South Wales) against Queensland in 1928-29.

Predominantly, the Sydney pitch is good for batting. The wicket stays fresh and assists batsmen till day 3. Starting from day 4, the spinners start to come into play. The Sydney pitch doesn't have the true bounce of Gabba or the raw pace of the WACA but certainly has enough spin to offer.
