The 2022 T20 World Cup has been underway for the best part of a week now, as eight nations looked to join the pre-qualified eight in the super 12 phase of the tournament.

There have already been shocks, with two-time champions West Indies already out of contention after defeats to Ireland and Scotland in the opening group phase.

The West Indies join Namibia, United Arab Emirates and Scotland in failing to progress to the tournament proper.

However, Sri Lanka, Netherlands, Ireland and Zimbabwe have made their way to the Super 12 phase.

Here's what to expect from the 12 remaining teams.

Group 1
Afghanistan

At the recent Asia Cup Afghanistan blew rather hot and cold, but still pulled out some stunning results, bowling out eventual champions Sri Lanka for just 105 in the tournament opener and needing just 10.1 overs to knock off the runs.

This will be Afghanistan's sixth appearance at a T20 World Cup, but they'll be hard pushed to make it to the knockout stages.

Afghanistan's aim will likely be to better their two wins from five matches they achieved in the UAE last year, starting against England in Perth on October 22.

Normally a side blessed with plenty of spin options, Afghanistan have wisely opted to bolster their pace-bowling for Australian conditions, with 20-year-old right-arm quick Salim Safi earning a maiden international call up.

Australia

The defending champions are, according to Marcus Stoinis, in the top two favourites for the competition, despite some middling performances in the warm up to the tournament. 

The batting has been somewhat shaky from the hosts, something that will need to improve upon if they are to retain the title that they won so impressively in the United Arab Emirates.

Some of those batting questions are being aimed at skipper Aaron Finch, given he failed to pass 20 in his last eight ODI innings before announcing his retirement from the format in September.

Finch has been better in T20 cricket, including hitting 76 against India at the Gabba last week, but Australia has still lost three of its last four matches in the format — and is arguably lucky that the rain intervened to deny England what would have likely been another win in Canberra.

England

England are being considered by some as a favourite for the tournament in Australia.

The way they managed to knock off Australia in successive matches in the build up, it's easy to see why.

England only won two of their six matches earlier this year, losing both home series to India and South Africa 2-1.

However, England have won their last five completed T20I's, including two against Australia. 

And this is all without opener Jonny Bairstow, who broke his leg on the golf course last month — Josh Inglis can empathise.

England still has a powerhouse squad though, with Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali, Chris Jordan, Mark Wood and Chris Woakes all named in England's 15 — although there has been a late setback as Reece Topley was ruled out with an ankle injury.

They're joined by a number of emerging talents, such as big-hitting Perth Scorchers batter Liam Livingstone and a returning one, in the formerly ostracised Alex Hales.

Ireland

Coming into the 2022 World Cup, Ireland had only won four matches, the most famous of which was a three-wicket victory over England in India.

Paul Stirling was there in 2011 and the last time Ireland progressed to the second phase of a World Cup tournament back in 2009.

He was there again on Friday, scoring an unbeaten 66 from 48 as the Irish thumped the West Indies to progress to the Super 12. 

After such a crushing victory, can Ireland do any damage to the established names?

It's been a true all round effort so far for Ireland, with no one stand out performer, but anything can happen in T20 cricket.

New Zealand

Last year's beaten finalists come into the tournament having won three of their six warm up matches.

It's not entirely convincing and, given Australia recently dished out a 3-0 hammering in their ODI series, you'd think the Kiwis have it all to do against the likes of Australia.

They are ranked fifth in the ICC rankings, but with such an experienced line-up, including the seventh-ranked T20 batter in the world in Devon Conway, the Black Caps have the players to make a deep run in Australia.

Sri Lanka

It was a tough start for Sri Lanka at this World Cup.

After being thrown into the initial qualifying phase of the competition, the three-time finalists were stunned by Namibia in the tournament's opening game, putting them immediately on the back foot.

However, the recent Asia Cup champions recovered from that initial set back to win their next two matches and are now definitely contenders the T20 World Cup.

No team has won more T20 World Cup matches than the 2014 champions — and none who have played more than five matches have a better winning percentage.

The uptick in form that Wanindu Hasaranga showed with the ball in the latter stages of the Asia Cup certainly marks him out as a player to watch.

He took nine wickets, the second highest of anyone.

Group 2
Bangladesh

After recording no wins at the Asia Cup and with veteran Mushfiqur Rahim deciding to ditch international T20 cricket in the aftermath, Bangladesh's prep for the T20 World Cup can't exactly be described as ideal.

Bangladesh are the only side to have played in all seven previous T20 World Cup tournaments without reaching so much as a single semi-final — and it's hard to see them breaking that duck in Australia.

In their October World Cup prep, Bangladesh are 0-5, with a sixth match washed out for rain.

Shakib al Hasan, the world's number one T20 all rounder, will shoulder a tremendous workload and Bangladesh's chances of a decent run will live and die with his ability with bat and ball.

Mosaddek Hossain led the run-scoring for Bangladesh at the Asia Cup though and, if he can continue his form then the Tigers could still spring a surprise or two.

India

India, the number one-ranked team in the world, has not won the T20 World Cup since the inaugural tournament in 2007. 

In the six tournaments since then, India have mustered just one other finals appearance, collecting recriminations and accusations instead of the expected silverware.

Key all rounder Ravindra Jadeja suffered a knee injury that will rule him out of the World Cup at the Asia Cup and, with the importance of spin in the shortest format of the game growing every year, his absence will be keenly felt by the Indians.

Viral Kohli though, comes into the tournament off the back of some welcome form, after scoring his first ever T20 international century against Afghanistan — crucially ending a torrid 1,021-day gap between international tons — and ended the tournament as second-highest run scorer.

Netherlands

The Netherlands are ranked 17th in the T20 world rankings, meaning getting to the Super 12 phase of the tournament is a serious achievement.

The Dutch progressed off the back of some solid run scoring from opener Max O'Dowd (129 at a strike rate of 121.69), who scored 71 not out in the defeat to Sri Lanka.

Bas de Leede has been impressive with the ball too, taking seven wickets in the tournament so far, but there will be concerns over the fitness of Roelof van der Merwe, who limped off the field in that final-game defeat. 

Pakistan

All eyes will be on Pakistan's opening match at the MCG on Sunday October 23, a crucial meeting with India, but Pakistan should look further than just that one blockbuster match.

The Asia Cup was, admittedly, a mixed bag, with Pakistan at times looking like world beaters but at others the very opposite.

Mohammad Rizwan led the run-scoring in the tournament and is now ranked by the ICC as the best T20 batter in the world — a title he looked especially worthy of in his match-winning 71 off 51 against India.

Rizwan played something of a lone hand in the UAE, his 281 runs eclipsing the efforts of Pakistan's next three highest run scorers — Iftikhar Ahmed (105), Fakhar Zaman (96) and Mohammad Nawaz (79) — combined.

The 2009 champions cannot be written off though and, if Naseem Shah continues his excellent form with the ball, no team will relish facing them.

South Africa

The Proteas could definitely have considered themselves unlucky at last year's tournament.

Winning four of their five group-stage matches, the same number as England and Australia, the South Africans missed out on a spot in the semi-finals due to net run rate.

South Africa should be considered one of the favourites this year though, and have won their only completed match in the warm up period in Australia after a 2-1 T20 series defeat against India in the sub continent.

In Tabraiz Shamsi, South Africa have the second-best bowler in the ICC T20 rankings and in Aiden Markram, the second-best batter.

The tournament will be the last as coach for Mark Boucher, who told management of his decision after the Test series defeat to England in September.

Zimbabwe

Had never made it past the first phase of a T20 World Cup before Friday's five-wicket victory over Scotland saw them top Group B.

Sikandar Raza was superb against Scotland, with his 40 ensuring he topped the run-scoring charts at the end of the first pool phase with 136 runs, but skipper Craig Ervine was the real difference maker, scoring a match-saving 58 off 54 balls.

Blessing Muzarabani has taken six wickets in his three games so far to lead the bowlers.

Zimbabwe's two defeats in the pool phase and warm up matches have come against Sri Lanka and the West Indies, and with a first-up match against South Africa on the horizon, things won't get any easier.

When (and where) does Australia play?

Australia are in action this very Saturday evening, taking on New Zealand at the SCG from 6:00pm AEDT.

You can follow the live blog of Australia's opening match on the ABC Sport website, as well as listen to all the action on ABC Radio or the ABC Listen App.

Australia then meets Sri Lanka on Tuesday at 10:00pm AEDT in Perth, before fronting up against England on Friday October 28 at 7:00pm AEDT back in Melbourne.

A match against Ireland on Monday at the Gabba at 7:00pm AEDT then follows, with the Aussies finishing the group phase in Adelaide against Afghanistan on Friday November 4.

In case you're wondering, yes, that is a lot of travel, about 13,000km in 13 days, more than any other nation faces.

When is the final?
