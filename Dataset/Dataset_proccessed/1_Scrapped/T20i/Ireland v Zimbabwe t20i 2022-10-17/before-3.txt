KudaChiwandire TakeMoney

As you will know by now Zimbabwean boxer Kuda Chiwandire, also known as Take Money has retained her WBC interim Super Bantamweight title after winning her fight against Mexico’s Zuli Munoz.

She did so by unanimous decision in front of an enthusiastic local crowd at the Rainbow Towers International Conference Centre.

The win means she now has a shot at the WBC gold title. In effect she is a mandatory challenger for the title. It is currently held by Mexico’s Yamileth Mercado who has defended it three times. She was set to defend it again on Saturday night.

She has quite rightly gotten massive attention from across the board, becoming a source of pride for the country.

Of Chiwandire’s achievement, Star FM Zimbabwe sports boss Steve Vickers said, ‘She’s Zimbabwe’s most successful boxer ever – male or female, in terms of level of titles won.”

And this is why this is one of the most important moments in Zimbabwean sporting history. It is up there with the women’s team qualifying for the Olympics, the Gems going to the Netball World Cup for the first time ever, the men’s national football team qualifying for Afcon and more. It is a statement, a door shut before which clears a path for future generations, male or female to chase glory.

Chiwandire did it against a vastly experienced Munoz, showing that with determination, anything is possible. Munoz has been a world champion five times.

It also sheds light on a sport which has had a couple of false starts since the heights of the 80s and 90s when the likes Proud ‘Kilimanjaro’ Chinembiri, Alfonso Zvenyika “Mosquito” Lambarda and the late John ‘Bonyongo the Destroyer’ Mutema ruled the roost.

What it means is that is that more spotlight will come to the sport and this will be the tonic needed for a discipline which has the potential to get many involved.

And finally, the fact that a high-profile fight like that was held in Zimbabwe can do little harm for the country as a sports tourism destination.

All the better when you win.
