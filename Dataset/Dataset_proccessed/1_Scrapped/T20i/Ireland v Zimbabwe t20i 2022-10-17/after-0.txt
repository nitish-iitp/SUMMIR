An all-round performance by Sikandar Raza guided Zimbabwe to their first victory of the ICC T20 World Cup 2022 as they defeated Ireland by 31 runs in Hobart. Fiery bowling spells from Blessing Muzarabani, Richard Ngarava got Zimbabwe the better off Ireland in the Group B fixture. Raza scored 82 off just 48 balls and Muzurbani clinched 3 wickets giving away just 23 runs to restrict Ireland to just 143/9 after 20 overs.

Chasing 175, Ireland was off to a horrendous start. Medium-pace duo of Richard Ngarava and Blessing Muzarabani unleashed terror on Ireland, sending back Paul Stirling (0), Lorcan Tucker (11), Harry Tector (1) and captain Andrew Balbirnie (3) within a space of just 22 runs in 3.5 overs. Curtis Campher and George Dockrell joined forces to take their side safely through powerplay overs. At the end of the powerplay in six overs, Ireland was at 33/4, with Dockrell (4*) and Campher (6*). Ireland crossed the 50-run mark in eight overs. (READ: Sikandar Raza breaks THIS record in Ireland match)

The partnership between the duo ended at 42 runs after a delivery by Sikandar Raza castled Dockrell's middle stump. He was back in the pavillion for 24 off 20 balls. Ireland was five down for 64 runs. Campher and Gareth Delany added 27 more runs to the total before Sean Williams dislodged the former's stumps, dismissing him for 27 off 22 balls. Ireland crossed the 100-run mark in 13.5 overs and still needed 75 runs in 37 balls. Medium pacer Tendai Chatara strengthened Zimbabwe's hold in the match, dismissing Delany (24) and Simi Singh (0) to reduce their opponents to 102/8 in 14.5 overs.

Muzarabani got his third wicket in the match when he dismissed Mark Adair for 9 off 10 balls. Ireland finished their innings at 143/9 in 20 overs, losing the match by 31 runs. Barry McCarthy (22*) and Joshua Little (7*) were unbeaten for their side. Muzarbani (3/23) was the standout bowler for Zimbabwe and troubled the opponents with his line and length. Chatara and Ngarava took 2/22 each. Williams and Raza got one wicket each.

What an amazing knock by Sikandar Raza - 82 (48) with 5 fours and 5 sixes. Zimbabwe were at 37/3 in 5 overs when he came, they finished with 174/7.

Raza and Shumba brought up their 50-run stand. Their partnership was cut short by 58 runs soon after Shumba gave a catch to Little at short fine leg on a delivery by pacer Mark Adair. He was dismissed for 16 off 14 balls. At the time of his dismissal, Zimbabwe was 137/5 in 15.5 overs. Little picked up his third wicket of the match, sending back Ryan Burl (1). (With ANI inputs)
