Zimbabwe, on Monday, October 17, defeated Ireland by 31 runs in the T20 World Cup 2022 Group B match at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart.

Prior to the game, Ireland had won five out of eight T20Is against the African nation, but looked out of sorts on Monday.

After being put in to bat first, Zimbabwe racked up 174 for the loss of seven wickets in 20 overs. Regis Chakabva and skipper Craig Ervine perished for single digits. Wesley Madhevere and Sean Williams scored 22 and 12 runs respectively, but failed to carry on.

After they got out, it was Sikandar Raza, who threw the kitchen sink at everything to score 82 runs off 48 balls with the help of five fours and as many sixes. Luke Jongwe gave the Zimbabwean innings a final kick, scoring an unbeaten 10-ball 20.

Josh Little was the standout bowler for Ireland with three wickets. Mark Adair and Simi Singh accounted for two wickets apiece.

Ireland found the going tough in their run-chase after being reduced to 33 for four in the powerplay. Paul Stirling, Andy Balbirnie, Lorcan Tucker and Harry Tector scored 15 runs.

Blessing Muzarabani and Richard Ngarava picked up two wickets apiece and put Zimbabwe in a commanding position. Curtis Campher and George Dockrell put on 42 runs for the fourth wicket, but both batters perished in quick succession.

Gareth Delany hit one four and a six to score 24 off 20 before Tendai Chatara got rid of him. Simi Singh, batting at No.9, bagged a golden duck as Ireland lost their last recognized batter.

Barry McCarthy scored a quick-fire 16-ball 22, but all the knock did was mitigate the damage. Barring Jongwe, all the other Zimbabwean bowlers performed well.
