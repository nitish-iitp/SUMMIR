Ball-by-ball commentary: SportsTiger App


Preview:


The fourth match of the T20 World Cup 2022 qualifiers will be an action pack thriller as it will bring two teams from the Group B up against each other. Zimbabwe will be up against Ireland in a thrilling contest as both sides will look to start their WC campaign on high. While Zimbabwe are placed at the 11th spot in the ICC men's T20I team rankings, Ireland is just behind with 187 rating points.


Pitch Report:


The surface at Hobart generally delivers high-scoring game but even bowlers can enjoy their outing as they will have a chance to swing the ball. Both teams will be eager to chase the total considering the rain prediction on the day.


Team Analysis:


Zimbabwe:


Zimbabwe has been in an amazing form lately as the side has lost just one T20I against the five played. Blessing Muzarabani will lead the pace attack which has been in top form. While, batters like Sikandar Raza, Sean Williams, and Craig Ervine are expected to perform well against Ireland.


Ireland:


Ireland will be hoping to script a new chapter in the T20 World Cup campaign after early elimination in the last edition. Skipper Andrew Balbirnie and Paul Stirling will be crucial for the side as they both bring lot of experience and possess great ability to win games.


Match Prediction:


  


Conclusion:


Zimbabwe is looking in top-form and will be favorites against Ireland. Although Paul Stirling-starrer Ireland should not be underestimated but Zimbabwe is currently hitting the rich chords in all the departments. Zimbabwe is likely to win the fourth match of the T20 World Cup 2022.
