Brisbane Heat won by 15 runs
PLAYER OF THE MATCH
Josh Brown

21:49 Local Time, 11:49 GMT, 17:19 IST: Second win for the Heat in the competition and they would be happy. They needed a win and they have had one. Sydney tried really hard but were left to do too much in the end. That catch from Neser off Silk also turned the fortunes around for the Heat as Silk seemed determined to ruin the party for the Heat. Josh Brown set the tone, McSweeney got going with a fine 84 and 224 was what the Heat got. Sydney started off well but lost too many wickets for their chase never to find some momentum. Silk tried his best towards the end but the exceptional catch ended the hopes for the Sixers. These two teams meet again in a couple of days. And we will meet you sooner. Happy New Year everyone! Toodles...

Josh Brown, Player of the Match: Awesome to get a win. I haven't played before such a huge crowd.

19.2

Whiteley to Abbott, out Caught by (sub)Bryant!! The man at deep mid takes it. He had to stay under the ball for a long long time but he takes it with elan. That was a slot ball and Abbott went for the slog across the line only to get a lot of height and nothing else. That should be it. Abbott could have played some big shots but he has to depart. The Sixers have fought well, one must admit that. Abbott c (sub)Bryant b Whiteley 14(9) [6s-1]

Whiteley to Abbott, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

18.2

Steketee to Silk, out Caught by Neser at long-off!! The calmness of a saint has allowed Neser to take that. It is a sensational catch. The balance of his body while going over twice was outstanding. He almost tripped over the fence but released the ball. He realized that he released it a little too much over the fence. Went beyond the fence, took it with both his feet in the air. Then looped it back and took it again inside the fence. Simply outstanding. The ease with which he took it was ridiculous. He never looked out of control despite the ball being so close to the fence. Silk c Neser b Steketee 41(23) [4s-3 6s-2]

Steketee to Silk, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

What happened there? Has the fielder at long-off taken a stunner? He went over the ropes but did he let go off the ball twice? It is a legal ball. The fielder caught it at the edge of the fence. He threw it before going over. Then picks the ball up with both his feet in the air. Loops it back into the playing area and then comes back to take it.
