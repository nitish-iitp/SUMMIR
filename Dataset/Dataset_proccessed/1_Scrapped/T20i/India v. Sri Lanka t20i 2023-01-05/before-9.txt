PLAYER OF THE MATCH
Gurinder Sandhu

So that's it from this ripper of a contest. The BBL is off to a thrilling start. We'll be back with more tomorrow. Until then, it's goodbye!

Gurinder Sandhu | Player of the Match: I was pretty clear (about the game-changing six). I played with Beau (Webster) for a while and kind of knew what was coming. So the plan was to stay still and swing hard and the rest will take care of itself. The wicket was a bit tricky, some were gripping and sticking and we knew that some of those low totals are gonna get tricky, but it was a great game. Our (team) communication on the field is very good, soon after the first 2-3 overs, we reacted and planned accordingly as a bowling group. Good morale boost this win and keeps us going for the rest of the competition.

22:41 Local Time, 11:41 GMT, 17:11 IST: Such drama to kick off this season's BBL. 123 didn't seem like a very challenging target, but Thunder have only scraped over the line off the final ball by one wicket. And they've done it thanks to a cameo from Sandhu who came up with a defining blow in the final over. It was a pitch where not a single batter found it easy, with Alex Ross's 28 off 27 balls being the top individual score of the evening. The seamers found a lot of joy taking pace off with their cutters - Farooqui, Sams and Sandhu for the Thunder, and Coulter-Nile and Boult for Stars. The substitute Brody Couch took a couple of memorable catches in the chase. Zampa got his 100th BBL wicket. But it was Sandhu who finished it off in the end, taking the Thunder off to a winning start.

19.6

Webster to Gurinder Sandhu, byes, 1 run, Thunder win it! Sandhu was beaten but the keeper missed it completely and it goes through for byes! Oh dear! Webster is on his haunces as Thunder get over the line. This is a full delivery outside leg, following Sandhu as he backs away. It goes right through him. But the keeper had taken his right glove off prior to the delivery in case he needed to throw it - and he fails to collect the ball. What a finish

Thunder win it!

19.5

Webster to Gurinder Sandhu, no run, it's not over yet. Will go down to the final ball. This is back of a length on leg, Sandhu makes room looking to go through the off-side with the field in the ring, but mistimes it to cover

19.4

Webster to Gurinder Sandhu, SIX, this has gone for six! Oh would you believe it! Big swing across the line, and the whole game swings with it. Sandhu dispatches this length ball over midwicket to level the scores. What drama to kick off the BBL

19.3

Webster to Doggett, 1 run, knocks this length ball gently through mid-on

Brendan Doggett, right handed bat, comes to the crease

19.2

Webster to Fazalhaq Farooqi, out Bowled!! Webster has two in two! He keeps it straight, and Farooqi misses. Big heave across the line from Farooqi to a length ball that skids through and knocks over the stumps. Just one more wicket left with Thunder needing 8 off 4. Fazalhaq Farooqi b Webster 0(1)

Webster to Fazalhaq Farooqi, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

Fazalhaq Farooqi, right handed bat, comes to the crease

19.1

Webster to Chris Green, out Caught by (sub)Brody Couch!! No wayyy! Brody Couch, you absolute ripper! Oh this is a catch you'll never get tired of watching, and what a crucial time to pluck it off. Green advances, hits this length ball in the air down the ground, and it's going over Couch at long-off who's standing well inside the boundary. But he pedals back, then leaps one-handed, catches it at full stretch as he's falling backwards, and hangs onto it! Incredible stuff. Chris Green c (sub)Brody Couch b Webster 17(20)

Webster to Chris Green, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

Beau Webster [3.0-0-12-0] is back into the attack

Eight needed off the final over. It's Webster with the ball. Green on strike

18.5

Luke Wood to Gurinder Sandhu, FOUR, this time he connects! Slower one that sits up from a short of length, Sandhu waits on it and slogs it over mid-on who is in the ring
