When the last time the two teams met each other in the T20 World Cup in 2022, Kohli played a sensational 82-run* knock to snatch a win for India from the jaws of defeat. It was one of the most memorable knocks in the mega India vs Pakistan rivalry over the years. Kohli will once again pose a threat to Pakistan in the T20 WC this year in June.

However, the Pakistan skipper has toned down Kohli's threat despite calling him one of the best in business.

"As a team, you always plan against different teams and according to their strengths. We don't plan anything against only one player. We plan for all 11 players. We don't know much about the conditions in New York and we will plan accordingly. He [Virat Kohli] is one of the best players, and we will plan against him as well," Babar said at the press conference ahead of the Ireland tour.
