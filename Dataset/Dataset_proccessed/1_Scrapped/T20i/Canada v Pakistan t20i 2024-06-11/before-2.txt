Pakistan Qualification Scenario T20 World Cup 2024: Shaheen Shah Afridi, right, consoles batting partner Naseem Shah as they leave the field after their loss in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup cricket match between India and Pakistan at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in Westbury, New York, Sunday, June 9, 2024. AP/PTI

Pakistan’s T20 World Cup campaign is in shambles after two consecutive losses in Group A matches. Currently placed at number 4, Pakistan are on the brink of elimination.

Men in Green suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of the USA in their first league match and the losing streak continued as they were humbled by Rohit Sharma-led India in New York on Sunday.

Pakistan’s current Net Run Rate is horrible -0.150. Amid all this, Babar Azam & co can still pull off a surprise and make their way to the Super 8 stage of the tournament.

IND VS PAK T20 MATCH: WHAT EXACTLY ARE DROP-IN PITCHES AND HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL PITCHES?

How is it possible? Well, as of now, Pakistan have zero points from their two losses. This means that they need to win their next two matches to keep the dream alive. Pakistan will face Ireland and Canada in their next games. This does not end here. Now comes the tricky part which Pakistan just can’t control and only hope. They should hope that the USA and Canada don’t register any more wins.

But even if Pakistan win their next two games and Canada and USA remain without any victory, the NRR will play a crucial role. Qualifying for the Super 8 stage would mean the team that has superior NRR goes into the next segment.
