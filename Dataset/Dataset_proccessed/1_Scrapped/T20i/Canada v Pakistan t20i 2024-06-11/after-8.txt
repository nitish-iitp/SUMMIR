Pakistan vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: PAK vs CAN – Babar reflects on Pakistan’s first win of 2024 World Cup

Pakistan vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: PAK vs CAN – Reflecting on Pakistan’s first win of the 2024 World Cup, skipper Babar admitted that the NRR was on the back of the mind of the batters while completing the run chase against Canada. Babar’s Pakistan completed the run chase in 17.3 overs to outclass Canada by 7 wickets. “Good for us. We needed this win. Credit to the team. We started well and took wickets with the new ball. We had NRR on the back of mind. The first six overs are very crucial here. You assess after 6 overs. Then we tried to take on the spinners. We are going to go with the same mindset. The conditions at Florida should be better from here as well. I got out to the same shot. So, I was angry. I still try my level best,” the Pakistan skipper said after the match.

Pakistan vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: PAK vs CAN – Pakistan climb to third spot in Group A

Pakistan have replaced Canada by taking the third spot on the Group A points table. With the seven-wicket defeat to their name, Saad Bin Zafar's men are placed fourth in the T20 World Cup standings."Was a bit disappointing. The wicket was difficult to bat on. The Pakistani bowlers bowled well. We were about 25-30 short. We needed to get some early wickets. We don't get to play high calibre teams. Johnson played well. Kirton's run-out was crucial. Lot of positives to take from this game," the Canada skipper said.
