Melbourne Cup-winning jockey Mark Zahra's 'miracle' ride on Gold Trip 12 months after ban

Melbourne Cup-winning jockey Mark Zahra has opened up on an emotional 12-month journey to the biggest triumph of his career.

Zahra executed to perfection in the 3200m race as Gold Trip comfortably beat Emissary, High Emocean and Deauville Legend to the finishing post.

The emotions for Zahra were a stark contrast to this time a year ago when he was suspended and watched the horse he was supposed to ride, Verry Elleegant, take out the Melbourne Cup.

"This time last year in Byron Bay and I was getting told off for drinking too much and it could have been my ride. Redemption day today. Just a miracle," he recalled.

"Twelve months ago I felt terrible and probably drinking my way out of it and (people around him) were saying don't drink too much.

"I said, 'What do you want me to do? My horse just won the Melbourne Cup'."

While it wasn't the most thrilling finish as Gold Trip steamed away from the pack in the final straight, Zahra revealed that he was still feeling the nerves as he raced towards the finish line.

"I was hoping no-one would come near me. It's just elation when I crossed the line," he said.

"The last 50m I was thinking I'm going to win this. It just went forever the last bit. And I still can't believe it. Melbourne Cup, it's unbelievable."

Zahra was shaken immediately after crossing the finish line, admitting, "I feel like crying".

Incredibly, Gold Trip had just one race win prior to taking out the Melbourne Cup.

The horse was trained by Ciaron Maher and David Eustace, and the UK-born Eustace was left in disbelief at the result.

"It's the pinnacle for our sport. To do it with Ciaron, I'm so grateful to be training with him. And it's just a great honour to be doing that with all these good horses and an amazing team of staff that we have," he said.

"It's a full credit to them to get five here and to this horse who was so unlucky in the Caulfield Cup and so gutted when he got beat. And I thought he would get beat again. It's just quite incredible.

"Obviously the race you know sort of exists. A bit later in my life I suppose from English racing. But ever since I've been here that's just the race you want to be contesting in and hopefully getting the chance to do that. So to win it is quite extraordinary."
