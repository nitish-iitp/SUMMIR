BCCI Looking For a New Coach

The Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI Secretary Jay Shah announced that the Indian board will be inviting applications for its men’s team head coach soon.

Current Indian team coach Rahul Dravid’s tenure as head coach ends after the T20 World Cup and the BCCI will begin to hunt for a new coach in the coming days. Shah stated that current coach Dravid can re-apply if he wants to.

“Rahul Dravid’s tenure is till the World Cup, we will be inviting applications soon for the post of head coach and if Dravid wants to re-apply, he can do it. We have decided on the criteria. Thereafter we will invite applications for support staff in consultation with the Cricket Advisory Committee. The coach’s tenure will be three years,” Shah said during an interaction in Mumbai on Thursday.

The Indian team will be traveling the T20 World Cup to West Indies and the USA next month in two batches, Shah informed.

Those whose IPL teams don’t qualify for the playoffs will be leaving on May 24.

“The team will be traveling in two batches, the first batch will travel on the 24th of this month while the rest after IPL gets over,” Shah added.
Impact player rule to be discussed

The Indian board is going to discuss the ‘Impact Player’ rule with all stakeholders during its meeting which will happen once the T20 World Cup gets over in the West Indies. The rule has drawn heavy debate during this season of IPL especially since it reduced the all-rounders’ role to a minimum. Players Shivam Dube headed to the World Cup, didn’t get a chance to bowl for Chennai Super Kings, as he was used as an Impact player by his IPL franchise.

The rule as per Shah, was used as a ‘test’ during this season of IPL and it wasn’t a permanent rule. The BCCI is ready to take a call for next season after consulting all stakeholders going ahead.

“Impact player was used as a test (in this IPL), it was done so that two Indian players could get a chance. It’s not permanent, we will have a discussion with the Indian team captain, players, franchises, and coaches and then take a call on it. The meeting can happen once the World Cup is over.” Shah explained.

The Indian board is also going to discuss the matter of retention of players whenever they meet IPL owners next.

Meanwhile, Indian team coach Dravid, Head of NCA-VVS Laxman, chairman of selection committee Ajit Agarkar, and the Indian board’s general manager of cricket operations, Abbey Kuruvilla have recommended a few changes in domestic cricket which the board is scheduled to implement.

The board is definitely considering a relook at the timing of Ranji Trophy games played in winters that saw many games ending without any results due to fog.

“We have received suggestions for domestic cricket and we will be implementing them. Like the weather in parts of North Zone needs to be considered,” Shah added.
