CRICKET TICKETS 2024

All You Need To Know About Cricket

Cricket is a team sport with 11 players per side, played on a 22-yard pitch with wickets at each end. The batting team aims to score runs by hitting the ball and switching places between the striker and nonstriker. Runs are also earned through boundaries or illegal balls. The fielding team tries to dismiss batters by bowling them out, catching the ball, or hitting the stumps before the batter reaches the crease. An innings ends when ten batters are dismissed, and teams then switch roles.

Cricket has different formats, from fast-paced Twenty20 (T20) to longer Test matches played over five days. Traditional cricket attire is white, but limited-overs formats use team colors, and players wear protective gear due to the hard leather ball. The International Cricket Council (ICC) governs cricket, while the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) maintains the rules. The sport has global appeal, with a history dating back to mid-16th century England. Australia is the most successful international cricket team, with multiple World Cup titles and Test rankings. Women's cricket, organized separately, also has international standing.

The Evolution of Cricket

Cricket's origins trace back to late 16th-century England, with the sport gaining a firm footing in the 18th century. It spread internationally in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the first formal Test cricket matches played in 1877. Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport, just behind association football (soccer). The International Cricket Council (ICC) governs the sport, with over 100 member countries, though only twelve play Test cricket. The game's rules are laid out in the "Laws of Cricket," and it offers a variety of formats, from short T-10 matches, which last about 90 minutes, to Test matches, which can extend up to five days.

Top Cricket Players in the World 2024

A comprehensive look at the leading cricket players currently dominating the game.

1. Ravindra Jadeja- Ravindra Jadeja, who leads the Test all-rounder rankings by a wide margin, is a versatile cricketer. He's a skilled batter in all formats and a brilliant spinner, adept at both attacking in subcontinental conditions and holding his ground overseas. Plus, his fielding skills are among the best in the world.

2. Jasprit Bumrah- Jasprit Bumrah is undoubtedly the best bowler in the world. It's beyond debate; he's the go-to bowler for any situation, whether it's the opening over of a Test match or the final over of a limited-overs game.

3. Rachin Ravindra- Rachin Ravindra, much like Jaiswal, has made a name for himself swiftly. His stellar performances in the World Cup and his all-round skills in the Test series against South Africa highlight his importance to the Black Caps. Ravindra is now a crucial player for New Zealand in all three formats.
