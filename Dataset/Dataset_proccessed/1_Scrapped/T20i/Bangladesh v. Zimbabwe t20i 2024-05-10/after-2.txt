Zimbabwe started the 2023 year on the back of an impressive T20 World Cup 2022 and were truly one of the toughest sides across the half of 2023, but things took an adverse turn for the African nation, as their heartbreaking defeat to Scotland denied them a spot in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 India, and when it looked like that they have all but qualified for the T20 World Cup 2024, they suffered a historic loss to the minnows Uganda, who will be playing their maiden cricket World Cup.
