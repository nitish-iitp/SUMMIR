COMMENTRY
That is it from this game then! Another game follows. That game will be played on the 12th. It begins at 0930 IST (0400 GMT). Till then, goodbye and take care!
Najmul Hossain Shanto says the openers batted really well. Adds they should have batted better. Adds the bowlers were brilliant and they did a really good job.
Mustafizur Rahman has been given the MAN OF THE MATCH AWARD! He says he loves playing for the country. Adds the wicket suited him and hence, he could bowl well.
Sikandar Raza says he is happy with how the youngsters are doing. Admits the fielding cost them and Bangladesh were really good in the field. Adds he needs to contribute more and he is disappointed he is failing to do so. Credits the bowlers for the way they came back but more is required of the batters. Ends by saying there is a lot they need to work on and they'll try to do better going ahead.
IN reply, Bangladesh bowlers were brilliant, the likes of Taskin and Shakib ran through the top order. However, Zimbabwe fought back well then courtesy the lower order. Brian Bennett, Wellington Masakadza and Ryan Burl! Mustafizur Rahman though was exceptional at the death. He got important wickets and yet again the game shifted towards the hosts. The lower order continued to fight for the visitors. They get it down to 7 needed in three but it was Shakib who kept his cool and helped his side come out on top.
What a game of cricket! Wow! Credit to Zimbabwe as they showed excellent fight yet again but kudos to Bangladesh to defend a total which we felt was just under par. This though was a game of comebacks. First it was Zimbabwe! Bangladesh were 100 for no loss but Zimbabwe bowled well in the second half and bowled the visitors out for below 150.

OUT! TIMBER! Zimbabwe fall heart-breakingly short. That is probably what Wellington Masakadza did not want Richard Ngarava to do! Short ball, around off, Ngarava swings for the heavens and misses. The ball crashes onto the stumps and you have got to feel for the visitors. So near, yet so far. I remember my ex-colleague covering a WI-Pak Test match where Shannon Gabriel did all the hard work of staying with Roston Chase to try and draw the Test. Only, to see Gabriel swing wildly across to Yasir on the last ball of the penultimate over (which turned out to be the last) and have West Indies lose that match. Same feeling. Dhaka won't mind as Bangladesh win by 5 runs and go 4-0 up!

OUT! STUMPED! But it is a wide which means Zimbabwe now need 6 in 3 but only have one wicket in hand and Richard Ngarava is on strike. He sees Blessing Muzarabani come down the track and fires it wide outside off. Blessing swings but misses and the keeper does the rest.

SIX! Bang! Gets hold of this and it goes all the way. What a time to hit a biggie. 7 needed in 3 now. Steps out, gets to the pitch of it and lofts it over the long on fence for a biggie.

TWO! What an effort. Can this be the difference? This is on middle. Blessing Muzarabani gets hold of this. He slams it towards long on. The fielder runs to his right, takes it but realises the momentum is taking him over the ropes. He throws it back in. Saves four for his side. 14 needed in 6.

OUT! TAKEN! Yet again, the Fizz makes the breakthrough. Top stuff. A slower one on middle, Faraz Akram does not pick it. He is through the loft, it goes towards deep mid-wicket and it is taken. 16 in 9 needed.
