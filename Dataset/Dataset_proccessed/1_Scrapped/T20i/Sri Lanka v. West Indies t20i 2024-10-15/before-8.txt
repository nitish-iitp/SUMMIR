The West Indies cricket team has arrived in Dambulla for their white-ball tour of Sri Lanka.

The West Indies are set to play three T20Is and three ODI's between 10-27 October.

Several senior players, including Nicholas Pooran, Andre Russell, Akeal Hosein, and Shimron Hetmyer, have opted out of the tour.

Head coach Darren Sammy says this has opened up opportunities for other players to make a case for a place in the West Indies T20I and ODI teams.

"My guys are ready to ake on a really strong Sri Lankan team. We've given some guys come opportunities with the World Cup in less than 20 months and with some of our senior players unavailable," he said.
