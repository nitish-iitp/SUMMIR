It’s time for the ninth edition of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup — the very first cricket world cup that the US will co-host. Between June 1 and June 29, a record 20 cricket teams will play 55 matches for the 2024 T20 World Cup trophy. The action continues today with the USA vs. Ireland at 10:30 a.m., followed by Nepal vs. South Africa tonight at 7:30 p.m. and New Zealand vs. Uganda at 8:30 p.m. Are you ready to watch the cricket world cup? Unfortunately, in the US, the sport still airs on the niche Willow TV, which you may not already have access to. But we’ve got you covered. Here’s everything you need to know about where to stream matches, how to watch for free, the full cricket world cup schedule and more.

When is the T20 World Cup 2024?

The cricket world cup began on Saturday, June 1, 2024. The tournament continues today, June 14, with the USA vs. Ireland at 10:30 a.m., followed by Nepal vs. South Africa tonight at 7:30 p.m. and New Zealand vs. Uganda at 8:30 p.m.

Where is the T20 World Cup 2024?

USA and the West Indies are co-hosting the 2024 T20 World Cup, and matches will be played across nine venues in Dallas, Bridgetown, Providence, New York, Lauderhill, North Sound, Gros Islet, Kingstown and Tarouba.

What channel is the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup on?

In the US, the cricket world cup will air exclusively on Willow TV. You may not have the niche cricket cable channel in your current package, or no longer have cable at all. But don’t worry, you can sign up for Willow TV directly, or add it to a live TV streaming service like Sling or DirecTV Stream. You can also check out other ways to stream the cricket world cup for free (or almost free) with the help of a VPN below.

How to watch the cricket world cup for free (almost):

While in the US, the T20 World Cup will be airing exclusively on Willow TV (which you'll need cable or a subscription for), in Australia it's all streaming on Amazon Prime Video — so all you need to do to tune in is be a Prime subscriber.

Don’t live in Australia? Don't worry, you can still stream like you do with the help of a VPN. A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you’re looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to the cricket world cup on Amazon Prime in Australia, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

(ExpressVPN)

Watch the cricket world cup
ExpressVPN

In Australia, viewers are able to tune into all 55 matches of the cricket world cup on Amazon Prime Video. While you may not live in Australia, you can still stream like you do with a VPN. But ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning US viewers can tune into international shows, movies and sporting events as opposed to paying for US coverage. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location to Australua, and then find the games on Amazon Prime Video. 

ExpressVPN’s added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 49% when they sign up for ExpressVPN’s 12-month subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.
