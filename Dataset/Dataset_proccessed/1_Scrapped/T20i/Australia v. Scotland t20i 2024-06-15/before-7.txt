BY Gaurav Thakur

India booked their ticket for the Super 8 ticket after defeating USA to earn third straight win in the tournament. The Men In Blue had earlier defeated Ireland and Pakistan in their first two games.

And, the Windies advanced to the next round of the ICC T20 World Cup with a 13-run victory against New Zealand in the 26th match. Earlier in the tournament, the co-hosts thrashed Uganda by 134 runs, and defeated Papua New Guinea by 5 wickets.

Speaking of Afghanistan, their journey has been nothing short of exemplary. The team secured their sport in the Super Eights with 6 points from 3 matches and notably the highest NNR (+4.230). Rashid Khan and Co defeated Papua New Guinea by seven wickets in Trinidad, thereby simultaneously eliminating New Zealand.

In a twist of fate, England have made their way to the next stage of the t20 World Cup 2024. They first defeated Namibia by a huge margin of 41 runs equaling the points (5) with the second placed team Scotland and then waited for Australia to beat Scotland by 5 wickets. By the virtue of better NNR (+3.611) the defending champions get back on the track.
