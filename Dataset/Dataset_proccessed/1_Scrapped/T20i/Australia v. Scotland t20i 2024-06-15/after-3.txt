Mark Watt to Glenn Maxwell, no run
94.6kph

OUT! CASTLED! An absolute seed by Mark Watt! Glenn Maxwell stands there in disbelief. Watt comes from around the wicket for the right-hander and spears it in, on a short length, on off and middle, the ball holds its line as Maxwell shapes up to work it across the line. It actually catches the outside edge of the bat and goes through to peg the off-stump back. A timely breakthrough for Scotland just as Australia were starting to put their foot down.

SIX! Adam Zampa makes a mess of it and it goes over the fence. Australia have not been upto the mark in the field this game. Starc bends his back and bangs it into the deck, at the batter, Matthew Cross swivels and pulls it flat and towards deep backward square leg. Adam Zampa isn't too far away from the ball and he is late to react. The ball bursts through his hands and parries it over the fence for a maximum.

Mitchell Starc to Matthew Cross, no run

Attacks the stumps with a full delivery, Matthew Cross toe-ends the drive to mid off for a dot.

13.4
Mitchell Starc to Richie Berrington, 1 run

Aerial but safe! Drags the length back and bowls it around off. The ball gets big on him but Richie Berrington does well to ramp it wide of deep third for a run.

Mitchell Starc to Matthew Cross, 3 runs

Right in the slot, on off, Matthew Cross makes room again and thumps it between cover and mid off. The ball plugs in the outfield and the batters run three.

Mitchell Starc to Matthew Cross, 4 runs
138.4kph

FOUR! Not where Cross intended but he will take it! Dishes it out on a fullish length, on off, Matthew Cross tries to squeeze it out on the off side but gets a thickish outside edge that races past deep third for a boundary.
