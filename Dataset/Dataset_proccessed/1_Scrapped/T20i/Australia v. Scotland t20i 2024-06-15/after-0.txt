In Short
Australia will face Scotland in Group B encounter on June 16
If Scotland beat Australia, they will make it to the Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup 2024
England will keep a close eye on the match, keeping qualification scenario in mind

The stakes for Australia's encounter against Scotland is going to be high. Not just the fans of the 2 teams, but the England team and their supporters will also keep a close watch on the Group B clash that will take place at the Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium at Gros Islet, St. Lucia on June 15, Saturday. The match had already made headlines after Australian pacer Josh Hazelwood's remarks on the prospect of their team manipulating the result against Scotland. As a win for Scotland would ensure England's ouster from the T20 World Cup 2024.

The equation is simple from here. A win for Scotland would mean that they are through to the Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup 2024. As simple as it sounds, they are up against one of the best teams of the tournament, Australia. Matthew Mott and Pat Cummins also issued clarification about Hazlewood's comments and suggested that he was joking. Cummins went onto to say that Australia would take the field with a winning mindset and manipulating the result would be against the 'spirit of the game'. If Australia manages to do so, captain Mitchell Marsh could also face a one-match ban for the same. However, the Scotland team also took the comments in a light-hearted manner and said that he would not mind David Warner opening the bowling.

The 2 teams will meet each other for the first time in a T20I encounter. However, Australia has dominated in the 5 outings in the ODI matches as Scotland are yet to defeat Australia.

AUS vs SCO:Team news

Australia, who cruised their way to the Super 8 stage, might look to rest a few players. Nathan Ellis, who played the first and the 3rd match, could get another outing. Hence, Australia might not rush to bring in Mitchell Starc, who will have a packed schedule in the Super 8s. The team has suggested some rotation on the cards. Marcus Stoinis, Cameron Green or Ashton Agar might be considered in the playing XI.

For Scotland, Brad Currie had missed the Oman game with a niggle but Leask said everyone was fit so he could return in place of Safyaan Sharif.

AUS vs SCO: Pitch and conditions

This will be the first time in the tournament that a match will be played at the St Lucia stadium. Australia will return to this very stadium for their Super 8 games against India, West Indies and who-so-ever between Scotland and England would qualify. The forecast says that there is a slight chance of showers. However, a washout should also be good enough for Scotland to make it to Super 8.

AUS vs SCO: Predicted Playing XI

Australia (probable XI) 1 David Warner, 2 Travis Head, 3 Mitchell Marsh (C), 4 Glenn Maxwell, 5 Marcus Stoinis/Cameron Green, 6 Tim David, 7 Matthew Wade (wk), 8 Pat Cummins, 9 Nathan Ellis, 10 Adam Zampa, 11 Josh Hazlewood

Scotland (probable XI) 1 George Munsey, 2 Michael Jones, 3 Brandon McMullen, 4 Richie Berrington (capt), 5 Matthew Cross (wk), 6 Michael Leask, 7 Chris Greaves, 8 Mark Watt, 9 Chris Sole, 10 Brad Wheal, 11 Brad Currie.

AUS vs SCO: Who will win?

Australia will definitely start off as favourites, but Scotland will look to put a tough fight with Super 8 qualification at stake.

AUS vs SCO: What they said?

"I think coming here a lot of us have prepared for plenty of spin depending on what venue you get to. I know here's a good wicket. I think this might be the venue we play India at so that'll be nice. But, yeah, we're going to get a heap of spin. We expect nothing different and they're all, on their day, they're all going to be very very hard teams to beat," Matthew Wade said with an eye on the Super 8.

"I think it'd be an incredibly proud moment for Scottish cricket if we did progress to the Super Eight. And look, let's not beat around the bush. It would be the tough way. We know we're going to have to beat Australia. So, I think that would make it extra special for us, knowing that we've played an incredibly good game of cricket, taking on the best in the world, beat the best in the world to progress," Michael Leask said on the chance of beating Australia.
