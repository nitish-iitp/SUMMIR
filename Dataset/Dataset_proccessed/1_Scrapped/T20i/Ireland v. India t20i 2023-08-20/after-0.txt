20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Double sixes

Prasidh will bowl the penultimate over of the match and Adair picks his first delivery for a straight six, right over the bowler's head!! The Next ball is slwower but gets hammered for a six as well!!! Here we go!!! Prasidh comes back with a dot ball next. Much better from Krishna as the next ball is also a dot as Adair does not take a single. Big full toss next but Adair can only take a single. IRE 148/7 after 19 overs

22:44 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Nifty from Arshdeep

Aeshdeep Singh to bowl the 18th and Adair has nonchalantly picked up the first delivery for a six!!! Full toss next and Adair takes a single. Young swings at the 3rd delivery and misses by a long shot. Nothing off the next two balls. Ends the over with another dot. IRE 135/7 after 18 overs

22:38 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: GONE!!!

Bumrah continues and McCarthy pushes the first delivery to get a single. The next two balls yields just 1 more run. And  McCarthy tries to go after the slower 4th delivery but has just holed out to Ravi Bishnoi. IRE 126/7 after 16.4 overs

22:34 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Dockrell departs

Another promising partnership comes to an end as Dockrell departs for a runout. Balbirine times the ball nicely and hustles for the single and calls for the second, however, he decides not to take the second run at the last moment. Dockrell comes half-way down the track and was caught in no man's land when the second one was denied. Bishnoi does a brilliant piece of fielding and throws the ball quickly to Samson who completes the rest. After 15.4 overs Ireland 123/6

22:32 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Balbirnie falls

Arshdeep Singh in to bowl the 16th and Balbirnie takes a single to start this one off. Full toss and new man Mark Adair returns the favour with a single of his own. The 3rd ball is pulled for a huge six!!! That run out in the last over was unfortunate but Balbirnie puts it behind him with that monster. And he's edged it behind and walks back!!! IRE 123/6 after 15.4 overs

22:25 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Ireland still hanging by a thread

Though India is chipping away Ireland is still in the contest. Opener Balbirnie is anchoring the innings nicely here and Ireland wants him to stay till the end for them to give themselves a chance. If Dockrell can provide the finishing touch required then India might be in a bit of a pickle.  After 14.3 overs Ireland 105/4

India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Captain into attack

Bumrah has brought himself into attack and bowled a tight over piling further pressure onto the Irish batters. The run rate has now gone over 12s the batters now have to squeeze at least one boundary from here on in each over. After 12.1 overs Ireland 85/4

22:08 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Campher departs

The right-hander tried to reverse-sweep Bishnoi but, was caught by the point fielder. This is the second wicket for Bishnoi and all the good work done by both the partnership has now gone in vain. Dockrell is walked into the middle and the role remains the same they need to build a partnership. After 10.2 overs Ireland 64/4

22:03 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Brilliant over by Shivam Dube

The part-time bowler rolled out a brilliant over. He just gave away four runs. He stuck to his lines and lengths and also varied his pace nicely. The Irish batters tried to take the bowler on but could not get the measure of Dube this is nice captaincy by Bumrah picking and choosing the right moments to get through the overs of his fifth bowler. After 9.2 overs Ireland 59/3

21:59 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Rebuilding underway

A couple of quiet overs for Ireland however, the positive thing is they have not lost any more wickets both Camphor and Balbirnie are looking to take their time and take this game deep. Washington Sundar on the other hand was brought into the attack and looked unimpressive. After 8.1 overs Ireland 55/3

21:51 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Ravi Bishnoi picks up Harry Tector

Another one bites the dust for the Irish they have now lost three wickets in the Powerplay and they have now clearly fallen behind the game. The need of the hour for hosts right now is a partnership. The pairing of Balbirine and Campher needs to take this game as deep as possible for the Irish to have a chance. After 6 overs Ireland 31/3

21:46 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Prasidh Krishna bowling with heat

In the first innings the Irish bowlers have hit hard lengths on a consistent basis and Krishna is doing the same right now. Seems like it is a surface which is offering something to bowlers who bend their backs. The Irish batters are struggling to deal with those deliveries. The are slowly falling behind the required rate. After 5 overs Ireland 24/2

21:34 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Prasidh Krishna picks up two wickets in an over

It is an inspired bowling change from skipper Jasprit Bumrah. Krishna who hits hard lengths on a consistent basis reaps the rewards. He bowls a short one to Striling initially and then to Tucker in the same over, both tried to pull the ball and mistime them to get caught. After a good start in the first two overs, Ireland are now looking in a bit of pickle.  After 3.3 overs Ireland 20/2

21:32 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Expensive start for Arshdeep Singh

The left-arm seamer trying to swing the ball could not get his line right in a couple of delivers of the over hence was taken for a couple of boundaries. This is a good start for the Irish in the run-chase they are looking to attack the Indian bowlers and push them onto the back foot. After 2.1 overs Ireland 19/0

21:29 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Eight runs of the first over

Andrew Balbirnie tried to attack Jasprit Bumrah in the first over however the Indian skipper was too good for the Irish opener. There were a few plays and misses. Bumrah bowled a wide in the middle of the over which ran away for a boundary to ruin a brilliant over and also the last ball Balbirnie squeezed a couple. After 1.1 Ireland 13/0

21:13 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Ruturaj Gaikwad, Sanju Samson and Rinku Singh's cameos take India to 185/5

It has been an inning of two halves to be precise after the first innings it seemed like India would be posting somewhere around the 200-mark however, Ireland's bowlers made a brilliant comeback in the second half. Leg-spinner Benjamin White had a good outing and so did fast-bowler Mark Adair. It is a decent total but not something which cannot be chased down given the conditions the pitch is still brilliant for batting the job for Jaspirt Bumrah and his teammates is cut out. Stay with us for all the live action from the second innings. 

21:06 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: 22-run over by McCarthy

Rinku Singh looked to change the gears and was successful. He showed his finishing ability yet again today. He has played some sumptuous shots in that over. McCarthy who had good first three overs could not close out his spell. Trying to disguise Rinku he bowled a few wides in the over making it a 10-ball over. After 19.3 Overs India 184/4

20:57 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: 21-balls since the last boundary

India has lost momentum completely here. Both Dube and Rinku are struggling with their timing. Irish bowlers have been excellent they are mixing slower deliveries and yorkers brilliantly. Looks like it is going to be a tough challenge for Bumrah and co. in the second innings to defend if India posts anything less than 175. After 18 Overs India 144/4

20:50 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: A class-knock by the opener

FIFTY!

A fine half-century by @Ruutu1331. He tops it up with a maximum soon after ??

This is his 2nd 50 in T20Is.

India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Ruturaj Gaikwad departs for 58

Gaikwad after playing a good hand gets out to a brilliant slower one by McCarthy. Gaikwad tried to accelerate post his fifty however, was deceived by a well-disguised slower one after he tried to slog the ball into the stands and the ball just went up high in the air for Tector to take a simple catch. Shivam Dube walks into the middle. After 15.3 Overs India 130/4

20:37 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Rinku Singh comes into bat

The stage is set for Rinku to show his finishing skills on the international stage. Both Samson and Gaikwad have laid a solid foundation here. With Gaikwad set at the other end and pitch brilliant for batting Rinku might just provide the finishing touch which is needed. After 14.3 Overs India 109/3

20:29 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Sanju Samson departs

Leg-spinner Benjamin White picks up Samson. The right-hander who was looking in ominous touch dragged one onto the stumps of the leg-spinner. Samson would be disappointed with his performance he was looking good for a big score today unfortunately not to be. After 13.1 Overs India 109/3

20:28 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Ominous partnership

This partnership is taking the game away from Ireland. The more worrying thing for skipper Sterling is they have taken their ace bowler Little for runs. India will be now looking to get up to the 200-run mark with the batting to follow.  After 12.2 Overs India 105/3

20:24 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Sanju Samson smashes Josh Little

It has not been a day for Little. He started poorly and is continuing to have a bad day. Samson took the bowler for 18 runs in the 11th over. The left-arm seamer has wavered with his lines and lengths. The execution has been poor from him. Samson on the other hand has now got a start and he would be looking to make a good 70 or 80 here. After 11.3 Overs India 101/2

20:18 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: At the halfway mark

It has been a good partnership between Sanju Samson and Ruturaj Gaikwad after a couple of quick wickets they are building a nice partnership here. Ireland on the other hand is operating with a leg-spinner Benjamin White and a seamer from the other end. Both the batters now may look to accelerate from here on.  After 10.2 Overs India 89/2

20:09 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Ruturaj Gaikwad changing gears

The right-hander is looking to change gears after the powerplay. He is showing controlled aggression he is playing exquisite shots and in the midst of that is rotating strike nicely. Samson thus far has played an elegant cut short apart from that he has been looking to give strike to Gaikwad who is looking in good touch.  After 8.3 Overs India 70/2

20:02 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: A bittersweet powerplay for India

It has been a mixed bag for India in the first six overs. it started with a bang from Jaiswal however, two quick wickets in the middle phase of the powerplay slowed down the scoring. Ireland has started well here they would be happy with their effort as they have come up with a clear plan if bowling short and using big boundaries which has worked. After 6 Overs India 47/2

19:53 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Tilak Varma departs

The short ball does the trick again. Varma trying to pull the short ball gets caught by Dockrell near the boundary. After starting his career with a few scores Varma has now hit a lean patch with a 1 and 0. Sanju Samson has walked into the middle important outing for him. After 5 Overs India 37/2

19:48 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Yashasvi Jaiswal departs

Craig Young picks the opener. Jaiswal trying to pull the ball towards the long boundary gets caught by a stunning catch by Campher. Jaiswal would be disappointed as he was looking good for a big score on a decent batting track and threw it away after getting a start. After 4.1 Overs India 34/2

19:46 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Yashavi Jaiswal looking in good touch

The stylish left-hander is looking in good touch today. He is letting the ball come on to the bat and playing on its merit staying in the backfoot. He is looking impeccable with his timing today. Irish bowlers have not started well at all they have pulled back their lengths very quickly despite there was a bit of movement on offer in the first over. After 3.2 Overs India 28/0

19:42 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Expensive over by Little

The left-arm seamer was a touch shorter in his length. Both the openers made full use of poor bowling. Jaiswal who is strong on his back foot pulled one behind the square to register the first six of the afternoon. All the good work done by Adair in the first over is undone by Little with that 16-run expensive over. After 2 Overs India 19/0

19:38 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: M Adair on the mark

Adair has taken the new ball for Ireland. He was able to get a hint of movement off the surface, however, nothing extravagant. Both Ruturaj Gaikwad and Yashasvi Jaiswal have started circumspectively. They might take another over to get their eye on and utilize the powerplay post that. After 1.1 Overs India 6/0

19:29 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Let's go!

National anthems are underway both the openers are walking into the middle we are all set to start the game. The sun is out today looks like a wicket brilliant for batting. Both Ruturaj Gaikwad and Yashasvi Jaiswal would be licking their lips to capitalise on the powerplay and make a big score. Stay with us for all the live action.

19:08 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Jasprit Bumrah at the toss

We would have batted first as well. The weather is a little better today and we wanted to put runs on the board. The body is good, was a little careful in the begining and then after that kept on building confidence and it was good. Same team.

19:07 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Paul Sterling at the toss

India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Bumrah likes challenges

He is a non-conformist, and has taken the road less travelled. In a world divided by Messi and Ronaldo, he idolises Swedish superstar and big-match player Zlatan Ibrahimovic. He once said, “I can relate to his story, people did not take him seriously and then he became a star.”

18:46 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Prasidh Krishna's comeback performance

The lanky pacer, on T20 debut, consistently produced discomfiting bounce and seamed the ball back, while bowling at a few notches below his regular pace. Like Bumrah, he sometimes fluffed his lines too, like the talisman, he was gifted with a pair of wickets too, those of George Dockrell and Harry Tector, the latter when trying to execute a ramp. Prasidh, though, could not sustain his intensity and ended up conceding 15 runs in his last over.

18:39 (IST)
20 AUG 2023
India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Cheered every ball

Two balls later, another stroke of fortune winked at him. In what could only be described as a moment of bedlam, Lorcan Tucker tried to ramp him but instead mishit it to Samson. A largely plain over though would fetch him a brace of wickets. He clocked an average speed of 137kph, and took as long as the third ball of his second over to hit 140 clicks. Like the first over, he began the second with an unusual half-tracker, duly pulled for four, but ended the over with four straight dot balls. Needless to say, he was raucously cheered for every ball.

India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Ravi Bishnoi on Jasprit Bumrah

“It was his first match nearly after 11 months. First ball he bowled was on the legs but after that the five ball he bowled was so good to see. Everyone was waiting for this Bumrah and it was so good to see him back in his rhythm,” Bishnoi told reporters.

18:25 (IST)

India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Kiran More on Rinku Singh

“I have been waiting for his opportunity in the Indian team. And that batting position, of No.5 and 6, he will perform well in that spot and can end up being a brilliant finisher. We all have seen MS Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh. After that we haven’t got a player like them,” Kiran More said in a conversation with Jio Cinema.

“We tried making such players, but it didn’t work so far. Tilak Varma is also there, he too can perform that role. Rinku is also a brilliant fielder. And I have seen him in domestic cricket as well, he has improved a lot I feel,” he added.

India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Food for thought

India fielded six left-handers in the first game - the most they have ever had in a T20I

India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Jasprit Bumrah after the 1st T20I

Felt very good, so many sessions I did at the NCA, didn't feel I missed out a lot or was doing something new. Credit to the staff, they kept me in good spirits. You are not thinking about yourself, you are thinking about others out there. Not really nervous but very happy. There was some swing upfront so we wanted to use it. Luckily we won the toss and it was coming out fine. There was some help due to the weather, so very happy. In every game, you would want more. After a crisis, they played well, credit where it is due. Even when you win, there are areas to improve on. Everybody is very confident, they are very well prepared. I think the IPL also helps. It is always good, wherever we go, they support us, that helps us to keep the spirit high.

India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Mukesh Kumar for Arshdeep

Arshdeep Singh has been in India’s go-to bowler in the T20I, since making his debut in July last year. The left-arm seamer has bagged 49 wickets in the 32 outings. But his death bowling has been a major concern in the recent past. He gave away 22 in the final over as Barry McCarthy smashed two sixes and a four in the last over. India might rope in Mukesh Kumar, who has recently made his debut in the all three formats in the West Indies. Mukesh was used only in the death overs by Hardik Pandya against West Indies and the Bengal pacer has impressed everyone with his yorkers. India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey says pacer Mukesh Kumar has shown potential to serve India in all three formats.

India vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score: Sanju Samson to bat at 3

The Ireland series is also a platform for Sanju Samson to throw his hat in the ring. Sanju a top-order batter will be looking for some runs uner his belt. Veteran India off-spinner R Ashwin on his YouTube channel has backed for Sanju to bat at 3. Ashwin said: “The series is an extraordinary chance to play Sanju as a keeper and make him bat at number 3. He will surely bat at number 3 or 4. Another debate is on how Sanju Samson is a top-order batter and how he is being wasted as a number 6 in T20Is. See, Team India’s top 4 has been really heavy all this while.”
