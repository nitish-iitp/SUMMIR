NEW DELHI: Ruturaj Gaikwad, Sanju Samson, and Rinku Singh all scored well to help India post a solid 185 for 5 against Ireland in the second T20I on Sunday.
Gaikwad's (58, 43 balls, 6x4, 1x6), Sanju Samson's (40, 26 balls, 5x4, 1x6), and Rinku Singh's (38, 21 balls, 2x4, 3x6) performances put India in position to win the series with one match remaining.
Under the DLS technique, India won the rain-affected first T20I by two runs.

India got off to a fast start with opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, who hit 18 off 11 balls with two fours and a six off pacer Josh Little.

The innings, however, fell short of expectations when Jaiswal's attempt to pull Craig Young ended in the hands of Curtis Campher at deep.


Tilak Varma struggled for the second game in a row, as a mistimed pull off Barry McCarthy was snagged by George Dockrell near to the ropes.
At 35 for 2, India required both consistency and momentum. The visitors got it in the third wicket stand between Samson and Gaikwad.
Samson and Gaikwad combined for 71 runs to push India above the 100-run mark in the 12th over.

Samson, who has sparked selection talks ahead of India's Asia Cup 2023 team announcement on Monday, played a lovely, modest innings of 40 off 26 balls that included five fours and a six.
Gaikwad was eager to give the strike to his in-flow partner, and the Kerala player did not miss the opportunity. In the 11th over, Samson tore into Josh Little, slamming him for 18 runs.
Three fours in a row came from an inside-out loft, slap over covers, and a guide through the cordon.
He topped off his barrage with a swivel pull that netted him a maximum over the fine leg.


However, a disaster cut short his visit. Samson attempted to knock leg-spinner White over the covers off a wide ball on the off-stump, but only managed to pull the delivery back on to his stumps.
At 105 for 3 in the 13th over, India had a strong starting point for a big total.
Gaikwad batted steadily to finish the game. It was the polar opposite of a typical T20 performance, with him looking to create the innings around him.
With a superb lift off White, the right-hander achieved his fifty, his second in T20Is. Gaikwad hoisted White for a six well over the bowler's head in a rare display of aggression on this day.
McCarthy's slow ball, though, ended Gaikwad's innings, when a heave fell into the hands of a running-in Harry Tector at mid-off. India was 129 for 4 at the time.
However, India had two strong hitters in its lineup in Rinku Singh and Shivam Dube, who demonstrated their power-hitting abilities in the 19th and 20th overs.
McCarthy's final over provided 22 runs, with Rinku hauling him for two sixes and a four, and Mark Adair's final over produced 20 runs as India accelerated.
