This series will mark the return of senior pacer Bumrah to international cricket who was on the sidelines for almost 11 months due to a recurring back injury. Both Rohit Sharma and Hardik Pandya are absent from the team. Hence, Bumrah will lead the team with Indian opener Ruturaj Gaikwad as his deputy.
