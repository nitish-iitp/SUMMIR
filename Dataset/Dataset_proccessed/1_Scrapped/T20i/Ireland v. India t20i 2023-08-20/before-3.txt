India's tour of Ireland kickstarts on August 18, with Jasprit Bumrah leading the Indian team in a 3-match T20I series. With most of the senior players rested, especially keeping the Asia Cup and the ODI World Cup in mind, the series offers several Indian youngsters an opportunity to showcase their skills and stake claim for a regular spot in the team. Both Rohit Sharma and Hardik Pandya are absent from the team, hence, Bumrah will be leading the troops in the shortest-format assignment.

While Bumrah will be in the spotlight, hoping to impress and seal a spot in India's Asia Cup squad, which will be announced in the coming days, the likes of Rinku Singh, Jitesh Sharma, Shivam Dube, etc. will be eager to make the opportunity count.
