England captain Buttler wants authorities to 'clean up' cricket laws after Kohli controversy

Jos Buttler has called on cricket’s authorities to “clean up” some of the inconsistencies in the game’s laws, admitting he fears England could be on the wrong end of a rough call during the T20 World Cup.

England’s captain was speaking ahead of his team’s Super 12 match against Ireland in the early hours of Wednesday morning at the MCG, where India won a wildly fluctuating match against Pakistan on Sunday.

A key moment in that game came when India’s Virat Kohli was bowled off a free hit in a thrilling final over.

Most cricket fans instinctively felt it should have been a dead ball. Crucially, though, Kohli knew it wasn’t and ran three as the ball deflected off the stumps and trickled towards the boundary.

Asked if he thought it should be a dead ball when the batter is bowled from a free hit, Buttler said: “It’s a tough one to work out. There’s a lot of laws of cricket which are quite unique. It’s far from perfect.

“But then I can see lots of other flipsides because, say the third umpire calls the front foot no-ball, you might get caught and cross for a run and then you get called back and you actually go back on strike and it’s just a dead ball.

“Whereas if the umpire had called no-ball on the field you wouldn’t have been out and you would have scored an extra run. That is something else that is not quite ideal.”

Buttler, part of England’s team that won the tied ODI World Cup Final against New Zealand at Lord’s in 2019, added: “I don’t think the review system is perfect.

“Say you need one to win in the World Cup final, you get given out lbw and you cross and complete a run and then you review it, you’re not out and it’s just a dot-ball. I don’t think that’s ideal either.

“Whether it’s a dead ball after a free hit; if you hit it, get caught and run two that’s fine but if it’s off the stumps, if someone should be able to run or not, I don’t know.

“Whether all of those things can be cleaned up a little bit would be beneficial. Where that ball goes off the stumps, India managed to score three runs off that ball which is a huge swing in the match. Hopefully it doesn’t affect us.”

With plenty of rain forecast in Melbourne this week, Buttler, whose team also take on hosts Australia at the MCG on Friday, has pleaded with umpires to continue playing through bad weather when possible at this World Cup.

South Africa were denied victory in their Super 12 match against Zimbabwe in Hobart on Monday despite the best efforts of the officials to keep playing through the rain.

And Buttler said: “Where it’s reasonable if you can continue the game as much as you can, I think that’s the right decision. As much as we can, it would be good if we can get the game continuing.

“Say, for instance, there’s a little bit of rain which isn’t that heavy and it looks like it’s going to blow through, can we just stay on and keep going?”

Buttler, meanwhile, says England will not be taking Ireland lightly, even though it appears to be his team’s easiest game of the tournament, on paper at least.

“We give them great respect,” he said. “Anytime you take things for granted or you don’t respect the opposition is when you can get hurt. I think in T20 cricket especially, it’s the one format where it’s as level a playing field as any.

“They’ve got some fantastic players in their own right who can win the game on their own. You’ve got to be fully committed, prepared and ready for the challenge ahead.”

Ireland coach, Heinrich Malan, added: “Look, it’s a nice challenge for us, and we’re really excited. We know they’ve got a couple of skill sets that’ll be challenging, but I also think the way we’ve played over a period of time, we’ve shown we’ve got a couple of guys that have put their names in lights, and that’s the opportunity that we’re looking forward to, and hopefully we can come out firing.”
