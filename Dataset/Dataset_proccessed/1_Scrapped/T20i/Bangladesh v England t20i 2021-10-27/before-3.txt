That's all for today, thank you so much!

Well, that was some start to the campaigns of India and Pakistan. Irrespective of the result, it was a cracking game and especially from Pakistan's point of view. This is only the start, folks. We have so much more coming up for you over the next couple of weeks. And we are sure we will meet you every single day. We absolutely enjoyed bringing the action to you today. Thank you so much for joining us.

IND vs PAK T20 World Cup: Babar Azam, PAK captain, speaks

"This was the team's effort, and the early wickets were very helpful. It gave us a lot of confidence and our spinners were very good as well. We applied our plans and got the results. We, the openers, kept it simple and built a partnership and because the wicket was getting better so we just wanted to keep batting till the end, which we did. It won't get easier just because we beat India. We will take the confidence, but we're taking it one match at a time, and there's a long way to go in the tournament. We prepared well, and just kept the history out of our mind. We needed quality practice, and warm-up matches, and even our domestic tournament and those games gave us a lot of confidence."

IND vs PAK T20 World Cup: Virat Kohli, IND captain, speaks

"We didn't execute properly. Credit where it's due and Pakistan outplayed us today. They started brilliantly with the ball, and 3 wickets for 20 runs was not a good start. We needed wickets early but with the bat they gave us absolutely no chances. It played slow in the first half and hitting through the line was not that easy as it was in the second half, after 10 overs. We needed those 15-20 extra runs an for that we needed a good start but Pakistan's bowling didn't allow us to get those extra runs. We could make the argument of getting in another slower bowler, but it's important to stay composed and understand our strengths because with the dew the slower bowlers couldn't be effective either. This is just the first game of the tournament, not the last."

Shaheen Afridi, Man of the Match, speaks to the broadcasters

"It is the good wishes of my parents and all Pakistanis. Very happy with my performance. The plan was to bring the ball back in. I was just trying to swing it and I was just looking to give the team a breakthrough. That was what I practiced in the nets as well yesterday. Batting against the new ball was tough. The credit goes to Babar and Rizwan for the way they played. All teams are good in the tournament and we will look to carry this momentum through and go to the finals."

India vs Pakistan: WHAT A RUN-CHASE THAT WAS

The monkey is finally off Pakistan's back. After 12 World Cup matches, including 5 in the T20 World Cups, the "Men In Green" have beaten the "Men in Blue"




And they have achieved this feat in very un-Pakistan manner. Usually, they stutter and have a mini-collapse. But Babar (68*) and Rizwan (79*) couldn't have any better to script this win
