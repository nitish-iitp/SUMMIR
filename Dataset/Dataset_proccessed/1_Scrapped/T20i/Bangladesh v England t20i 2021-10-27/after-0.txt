ENG vs BAN T20 World Cup 2021 Live Cricket Score

England vs Bangladesh T20 World Cup 2021 Highlights: England produced yet another phenomenal performance as they beat Bangladesh by 8 wickets to register a second successive victory in the Super 12 stage. Jason Roy's 61 proved central to the side's run-chase as England reached the 125-run target in only 14.1 overs. Earlier, England had restricted Bangladesh to 124/9 in 20 overs. Moeen Ali's double-strike (dismissals of Liton Das and Mohammad Naim) in the third over set the tone for Bangladesh's innings as the side failed to recover from the early setbacks. Tymal Mills was the pick of the bowlers, picking three wickets in the innings while Liam Livingstone dismissed Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah to return impressive figures of 3/15 in three overs. Earlier, Bangladesh had won the toss and opted to bat first.

ENGLAND WIN!

England secure their second successive victory in the Super 12s in style. The bowling lineup stepped up to the occasion once again, and Jason Roy's quickfire fifty was central to the run-chase as Dawid Malan (28*) and Jos Buttler (18) contributed efficiently for the win.

Oct 27, 2021 6:27 PM IST
Roy falls on 61

The opener was in a hurry to finish the game and falls to Shoriful Islam in the 13th over. Roy went for a scoop but there wasn't enough pace in the delivery. Nasum Ahmed takes an impressive catch at third man.

England 114/2 in 13 overs; Target - 125

50 for Jason Roy!

The England opener brings up his seventh T20I half-century with a lofted boundary over the bowler's head. Excellent innings from Roy so far, and England are steering towards a second win in the Super 12s.

England 104/1 in 12 overs; Target - 125

Oct 27, 2021 6:11 PM IST
90/1 in 10 overs

This has been a largely one-sided affair so far, with Roy and Malan finding easy runs on almost every ball now. Even a miracle may not work for Bangladesh here. 

Oct 27, 2021 6:06 PM IST
Easy strike rotation

Roy and Malan are finding easy singles as Bangladesh lack any sense of urgency here. It seems like an exhibition now, with clear difference in quality between both sides in this game.

England 83/1 in 9 overs; Target - 125

Oct 27, 2021 6:03 PM IST
Malan joins the party!

The left-hander plays a cheeky reverse-paddle for a four against Nasum Ahmed on the first delivery, and ends the over with a smacking cover drive for another four. Another good over for England as the batters accumulate 12 off it.

England 75/1 in 8 overs; Target - 125

Oct 27, 2021 5:57 PM IST
Roy's attack continues

The England opener is undeterred with Buttler's dismissal. He takes on Mahedi Hasan in his first over, charging down the track for a six over bowler's head before cutting a length delivery square for a four. England racing away towards a win as Bangladesh in a dire need of another breakthrough.

England 63/1 in 7 overs; Target - 125

Oct 27, 2021 5:46 PM IST
WICKET! Buttler departs

Nasum Ahmed gets the breakthrough! Jos Buttler lofts a length delivery wide of long-off and Mohammad Naim takes a good catch. The England batter played for the turn but the ball slides in, which traps him at an awkward angle.

England 40/1 in 5 overs; Target - 125

Oct 27, 2021 5:42 PM IST
Poor lengths from Bangladesh

Chris Woakes had mentioned in the mid-innings interview that his focus was largely on hitting the deck as hard as he could, adding that it was a "two-paced pitch." Bangladesh bowlers, however, have largely kept their lengths full, allowing easy runs for both English openers.

Bangladesh 37/0 in 4 overs; Target - 125

Oct 27, 2021 5:39 PM IST
Buttler goes big!

Buttler slams the first six of England's innings! He charges down the track and smacks the full delivery straight over bowler's head! 8 off the over.

England 26/0 in 3 overs; Target - 125
