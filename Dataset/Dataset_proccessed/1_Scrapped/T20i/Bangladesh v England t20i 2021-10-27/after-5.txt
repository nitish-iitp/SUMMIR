England wrapped up an eight-wicket win to move to two-from-two at the T20 World Cup (Getty Images)

England have cruised to an eight-wickets victory over Bangladesh to continue their perfect start at the T20 World Cup. After Eoin Morgan’s side crushed West Indies in their opening match with a blistering display of bowling which saw them all out for 55, England were again impressive as they restricted Bangladesh to 124.

Moeen Ali removed Bangladesh’s openers with back-to-back deliveries, while Liam Livingstone took out the experienced pair of Mushfiqur Rahim and captain Mahmudullah just as they were beginning to build momentum. Chris Woakes yielded just 12 runs before Tymal Mills took consecutive wickets at the end of the innings to take his total to three.

Given a target of 125, Jason Roy smashed 61 runs from 38 balls alongside Jos Buttler (18) and Dawid Malan (28 not out) to secure a comfortable victory that sees England top Group 1 ahead of Saturday’s clash against Australia. Follow all the reaction and latest updates from the T20 World Cup below.

England cruise to eight-wickets win over Bangladesh

Two matches, two wins and two dominant performances. England’s T20 World Cup campaign continued at a devastating pace as they beat Bangladesh by eight wickets, with 35 balls to spare, to solidify their position at the top of Group 1.

In an all-round team performance, it was Jason Roy who emerged with the most credit, striking a swift 61 that broke the back of England’s chase of a lacklustre target of 125, helping the team to within 13 runs of victory before falling. It was a fitting celebration of the Surrey batter’s 50th T20i cap - clean strikes right through this seventh half-century in the format and second at an ICC event.

Vithushan Ehantharajah reports as England claimed another impressive victory to ensure they move into Saturday’s clash against Australia full of confidence.

England captain Eoin Morgan, reacting to his side’s eight-wicket victory over Bangladesh.

On England’s bowlers: “They’ve started the tournament exceptionally well. They’ve adapted to the conditions really well. Today they’ve been disciplined and that’s been backed up by good catching in the field.”

On strength in depth: “I think it’s a huge compliment to how our white ball has really come along. Quite a big squad of players were involved in the 2019 success and that’s leant itself to T20 as well.”

On Jason Roy: “He was crucial. It’s nice for him and Dawid to get some time at the wicket. The way he played was so imposing and when you play like that on a slow wicket it makes it very difficult to set a field. It’s good to see him in good touch.”

“At the start of my career it felt like there were sporadic T20s here and there, so it’s been nice to get into more of a routine over the last couple of years,” adds Roy, who was celebrating his 50th cap today.

“You want to get off to a good start but sometimes these pitches make it hard to do so. Today I was able to find a few gaps but it’s definitely a case of keeping wickets in hand, and then powering through the end of the innings.

“I’ve been working on [facing spin] over the last few years and it’s a part of my game that has improved a lot. Today was a big test up against two left-arm spinners and two left-arm seamers, and I had to use a lot of the sills that I’ve learned.

England cruise to eight-wickets win over Bangladesh

It was all very straight-forward for England against a disappointing Bangladesh side. But it’s a commanding performance from the world’s number-one ranked side, one which shows why they held that status coming into this T20 World Cup.

Here’s England’s player of the match, Jason Roy: “That was a very special match. We had to back up our last performance against the West Indies and we made a fast start with the ball. Our bowlers deserve a lot of credit.”
