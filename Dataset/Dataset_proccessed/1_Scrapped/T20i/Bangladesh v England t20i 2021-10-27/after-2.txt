Peter: Morgan has to be the best limited-overs captain around today, surely? Bringing Livingstone on was a stroke of pure genius.

England's Chris Woakes - who took 1-12 - speaking to TMS: "It was a warm one out there. A nice breeze, which helped. It's certainly warmer than Birmingham.

"It's been a really good start from the boys. You always want to start well, particularity in this type of format where it always looks like it could be a dogfight. but to have two wins out of two is a good start."

There are going to be tougher tests than they've had today, they'll be put under some serious pressure from teams they are yet to come up against in the Super 12s tournament.

England captain Eoin Morgan: "Our bowlers have started the tournament really well. It's a huge compliment to how far our white ball cricket has come along. We have a huge squad of players from our 2019 success and that lends itself to T20 cricket.

"It's nice for Jason and Dawid to get some time at the wicket. Jason is so imposing and when you play like that on slow wickets, it makes it difficult to set fields and how to bowl to him."

Bangladesh captain Mahmudullah: "We are very disappointed with the way we batted especially. It was a very good wicket to bat on but we din't make any partnership in the middle.

"If you don't get a good start, it gets difficult later on. We are much more skill hitters than power hitters. We need to reassess a lot of things, especially in batting, and come up with a good plan."

England are next in action on Saturday against Australia - because they don't play enough matches against each other - while Bangladesh face West Indies on Friday.

'Nice to get into routine over years'

14:09 BST 27 October 2021

Player of the match Jason Roy on playing his 50th T20 international: "At the start of my career I felt like there were sporadic T20s here and there. It's been nice to get into a bit more of a routine over the past few years and it's nice to get going here."

On today's performance: "You want to get off to as good as a start as possible but these pitches have been hard to do so. Today was alright - managed to find a few gaps, but it's definitely a case of keeping a few wickets in hand and then powering on."

The groups are now starting to take shape. You can see teams which are finding their own way to play. It seems England in this group, and Pakistan in the other group, are the two favourites.

Now that England have scored 125 runs, I would say Bangladesh's chances of winning this match are slim.

I have no doubt one of the favourites will win this tournament, unless they don't.

MJP from London

I believe there will be some batting and some bowling from all cricket teams. My analysis rates are reasonable.
