Patna: Altogether 33 flights to and from Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport in the city will be operational from Sunday, according to the extended summer schedule effective till September 30.
Earlier, 30-32 flights were operating from the city airport. “The number of flights operated by different airlines on various sectors has largely remained consistent.

Some airlines have added flights while others have reduced them. There have also been adjustments in the timing of a few aircraft. The flight operations at the airport commence at 7.30am with IndiGo’s Bengaluru-bound flight (6E-5126) and the last departure is for Hyderabad at 10.20pm,” said an airport official.


The official added that the previous day’s last flight was the Mumbai-Patna-Mumbai service (6E-825/6619), which arrived in Patna at 9.20pm and departed at 9.50pm. “No new routes or airlines have been introduced in the revised summer schedule released on Sunday,” he said.

IndiGo will operate up to 27 flights a day, including the Deoghar ATR flight (6E-7944/7945) four days a week —Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays.
Air India will run three flights — two to Delhi and one to Mumbai. Vistara will have two flights to Delhi and SpiceJet will operate one flight to Delhi.
An executive said the decline in the number of flights was partly due to SpiceJet’s shortage of aircraft.
“Earlier, the airline operated 5-7 flights a day,” he said.

Currently, Patna airport offers direct connectivity to 13 destinations across the country, including New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Ranchi, Lucknow, Deoghar, Chandigarh and Bhubaneswar. The average daily footfall at the airport ranges from 8,000 to 10,000 passengers.
