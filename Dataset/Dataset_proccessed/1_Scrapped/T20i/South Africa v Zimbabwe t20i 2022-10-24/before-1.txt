Well yes of course. Most obviously it iuspossible to hit a six (6) - the ball from the bat going directly over the boundary on the full. There are a couple of instances of a batsman hitting 6 sixes in an over in an international match. You can get a five (5 if the fielding side uses some kind of unofficial aid to stop the ball, even if it only hits a piece of kit such as a helmet put aside by a fielder. Actually, i remember an instance of batsmen running a five (5) at the MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground), which is just huge. And there must have been literally thousands of examples of batsmen try

Can we take 4 runs by running in a cricket match, or is it a rule that a player is not allowed to take more than 3 runs by running?

Yes, one can take 4 runs by running in a cricket match. The last incidence when this happened I can remember was in a match between Pakistan and Australia.

The lazy ball chase by the fielder allowed the batsman to run 4 runs.

Is it possible for a player to score more than 6 runs on one ball in cricket?

Yes - just keep running more than six times between wickets.

As you can imagine that doesn’t happen because the fielders will get to the ball and return it to the wicket-keeper before you have time to do that - even five (all run) runs are very rare - usually when the fielding side is clustered around the bat hoping for a catch.

But the fielding side can help you. If they throw the ball inaccurately the wicket-keeper may not be able to take the throw and the ball can travel towards the opposite boundary giving extra time to run - and if the ball does reach the other boundary then the batsman is

What is the maximum number of 'Runs' that can be scored from a single ball in the game of cricket?

In theory - pretty much any number.

So - you bowl the ball.

The batter hits it.

It goes along the ground, and the fielder picks it up…. and then holds it. She doesn’t throw it back, she just holds it.

The two batters can continue to run end to end for as long as they want. 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500. The only practical limits are a) them getting tired and b) the next break in the innings (lunch or tea) or c) bad light stopping play.

Now - as for a more realistic answer…. it gets kind of complicated.

The easy answer is six - if the batter hits the ball over the boundary then you get six runs.

However I

Is it possible for a batsman to score 5 runs in one ball?

Yes, it is possible in two ways.

One when a batsman get 5 runs other when the team gets.

1. If the ball played by batsmen hit the Keeper’s helmet , the batting team will get 5 runs as an extra.

2. After the batsmen takes a single , if the fielders overthrow the ball to the boundary while hitting the stumps and batsman reaches in the crease safely then batsmen will get total 5 runs in one ball.

(1 run)

In cricket, if a batsman scores a boundary and he runs 2 before that, will the total run be 6?

“Visit the Quora space Know Your Cricket for an in depth understanding of game of cricket.”

Only Boundary 4 will be scored.

But, it is not a straight forward assumption that whenever boundary is scored, the runs completed by the batsmen are ignored and only 4 or 6 (as may be the case) are scored.

Whenever a boundary is scored, if the number of runs completed by the batsmen before the ball reaches the boundary is more than the boundary allowance (4 runs or 6runs), then runs completed by the batsmen will be scored, else the boundary allowance will be scored.

Example-1: Batsmen have completed 2 runs

When 1 run is needed of the last ball and suppose the batsman ran more than 1 run and win the match, why are all the runs counted in the total although the match was won as soon as the batsman ran the first run (remember Sehwag's incident vs SL)?

So far I remember Sehwag’s incident was, India needed one run to win and Sehwag was on 99. Suraj Randiv was the bowler but there was a no ball, an intended one, and Sehwag hit a six on that ball. Still his century was denied. But in other cases, when you need one run and you hit a boundary on a legal ball, all the runs are counted. Right?

Here is the reason:

When you need one run and hit a 4/6 on a legal delivery, the match is not won until the ball reaches boundary. The moment ball reaches boundary, all the runs are added.
But when the delivery is illegal (no ball) then you won the match immedia

What is the highest score that can be achieved in cricket by hitting the ball for six runs?

There's no maximum limit to the score achievable in cricket through sixes.

The beauty of cricket is that theoretically, a batsman could hit every single ball for a six throughout their innings. But this is highly unlikely.

However, there are records for the most sixes hit in an innings:

In a Test match: 23 sixes by Sir Garfield Sobers in 1968
In a One Day International (ODI): 16 sixes by Rohit Sharma in 2018
In a Twenty20 (T20) match: 17 sixes by Hazratullah Zazai in 2018

While these numbers are impressive, they still only represent a portion of the total runs scored.

How does scoring work in cricket? Can more than one run be scored on a single ball?

A game of cricket is decided by the number of “runs” scored by each team.

A run is scored when a batter hits the ball and runs to change places with his partner but if the batter hits the ball further out into the field, the batters may have time to run two or more times.If the ball reaches the boundary, the batter is awarded 4 runs and if it flies over the boundary, the “reward” is 6 runs and a lot of cheering.

So, the answer is “Yes, one can score more more than one run off a single ball.

Runs are also scored if the bowler bowls an illegal ball, a wide or a no-ball. If the hits a batter’s leg a

What is the maximum number of runs that can be scored from a single ball in cricket? Can it exceed 10?

Imagine bowling a no ball which is sent for a maximum. Already 7 runs scored without a legal delivery.

Next delivery is yet another no ball which dispatched over the boundary. Another 7 runs.

Next delivery may or may not be a legal one. It could be wide or yet another no ball. Assuming it is another no ball and result is same, batting side gets another 7 runs.

Finally, the legal delivery happens which can still be hit for a six. All this assuming that the last delivery was fair otherwise cycle can continue.

So possibilities will never end. But, if 13 runs off 1 ball has happened, I won't be surpri

Is it possible for a batsman to score more than 6 runs on any ball without hitting a boundary or clearing the ground?

Batsman hits and runs for 3 runs and then fielder overthrows the ball that is missed by the other fielders and goes past the boundary for 4. That is seven runs.

Actually if you have clumsy fielders ( Pakistan seems to have a lot of them), you could overthrow twice and the batsmen could potentially score more than 7 if the last overthrow crosses the fence.

There is also a lesser known rule in cricket for penalty runs where the ball hits the helmet of the wicket keeper that is not worn by him and that is 5 penalty runs.

in fact, 5 penalty runs are awarded in several cases that cover Cricket rules 2

What is the maximum number of runs that can be scored before a fielder calls the ball lost in cricket?

Ooh, old Law. There is no longer such a thing as Lost Ball in cricket. In the old days, the old law allowed for a fielder to declare “Lost Ball” when a Ball in play became lost or irrecovable. We weren't talking about a Ball that had been smashed out of the ground, landed on the top deck of a no.7 bus and was on its way to Bournemouth. You knew where that had gone. We are talking about a Ball that hasn't left the field of play, but yet, couldn't be retrieved. In ye olden days it probably meant it had gone down a rabbit hole. The only time I ever heard Lost ball was in a boxing day charity matc
