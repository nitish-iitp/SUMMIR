Well yes of course. Most obviously it iuspossible to hit a six (6) - the ball from the bat going directly over the boundary on the full. There are a couple of instances of a batsman hitting 6 sixes in an over in an international match. You can get a five (5 if the fielding side uses some kind of unofficial aid to stop the ball, even if it only hits a piece of kit such as a helmet put aside by a fielder. Actually, i remember an instance of batsmen running a five (5) at the MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground), which is just huge. And there must have been literally thousands of examples of batsmen try

Can we take 4 runs by running in a cricket match, or is it a rule that a player is not allowed to take more than 3 runs by running?

Yes, one can take 4 runs by running in a cricket match. The last incidence when this happened I can remember was in a match between Pakistan and Australia.

The lazy ball chase by the fielder allowed the batsman to run 4 runs.

Is it possible for a player to score more than 6 runs on one ball in cricket?

Yes - just keep running more than six times between wickets.

As you can imagine that doesn’t happen because the fielders will get to the ball and return it to the wicket-keeper before you have time to do that - even five (all run) runs are very rare - usually when the fielding side is clustered around the bat hoping for a catch.
