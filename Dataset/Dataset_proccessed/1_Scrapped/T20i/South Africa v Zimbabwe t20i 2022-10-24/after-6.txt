We are back for the chase! The players are out to the middle now. Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma are the two openers for South Africa. Tendai Chatara to start with the ball for Zimbabwe. Here we go...

!

... THE CHASE ...

!

South Africa will back themselves to chase this total while Zimbabwe will need to create early inroads to stay in the game till the end. Chase coming up shortly, stay tuned…

!

Lungi Ngidi comes up for a flash interview. The pace bowler shares that it's too wet and it was hard to grip the ball. Mentions that there is a bit of a skidding bounce now and it should be pretty good for batting now. Feels that they should chase it down easily.

!

South Africa were right on the money since the start. They realized very early that the back-of-length deliveries are the way to go on this wicket and kept troubling the Zimbabwean batters with that length. Lungi Ngidi starred with the ball for the Proteas but he was a shade expensive. Wayne Parnell impressed while Kagiso Rabada was rusty.

!

With the game reduced to nine overs due to rain, Zimbabwe were in a tricky situation having opted to bat first. In their quest to start hitting from the word go, they never got going. Wesley Madhevere and Milton Shumba’s stand propelled Zimbabwe to a total that didn’t look possible at 19-4.

!

So, Zimbabwe end up with 79 on the board at the end of their nine overs. Temba Bavuma will be pretty happy with his side’s bowling effort at the halfway mark. However, he will hope that the late flourish by Zimbabwe does not come back to haunt them.

ANRICH NORTJE TO MILTON SHUMBA

OUT! CAUGHT BEHIND! A wicket to end the innings then! Anrich Nortje bowls this on a good length and on off, Milton Shumba moves across to play the scoop but gets an edge towards the keeper where Quinton de Kock takes a brilliant catch diving to his right. Zimbabwe finish on 79 for 5!

ANRICH NORTJE TO WESSLY MADHEVERE

ANRICH NORTJE TO WESSLY MADHEVERE

Short of a length and outside off, Wesley Madhevere swings hard at it but gets a top edge towards third man for a run.

5 Penalty runs awarded to Zimbabwe.

ANRICH NORTJE TO MILTON SHUMBA

Uppish but safe! A length ball around off, angling away, Shumba tries to reverse-heave but the top edge takes the ball down to fine leg. They take a run. FIVE PENALTY RUNS ARE GIVEN. Reason? Quinton de Kock had taken one of the gloves which was lying on the ground and the throw from the deep clipped that glove. Bonus runs for Zimbabwe.

ANRICH NORTJE TO MILTON SHUMBA

Another yorker, on leg, Milton Shumba squeezes it towards deep mid-wicket for a brace.

ANRICH NORTJE TO MILTON SHUMBA

SAFE AND FOUR LEG BYES! Anrich Nortje nails the yorker on the leg stump line, Milton Shumba is late to get his bat down and the ball deflects off his boot towards the fine leg fence for a boundary. Temba Bavuma takes a review for the LBW. UltraEdge shows no bat involved and Ball Tracking shows it is pitching outside leg. However, the question was whether Shumba tried to offer a shot or not. The umpires are satisfied and Zimbabwe get the runs.

!

DRS time. South Africa have appealed for an lbw against Milton Shumba. It has pitched outside leg.

KAGISO RABADA TO WESSLY MADHEVERE

FOUR! Another one for Wesley Madhevere! This is poor from Rabada, he bowls this short and wide outside off, Wesley Madhevere reaches for it and cuts it towards the vacant deep point fence for a boundary. 17 from the over and Zimbabwe are finishing strongly.

KAGISO RABADA TO WESSLY MADHEVERE

Good fielding in the deep! This is short again and on middle, Wesley Madhevere pulls it hard and wide of deep square leg where Rilee Rossouw covers his ground well and dives to his left to stop the boundary. A couple of runs are taken.

SIX! BANG! Wesley Madhevere sends this one over the fence! Kagiso Rabada lands this short again and on middle, Wesley Madhevere stays there and pulls it over the deep mid-wicket fence for a biggie. 50 up!
