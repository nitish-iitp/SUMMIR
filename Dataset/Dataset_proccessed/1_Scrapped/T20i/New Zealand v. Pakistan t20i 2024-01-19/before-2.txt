ICC U19 World Cup 2024 will begin from 19th January.

The 15th edition of the ICC U19 World Cup is set to begin from 19th January, 2024. South Africa earned the hosting rights of the tournament and replaced Sri Lanka, who were the earlier supposed to hold the tournament. International Cricket Council (ICC) suspended Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) during the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 due to political interference and South Africa got the chance to host the U19 World Cup for the third time.

A total of 48 matches will be played among 16 teams in the 23-day-long tournament. India are the most successful side in the tournaments history and have won 5 editions of the U19 World Cup. India will also enter as the defending champions and hot-favourites of the upcoming mega youth event. India won the U19 World Cup 2022 in West Indies by defeating England in the finals.

16 teams have been divided into groups of four, where the top three teams from each group will qualify for the Super 6 stage. Two groups will be further divided in the Super 6 round with each group consisting of six teams. The top three teams from group A and D will qualify in group 1 and teams from group B and C for group 2. The top 2 teams in each Super 6 group will play in semi-finals.
