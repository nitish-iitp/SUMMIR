New Zealand vs Pakistan: Despite Mohammad Rizwan’s record-breaking performance, Pak lose fourth straight match
NZ vs Pak: Mohammad Rizwan waged a lone battle, notching up the highest score by a visiting wicket-keeper in New Zealand but Pakistan managed a below-par total in Christchurch on Friday.

New Delhi: Pakistan’s star wicket-keeper batter Mohammad Rizwan went past his record as he scored an unbeaten knock of 90 runs in the fourth T20I match against the Kiwis on Friday. But despite his efforts, the Men in Green couldn’t post a challenging total, they were skittled for 158/5 at the Hagley Oval. New Zealand won the match by seven wickets on Friday. Daryll Mitchell and Glenn Phillips stitched a record-breaking partnership of 139 runs off 93 balls. At one point they looked in trouble as they were reeling at 20/3 on the back of Shaheen Shah Afridi’s three-wicket haul but Phillips and Mitchell helpe the team bounce and take an unassialable lead of 4-0 in the five-match series.

Mohammad Rizwan missed out on becoming the 2nd Asian batter after Suryakumar Yadav to have scored a century in the shortest format in New Zealand as he remained unbeaten on 90 runs off 60 balls. He couldn’t bat much in the last 2 overs as Mohammad Nawaz faced Adam Milne, where he smashed him for three sixes in the last over. Rizwan could play just four balls in the last over as Tim Southee didn’t let him play big shots.

The Shaheen Shah Afridi-led posted the lowest total of the series on a pitch that wasn’t batters-friend; as it was in the first three matches. The Kane Williamson-led side scored 266 in the first match, 194 in the second match, and 224 in the third match since they batted first in all these matches. New Zealand has already taken an unassailable lead of 3-0 in this series.

Mohammad Rizwan had scored 86 runs before the last over but he couldn’t get to his boundaries to get to his century.

He is the highest run-scorer in the shortest format in visiting countries as he scored 89 runs off 59 balls in Napier in December 2020.

Most runs by visiting WKs in New Zealand T20Is:

1. Mohammad Rizwan – 90 not out in 63 balls in Christchurch in 2024

2. Mohammad Rizwan – 89 in 59 balls in Napier in 2020

3. Kusal Mendis – 73 in 48 balls in Queenstown in 2023

4. KL Rahul – 57 in 50 in Auckland in 2020

Why Pakistan couldn’t perform well with the bat?

Pakistan made one change in their playing XI as the wicket-keeper batter Azam Khan sat out as he couldn’t score much in the first three matches.

Saim Ayub, who was backed by the team management, also failed as he scored one run from 6 balls. He did score a gritty knock of 27 runs in the first match, but then scored just 12 runs in the next three matches.

Babar Azam looked in sublime form as he smashed a couple of boundaries but Adam Milne dismissed him after he scored just 19 runs off 11 balls in the seventh over. His streak of scoring three consecutive fifties was ended as he was the lone warrior in the batting unit in the first three matches.

Fakhar Zaman was seen struggling as he faced just 15 balls whereas Sahibzada Farhan batted in the middle order. Farhan replaced Azam Khan but couldn’t post a challenging total as he was dismissed for just one run as Lockie Ferguson took his second wicket in the 13th over.

Mohammad Nawaz did score a gritty knock of 21 runs off nine balls.
