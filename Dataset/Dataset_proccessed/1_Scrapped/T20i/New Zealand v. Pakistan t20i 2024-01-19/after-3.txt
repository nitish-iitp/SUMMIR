NZ vs PAK I Twitter laughs as bat-less Rizwan’s Kabaddi antics fail to fetch 'bonus point'

Pakistan is a team known for its funny shenanigans and there seems to be no stoppage for it. A similar thing happened in the third T20I between New Zealand and Pakistan on Friday in Dunedin where Mohammed Rizwan orchestrated some amusing running between the wickets, resulting in a short run.

‌After New Zealand had put up a mammoth total of 224/7 on the back of a splendid century from Finn Allen, Pakistan were in need of a strong start. Unfortunately, they lost Saim Ayub for 10 upon which the onus shifted to Rizwan and Babar Azam. At 49/1 in 5.4 overs, Pakistan needed to knock off 176 more from 86 balls when Rizwan tucked a ball from Matt Henry towards the on-side. As Rizwan hit the ball on the backfoot he lost his balance and nearly tripped, losing his bat in the process. With the ball headed between deep midwicket and long-on, Rizwan realised an opportunity to complete a couple. But without a bat, he knew he had to stretch extra to make the crease.

Hence, with the bat not at his disposal to make the crease, Rizwan slumped and touched the crease at the non-striker end with his hand before turning around quickly and ran for the second. With a strong throw coming in, Rizwan was forced to dive. Upon looking at the replay by the broadcasters, it was highlighted that Rizwan was in fact guilty of a short run as his gloves touched the ground a couple of inches before the crease.

Twitterverse was left in splits with this hilarious show of antics by Rizwan and took to social media to share some good laughs.

 

Legendary stuff!!

Get it

This is Pakistan's team! This is not Babar Azam or Mohammad Rizwan's team. Please get it 🇵🇰



How can you say you two were doing great? That means there are no better openers in Pakistan? Did we win T20 World Cup 2021, 2022 or Asia Cup 2022? 👎🏼 #NZvsPAKpic.twitter.com/5KIqRPuVYn

Ohh

The full press conference this scum decided to not include. Please do listen to it as this is what he has really said about Saim. Its positive and constructive



In summary



Rizwan called the team management changes perfect as a team needs to look for combinations to find the best… https://t.co/3IUDAmPSgA pic.twitter.com/0KPFE3p1JC
