The participating teams in the 2024 edition include the Chattogram Challengers, Comilla Victorians, Durdanto Dhaka, Fortune Barishal, Khulna Tigers, Rangpur Riders and Sylhet Strikers. These teams are poised to showcase their talent and determination, striving for the coveted T20 league title.

Comilla Victorians’ quest for fifth BPL Title

The Victorians, four-time defending champions from the previous edition, are anticipated to encounter fierce competition from other contenders. Notably, the Strikers, runners-up in the 2023 season, led the points table during group stage, only to be defeated by the Victorians in the first Qualifier and again in the final, resulting in the latter securing the trophy.

Strategic shifts in teams dynamics

Several changes have unfolded in the squads of the seven participating teams. Two of Bangladesh’s cricketing stalwarts, Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan, have altered their allegiances. Mushfiqur, formerly associated with Sylhet, now captains Barishal, replacing Shakib. Meanwhile, Shakib will play for Rangpur but won’t assume the captaincy.

With four titles to their credit, Victorians stands as the most successful team in BPL history. Litton Das has been appointed as their captain for this year, succeeding Imrul Kayes, who guided them to consecutive titles in 2022 and 2023. The stage is set for an enthralling season, where each team will endeavor to carve its name into the annals of BPL glory.
