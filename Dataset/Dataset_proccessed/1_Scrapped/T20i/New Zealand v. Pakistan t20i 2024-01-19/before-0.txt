The ICC Under 19 Men's Cricket World Cup is all set to kick off on 19 January 2024, with a double header pitting hosts South Africa against the West Indies and Ireland taking on the USA.

The 15th edition of the tournament will feature the rising stars of 16 countries battling it out in 41 matches, with five venues featuring the future of the international game.

Ahead of the tournament, here's everything you need to know about the World Cup.

GROUPS

Group A - Bangladesh, India, Ireland, USA

Group B - England, Scotland, South Africa, West Indies

Group C - Australia, Namibia, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe

Group D - Afghanistan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan

FORMAT

The event will welcome a new format for this edition, where the three teams progressing from each of the four groups will enter a new Super Six stage, starting 30 January.

Two groups of six teams will clash to determine the semifinalists and the subsequent finalists.

The bottom-placed teams will then meet in placement games to determine finishing positions 13 to 16.

It will be the third time that South Africa has hosted the Under-19 World Cup - after previous editions in 1998 and 2020.

All teams will play two warm-up fixtures in South Africa between January 13-17.

KEY DATES

Group A and Group B action begins on the 19 January opening day, with Ireland meeting the USA in Bloemfontein, and the hosts meeting the West Indies in Potchefstroom.

Group D’s opening match (Afghanistan v Pakistan) will be played out on 20 January in East London, while Group C, based in Kimberley, begins on 21 January. Sri Lanka meet Zimbabwe to open group action.

Attention then turns to the Super Six stage from 30 January, with the top three teams from Groups A and D put together with the top three of Groups B and D. The teams play two matches in this phase, and avoid the team that finished in the corresponding position in the other group. For example, the top finisher in Group A play the second and third teams in Group D.

Semifinals begin on 6 February, with the final on 11 February. Both semifinals and the final will be held at Willowmoore Park in Benoni.

Tournament History

The tournament was first contested in 1988 and was then known as the Youth Cricket World Cup. The hosts, Australia, won the tournament on that occasion, beating Pakistan by five wickets. The next edition was held after a gap of 10 years in South Africa. England were the champions on this occasion.

The defending champions, India, have been the most successful side in the tournament, with five titles to their name. Australia are the next best with three titles. Pakistan have won it twice, doing so in 2004 and 2006, while Bangladesh, England, South Africa and West Indies have all won it once.
