COMMENTRY
Right then, that’s it from this game but the action continues in the Asian Games, 2023. Afghanistan will take on India in the Final of the Asian Games. That game will begin at 11.30 am IST (6.00 am GMT). But as know, you can always join us early for the build-up which begins shortly. Until then, goodbye and cheers!
Earlier today, Pakistan started off well after having put into first and were 48 for 1 at the end of 5 overs when the rain halted the play. The innings could not go further and ended at the 5-over mark. Khushdil Shah and Mirza Tahir Baig were aggressive right from the start. Mirza Tahir Baig was batting on 32 off just 18 when there was a break in play. Rakibul Hasan was the pick of the Bangladeshi bowlers in his short spell of 2 overs as he picked the solitary wicket of Khushdil Shah. Bangladesh will be mighty proud of their effort to end up with bronze medal in the Asian Games, 2023.
Arshad Iqbal was sensational for Pakistan with the ball. He picked up 2 wickets in the opening over and came back to take another in the 4th over to round off an outstanding spell of 3 for 14 off two overs. Sufiyan Muqeem took a wicket as well but was smacked all around the park giving away 32 in his 2 overs as Pakistan slumped to a narrow loss.
Bangladesh have the bronze medal. Phew! What a humdinger we have witnessed in the 3rd place game between Pakistan and Bangladesh. Chasing 65 for the win in just 5 overs, Bangladesh was off to a horror start losing two wickets in the first over. Afif Hossain and Yasir Ali added 43 in quick time and set the tone for the chase. They kept finding boundaries at regular intervals and kept their hopes alive. With 20 needed off the final over, Yasir Ali smacked 16 off the first four balls and got out in a anti-climatic way. Rakibul Hasan came in and hit the winning runs to get his side over the line.

FOUR! Bangladesh Clinches the Bronze Medal as Rakibul Hasan smashes this fuller one towards deep mid-wicket pocket for a boundary of the last delivery of this game.
