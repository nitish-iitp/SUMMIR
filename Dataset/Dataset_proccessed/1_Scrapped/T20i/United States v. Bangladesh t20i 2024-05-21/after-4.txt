Everything you need to know about the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024
All the important information surrounding the ninth edition of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup that will be co-hosted by the USA and West Indies.

By Jonathan Healy

Format

The ninth edition of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup will feature a record number of teams, with 20 different sides represented in a tournament co-hosted by the USA and West Indies between June 1-29.

The 20 teams are separated into four groups of five for the first stage of the event, with each team playing a minimum of four matches against their other group members during that initial group stage.

The top two sides from each group then progress to the Super 8s stage of the event, with the bottom three teams from each group eliminated.

The remaining eight teams are then split into another two groups during the Super 8s phase, with sides to play three matches against their group rivals to determine the semi-finalists.

The semi-finals will be played out between the top two teams from each Super 8s group, with the winners then progressing to the one-off final in Barbados on June 29.
