The Men's T20 World Cup will begin on June 1 with the hosts USA taking on Canada. The competition has seen an expansion from the previous edition which was held in Australia 2022.


T20 World Cup Groups and Teams

This time around 20 teams are participating in the T20 World Cup, the teams have been divided into groups of five in the first round, the top two teams from each group will qualify for the super eights, the teams in a group of four then split into two pools. The Top Two teams from each group will qualify for the semi-finals. The Final is scheduled to be held on June 29 at Bridgetown in Barbados.

All the teams barring Pakistan have announced their provisional squads for the World Cup. The Pakistani Team will announce their squad after the first T20I against England.

Apart from the playing contingent the radar is also on the coaching staff of the competing teams as many former international stars are a part of the World Cup as backroom staff members.
