The 100% Cricket Future Leaders Programme is coming back in 2024 with a new look!
The ICC is excited to announce that the much-anticipated Future Leaders Programme will be returning in 2024.

The Future Leaders Programme is the ICC’s programme to support upcoming female leaders in the sport and forms part of the ICC’s strategic priority to accelerate the growth of women’s cricket and women in the game. It falls under the 100% Cricket campaign, the objective of which is to promote gender equity, as well as to empower women and young girls through cricket.

The Future Leaders Programme has run three successful batches so far. Each batch saw applicants paired with mentors who were senior leaders from across cricket over a six-month period. Mentees received training and support in their areas of expertise in dealing with real-time and real-world issues and projects.

In 2024, the Future Leaders Programme will focus on two workstreams in particular: Coaching and Administration, looking to address the specific problem of the low percentage of women in leadership positions in these fields.

The Coaching workstream will see two regional programmes delivered in 2024, beginning in the ICC’s East Asia Pacific region at the ICC U19 Women’s T20 World Cup EAP Qualifier starting tomorrow (14th May 2024). The programme has paired ten upcoming female coaches from six countries with each participating nation: Fiji, Samoa, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. The eight-month programme, supported by ICC Hall of Famer and ICC Master Educator Cathryn Fitzpatrick, provides an exciting opportunity for aspiring female coaches to develop their skills in a tournament environment and build networks whilst being supported on their coaching journey throughout the year.
