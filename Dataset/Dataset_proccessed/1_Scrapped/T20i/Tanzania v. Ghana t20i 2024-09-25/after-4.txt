Kicking things off in our top 10 this week are West Country duo Ollie Lawrence and Tomos Williams, who both racked up 62 metres in their respective games.

Bath centre, Lawrence, played a crucial role in his side’s win over Northampton Saints on Friday night, making his 62 metres from 10 carries – an average of 6.2 metres per carry – and he also notched a try in the 38-16 victory.

Gloucester’s new recruit, Williams, arrived at Kingsholm with high expectations; and whilst his side couldn’t get the win against Saracens, he still gave a very good account of himself. The scrum-half notched his 62 metres from 11 carries – an average of 5.6 metres per carry.

8. Siva Naulago – 63

Pipping the duo into eighth-place is Bristol’s Fijian ace Siva Naulago, who continued where he left off last season with a fine attacking display.

The winger made his 63 metres from just nine carries – an average of seven metres per carry – and he also grabbed himself a try in the 24-3 win over Newcastle Falcons.

7. Ivan van Zyl – 66

The Premiership is gifted with some top-quality scrum-halves, but Saracens‘ number nine, Ivan van Zyl, is potentially the most underrated in the competition.

The South African half-back had yet another stellar game in his side’s 35-26 win over Gloucester on Saturday, and he was his side’s chief metre-maker with 66 from just five carries – an average of 13.2 metres per carry!

6. George Barton – 67

The Cherry and Whites are blessed with options at 15, with both Santi Carreras and Gareth Anscombe able to play there, but young gun George Barton certainly gave a good account of himself there against Saracens.

The academy graduate notched his 67 metres from 11 carries – an average of 6.1 metres per carry.

5. Gabriel Ibitoye – 70

Bristol Bears ace Gabriel Ibitoye led this chart last season with an astonishing 1432 metres, and he looked in red-hot form again in this department in his side’s win at Kingston Park.

The winger made his 70 metres from 14 carries – an average of five metres per carry.

4. Tom de Glanville – 76

Versatile Bath back Tom de Glanville missed the end of last season through injury, but he showed what an asset he is to their squad against Northampton on Friday night.

The 24-year-old made his 76 metres from 10 carries – an average of 7.6 metres per carry.

3. George Furbank – 84

Just edging out his Bath counterpart from the clash on Friday night is new Saints skipper George Furbank.

The England international was arguably his side’s best player at the weekend, and made his 84 metres from 15 carries – an average of 5.6 metres per carry.

2. Josh Hodge – 87

Despite the defeat at Sandy Park, the Exeter backline had a solid outing in attack, and Josh Hodge was right at the heart of it.

The exciting fullback notched his 87 metres from 11 carries – an average of 7.9 metres per carry.

Rounding off our list this weekend is Hodge’s Chiefs teammate Immanuel Feyi-Waboso, who showed just why he is the most exciting talent in the Premiership right now.

The England international made his 144 metres from 19 carries – an average of 7.6 metres per carry.
