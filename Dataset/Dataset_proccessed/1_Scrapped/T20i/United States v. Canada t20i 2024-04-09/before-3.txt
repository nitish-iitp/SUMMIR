Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH ) will face off in their next match. Who will win the 9th T20 Match of the Indian Premier League 2024? Find out in the PBKS vs SRH Today Match Prediction. The cricket match between Punjab Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad will be held on Tuesday, April 9th, at the Venue Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium, Mullanpur, Mohali, Chandigarh.

PBKS vs SRH Today Match Prediction – Team Analysis
Punjab Kings (PBKS)

Punjab Kings (PBKS) have been inconsistent in the ongoing IPL 2021 season, having won two and lost two in their first four games.

Liam Livingstone was absent in the previous game of the team against GT due to an injury. Nonetheless, he was not in good form either way. Although PBKS added Sikandar Raza to the team, he also failed to leave an impact. There are concerns about Jonny Bairstow’s form as well. Raza is expected to maintain his position in the team due to his all-round abilities, and one of Bairstow or Livingstone should be included in the playing XI.

During their recent match against Gujarat Titans, Punjab Kings discovered a new star in Shashank Singh. He scored an impressive 61 runs in just 29 balls, helping the team chase down a target of 201 runs. However, despite occasional flashes of brilliance, Punjab Kings have struggled consistently due to erratic performances. While Shikhar Dhawan has been a dependable player, other key players such as Jonny Bairstow, Prabhsimran Singh, Sam Curran, and Liam Livingstone have failed to consistently contribute with the bat. Similarly, Kagiso Rabada has been outstanding in bowling, but he hasn’t received enough support from the rest of the bowling unit.

Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH )

Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) have been playing aggressive cricket. Due to their style, they might sometimes lose a few matches. They’ve played four games, won two, and lost two.

Jaydev Unadkat and T Natarajan bowl in a similar way, especially on pitches with speed and bounce. It doesn’t make sense to have them both in the team at the same time. Instead, Umran Malik could replace one of them, usually Unadkat. Also, Rahul Tripathi could come in for Mayank Agarwal.

Punjab Kings will face Sunrisers Hyderabad, who seem very strong despite losing two out of four games. SRH’s batting has been exceptional this season, with players like Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram, and Heinrich Klassen in great form. If these batters continue their streak, it’ll be tough to halt them. PBKS will need to perform exceptionally well to stop SRH’s momentum.

Plus, they have Cummins, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, and Natarajan for a strong bowling attack. Punjab Kings have been inconsistent, especially in batting.
