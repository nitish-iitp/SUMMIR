India vs Afghanistan 2nd T20I Highlights:

India vs Afghanistan 2nd T20I Highlights: Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shivam Dube have made a mockery of the 173-run target that Afghanistan set for India to chase and the hosts won the match with six wickets and 26 balls to spare. Jaiswal scored 68 off 34 balls in a 92-run partnership with Dube that came in just 42 balls before falling to Karim Janat in the 13th over, by which point India were already on the cusp of victory. Dube remained unbeaten on 63 off 32 balls while Virat Kohli smashed 29 in just 16 balls in his first T20I since November 2022.

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, IND vs AFG 2nd T20I: India beat Afghanistan by 6 wickets

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, IND vs AFG 2nd T20I: Farooqi nailed a couple of yorkers and the batters run a leg bye off the fourth ball to finish off this chase. Extraordinary from the Indian batters today. Dube ends unbeaten on 63 off 32, he has been the heart of a chase for the second consecutive match. Rinku at the other end on a run a ball nine. Jaiswal walking out from dug out to shake hands having smashed 68 off 34. As does Kohli having scored 29 in 16. So far, the only real failure among the Indian batters in this series has been captain Rohit, who has two ducks to his name in two matches. But he has led India to victory in the series though, having taken an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. The third match will be played in Bengaluru.
