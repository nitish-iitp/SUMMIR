Dream11 fantasy XI tips and guide for the 1st T20 of the Zimbabwe’s tour of Sri Lanka 2024 between SL vs ZIM to be played in Colombo.

After a brilliant three-match ODI series between Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, it is time for the shortest format of the game. Both teams will face each other in the three-match T20I series. The first game will be played on Sunday, January 14, at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.

Sri Lanka won the ODI series 2-0 and will be pretty confident to win the T20I series as well. But Zimbabwe have also got a pretty good squad in the T20Is and they can challenge any team. Hence, it is expected to be a brilliant series ahead.
