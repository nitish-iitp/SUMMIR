Yes, it's time to crown Miss Universe 2023 and with over 86 women contesting for the beauty crown, the 71st annual Miss Universe will be held on Saturday, January 14, 2023 to once again celebrate women around the world and advocate for humanitarian work. The beauty pageant will be hosted at the Ernest N Morial Convention Center in New Orleans, Louisiana where the winner will be crowned by current Miss Universe - India's Harnaaz Sandhu, who took home the crown on December 13, 2021.

This year, ‘Miss Universe India’ Divita Rai is also among the 86 women contesting for the crown while Miss USA R'Bonney Gabriel will represent America. Unlike the last 5 years, Steve Harvey, famous for announcing the wrong winner in 2015 and having Harnaaz Sandhu meow onstage in 2021, will not be hosting Miss Universe 2023.

Instead, this year's hosts will be Miss Universe 2012 Olivia Culpo and ‘The Real’ star Jeannine Mai Jenkins while the backstage commentary will be done by Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray and ‘Access Hollywood’ correspondent Zuri Hall who had also been the host for the last two Miss USA pageants. The show will feature performances by New Orleans's musical bands Big Freedia and Big Sam's Funky Nation, American fiddler Amanda Shaw's violin skills and also performances by Yolanda Adams and Tank And The Bangas.

As per the Indian Standard Time, Miss Universe 2023 will take place on Sunday morning i.e. January 15 at 6:30 am. According to the Eastern Time, the beauty pageant will be held on Saturday evening i.e. January 14 at 8 pm.

The host venue, the Ernest N Morial Convention Center in New Orleans, Louisiana will air the show and viewers in India can catch the stream live on VIACOM 18-owned Voot or watch it on JKN18 channel's official Facebook and YouTube channels. Those outside India can watch the live stream for free on the Roku Channel's website at 7 pm ET or on Telemundo at the same time in Spanish.
