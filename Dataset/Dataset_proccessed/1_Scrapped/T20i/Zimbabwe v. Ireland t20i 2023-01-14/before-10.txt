What did Richard Bedbrook, the head of England’s women’s pathways who chaired the selection panel have to say?

“It’s hugely exciting to name this squad and to think ahead to the opportunity that awaits the players. They’re a tremendous group of young cricketers with great potential at the beginning of their journeys in the game. They’ll all benefit hugely from this experience – on and off the field. It’s important to compete in this age group and it’s equally important to continue the process of learning what it takes to progress to the next level. I’m sure we’ll take a lot away from the tournament. We have the ambition for the next few months to be a significant life moment for all the players and ensure they use it as a springboard towards making an impact in senior regional cricket, and hopefully beyond in years to come.” He added, “The ICC U19 Women’s T20 World Cup will provide an exciting platform for the best young players around the world and it will be really exciting to see our players compete against their peers in a global event.”
