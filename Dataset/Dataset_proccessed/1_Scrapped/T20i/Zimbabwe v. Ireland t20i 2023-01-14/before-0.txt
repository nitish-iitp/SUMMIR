It has been quite lackadaisical from the ICC as they have not reported on the matches that happened today on their website which made procuring scores and additional information extremely difficult and with the matches not being telecasted, the fans were certainly deprived of live-action.

We will be hoping for better coverage for the next set of matches on 11th January.

Here’s the schedule for the same and mark your calendars!
