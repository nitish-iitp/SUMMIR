The Premier League is back up and running after the World Cup break and now, the focus will be on the League title. As things stand, we have an interesting race up top but considering it’s only the halfway point of the season, a lot can change. This weekend, every team will be in action and this is a key matchweek for each team. Here are our best picks for Matchday 20.

Aston Villa vs Leeds United

This is a matchup between two mid-table teams and on the surface, it looks like it could go either way. While that’s true, give us Villa. They will be at home in this fixture and they have been solid at home recently. In their past four games at Villa Park, they have two wins and a draw from those matches. After a brutal start that saw Villa in last place in the early stages of the season, they have clearly bounced back and seem to have stabilized. Also, while Leeds are a dangerous team, they are much better at home and cannot be trusted defensively. Although Villa’s offense is lacking at times, take them to win this game and continue their strong mid-season form.

Manchester United vs Manchester City

Erling Haaland Anytime Goalscorer
This is the first of two marquee games this weekend and this Manchester Derby should be a fun one. Fourth-place Manchester United will host second-place Manchester City in a game that could truly go either way. While we would like to take City, they have been inconsistent so we will stay away from them and bet on their main man, Erling Haaland, to grab a goal. Simply put, Haaland has been divine this season and has 21 goals in 16 Premier League matches. While United have a solid defense, we will bet Haaland to score any time his odds are in this range and he should put on a show in this Derby battle.

Marcus Rashford Anytime Goalscorer

In the same game, but with much longer goalscorer odds, lies Marcus Rashford. And he is becoming a great bet to score as well. While he’s more unreliable than Haaland, United needed someone to step up in the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo and Rashford is doing that. He has a goal in his last six games across all competitions for United and he is filling Ronaldo’s shoes admirably. While United may have a tough time breaking down the City defense and creating chances, Rashford only needs one and at +300, that’s alright with us.

Brighton vs Liverpool

Liverpool’s season has been marred by inconsistency but we are sticking with them. While this should be a tough game, Liverpool have been pretty solid away from home recently and have won their last three road matches. Now, they will play a middling Brighton team who have lost two in a row on their home field. While Liverpool haven’t given backers too many reasons to believe in them, we feel like this is a good matchup for them and they outclass Brighton in many key areas. Liverpool’s bugaboo this season has been their defense but Brighton have struggled to score all season and are winning games with their defensive prowess. In this game, we think Liverpool will break down that defense and do enough defensively to escape with a win.

Brentford vs Bournemouth

Simply put, Brentford are a huge surprise this season. They currently sit in ninth place but have garnered key results against the big clubs this season. Now, they get to play 16th-place Bournemouth. And it shouldn’t be too difficult for them to win here. Brentford have been great recently and haven’t lost in six consecutive Premier League matches. On the other side of the pitch, Bournemouth have won only once away from home this season and they should struggle to create anything at Gtech Community Stadium. Take Brentford to win and carry on their fine season with a relatively easy win.

Newcastle United vs Fulham

Alexander Isak Anytime Goalscorer

Alexander Isak is a young striker for Newcastle who has been on the shelf due to injury for the past few months. While that’s not ideal, he flashed for the Magpies prior to his injury and scored twice in three Premier League matches. Now, he projects to be back for this game and he should immediately become their main man. Newcastle have been unbelievable this season and sit in third right now. They create a lot of chances for whoever is playing up top and Isak should take full advantage of that. Against a fine Fulham defense, we don’t expect Newcastle to struggle and they should feed Isak all day long. Take Isak to score a goal at +125 and show Newcastle supporters why he was their record signing this past Summer Transfer Window.

Tottenham vs Arsenal

This is going to be a fun one. The North London Derby has featured some classic games in the past and it wouldn’t be shocking if we get another one this weekend. On Sunday, fifth-place Tottenham will host first-place Arsenal in a match that could truly go either way. That being said, give us the Gunners. At this point in time, Tottenham cannot be trusted. Spurs are in a rough stretch of form and have only one win in their last four Premier League matches at Tottenham Hotspur stadium. While guys like Harry Kane and Richarlison will surely cause problems for Arsenal defensively, the Gunners have held up defensively all season and are currently conceding less than a goal a game. Also, Arsenal have an impressive record away from home and have only lost once on another team’s pitch this season. Everything is going Arsenal’s way this season and we expect that to continue in this spot. Take Arsenal to win at +120 and watch them work to dismantle their rivals in this massive North London Derby.
