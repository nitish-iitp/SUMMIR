New Zealand captain Kane Williamson set a new record for the fastest fifty in the men's T20 World Cup final after getting to the landmark in 32 balls against Australia in the summit clash in Dubai on Sunday.

Williamson brought up his 14th T20I half-century with consecutive sixes against Glenn Maxwell in the 13th over of New Zealand's innings after Aaron Finch won the toss and elected to bowl first.

Williamson beat Sri Lanka legend Kumar Sangakkara and Joe Root's record by 1 ball and also became the second captain to hit a fifty in men's T20 World Cup finals.

Sangakkara was the first skipper to score a fifty in the 2009 final against Pakistan at Lord's. His unbeaten 64 in a lost cause was also the highest score by a captain in T20 World Cup finals until Williamson crossed that mark in the 16th over against Mitchell Starc, which ultimately went for 22 runs courtesy four boundaries and a six hit by the Blackcaps skipper.

Williamson was eventually dismissed for 85 off 48 balls by Josh Hazlewood in the 18th over as New Zealand reached 172 for 4 after being asked to bat first. He matched West Indies all-rounder Marlon Samuels' record (85* vs England in 2016) for the highest individual score in a T20 World Cup final with his swashbuckling knock that included 10 fours and 3 sixes.

Interestingly, Williamson was dropped on 21 by Hazlewood in the 11th over bowled by Starc. He then made the Aussies pay by adding another 64 runs to New Zealand's total.

Neither team has won the men's T20 World Cup so far, but Australia came closest in 2010, finishing runners-up, so the tournament will have a first-time champion on November 14.

The last time these two teams met at a World Cup final was in 2015 when the trans-Tasman neighbours co-hosted the 50-over World Cup. Although Brendon McCullum's men had edged Michael Clarke's side in the group stage, the final at the MCG went comprehensively Australia's way.

But repeating history won't be easy for Australia against a New Zealand side recognised as the one of best teams across formats in international cricket.

This summit clash is New Zealand's third-successive World Cup final after 2015 and 2019, both of which they lost after coming up short against Australia and England respectively. That is one record which Kane Williamson's team will look to change come Sunday.
