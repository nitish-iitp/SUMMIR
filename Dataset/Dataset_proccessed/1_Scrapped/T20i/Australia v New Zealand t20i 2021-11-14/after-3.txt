NZ vs AUS Highlights, T20 WORLD CUP 2021 Final: New Zealand Vs Australia T20 Final.

New Zealand Vs Australia Highlights: AUSTRALIA ARE THE NEW T20 WORLD CUP CHAMPIONS! Courtesy of David Warner's 53 and Mitchell Marsh's 77 not-out, the Aussies chase down the target of 173 in 18.5 overs to bag their maiden world title in the shortest format. In response, the Black Caps drew first blood as Trent Boult dismissed Aaron Finch in the 3rd over. However, that did not deter Mitchell Marsh from taking on Adam Milne in his first over, smashing him for two fours and a six. Along with Warner, he took Australia to 43/1 after the first 6 overs. The duo continued in the same vein and went on to stitch another 50-run stand. They handed Australia the command of the chase by taking the side to 82/1 after 10 overs.  Warner got to his 50 before being cleaned up by Trent Boult on 53. Soon after, Marsh smashed a 50 off 31 balls, fastest in a T20 WC final, to take Australia to 136/2 in 15 overs. He stitched an unbeaten 67-run stand for the 3 wicket with Glenn Maxwell to take the side home with 1.1 overs to spare. In the first innings, New Zealand set Australia a target of 173 in 20 overs to win the T20 World Cup final. Martin Guptill and Daryl Mitchell struck some early boundaries to power the Black Caps to 23/0 after 3 overs. Off Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Wade dropped Guptill. In the next over, Josh Hazlewood removed Mitchell as NZ then stuttered to 37/1 after 7 overs. Then Kane Williamson hit a few boundaries to help New Zealand reach 57/1 after 10 overs. In 31 balls, he brought up his 50 to take New Zealand to 102/2 after 14 overs. Williamson smashed Mitchell Starc for 22 runs in an over to take NZ to 117/2 after 17 overs. His onslaught ended on 85 off 48 balls as Hazlewood scalped the big finish after getting rid of Glenn Phillips in the same over. Tim Seifer and Jimmy Neesham guided NZ to 172/4 in 20 overs.

NZ vs AUS, T20 World Cup Final: Australia's Aaron Finch, the winning captain, speaks

"This is huge. To be the first Australian team to be able to do it. So proud. We knew our backs were against the wall. We had some great individual performances, some great team performances. Can't believe people wrote him off saying he was done (Warner). That's when he plays his best cricket. Was almost like poking the bear. The player of the tournament for me (Zampa). Mitch Marsh - what a way to start his innings today. Wade coming into this game with an injury cloud but got a job done. Stoinis did the business."

NZ vs AUS: Kane Williamson, the losing captain from New Zealand, speaks

"We were trying to get a platform and the surface was holding a fraction. But typical to here in Dubai. It was nice to build some partnerships and get what we thought was a competitive total. Only to be chased superbly by Australia. They're a fantastic side. We certainly made every effort. Guys came out and committed to their plans. They didn't give an inch really. Really proud of our team's efforts throughout. Came here in the final and gave it our best shot but it wasn't enough. Conditions varied a lot from venue to venue but we adjusted well. Nice to get to the big dance. Credit to Australia. Today they really turned it on. High hopes coming into this game. Never nice. Winning and losing are two possible outcomes."

David Warner is the player of the tourname

"Always felt really well. Didn't get much time in the middle in the two practice matches obviously. But for me it was about going back to basics. Going to hard, synthetic wickets and try to hit some balls. Definitely up there with 2015. Being part of the World Cup final against England a decade ago definitely hurt. These guys are a great bunch of guys. Great support staff, great team, great support back home. Just wanted to put on a great spectacle for everyone. Bit of nerves around with a good score on the board. Just great to see the guys deliver," says Warner

Mitchell Marsh is the Player of the Match

“Lot of people say this but I really don't have words right now. An amazing six weeks with this group. Coaching staff came up to me in the West Indies and said you'll bat three for this tournament/series. Absolutely jumped at the idea of that. Done a little bit of that for the Scorchers. I must thank everyone in the supportstaff for backing me. Not a whole lot of thinking that goes into that (first ball for six). Just wanted to go out there and have a presence. Big Marcus Stoinis always talks about having a presence,” says Marsh

New Zealand vs Australia T20 World Cup Final Live Cricket Score: Steve Smith picks

Steven Smith: It means a lot. We have worked hard for a long time and it is honour to be here with the boys and take the trophy home. Warner's last two weeks have been amazing. A lot of people were writing him off. He came in with exceptional intent and took the game away at the start.

New Zealand vs Australia Live Cricket Score: Post-match players talk

Mitchell Starc: "It's not been an ideal lead up. But this is the closest the guys were and it has shown in the way we played our cricket. Different guys in different games and the closeness with the guys has taken us through. Zampa has been the best bowler by far in white ball over the last two years. We know how to bowl around him. The bowling group just know our roles a lot clearer."

Pat Cummins: "Pretty pumped. Once we go back home it will sink in. A lot of support back home, they've gotten up at 1am. It's a good thing to play some IPL here. Even Hazlewood was able to adapt quickly because of that."

What a win, especially when no one gave them a chance

Not many predicted Australia to make the semifinals before the tournament, let alone making the final and winning it but with game, the side got better and just like all the World Cup finals they have won, this one turned out to be one-sided as well.
