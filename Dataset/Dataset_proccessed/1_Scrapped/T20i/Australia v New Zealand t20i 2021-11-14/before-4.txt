ENG vs NZ Semi Final Highlights, T20 WORLD CUP 2021: England Vs New Zealand T20.

England Vs New Zealand Highlights: New Zealand have entered the T20 World Cup 2021 final by beating England by 5 wickets in the first semi-final in Abu Dhabi. England set New Zealand a target of 167 in 20 overs. The Kiwis struggled early in the chase, as they could only get to 36/2 by the end of the Powerplay. Pacer Chris Woakes jolted New Zealand by dismissing both Martin Guptill and Kane Williamson. Once the field opened up, the boundaries dried up for the Kiwis as they crawled to 58/2 after 10 overs. But they did manage to pick up the ante to some extent after that as they brought up their 50-run partnership off 48 deliveries. Then, Conway fell for 46 and Glenn Phillips followed him soon after as Livingstone's double strike pegged NZ back further. However, Neesham's 27 off 11 balls changed the fate of the game as he allowed Daryl Mitchell to find his range and he finished unbeaten on 72 to take the side home with 6 balls to spare. In the first innings, after being put in to bat, England started off well as Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler hit a few early boundaries. However, Bairstow's night ended early on 14 as Kane Williamson took a brilliant catch off Adam Milne. England reached 45/1 after 7 overs. In the next three overs, ENG added 22 runs but also lost their in-form batter Jos Buttler as he was trapped in plumb on 29 off Ish Sodhi. Then, it was Dawid Malan (42) and Moeen Ali who rebuilt the English innings by putting on 63 runs for the third wicket before Tim Southee got the better of Malan. Eventually, Moeen Ali dished out a few more big hits en route to his maiden T20 WC century as England posted 1664/ in 20 overs in Abu Dhabi in the ENG vs NZ clash....Read More

Sweet, sweet revenge! But all in good spirits

New Zealand were handed a painful defeat in the 2019 World Cup final by the same opposition. 2 years later, they avenge the defeat. Irrespective of how you look at it, this was a remarkable game of cricket. Two top sides fought tooth and nail and this time, the Black Caps ended on the right side of the result.

ENG vs NZ Live Updated: Kane Williamson, the winning captain, speaks

"Most players have played together in various tournaments. Knew it was going to be a great game of cricket. Thought they had a pretty competitive total. But just by staying in there, building the partnerships and cashing in on some moments, some matchups. Definitely, something that stood out today (Mitchell's character). Has batted beautifully in a high pressure situation. T20 cricket - it's a game of small margins. Depending on the surface, the short side - these things can be match-defining. He came out and hit the ball hard, that's what he does (Neesham). Changed the momentum really. Fantastic knock from Daryll, hit the big shots when it counted. We'll be following that match - going to be fantastic. We know we have another challenge coming up and we'll change our focus after tonight.

ENG vs NZ Live Score: Eoin Morgan, the losing captain, speaks

“Coming into the game we knew both sides were close in skill. Full credit to Kane and his team. They outplayed us today. Have represented ourselves in this tournament really well. Proud of the guys. They have given everything in this tournament. Thought we were right in the game until probably the 17th, 18th overs. We had them exactly where we wanted them up until that point. It was (sluggish). We're a six-hitting side but we struggled to hit sixes. But we hung in there and posted probably a par score. To come out and hit sixes from ball one like that - full credit to him (Neesham). Absolutely love playing cricket at the moment. At the forefront of change both on and off the field (the team).”

England vs New Zealand Live Updates: Daryl Mitchell is the Player of the Match

"It was a bit of a whirl at the end there. I couldn't remember what was going on, but I'm happy I got the job done. It was a challenging surface, with the new ball, and it was two-paced. The way Conway set the platform and Neesh hit a few out of the ground was amazing. We knew one or two good overs would do it, and we got the momentum back thanks to Neesham's hitting. With what's going on around the world right now, it's amazing that my old man travelled half way around the world to watch me play, so this is a proud moment," says Mitchell after receiving his award.

WHAT JUST HAPPENED? INCREDIBLE GAME

4 overs ago, not many people would have placed their bets on a New Zealand win. They lost two quick wickets and Mitchell was set but wasn't timing the ball. However, it was Jimmy Neesham's 11-ball cameo, during which he scored 27 runs, that changed the face of the game. It allowed Mitchell to find his range and once Neesham fell, Mitchell finished the job by hitting an unbeaten 72.
