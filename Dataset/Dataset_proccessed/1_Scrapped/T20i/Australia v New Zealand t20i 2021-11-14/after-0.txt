The Aussies go up for their medals, pursued by garlands of praise from Harsha Bhogle. The last man in is Aaron Finch, who then gives his interview. “This is huge,” he says, before giving some quickfire lines on his star players. Warner? “Outstanding. Can’t believe people wrote him off a couple of weeks ago. Almost like poking the bear.” Zampa? “Player of the tournament. Got big wickets, yeah, super player.” Marsh? “Put so much pressure on New Zealand, the way he came out and played.”

The trophy is handed over, the tickertape goes off, the fireworks join in, and the Aussies do a mass man-hug which turns into a mass pogo. They are the champions. They peaked at the right time.

Thanks for your company and correspondence, and we’ll be back for the Ashes, in less than a month’s time, on 8 December.

Kane Williamson is giving an interview. Affable as ever, he says Australia are “a fantastic team” who have had “a brilliant campaign”. It was “nice to get a competitive total and build some partnerships... the guys showed a lot of heart.”

The Player of the Tournament

... is David Warner, who finishes second among the leading run-makers, behind only Babar Azam. Asked if he was pumped today, he says: “I’m always pumped”.

Just as Jimmy Neesham quietly took his revenge on England in the semi, so did Warner on Williamson in the final. It was Williamson who replaced him as captain of Sunrisers Hyderabad in the middle of the IPL season, and who then dropped him from the XI. Warner, all smiles now, doesn’t mention this, but it’s quite a sub-plot.

Marsh "just wanted to have a presence"

Time for the presentations, which begin with the umpires. The only Englishman in the match, Richard Kettleborough, strides forward to collect his medal.

The player of the match is, inevitably, Mitch Marsh, for his 77 not out off 50 balls. “I don’t really have words,” he says. “I’ve just loved playing my role for this team.” Asked about hitting his first ball for six, he says: “Not a lot of thinking went into that. I just wanted to have a presence.” He’s so understated, he could be a Kiwi.

Jos Buttler has to share a flight with this lot

Mike Atherton points out that England’s all-format players are still in Dubai, and, for reasons of quarantine, they’re booked on the same flight out as the Aussies. Ouch.

The Book of Heroic Failures

There was once a bestseller called The Book of Heroic Failures. If it was still around, Kane Williamson would go straight into it. He made only seven off his first 13 balls on a pitch so dry that the ball wasn’t coming onto the bat and even Martin Guptill, a master-blaster, was reduced to mediocrity. From that point on, Williamson was a man possessed. Off his next 35 balls, he made 78. He abandoned his natural orthodoxy and gave us some wonderful improv. And it still wasn’t enough.

Now it’s the turn of Justin Langer, Australia’s coach. He says Mitch Marsh was one of the missing pieces in the jigsaw, Hazlewood has been sublime, and Zampa is “a little hippie”. For some reason, Langer doesn’t mention that between they have saved his job.

If you feel like reading the story of the whole game, here’s a snap match report, with Simon Burnton’s piece to follow.

The interviewees are coming two by two. Zampa appears with Glenn Maxwell. “Been in bubbles for nearly two years now,” Zampa says, acknowledging the role played by the backroom staff.

Josh Hazlewood teams up with Steve Smith, who salutes Marsh and Warner – “really proud of those boys”.

Zampa "our best bowler"

Now there’s another double act giving an interview, Pat Cummins (who was good) and Mitch Starc (who was hopeless). They’re generous in their praise for Adam Zampa. “He’s been our best bowler by far with a white ball,” says Cummins, or possibly Starc – the cameras have gone off to show us other members of the winning squad, cavorting around, demonstrating their love.

How did Australia do that?

They were awful against England, but they pulled themselves together. They won every toss after that, and became masters of the chase – never letting the target get too big, as Warner found his form again after what could have been a career-ending IPL. Steve Smith wasn’t even needed today: Mitch Marsh did his job for him.

Mitch Marsh, this is your moment

Fireworks are going off, the Aussie players are staging a pitch invasion, and Mitch Marsh is in tears, sinking to his knees. His innings was so good, it was almost as good as Kane Williamson’s.

Australia win with seven balls to spare!

19th over: Australia 173-2 (Marsh 77, Maxwell 28) Another mis-hit, another near miss: Southee’s slower ball is pulled straight by Marsh, and Neesham can’t quite reach it with his dive from long-off. A single, and now Australia can do it with one big hit. Two small blonde girls in yellow shorts hold ‘6’ signs hopefully. Maxwell fancies it but can only heave a single to deep midwicket. A single to Marsh too, so Maxwell can finish it with a four– and does! With a reverse flap!

18th over: Australia 162-2 (Marsh 71, Maxwell 23) Boult finishes with 2-18 and his head held high. Milne returns, and there’s yet another near-miss as Maxwell flat-bats a cut about 18 inches short of the man at mid-off. Just three singles off the over, but the Aussies can afford it: they need 11 off the last 12 balls.

“Afternoon Tim,” says Kim Thonger. “This seems to be turning into an episode of Squid Game. When do the coffin bearers walk out to the middle?”

17th over: Australia 159-2 (Marsh 69, Maxwell 22) Boult comes back too, but now even he goes for four as Marsh finds the gap, yet again, at midwicket. The partnership reaches 50 off 26 balls. Maxwell bumps into Boult, who just smiles. Last ball of his spell, Boult persuades Marsh to offer a return catch – which he drops. Oh dear.

Halfway through the over, Marsh sent for a new bat, as if unaware that the only way to make this finale exciting would be for him to have no bat.

“Assuming NZ lose this,” says Peter Salmon, “is there anywhere I can put good money on a newspaper feature before the next World Cup in any format, with a close-up pic of Kane Williamson, and the headline No More Mr Nice Guy?”

16th over: Australia 149-2 (Marsh 61, Maxwell 21) Southee returns as Williamson accepts that there’s no point keeping his best bowlers up his sleeve now. And Maxwell gets an inside edge for four more! Even the luck is with the Aussies. Then, with judgment rather than luck, he plays a lovely late pull for six. Poor old Williamson: he’s going to finish on the losing side after playing one of the all-time great innings. Australia need only 24 from 24 balls. And these two have added 42 from 22.

15th over: Australia 136-2 (Marsh 61, Maxwell 10) Williamson has one over of Boult up his sleeve (3-0-8-2), but he wants to keep it there, so he summons Milne. And he almost takes a wicket too, but Mitchell, at deep backward square, can’t quite get his fingers under a flat-bat pull. Even Maxwell comes to the party, with a pull for four and a top-edge over the keeper for four more. Eleven off the over: Australia need 37 off 30 balls. Their chances of a win are around 93 per cent.

14th over: Australia 125-2 (Marsh 60, Maxwell 1) New Zealand have to get rid of Marsh too. Williamson, perhaps fatally, turns back to Sodhi. Marsh lofts him for six, to reach an outstanding 50 off 31 balls – the fastest fifty in a T20 World Cup final. Some players are vulnerable just after waving their bat, but Marsh belts a two and a four, and persuades Sodhi to go wide of off – too wide. That’s a nine-ball over, costing 16, and it has put Australia back in control. They need 48 off six overs.

13th over: Australia 109-2 (Marsh 46, Maxwell 1) Here’s Glenn Maxwell. who’s not in form. He goes dot, dot, single, and the over goes for only three: well bowled Boult. Warner was undone by going for the big shot, a right old mow, when he didn’t really need to. Australia need 64 off seven overs, so the rate goes back above nine.

12th over: Australia 106-1 (Warner 53, Marsh 45) A third over for Santner. Marsh slogs him into the deep – and Phillips, who is an electric fielder, can only take it on the half-volley. A rare bad ball from Santner brings a full from Marsh that is just vicious. Nine off the over, which is par now. Australia need 67 from eight overs. They’ve helped themselves to 57 off the last five. Early finish, anyone?

11th over: Australia 97-1 (Warner 52, Marsh 38) “Now time for a Neesham miracle,” says Michelle Garland. And Kane Williamson agrees – but there’s just one problem, the Aussies. Just like Milne, Neesham gets hit for six first ball by Mitch Marsh – a comfortable pull, backward of square. Warner sees that six and raises it a chip for six more, to reach 50 off only 34 balls. This is all too easy. Australia are ahead of the rate for the first time: they need 76 off nine overs.

10th over: Australia 82-1 (Warner 45, Marsh 30) Williamson is sticking to his guns, when you might feel, to quote Woody from Toy Story, that this was the perfect time to panic. Santner again beats Marsh outside off with a ball so slow that if it hadn’t been on the spot, he could have run after it, caught it and tried again. At the halfway stage, Australia are well on top: 25 ahead of where NZ were at this stage. Speaking strictly from the neutral point of view, can we please have a collapse?

9th over: Australia 77-1 (Warner 42, Marsh 28) Sodhi continues, so Warner takes his helmet off and bats bare-headed. And hats off to him, as he flat-bats a four to long-on, then reverse-sweeps for two, pulls for four and straight-drives for six After a sedate start by his standards, he’s now going as fast as Marsh. The partnership has raced to 62 off 39 balls, and Australia are on fire.

8th over: Australia 60-1 (Warner 26, Marsh 27) Williamson goes for spin at both ends and brings on Mitchell Santner. Marsh says thank you very much and slog-sweeps for six – a clear case of Mitch’s inhumanity to Mitch. Santner strikes back, beating the bat with some actual turn. Marsh’s 27 have come off only 15 balls, which feels like a match-winning strike rate. Australia need 113 off 12 overs.

7th over: Australia 50-1 (Warner 24, Marsh 19) Time for spin, with Ish Sodhi’s leg-breaks. Warner works him around for ones and twos. In mid-over, the win predictor pops up: NZ 50 per cent, Australia 50 per cent. Personally, I make it 49-49 with a 2 per cent chance of a Super Over.

11.18 EST

6th over: Australia 43-1 (Warner 19, Marsh 18) After that shellacking from Marsh, Adam Milne fights back, mixing dots with leg byes and keeping Warner honest with a snorter of a bouncer. NZ win that over, but the Aussies win the battle of the powerplays, with 43-1 to NZ’s 32-1.

An interesting point from Khawar Ali. “As New Zealand are not as bad a fielding side as Pakistan were in the semi-final, NZ stand better chance to win this game.”

5th over: Australia 40-1 (Warner 18, Marsh 17) Warner, facing Southee, gets away with a bottom edge, into the pad and away for a single. Simon Doull makes a good point: against Marsh, the Kiwis will want to try some spin, but then they run the risk of Warner going postal. And Warner can play seam too – he spots Southee’s slower ball and swings it for six. Australia need 133 from 15 overs.

4th over: Australia 30-1 (Warner 10, Marsh 15) On comes Adam Milne, with a new batter to bowl at – and his first ball goes for six! Superb from Mitch Marsh, flicking off his toes into the stand. Next ball, he plays a delicate dab to steer a short one for four through the vacant slips. Then a pull for four more. Carnage! Milne recovers to an extent, with two dots to Warner. This innings has only been going for about 15 minutes, and already we’ve had some classic ebb and flow.

3rd over: Australia 15-1 (Warner 10, Marsh 0) Finch had just played a good shot, a straight thump for four, but that was the only one he middled. After taking the wicket, Boult keeps Warner quiet. Australia need 158 off 17 overs.

2nd over: Australia 11-0 (Warner 10, Finch 1) At the other end it’s Tim Southee, who’s gone for less than a run a ball throughout this World Cup. Warner’s first attempt to attack him falls flat as a cross-court forehand finds mid-on, but then there’s some width outside off and Warner goes over the offside ring for four. And again! Finch gets away with an inside edge, and that’s ten off the over.

1st over: Australia 1-0 (Warner 1, Finch 0) The new ball is in the hands of Trent Boult, the most successful seamer in this tournament. Can he find swing where Starc didn’t? He can. He goes dot, dot, nick as David Warner wafts at an outswinger, and then he screams for an LBW as Finch goes dancing down the track. It’s straight enough, but Finch was a long way down, so Williamson doesn’t review. Good over, though.

NZ finish on 172!

20th over: New Zealand 172-4 (Neesham 13, Seifert 8) Hazlewood is bowled out, so Finch has to bring back Starc. First ball, Seifert flicks a yorker for four (fine leg up). Starc stays full, goes wide of off, and manages a dot that must feel like a wicket. Seifert guides another wide yorker for a single. Neesham swings and misses, for once. Two dots! Starc is so amazed by his good fortune that he ends up on the ground, calling for new boots. A legside wide, which the batters run, perhaps unwisely. A straight yorker, flicked for a single by Seifert. The lastball is driven for two by Neesham. By Starc’s standards today, that’s not a bad over – ten off it. NZ rattled up 115 off the last ten overs. Kane Williamson has made a game of it, almost single-handed – and literally so for a couple of his big shots. Back in a few mins.
