Bigger and better will be the mantra for women's cricket as the T20 World Cup gets underway on Thursday.

The International Cricket Council is hopeful of another stellar outing for the globe's top female cricketers following the success of the 2023 edition in South Africa and the momentum provided by India's triumph in the men's tournament this summer.

Women's T20 World Cup

Group A:

Australia
India
New Zealand
Pakistan
Sri Lanka

Group B:

Bangladesh
England
Scotland
South Africa
West Indies

A major stumbling block was overcome after host Bangladesh suffered political turmoil and domestic instability just months before the tournament's start. 

The event was moved to the United Arab Emirates, with the 23 games to be played across Sharjah and Dubai. The final is on October 21, Australian time.

Bangladesh, which retains hosting rights, kicks off the 10-team tournament on Thursday against debutant Scotland in Sharjah. Pakistan will play Sri Lanka in the evening game at the same venue.

Defending champions and firm favourites Australia are in group A along with India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and New Zealand.

Group B comprises South Africa, England, West Indies, Bangladesh and Scotland.

Australia will be gunning for a fourth straight title. They fell short in 2016 when West Indies beat them in the final at Kolkata.

"T20 World Cups are really hard to win — it's the best against the best and whoever can be most consistent or win those little moments along the way can get the job done," Australia's Alyssa Healy said in her captain's column ahead of the World Cup.

"Conditions are a little unknown for us — only a few of our squad have played in the UAE before, while most of our players were involved with The Hundred prior."

Australia, which has twice won three in a row, will be wary of India's threat. Semifinalists in 2023, where they lost to Australia in Cape Town, the "Women in Blue" have improved thanks in large part to the Women's Premier League in India. It was set up to provide a platform for India's women cricketers to express themselves and gain in stature.

Led by Harmanpreet Kaur, 12 of this Indian side have played the tournament before. And three new stars in the making — Shreyanka Patil, Asha Sobhana and S Sajana — are eager for a first taste at the big stage.

"I can say this is the best team we are going for a T20 World Cup with," Kaur said in a press conference. 

"We have players who have been together for a long time. We know what the pressure is like and we know how to handle it."

Women's T20 World Cup

Group A

Saturday, October 5, 8pm AEST — Australia vs Sri Lanka
Wednesday, October 9, 1am AEDT — Australia vs New Zealand
Saturday, October 12, 1am AEDT — Australia vs Pakistan
Monday, October 14, 1am AEDT — Australia vs India

Daylight savings time begins on Sunday, October 6

India has never won a women's T20 World Cup. It came close in 2020, finishing runner-up to Australia, and lost in the semifinals in 2018 and 2023. 

For Kaur, this will be a 10th consecutive tournament since 2009 and she will be keen to replicate Rohit Sharma's triumph with the Indian men's side earlier in the summer.

India starts its campaign on Friday against New Zealand and then will face Pakistan on Sunday — both games in Dubai. The Indians play Australia on October 14.

Group A will open with a replay of the Asia Cup semifinal, where Sri Lanka beat Pakistan.

Meanwhile, England will be firm favourites to advance from Group B. It has been a bare run for the inaugural champions, and under Heather Knight again, the 2009 winners will be keen to get past the semifinals at a minimum.

"It can be an unpredictable tournament," Knight said. "It is important for us not to change how we play and approach it with a one-game-at-a-time mentality."

Can't get enough cricket from Grandstand?

Opening the campaign against Bangladesh, England will be wary of the conditions. The hosts have lined up five spinners in its squad, thus indicating what is potentially in store for the three-week tournament.

South Africa, the runner-up last time, is led this time led by Laura Wolvaardt and will open its campaign against West Indies.

"Reaching our first-ever World Cup final in 2023 was a big landmark moment for us. Now we would like to go that one step further and lift the trophy," Wolvaardt said.

The big question remains if anyone can stop Australia. There is further incentive to do just that — the ICC has confirmed prize money of $2.34 million, equal to the men's tournament and an increase of 134 per cent over what Australia received for winning in 2023.
