EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: SIMON COOK ON BEING APPOINTED AS DIRECTOR OF CRICKET

Tuesday 5th September 2023

Kent Cricket

After being announced as the Club’s new Director of Cricket from 1 October, we sat down with Simon Cook to discuss his time developing as a coach globally, the importance of his philosophies fitting into the Kent Cricket Talent Pathway, and more.

In a feature-length interview, Kent Members & supporters can get an insight into what they can expect from our incoming Director of Cricket:

International T20 cricket is back at The Spitfire Ground after 12 years next Summer!

International T20 cricket will return to Canterbury on Thursday 11 July 2024 when The Spitfire Ground, St Lawrence hosts the 3rd match in England’s IT20 series against New Zealand.

It is only the second time that Canterbury has hosted a Women’s International T20 match in its long history, and will be another boost for the continued growth of women’s cricket in Kent.
