COMMENTRY
Right then, that brings an end to the T20I series. The two captains Tim Southee and Moeen Ali pose for pictures with the shared trophy. Not much of a rest for both teams as they now face off in a four-match ODI series, the more relevant format with the ODI World Cup around the corner. The first ODI will be played on September 8 at the Sophia Gardens in Cardiff. The first ball will be bowled at 5.00 pm IST (11.30 am GMT) but our build-up will begin much sooner. See you then, cheers!
England's stand-in skipper Moeen Ali says that they were a few runs short and couldn't capitalise after the first 10. He appreciates the surface and says it was a good batting pitch. He mentions that the players are really good and it was an unfortunate loss. He backs his players and appreciates their contributions.
Tim Southee, the skipper of New Zealand, says that he is happy to bounce back and feels that they are back in good rhythm. He adds that the team played like themselves which helped them take those two wins. He credits the spinners for restricting the batters. He adds that he will travel and rest for the ODI series and mentions that a couple of new faces will be seen in the squad.
Jonny Bairstow is the Player of the Series. He says that he'll be fine and his shoulder feels a little stiff. He adds that he felt good getting back in touch and as it goes on he is expected to improve his timing and says that he is delighted to contribute in his way. He mentions that the powerplay is very crucial and they need to maintain the run rate and their strike rate in order to utilize it properly. He mentions that his ankle is fine and hopes it stays that way.
Mitchell Santner is the Player of the Match for his brilliant bowling performance. He credits his team for the win. He adds that they were happy when Jonny Bairstow got out. He mentions that they tried to utilise the powerplay and says that they are confident about the ODI series.
Time for the presentations...
Earlier in the game, stand-in skipper Moeen Ali won the toss and opted to put runs on the board. Jonny Bairstow got off the blocks quickly and got the hosts off to a flying start. He departed after scoring 73, which is when Dawid Malan began to take the innings forward. Just when he was starting to shift gears, he holed out in the deep, and it all went downhill for England from there. No English batter was able to score at the rate at which Bairstow did. They kept losing wickets at regular intervals and, in the end, had to settle for 175. For New Zealand, their spinners did the most damage, with Mitchell Santner being the pick of the bowlers with 3 wickets.
As far as England are concerned, they were outplayed in both departments by a resilient New Zealand side. On what was a flat wicket, they needed early wickets to have any chance of defending the total. Luke Wood did give them an early breakthrough, but the rest of the bowling unit were unable to capitalise on that early scalp. The pacers as well as spinners leaked a lot of runs in the Powerplay. They did sense an opening when Tim Seifert and Daryl Mitchell were dismissed in the space of two overs but they just were not able to squeeze in quiet overs.
There it is, New Zealand do it in a canter! An efficient run chase by the Kiwi batters helps them complete a comeback from a 2-0 deficit to end the four-match series on level terms. Having finished strongly with the ball, New Zealand certainly took that momentum into their batting effort. Finn Allen picked up where he left off in the last game and gave the chase an early impetus before departing. After his departure, Tim Seifert took matters into his own hands, and with his onslaught, he ensured that New Zealand had the required run rate in check. He fell two runs short of his fifty but had already laid a solid foundation for the innings. Then arrived Glenn Phillips who took the game by the scruff of the neck with his clean ball striking and had Mark Chapman for company. The duo took on the spinners with ease and by doing so, never allowed England a sniff. Towards the end, Rachin Ravindra provided the finishing touches to take his side over the line with more than 2 overs to spare.

FOUR! A misfield brings an end to the match. Moeen Ali bowls this full and on off. Rachin Ravindra hacks at it hard and towards cover. The fielder there fails to stop it and the batters take that single. The fielders don't chase after the ball and it runs away to the fence for a boundary. That is a win from New Zealand as they level the series after a dominating performance.
