New Zealand beat England at Trent Bridge to level the T20I series between the sides 2-2 before attentions to turn to the pre-World Cup ODIs.

The series was characterised by a succession of one-sided affairs, the first two won by the hosts before the visitors drew the series level.

Here’s how England’s 14 players fared across the series:

Jonny Bairstow: 8/10

175 runs @ 58.33; SR: 147.05

A profitable return to the top of the order for Bairstow in T20I cricket. He was the only England player to get going at all at Trent Bridge and was Player of the Match for his 86 not out in Manchester.

Will Jacks: 5/10

68 runs @ 17; SR: 147.82

One wicket @ 5; ER: 5

A stop-start series for Jacks who lacked a significant score but showed the sort of intent that generally impresses the England management. His off-spin was under utilised.

Dawid Malan: 3/10

80 runs @ 20.50; SR: 105.12

Malan continues to look out of rhythm. Should a player who doesn’t make his Hundred side command a place in England’s top three? On the evidence of this series, probably not. As CricViz pointed out during the series finale, these games followed a pattern that has become familiar over the past two and a half years.

Harry Brook: 8/10

122 runs @ 40.66; SR: 154.43

An admirable riposte to his World Cup omission, Brook was in sensational touch in Manchester in particular.

Jos Buttler: 7/10

53 runs @ 53; SR: 182.75

How permanent will his move down the order be? His record up top is outstanding, potentially the best ever in the format but he is capable of batting anywhere in the top six and his ‘demotion’ may allow other players to reach their full potential.

Liam Livingstone: 3/10

38 runs @ 19; SR: 126.66

Three wickets @ 32; ER: 10.66

A quiet series for Livingstone who is likely to be enlisted in a crucial role in the heart of the line-up for next month’s 50-over World Cup. Like Malan, he doesn’t look at his best with the bat.

Moeen Ali: 5/10

33 runs @ 11, SR: 157.14

One wicket @ 43; ER: 8.06

A similar series to Moeen’s T20 World Cup campaign. Rarely called upon with bat or ball but very much Buttler’s trusted right-hand man.

Rehan Ahmed: 7/10

11 runs @ 11; SR: 157.14

Two wickets @ 13.50; ER: 6.75

Made his home international debut in the series finale and did not look out of place bowling in tandem with Adil Rashid. The teenager was arguably the pick of the England bowlers on the night.

Adil Rashid: 5/10

Three wickets @ 40; ER: 8.57

Rashid’s own performances correlated closely with England’s success; excellent in the first two games, less so in the final two.

Sam Curran: 5/10

Five runs @ 5; SR: 125

One wicket @ 73; ER: 8.11

In a series without a close finish, Curran did not get the chance to show off his finishing skills in either discipline.

Gus Atkinson: 9/10

6 wickets @ 8.50; ER: 7.46

The Surrey speedster did not disappoint in his highly anticipated first outing in international cricket. He regularly hit the 92-mph region and was impressive at the death. He has the raw attributes to force his way into England’s first choice XI for the World Cup.

Luke Wood: 6/10

Five wickets @ 20.20; ER: 10.10

An odd series for Wood in that he was constant new-ball threat but was also England’s most expensive seamer.

Brydon Carse: 7/10

Four wickets @ 16.50; ER: 8.25

Carse, who has recently been added to England’s ODI squad for the upcoming New Zealand series, bowled with good pace and bounce. When he is on the money, he can be a real handful – it’s not impossible that he forces his way into the final XV for the World Cup.

Chris Jordan: 5/10

No wickets; ER: 8.75

Jordan’s sole outing came in defeat at Edgbaston.
