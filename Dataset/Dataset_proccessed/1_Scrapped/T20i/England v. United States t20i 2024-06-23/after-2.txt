23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: ENG 2/0 after 1 over

Time for the chase and remember, if England chase down this target in 18.4 overs or less, they are almost sure to qualify to the next round. Buttler and Salt in the middle.

23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: A special moment for Jordan

Chris Jordan has not just taken a hattrick on any venue. It's the ground where he watched most of his cricket growing up in Barbados.

Speaking to the broadcasters in the innings break, a beaming Jordan says, "Very nice to do this at a special place like this. I thought we worked out the conditions well. Rash came on and controlled one end, and the way Livi bowled set the game up for us. Points first and foremost, but if we get the opportunity to get out run rate up we'll have a look at that."

21:26 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Jordan nails hattrick, USA all out!

Chris Jordan to bowl the penultimate over. First ball, low full toss, and Corey Anderson has perfectly located Harry Brook at long on. And that feels like it for USA. 

Ali Khan on the strike. Jordan pivots to good length and seams one back in to clip the off stump. 

Nosthish Kenjige is then trapped LBW, and this is a one man clean-up in the penultimate over with one ball to go. Jordan on a hattrick, he's already claimed three in the over. 

Up he goes to claim a fourth, and he's got it! Cleaned up! A hattrick. Second of the day (IST at least) as USA are all out for 115. What pictures from Barbados. Four wickets for Jordan!

21:23 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Curran removes Harmeet

Sam Curran to bowl his second over. Harmeet Singh picks the slower ball. Carves it inside out to collect four runs.

It seems like he knew what Curran was going to do off the very next delivery. Stood still, deep in his crease, and trusted his strength to whack one over wide long on for SIX!

A full toss to close the over, Harmeet gets his bat on it but not as sweetly as he would've liked. Chris Jordan runs from long on to his right to take the catch. 115/6 after 18 overs.

21:17 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: 100 up for USA

Chris Jordan into his second over. Back to back slower, short deliveries to the two left-handers. The pull shots, on both occasions, run towards the man stationed at deep backward square leg for a couple of singles. 100 up for USA. It's been a slow drag since that first fifty, credit to Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone. 

First 50: 39 balls

Second 50: 60 balls

End of Jordan's second over, a mere four runs come off it. USA, 101/5 after 17 overs.

21:13 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Morgan spills the beans on Rashid's rise

Jofra Archer back into the attack. Harmeet Singh is the new man for USA.Width and length on offer and hthe southpaw cuts it in front of square for four.

Meanwhile, Nasser Hussain nudges Eoin Morgan, the England captain he claims to have changed Adil Rashid's career trajectory.

"He's always been a very prodigious young player. One of the things that captains have been is how they've managed spin bowlers. Managing pace bowlers has always been perceived as a mark of greatness. Adil early in his career took on a lot, and has been rewarded for it (with his variation skills). Certainly wasn't managed well," Morgan says on the comms. After 16 overs, USA are 97/5.

21:08 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rashid finishes his spell

He's gone under the radar off late but this has been a mighty impressive performance from Adil Rashid, who is now the joint-highest wicket taker for England in T20 World Cups (30 wickets). 

His final over costs a mere three runs - off which one came off a wide. USA are 91/5 after 15 overs.

23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Livingstone strikes!

Liam Livingstone to bowl his fourth over. And Corey Anderson takes the risk off a flighted delivery to break the boundary drought. A reverse-sweep over deep backward point for SIX!

Off the last ball, Milind Kumar opens his front foot in the attempt of dispatching oner over mid wicket but instead splices it up and Jos Buttler tracks back to take the catch. Livingstone gets a wicket. USA are 88/5 after 14 overs.

20:58 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Jordan's valuable spell begins

Chris Jordan into the attack. England have brought him back instead of Mark Wood, who's been struggling at this World Cup, really. Jordan's contributions with the ball in the latter half of the innings are all too valuable for England, who need a big win today to strengthen their claim for a semifinal spot. Six runs from the over. 79/4 after 13 overs.

20:55 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: ENG nullify USA's advantage

The boundaries have dried up for USA. Corey Anderson's shot down the ground is cut just in time by Sam Curran. Last boundary came 26 deliveries ago. Livingstone has run through his three overs in tandem with Rashid and just like that, England have nullified the fine start - despite the wickets - that USA had managed in the powerplay overs. 73/4 after 12 overs.

20:52 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rashid removes Nitish!

Adil Rashid into his third over, and he's struck again!

Another googly, and this time Nitish Kumar can't read it and is cleaned up. Was tossed up and lack of footwork is got the better of the USA number three. Another over without a boundary for USA, only four runs off it. 69/4 after 11 overs.

20:49 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Halfway stage

Corey Anderson is the new batter in for USA, and this is much more like it. No boundaries in Livingstone's second over but the USA duo negotiate six singles. At the halfway stage, the scorecard reads 65/3.

20:40 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Jones cleaned up!

Rashid continues from the other end. Serves a googly on the middle stump. Jones made room outside the leg to play it but it came back in quickly and the leg stump's gone for a toss. He was looking scrappy and has departed early. Another economical over for England with only four runs conceded. 59/3 after nine overs.

20:36 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: ENG's middle overs trap

Liam Livingstone to roll his arms from the other end. England run quickly through this phase (7-13) with their spinners. It's what the helps them against the opposition looking to go big in the death overs as the run rate dips extremely low. USA would do themselves a huge favor if they can get past the 100-run mark before the final seven. 55/2 after eight overs.

20:34 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Fifty up!

Adil Rashid comes just as the field restrictions are lifted. USA will do well to remember against this England lineup, every single counts. Strike rotation - as it was in the Afghanistan-Australia game - will be key. In this over, Nitish Kumar and Aaron Jones haven't been able to do so. Only two runs come off it. Fifty up for USA. 50/2 after eight overs.

20:26 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Taylor falls!

Fortune favoring the bold. Sam Curran into the attack for the first time. Offers width to Steven Taylor outside the off stump with a wide slip in place. It takes the edge but runs in between the keeper and the slip for four. 

Next up, Curran drags back the length and bowls a back of the hand slower one. Taylor goes for a slap on the off side, and Moeen Ali takes a fine diving catch to his left at backward point. Second wicket for England in the powerplay. 

Aaron Jones is the new man in. Curran goes wide with the angle to the newly-in right-hander, who opens the face of his bat to splice one down third man for four more. End of the powerplay: USA are 48/2.

20:23 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Nitish targets Topley

His first boundary had an element of luck attached to it but his second is as clean as they come. Topley dishes a fullish one, on the pads, picked by coming down the track and slotting over mid on for four!

Next ball, Topley pitches it further down the leg, and this time, Nitish has connected it even well. A clean striker over wide long on for SIX! After five overs, USA are 39/1.

20:19 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Archer's short one goes for SIX!

Archer on the back of a fine first over. "It's a measure of his pace," says Michael Atherton as the pacer bangs one in short and Nitish Kumar goes for a pull but ends up top edging it. No worries, such is the pace on it, and the boundary ain't long as well, it goes all the way for SIX!

USA are 26/1 after four overs.

20:14 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Taylor opens his boundary count

Topley continues from the other end. Gous - USA's leading run getter at the tournament - seemed to have taken the early steam out of the USA batter. Topley's incoming delivery to Taylor, just lined up on the off stump, is lofted over wide mid off for four. First boundary of the day for him. After three overs, USA are 18/1.

20:11 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Archer in

Archer steams in from the other end. First ball is pitched outside leg and doesn't seem to have to come into the left-handed Steven Taylor as it clips it on his pads.

Just a tad reminder, Archer's childhood best friend Aaron Jones is captaining USA today, and is very much 'looking forward to facing' him. For now, Nitish Kumar accompanies Taylor in the middle.

Only two runs from the over. USA, 11/0 after two overs.

20:05 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Topley strikes in first over

The left-armer able to find early movement. Deceives Andries Gous on the outside edge, with one that goes away with the angle. Then, pretty much on expected grounds, brings one back in. Gous plays it along the angle and flicks it behind square on the on side for SIX! A fine shot. 

Next ball, Topley clips one on the pads but the impact seems to be outside leg. Gous goes for another audacious stroke off one lined up just outside leg, more uppish this time, but finds the fielder at backwards square. First over ends up with first wicket for England. 

20:01 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: All in readiness

A vibrant atmosphere in Bridgetown, Barbados as the two sets of national anthems are sung. Decent turnout for a game that has big ramifications on who makes it to the semifinals, and who faces whom. 

Reece Topley has marked his run up for the first over. Steven Taylor takes the strike, and we're up and running.

19:51 (IST)
23 JUN 2024
England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: ENG's mixed record at Barbados

England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Captains on the mic

Jos Buttler: We will bowl first. An early morning start, it will be tacky to start, that's the reason to bowl. Everyone's good and getting ready, has been a quick turnaround. We got a tough game, USA have played some tough cricket. We know what we have to do. I think the boys have bowled well, hopefully today's the day. Jordan comes in for Wood.

Aaron Jones: Wanted to bowl first as well. We are going to go hard, it's a good wicket. We are going to play fearless cricket like always, let's see how it goes. We need to be more disciplined in batting and bowling. Going to come back stronger today (after that loss against West Indies.) Same team as the last game.

So as of now it's all sunshine in Bridgetown, Barbados. But the forecast for the rest of the day doesn't look as promising.

As vital as he is to Oracle, where he handles databases of companies and even holds a patent for a search innovation, Netravalkar is indispensable to Team USA as it co-hosts its first major international cricket tournament. (Devendra Pandey tracks his story, READ HERE)

England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Marsh sets up IND vs AUS

A loss against Afghanistan on Sunday meant Australia’s chances at making it to the T20 World Cup semifinals hang by a thread. Sitting in Group 1, the 2021 winners are currently second but have as many points after two matches as Afghanistan.

It's what led to skipper Mitchell Marsh simplifying the task for his troops ahead of their last Super-8 game, against India. 

“We just need to win,” Marsh said after the loss to Afghanistan, before adding, “there’s no better team to do it against.” (MORE HERE)

England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: What went by in Kingstown?

The Afghans have slayed their demons, defeating Australia at the World Cup. And boy, do we have the offerings to take you through the historic result: 

-Lalith Kalidas with the match report: Openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran build the foundation with a century partnership and Gulbadin Naib (4/20) gives Pat Cummins a taste of his own medicine, as Afghanistan score a famous win over Australia. Afghanistan played to their strengths to defeat Australia.

-Sriram Veera with the analysis from Australia's POV: Warner, Agar drop catches; Gurbaz stares down Stoinis and Gulbadin takes out Cummins. 

-REPLUG from Pratyush Raj on the magical story of Afghan cricket: With wins over England, Pakistan, Sri Lanka (at 2023 ODI World Cup), New Zealand, and Australia (at 2024 T20 World Cup), don't mistake Afghanistan cricket's rise as meteoric. It is methodical.

-REPLUG from Rahul Pandey on Rahmanullah Gurbaz: At a World Cup where the batters have found it hard to get going, Gurbaz - leading the scoring charts - is one of the few who have got going. Behind his success has been an ailing mother’s wish, love affair with India, and dileri.

England vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Hello and welcome!

What a game that was in Kingstown! Afghanistan with their first-ever win against Australia in cricket. A result that's opened up Group 1 nicely for the two semifinal spots.

Now we turn our attention to Group 2 as England play United States in what will be the first meeting between these two nations across formats. The stakes? Both can still qualify for the semifinals but USA need a big win, and also rely upon South Africa to have a chance at it. England, who have a win in the Super-8 under their belt, obviously hold the advantage going into the match but then again, after all we've seen at this World Cup: can we rule USA out as of now?

Hopefully, another memorable game in the brewing for the neutrals. Stay with us as we take you through the action at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados.

T20 World Cup: How West Indies’ world-class spin trio set up big win against USA

West Indies’ three-pronged spin attack is not like your usual T20 trifecta.

Typically, when that many spinners feature in the XI, chances are one of them would be a wristie. But in Akeal Hosein, Gudakesh Motie and Roston Chase, the Windies have a trio that complement each other. They even prompted Indian ace Ashwin Ravichandran to tweet recently, “This West Indian three finger spinner attack showing how a good pack should hunt, top class.”

On Saturday in Barbados, the spinners broke the USA batting effort (even though the scoreboard would tell you pacers accounted for five wickets) to set up the match for the hosts. Shai Hope then smashed it out of the park at his home ground, as WI chased down 129 with 9.1 overs to spare. West Indies would have been out of the tournament had they lost but a rocking Kensington Oval witnessed a clinical win that gave WI a significant Net Run Rate boost and kept destiny in their own hands.
