USA vs ENG Scorecard
USA vs England Commentary
5:24 PM IST Right then, that's all from this lop-sided affair. With this outcome, England have sealed a berth in the semis and now, all eyes turn to Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua where West Indies and South Africa will lock horns. The victor of that clash will join England from Group 2 in the semifinals. The game will start at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT), but our build-up will begin much sooner. See you then. Cheers!
5:18 PM IST Jos Buttler, the victorious captain of England says that they played the USA with a lot of respect. He adds they talked about playing with a lot of intent. Further adds that the spinners Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone bowled really well in tandem and further compounded the pressure created in the powerplay. Also says it is not easy for the batters when these guys are bowling. Mentions that they have got good options with the ball and he felt to bring Chris Jordan to add some batting depth as well. Appreciates him and says that Jordan executed brilliantly with the ball and getting a World Cup hat-trick is always a moment to cherish. On his batting form, he says you don't always get the results but he feels good and confident. Also adds that now he is hitting the ball with intent. Concludes by saying he needed to look at his own game and is happy to contribute.
5:15 PM IST The captain of the USA, Aaron Jones says that it was a hard game and feels that they weren't as disciplined as they should have been. Tells that they didn't have a good last few games but looking forward to learning from it and delivering in the future. Shares that they enjoyed playing in this tournament. Reckons that their shot selection against Adil Rashid wasn't the best and should have batted smartly against him.
5:10 PM IST Adil Rashid is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his exceptional bowling figures. He begins by saying that he is delighted with the team's performance. Says all the bowlers did their job to restrict the USA at 115. Adds that you have to assess which end you want to bowl especially when the wind is a factor. Also tells that it was one of those days when the googly came out well and he is happy with the way he bowled. Appreciates Chris Jordan and says that he has been a match-winner and has been doing the job for a number of years now. Also congratulates Chris Jordan and says that coming back and scoring a hat-trick is highly impressive. Also says that Jos Buttler is a world-class player. Ends up saying that he is hopeful to carry down the momentum into the semifinals.
5:10 PM IST Time for the presentation ceremony...
5:10 PM IST Earlier in the game, after being asked to bat first, the USA were dealt an early blow in the form of Andries Gous. Coming in at number 3, Nitish Kumar did not shy away from playing his shots and made the Powerplay count for the USA. Once the field restrictions were lifted, the boundaries became hard to come by for the USA and it got even tougher as Jos Buttler introduced spin from both ends. Just as Corey Anderson and Harmeet Singh were beginning to rebuild, Harmeet fell and it all went downhill from there. The USA lost their last 5 wickets in just 6 balls without adding a run to be eventually bowled out for 115. For England, with four wickets in a single over, including a hat-trick, Chris Jordan cleaned up the USA tail, becoming the second bowler at this World Cup to take a hat-trick.
