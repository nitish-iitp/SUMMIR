News
12 March 2021

From 13-14 March 2021, all SuperSport channels will be open to DStv Compact Plus, Compact, Family, Access and EasyView packages via the DStv App.

▶

Everybody’s talking, tweeting and TikToking about DStv’s hottest sporting events, especially the upcoming soccer showdowns between Arsenal and Tottenham and the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals.

It’s also a big one for rugby with England and France exploring their centuries-old rivalry in a Six Nations match at Twickenham, and the Crusaders taking on the Chiefs in the big Super Rugby Aotearoa game. And cricket fans will be setting out the tea for the India vs England second T20. Plus there’s so much more to see, including the Golden Gloves SA Super Middleweight title fight between Rowan Campbell and Ryno Liebenberg.

Don’t get left out in the cold because, on the weekend of 13-14 March, DStv is opening the doors to welcome all our customers to see the very best of sports TV on offer in South Africa, live on the DStv App…

If you’re a DStv customer on any package, all you need to do is to download the DStv App on your smart device and you will be able to see every SuperSport channel on Saturday, 13 March, and Sunday, 14 March.

This means that if you’re currently subscribed to DStv Compact Plus, Compact, Family, Access or EasyView, you can watch all the SuperSport channels on DStv using the DStv App!

Feel every moment anytime, anywhere with the DStv App

The DStv Open Window on Saturday, 13 March, and Sunday, 14 March, is viewable with the DStv App and not via your decoder.

The Open Window is for streaming channels only – you won’t see any additional titles on Catch Up, but you will see your regular Catch Up content. If you choose to upgrade, you will get loads more Catch Up with your new package.

With the DStv App, you can stream DStv content on a computer, laptop, smartphone, tablet, smart TV or gaming console. After the Open Window, you will still be able to access all the DStv channels available on your existing DStv package, via the app.
