KKR vs RR (Kolkata Knight Riders vs Rajasthan Royals), 31st T20 Match Preview

KKR might not change the team for the next match. Last time, they didn’t include Rinku Singh because they wanted to bowl first. They might do the same if they bowl first again. But if KKR is batting first this time, Rinku Singh will get to play.

In the last game, Rajasthan Royals didn’t include R Ashwin and Yashasvi Jaiswal because they were injured. But Samson said at the start of the game that their injuries weren’t serious, so we think they’ll be back in the team for the next game.

“We predict that Rajasthan Royals will beat Kolkata Knight Riders.”

Pitch Report for KKR vs RR of Eden Gardens, Kolkata

Venue: Eden Gardens, Kolkata

Surface Nature – Batting Surface

The cricket field at Eden Gardens is good for batters. It allows them to hit the ball hard and score runs easily because it’s bouncy and fast. But as the tournament goes on, the field will slow down. This means spin bowlers will become more important. They can make the ball spin and trick the batters. Already, some balls are starting to spin unpredictably, so batters have to be careful when facing spin bowlers.
