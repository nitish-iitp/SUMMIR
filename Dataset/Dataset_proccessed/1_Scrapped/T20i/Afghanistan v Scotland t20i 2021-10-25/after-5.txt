Spinners Mujeeb Ur Rahman and Rashid Khan combined for nine wickets as Afghanistan crushed Scotland by 130 runs in Group Two action of the ICC Men’s World T20 on Monday in Sharjah.

Set a stiff target of 191, Scotland were never in the game after losing their first wicket with 28 on the board in the fourth over.

They folded meekly thereafter, being dismissed for 60 in 10.2 overs. Off-spinner Mujeeb wrecked the top-order, returning immaculate figures of 5-20 off four overs.

Leg-spinner Rashid then did the polishing job, clearing off the lower-order with 4-9 off 2.2 overs. Opener George Munsey topscored with 25 off 18.

Earlier, Afghanistan batsmen were dominant throughout the innings, led by a shot-filled 59 off 34 from Najibullah Zadran, who struck five fours and three sixes.

Rahmanullah Gurbaz (46 off 37) and Hazratullah Zazai (44 off 30) were also among the runs as Safyaan Sharif picked up 2-33.
