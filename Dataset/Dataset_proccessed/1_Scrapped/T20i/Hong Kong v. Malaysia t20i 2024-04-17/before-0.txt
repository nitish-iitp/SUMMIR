Pressure Is To Continue To Play Way I'm Playing: T20 World Cup Glory In Travis' Head Now

BY PTI

Placed in Group A, Malaysia and Hong Kong have both won just one game out of three and have two points each. However Malaysia's (-0.040) net run rate is far better that of Hong Kong (-1.474). Owing to their superior net run rate, a win will be enough for Malaysia to jump ahead of Qatar and Saudi Arabia and get to the second spot in group A and book the ticket for the semi finals.

However, in the unlikely event of Saudi Arabia managing to topple Nepal in the other Group A match that will take place simultaneously, Malaysia's hopes will be trashed.

In their first match, Malaysia fought hard but went down against a strong Nepal in last over losing the match by 5 wickets. In their next outing, Malaysia defeated Saudi Arabia by 12 runs. However, another close defeat awaited against Qatar in their last match.

Skipper Virandeep Singh has been Malaysia's hero. The left-arm spin bowling all-rounder is the joint-highest wicket-taker in the tournament with 8 wickets and also played a crucial 72 not out in Malaysia's loss against Nepal.

After winning their opening game against Qatar, Hong Kong's form has dipped. They have been handed two heavy defeats, first from Saudi Arabia by 55 runs and then from Nepal by 8 wickets and 38 balls remaining.

The big losses have damaged their net run rate meaning that even a win would not help them get to the second point spot in the table.

However, they can spoil the party of Malaysia and help Qatar get to the knockouts if they win.
