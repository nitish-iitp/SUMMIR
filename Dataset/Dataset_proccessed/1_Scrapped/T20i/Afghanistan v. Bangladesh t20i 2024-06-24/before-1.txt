The 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup is being played in the US and West Indies. The tournament is in its 9th edition, and India is hoping to win it a second time. Although cricket will be at the centre of all the action, there are many more things to do, including visiting several attractions, at the T20 World Cup 2024 host cities.

The biennial Twenty20 International (T20I) tournament is being co-hosted by the West Indies and the United States. The tournament began on June 1 and will conclude on June 29. The excitement is palpable as it is the first major tournament that not only had matches played in the United States but was also the first held in any other country in the Americas outside the West Indies.

Of course, besides some American cities, there are several top Caribbean destinations to explore while the tournament is on.

Established: 1882; capacity: 28,000

India will play Afghanistan on June 20, marking the first match in the Super 8 group stage of the tournament. The stadium will also host two more matches between teams in Group 2 of the Super 8 stage. If all goes well for the team, Rohit Sharma’s boys will be playing in the tournament finals on June 29, at Kensington Oval.

Places to see around Kensington Oval: A walk on pristine beaches, sailing on the calm waters of Carlisle Bay, surfing at Soup Bowl, or a catamaran cruise to shipwrecks, there is something for everyone in Barbados — without a doubt one of the T20 World Cup 2024 host cities boasting great attractions. A tour of the Barbados Boardwalk, lined with shops and street vendors, is the best for a taste of Bajan life.

The capital city of Bridgetown has several historical buildings, including the Nidhe Israel Synagogue — the oldest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. Outside of Bridgetown are adventure spots, such as Andromeda Botanic Gardens and Harrison’s Cave, the latter of which is a crystallised limestone cavern with tram tours and picturesque waterfalls.

How to reach: Grantley Adams International Airport is 19 km from Kensington Oval.

Established: 2007; capacity: 20,000

India will play at this stadium on June 22. Australia, too, has a match in the same group as India on June 20. South Africa and West Indies from another group will also be playing here.

Places to see around Sir Vivian Richards Stadium: As a Caribbean island nation, Antigua has much to offer, including luxury yacht trips on the open sea. Of course, diving or snorkelling trips in the blue waters off the coast are the most famous adventure things tourists do here. The famous Dickenson Bay, with its calm waters and luxurious resorts, is about 13 km to the west of the stadium. Almost a similar distance away to the east is the secluded Long Bay — perfect for those who love to stay away from the crowds. A roughly 17-km road trip towards the south of the stadium will take cricket lovers to Shirley Heights, a fort known as a historic lookout for mesmerising panoramic views of the Caribbean Sea. It is part of Nelson’s Dockyard National Park and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Nearby Shirley Heights is Nelson’s Dockyard, named after the legendary Admiral Horatio Nelson who lived here from 1784 through 1787. The restored 18th-century British naval base retells the rich maritime past of Antigua.

How to reach: V.C. Bird International Airport is 8.5 km away.

Established: 2002; capacity: 15,000

India will play Australia in their Super 8 encounter on June 24, at the Darren Sammy Cricket Ground. West Indies and South Africa are the two additional teams from Group 2 in Super 8 that will play here.

Places to see around Daren Sammy Cricket Ground: Gros Islet is to the north of the island of Saint Lucia. At 617 sq km, the island nation is three times the size of Antigua. This means that visitors may have to travel some distance and spend a few days exploring the entirety of the island. The best thing to do in Gros Islet is to take part in the Friday night street party, where visitors are enchanted by lively music as they watch the sunset over the horizon. Nearby attractions include the ruins of Fort Rodney, stunning hiking trails of Pigeon Island National Park, panoramic views of the Rodney Bay Marina, and Splash Island Water Park.

Across the island, which can be easily navigated by road and sailboats, there are numerous exploration options, including the volcanic peaks of the majestic Pitons, offering hiking trails that end with breathtaking views. Those looking for rejuvenation can experience the therapeutic mud baths and natural sulphur springs in Soufriere.

How to reach: Hewanorra International Airport is 65 km away.

Established: 2008; capacity: 15,000

If India wins Group 1 in Super 8, the Men in Blue will play at the Brian Lara Cricket Academy in the first match of the semi-finals. The stadium hosts only one knockout stage match.

Places to see around Brian Lara Cricket Academy: With some of the best attractions among the T20 World Cup 2024 host cities, San Fernando is known for offering an eclectic mix of urban delights and natural wonders. It is located on the southwestern coast of Trinidad. Nearby is the San Fernando Hill, from the top of which visitors can see panoramic city views. Just 30 km to the south, along the coast, is the natural wonder of Pitch Lake, the world’s largest natural asphalt deposit. Further down to the south is Icacos Point, a scenic wetland with calm waters and coconut palms that guard the coast like sentinels.

Move 52 km north to the capital city of Port of Spain, where you can delve deeper into the history of Trinidad and Tobago at the National Museum and Art Gallery, explore the architectural marvel of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Perpetual Help and visit the Caroni Bird Sanctuary.

How to reach: Piarco International Airport is 50 km away.
