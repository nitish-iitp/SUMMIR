Match Preview:

The T20 World Cup 2024 Super 8s will be privy to a big-ticket clash as Australia take on India in a thrilling contest. Ahead of this match, Afghanistan registered their first win over Australia. On the other hand, Team India took down Bangladesh in a dominant 50-run win.

Toss Prediction





Over the T20 World Cup 2024, Australia have a better toss-winning percentage than India. Hence the Aussies are the favourites to win the toss this time.


Win Possibility





The Rohit Sharma-led India are favourites to win this game and seal qualification for the semi-final stage of the T20 World Cup 2024. Australia, despite suffering a massive defeat, will be a formidable opponent. But an in-form Indian team with nearly all bases covered could take down the Aussies and even knock them out of the tournament if Afghanistan beat Bangladesh.

Predicted powerplay score and first innings score





The pitches at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in Gros Islet, St Lucia, have been quite good for batting in the T20 World Cup 2024, which has led to a few big totals getting made here.
