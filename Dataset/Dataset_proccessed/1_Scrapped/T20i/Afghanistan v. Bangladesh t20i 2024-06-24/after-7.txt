Australia has been knocked out of the Twenty20 World Cup after Afghanistan progressed to the semifinals for the first time with a dramatic, rain-hit win over Bangladesh.

Afghanistan only needed to win to advance to the semis, but Bangladesh needed to win with an enormous boost to its net run rate to surpass Australia.

After restricting Afghanistan to 5-115, Bangladesh needed to chase down 116 in 12.1 overs to qualify for the semifinals but the middle order was torn apart by leg-spinner Rashid Khan, who took 4-23 from his four overs.

The target was reduced to 114 by rain and Bangladesh opener Litton Das looked set to carry his team to its first World Cup semi but he was left stranded on 54 off 49 as the last two wickets fell in the penultimate over.

Seamer Naveen-ul-Haq was named player of the match after he finished the job under intense pressure, taking the wickets of Taskin Ahmed and Mustafizur Rahman with the last two balls of the game to finish with 4-26 and send his country into the final four of a World Cup for the first time.

"We have worked so hard over the past few years," Naveen said.

"We were dreaming and working for this day. When [that day comes] it's a surreal experience. I'm lost for words."

Afghanistan leapfrogged Australia for second place in Group 1 of the Super Eights, with unbeaten India topping the group.

India will play a blockbuster semifinal against England in Guyana, while Afghanistan will take on South Africa in Trinidad and Tobago for a spot in the final.

"It's something like a dream for us as a team," captain Rashid said.

"It's unbelievable. I don't have any words to describe my feelings.

"I'm sure it's going to be a massive celebration back home. The country will be very proud."

Rain, fake injuries and quick maths in thrilling run chase

Afghanistan won the toss and chose to bat at Arnos Vale in Kingstown, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran laid the platform with a composed opening stand but were restricted to just 36 from the first seven overs by stingy Bangladeshi bowling.

Things tightened even further after the powerplay as Afghanistan failed to hit a single boundary from the eighth through the 13th overs, and lost Ibrahim to a sliced drive that landed in the hands of Tanzim in the 11th.

Gurbaz finally accelerated as Afghanistan took 13 off Rishad Hossain in the 14th over but it proved to be little more than a blip as Bangladesh took 4-9 in just 12 balls.

That brought captain Rashid Khan to the crease and he quickly went to work, smashing his second ball for six, but he and Karim Janat could only score one run off Mustafizur Rahman in the penultimate over.

The wild day that ended Australia's World Cup

Rashid blasted two more sixes as rain started falling heavily in the final over, including launching a ball onto the roof to end the innings, to take Afghanistan to its total of 116.

After a brief rain delay, Bangladesh went about chasing and things could not have started much worse for Afghanistan's defence as the first over went for 13 runs and wicketkeeper Gurbaz had to be subbed out after copping a mullygrubber to the knee.

But Fazalhaq Farooqi and Naveen-ul-Haq halted the Tigers as they took 3-7 in nine balls, including Najmul Hossan Shanto and Shakib al-Hasan in successive balls for Naveen, before the rain returned to force the players off the field once more.

Bangladesh was still in a healthy position at 3-46 after six overs, when Rashid brought himself into the attack and changed the complexion of the game with four wickets in his first three overs as Bangladesh finished the 11th over 7-80.

Afghanistan also overtook Bangladesh in the Duckworth-Lewis tally just before another rain delay in the 12th over, leading to farcical scenes.

As the rain started to fall, coach Jonathan Trott signalled to the team to slow down from the sidelines, after which Gulbadin Naib collapsed, clearly faking hamstring injury at first slip.

Rashid looked very displeased with the cynical effort and Gulbadin was helped off the field as the covers came on.

"That is unacceptable. That's not a good look," former New Zealand Test player Simon Doull said in commentary.

Former Australia captain Lisa Sthalekar agreed: "I know it's always a grey area with the spirit of the game, but it does not look good, those pictures do not add up."

Meanwhile, Australia leg-spinner Adam Zampa made light of the incident, posting video of the moment to his Instagram stories with the sarcastic caption: "the old rainstring."

Seamer Gulbadin returned to the field soon after the rain break, which cost one over and reduced the target to 114, and returned to the attack almost immediately once he was back on the field, getting the crucial wicket of Tanzim with his second ball.

With a maiden semifinal out of reach, Das continued to try to push Bangladesh to victory for pride and had the team in front of the Duckworth-Lewis-projected total with nine runs needed off the last nine balls, but that changed when Taskin chopped on from Naveen and the teams were briefly forced off the field again.

Naveen trapped Mustafizur plumb LBW as soon as play resumed and Afghanistan's emotional celebrations were already in full swing as Bangladesh's desperate review failed.
