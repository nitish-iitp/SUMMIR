Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Highlights, T20 World Cup 2024 Match Today: Afghanistan defeated Bangladesh by 8 runs in a rain truncated match which saw the Afghan team reach their first semifinal in history. The loss for Bangladesh also meant that 2021 champions Australia were knocked out.

Riding on their captain Rashid Khan’s fantastic cameo, Afghanistan have managed to post 115/5 at the end of their 20 overs against Bangladesh in their last Super Eight match at the St Vincent on Tuesday. Rashid scored a brisk 10-ball 19, including three sixes to help his team reach a respectable total.

Opting to bat first, Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran got Afghanistan off to a steady start. They played cautiously as those weren’t easy conditions to bat. The Bangladesh bowlers bowled tight lines and lengths and barring those three sixes at the fag end from Rashid, the Bangladesh batters never got going.

Scenarios

If there won’t be any cricket due to rain, Afghanistan will qualify for the semifinals. Bangladesh will have to chase down the total in 12.1 overs in order to surpass Australia and Afghanistan in terms of net run rate and head into the semifinals.

Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rashid Khan

It's something like a dream for us as a team being in the semifinal. It's all about the way we have started the tournament. The belief came while we beat NZ. I don't have any words to describe the feeling. The only guy who put us in the semifinal was Brian Lara and we proved it right. I told him we won't let you down. We thought 130-135 was a good total on this wicket. We were 15-20 runs short. It was all about mindset. We knew they would come hard at us to chase that in 12 overs. That's where we could take advantage, We just had to be clear with our plans. We put in the effort, that's in our hands. Everyone did a wonderful job. In T20s, we have a strong base, especially in bowling. The quality of fast bowling we have, they are skilful. They have great starts in this competition and it makes our job easier in the middle. Rain was on and off, but mentally we were there. We had to take 10 wickets, that's the only way to get to the semifinal, there's no other way. Gulbadin had some cramps I think, hopefully he'll be alright. That wicket he took was massive for us. It's a massive celebration back home. The country will be very proud back home. Being in the semis is big now, we have to go with a clear mind. We'll have to keep things simple and make sure we enjoy the big occasion.

Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Najmul Hossain Shanto

I think we bowled really well, we did lots of good things but as a batting unit, we made poor decision especially in the middle overs and that's what cost us today. The plan was to go hard in the first six overs, if we lost early wickets, the plan was to bat normally, but that didn't happen and the middle-order couldn't execute. The whole tournament we have bowled really well, both the pacers and the spinners, especially Rishad was great, the fast bowlers also did really well. Also, as a fielding group, we did well. The batting needs to improve, the top-order didn't perform well. It can happen, the ball got wet and that's a good thing. As I said, we didn't execute well with the bat and made a lot of wrong decisions.

Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Naveen-ul-Haq, POTM

"We have worked so hard over the past few years and we were dreaming and working for this day. I'm lost for words. We always knew that they were going hard in the powerplay to chase the total down in 12.1 overs so we knew we were in the game as long as we kept picking wickets. We had confidence that these wickets are not high-scoring wickets. As long as we don't give easy runs we knew we would have a chance."

Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Jubilant Afghanistan

Tears and smiles in tandem in the Afghan camp. A stellar journey that started in 2001 as an Associate Member nation has peaked with a maiden World Cup semifinal berth 23 years later. From minnows to underdogs and favourites with their pedigree, Afghanistan have shown that they are as good as any T20I side in the world. Watch out, South Africa!

Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: What a finish

The semifinals are locked in:

SF1: South Africa vs Afghanistan

SF2: India vs England

What an effort this has been from Afghanistan, once again led by their skipper Rashid Khan. He broke the back of the Bangladesh middle-order with four wickets and the other bowlers rallied around to maintain the pressure. Even monumental is that they have taken down the mighty Australia out of the tournament on their way to a maiden semifinal.

Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Afghanistan KO Australia to reach semifinals!

12 to win in 12 balls for Bangladesh.

Naveen-ul-Haq returns. Litton makes room to cut and taps the slower-cutter to point for a single. Width from Naveen and Taskin nearly steers it past Farooqi at third for FOUR but a stellar dive denies a boundary. It's raining again and Bangladesh have just nosed ahead on DLS. Naveen to Litton, DROPPED! Fuller delivery and Litton chips it straight back and Naveen puts down a regulation chance. Naveen to Taskin, OUT! BOWLED HIM! The cutter prevails once again. Cross-seamer keeps low from length and Taskin gets an inside-edge back onto the stumps. Afghanistan pop back ahead on DLS as the players leave briefly due to rain.





Mustafizur Rahman is the last man in. There is still some work going on with the stumps as the players continue to wait.

9 needed off 8. Naveen to continue. Naveen to Mustafizur, OUT! IT'S ALL OVER! Afghanistan knock Australia out to qualify for their maiden T20 World Cup semifinal!

Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: BAN 102/8 in 17 overs (Target: 114 in 19)

Gulbadin raps one onto Taskin's pad and the batters reel in the single. Litton taps the ball down to long-on for another single. 100 up for Bangladesh, just 14 away from crashing the Afghan dream. Naib slides another one in and Taskin flicks it to deep mid-wicket for a single. Slower-bumper, Litton whacks it to deep mid-wicket for a single. Dot ball as Naib cramps up Taskin as he taps the ball to short cover. A dot to finish as Naib rushes a short delivery past Taskin's blade.

10:18 (IST)
25 JUN 2024
Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: BAN 98/8 in 16 overs (Target: 114 in 19)

Close! Noor nearly traps Litton in front with a loopy delivery that straightens from length. In the slot and Litton sweeps it through mid-wicket for FOUR and brings up his half-century in 41 balls. He continues to be the thorn in the Afghan dream. Noor takes the ball wide outside the off-stump, keeping it away from the arc. Straighter delivery and Litton blocks it out. Two deliveries remaining in the over. Nerves must be jangling in the Afghan camp. Litton shuffles across but Noor wafts it in for another dot ball. Huge shout from Noor as he scuttles the ball in past Litton's defences onto the bat. Afghanistan review. Umpire's call on impact and wickets, Litton survives!

25 JUN 2024
Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: BAN 94/8 in 15 overs (Target: 114 in 19)

Kid you not, Gulbadin Naib is into the attack now. 

Litton chips the first ball past the bowler for a single. Naib to Tanzim, OUT! Short ball and gone! Tanzim wafts at a bumper and sends it straight to Nabi at cover. The drama continues! Taskin Ahmed is in at 10. A couple of dots and Taskin find a leg-bye single. Huge delivery coming up with Litton on strike. He finds a single.

Litton finds two off the first ball in a flash. Noor corrects his line to dart in a couple of dots. Litton drives the ball to long-on for a single. Excellent over in the scenario, just three from it.

Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: BAN 88/7 in 13 overs (Target: 114 in 19)

Rashid to bowl out.

Tanzim finds a single. Short from Rashid and Litton slaps it to deep mid-wicket for two runs. Another short delivery and Litton straight-pulls it for one run. Tanzim deftly cuts the ball for another single. Six from the over and Bangladesh are officially knocked out from the semifinal race. Will they take Afghanistan along?

09:52 (IST)
25 JUN 2024
Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: BAN 82/7 in 12 overs (Target: 114 in 19)

Noor spins a web around Tanzim who struggles to put bat on ball as it turns away from him. He comes around the wicket as he straightens the ball past off-stump. There is another drizzle around and Jonathan Trott is asking his boys to slow the game down. And immediately the slip fielder is going down to delay the game. Rashid is livid with Gulbadin as the covers come on!

We're back after a brief halt. Najibullah Zadran replaces Gulbadin on the field. 1 over has been lost and Bangladesh's target is cut to 114 in 19. Tanzim taps the ball to the deep for a single. And suddenly Gulbadin is emerging from the dugout. 

09:42 (IST)
25 JUN 2024
Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: BAN 80/7 in 11 overs (Target: 116)

Bangladesh need 39 in 13 balls to qualify.

Rashid continues. A single to start for Litton. Another single and Bangladesh seem in no hurry to chase the target down. Another dot ball as Afghanistan continue to search for wickets. Short ball and Litton drags it to deep mid-wicket for a single. Loud appeal as Mahmudullah swings at a fuller ball across the line and misses. Rashid is excited and reviews. Would you believe it? There's a spike on the UltraEdge and Mahmudullah perishes! Rashid to Rishad, OUT! Two in two for Rashid Khan! A classic googly and Rishad plays all around it first ball. What a moment for Afghanistan.

25 JUN 2024
Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: BAN 77/5 in 10 overs (Target: 116)

Noor Ahmad into the attack

Noor zips one past Mahmudullah's outside-edge. Fraction shorter and Mahmudullah guides the ball to backward point, no run. Three dots as Noor cramps up Mahmudullah with a straighter delivery. Width outside the off-stump and Mahmdullah creams it through cover for FOUR. Just a sole scoring shot in the over. Drinks come on in as we reach the half-way mark. A pulsating finish is still in store.

09:36 (IST)
25 JUN 2024
Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: BAN 73/5 in 9 overs (Target: 116)

Rashid continues. Rashid to Hridoy, OUT! Straight to deep mid-wicket. Rashid Khan becomes the second bowler to reach 150 T20I wickets and the quickest to the feat. Hridoy is foxed by the googly as he plays with the turn but does not get the desired muscle on it. Mahmudullah is in at 7. Loopy delivery from Rashid and Mahmudullah steps out and pumps it past long-off for FOUR. Rashid darts one in and Litton slices it late down third for another FOUR.

25 JUN 2024
Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: BAN 63/4 in 8 overs (Target: 116)

Nabi loops one in to cramp up Hridoy. The dots are quietly piling up. IN THE AIR and Farooqi spills a chance running backwards from short-fine! Hridoy gets a top-edge off a length delivery that springs up and Farooqi could not keeping it within his grasp. Another top-edge over the keeper and Noor Ahmad gives a chase from short-third but fails to stop a FOUR with a sloppy effort at the fence. In the slot and Hridoy slog-sweeps through mid-wicket for another FOUR. Another misfield at mid-wicket and Hridoy reels in two runs. Afghanistan are letting it slip through now.

09:28 (IST)
25 JUN 2024
Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: BAN 51/4 in 7 overs (Target: 116)

Rashid Khan into the attack

Rashid is finding it hard to grip the ball as he uses a cloth to wipe off the dew frequently. He sends in a wide to Soumya down leg. Rashid to Soumya, OUT! Cleaned him up. A Rashid pearler there as he skids it through with a straighter line. Soumya is stuck in the crease, not going forward or back as the ball zips through to hit middle-stump. Massive wicket for Afghanistan, delivered by the skipper. Towhid Hridoy is in at 6. He is off the blocks with a single as Bangladesh cross 50.

Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: BAN 46/3 in 6 overs (Target: 116)

Mohammad Nabi into the attack

Nabi finds some turn in towards Litton, who rocks back to dab it short-third for one run. In the air and just short! Soumya attempts a reverse-sweep but lobs it towards Farooqi at short-third. Close! Soumya nearly drags one back as Ishaq leaps forward and scoops the ball to hit the stumps. The batters sneak in a single off the deflection. Litton slog-sweeps to the deep and only finds a single as both batters slip at either end

09:18 (IST)
25 JUN 2024
Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: BAN 43/3 in 5 overs (Target: 116)

Naveen moves into his third over. Back of a length slower-ball and Litton drives it to the cover fielder, no run. Width outside off-stump and Litton fails to connect with a slash. Short and wide from Naveen and Litton slaps it over point for FOUR. Naveen sends one in with the angle and whizzes the ball past the outside-edge again. Another slower ball on the full and Litton lofts it over mid-off for two runs.

09:12 (IST)
25 JUN 2024
Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: BAN 36/3 in 4 overs (Target: 116)

Farooqi will resume his over as Litton and Soumya return to the crease. Litton's back on strike. Slower-ball outside the off-stump and Litton taps it behind point for a single. A touch of width and Soumya slices it behind point for a quick single. Farooqi will resume his over as Litton and Soumya return to the crease. Farooqi continues to fiddle with his pace as the batters tread on singles.

08:41 (IST)
25 JUN 2024
Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: 4th over

Farooqi starts with a wide down leg to Soumya. Farooqi strays to the pads and Soumya clips it over mid-wicket for FOUR. Width from Farooqi and Soumya taps the ball to backward point. A direct-hit at the striker's end would have sent Litton packing. And it's started to drizzle again. The players walk off and the covers are coming on.

08:33 (IST)
25 JUN 2024
Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: BAN 24/3 in 3 overs (Target: 116)

Loud shout as Naveen slides the ball in high onto Litton's pad. Umpire Nitin Menon is unmoved but Afghanistan opt for a review. Wickets missing as the ball swings down leg and Litton survives. Length from Naveen and Shanto heaves it through mid-wicket for FOUR. Bangladesh are up and running now. Naveen foxes Shanto with a slower-ball outside off-stump, dot ball. Naveen to Shanto, OUT! Slower-ball on length and Shanto miscues it to Nabi at deep mid-wicket. Excellent bowling and captaincy to ring in the change in field immediately. Naveen to Shakib, OUT! Chipped straight back and Naveen is on a hat-trick. He shapes one and straightens it sharply, getting Shakib into an awkward angle with the push and he ends up offering a simple catch to the bowler. Afghanistan are back on top. Soumya Sarkar is in at 5. He dabs the first bowl down to third for a single.

He strays to the pads and Litton finds two leg-byes down leg. Farooqi to Tanzid, OUT! Loud shout and given. A cracking off-cutter from Farooqi scuttles in to hit the pad. The umpire raises his finger straightaway but Bangladesh review. Three reds and Tanzid falls for a duck. Najmul Shanto is in at 3. He is off the blocks with a single. Litton attempts a ramp but settles for a single with an inside-edge.

Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: BAN 13/0 in 1 over (Target: 116)

Naveen-ul-Haq takes the new ball

Fuller ball outside the off-stump and Litton taps it towards mid-off for a single. Naveen comes around the stumps to the left-handed Tanzid and cramps him up for room. Naveen tails the ball onto the hip and Tanzid fails to brush it past short fine-leg. Slower-delivery outside the off-stump and Litton gets a thick outside-edge past third for FOUR. Length from Naveen and Litton pumps it over mid-wicket for SIX! Another slower ball dips on Litton and it hits Gurbaz flush on the knee as the batters sneak in a single.

The rain is getting heavier. The umpires have called in for the covers as soon as Afghanistan's innings gets over. It is pouring down now. The groundstaff have charged in and have covered the pitch, squares and run-up areas.

Remember, if we don't get any more cricket due to rain, Afghanistan will qualify for the semi-finals.

07:28 (IST)
25 JUN 2024

25 JUN 2024
Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Wicket

Mustafizur gets the wicket of Azmatullah Omarzai. Omarzai hangs back and goes for the cut but gets an outside edge. Das behind the stumps collects it and starts celebrating but strangely, Nitin Menon is not interested. The Bangladeshi players appeal but Menon's finger stays down. Shanto quickly opts for a review. There was definitely a noise when the ball passed the bat. The UltraEdge showed a big spike. The original decision is reversed and Omarzai departs.

07:09 (IST)
25 JUN 2024
Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Comedy

It's comedy of errors here. Both the batters are at the same end but the shy at the stumps is missed. Both try to get to the bowler's end and run simultaneously but there is no one backing it up to throw it to the bowler's end.

07:06 (IST)

25 JUN 2024
Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: FOUR

Change of bat for Gurbaz and he breaks the shackles to collect his only second boundary. A much-needed one for Afghanistan and Gurbaz. It was the first boundary in 39 deliveries. (AFG: 71/1 in 13.5 overs)

25 JUN 2024
Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Scenarios

A win by 62 or more runs, and a chase of 141 in 12.3 overs or earlier, will push them to second place on the points table. (If they level the scores and then win with a six, they can push the chase to 13.1 overs.) If Afghanistan score 160, Bangladesh can stay ahead of Australia by chasing it down in 12.5 overs or sooner (if they score 161), or in 13.3 overs if they level scores and win with a six.
