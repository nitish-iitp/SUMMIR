AFG vs BAN Scorecard
Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Commentary
5:33 AM IST And then there were four! It has been a long and humdinger of a tournament but we now know the four teams that will battle it out in the knockout phase of the competition. It will be South Africa taking on an upbeat Afghanistan in the first semifinal at the Brian Lara Stadium in Tarouba, Trinidad on Thursday 27 June at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT). Then, it will be a repeat clash of the semifinal from the last T20 World Cup where the reigning T20 World Champions England will take on an unbeaten Indian side at the Providence Stadium in Guyana also on 27 June but that game will begin at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT). You can join us for the early build-up for both those matches but till then, take care and goodbye!
5:31 AM IST Rashid Khan, the skipper of Afghanistan says that it's like a dream for them as a team. Says the belief came when they defeated New Zealand. Says he is out of words to describe the emotions. Mentions that he thought they were 10-15 runs short but also says that 115 was the best score on this track. Further adds that they knew Bangladesh would come hard against them and that they needed to be clear with the execution of plans. States they put in that requisite effort. Also says that rain is not in their control but they gave their 100% on the field. On Fazalhaq Farooqi and Naveen's bowling, he says if you have a strong base in bowling, it gives a good advantage and opportunity to attack in the middle overs. Then goes onto appreciate Naveen and Farooqi saying they are skillful and he is very happy with the way they delivered. Says it is a great achievement for them. They reached the Under 19 semifinals as before so it is a special win for them and the country will be proud of them. Ends up by saying that now they will have to go with a clear plan for the semis.
5:28 AM IST Najmul Hossain Shanto, the captain of Bangladesh says that they bowled really well but as a batting unit, they made some poor decisions, especially in the middle overs, and that cost them. Adds that the plan was to go hard till losing three wickets and then it was just about getting the win. Mentions that throughout the tournament they bowled well and lauds the likes of Rishad Hossain and the pacers and even the fielders but adds that going forward, they need to think about their plans with the bat. Mentions that with the rain stopping play can be frustrating but the ball also gets wet and comes on nicely to bat and it was just about the batters not executing well enough.
5:24 AM IST Naveen-ul-Haq is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his sensational bowling at the top and at the backend as well. He begins by saying that they had been dreaming for the past few years about this day and says that he is at a loss for words to describe the feeling. Adds it is a very special moment for them as a team and as a country. He further adds that they knew Bangladesh was going to come hard in the powerplay to chase it down in 12.1 overs and says that they needed wickets inside the first six. Also adds that these are the kinds of games where you don't know what is going to happen and the margin of error is very small. But also says that they knew if they don't give away easy runs, they will be in the game. Ends up by saying they worked very hard for this day and are looking for a good semifinal performance.
5:23 AM IST The Presentation ceremony...
5:23 AM IST Earlier in the game, Rashid Khan opted to bat first on a used pitch, the exact one on which they beat the Aussies in the last game and once again, the duo of Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran was able to put on a stand at the top. It wasn't a brisk one and neither of them could convert it into a big score this time around. Bangladesh fought back hard with the ball and managed to pick up wickets along with keeping runs to a minimum and it was the leggie Rishad Hossain who was the star as he picked up three wickets. Afghanistan huffed and puffed but skipper Rashid Khan managed to put away a couple of balls into the crowd at the death and that virtually got them the win.
