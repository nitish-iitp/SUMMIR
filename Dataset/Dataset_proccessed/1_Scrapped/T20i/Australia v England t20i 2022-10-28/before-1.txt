WI lacked proper preparation, leadership - Gray
 
Narper 2022-10-26 16:40:16 

Former Windies player Tony Gray:


“It is hurting me…I don’t think we were prepared properly. We didn’t have a specific camp and when you are preparing for a tournament, you need specificity,” the former West Indies fast bowler explained.


“Players needed to be selected long in advance of the World Cup and specific work had to be done with them in a camp situation with all the support staff, so clear-cut plans would have been implemented and there would have been a proper educational prelude to the World Cup,” he continued
.

In terms of the leadership of the team, Gray said skipper Nicholas Pooran has been struggling in the white-ball format. “Pooran is at sea with his tactical awareness and he has lost the mantle of leadership because he is not scoring runs and should be relieved of the captaincy,” said Gray.

“Pooran is an example of how we are not thinking. What is his history and experience of being captain? If you look at Pooran’s batting and captaincy, it is aligned with the lack of foundation, which he has not had in first-class cricket,” Gray contends.


“Pooran hasn’t captained teams before—for example regional age-group teams—before being appointed to lead the senior West Indies team so where does he get the foundation from to captain the hardest team to captain in world cricket,” he continued. “With the way our cricket is structured, with players coming from all different regions, leadership of the West Indies side is very difficult.”

”If you have a guy bowling 150 km per hour, why are you not opening your bowling with him. You don’t want to give your opposition any level of confidence. So, my problem is that you are using bowlers who will give them confidence from the start, so when your main bowlers come on you are in trouble already, so the strategy of the coaching staff has to be looked at,” Gray assessed.

“Having been a level-three coach and a level-three coaching assessor, I am not totally surprised,” said Gray. In terms of the batting, he said the order should have been cemented long before the tournament so that the players could build the necessary chemistry with one another and for everyone to get their roles and strategy right.


Apply for the head coach wuk Tony ...hammer them

Very good analysis.....

Pooran became captain..,who recommended his name...who seconded and who appointed...all are liable...

Strategy...Mayers and Akeal our opening bowlers in Australia...even Zampa, Ashwin, Rashid,Shadab don't dare to open in Australia.. management used Akeal...
And less said about Mayers better.,

Takes a Gray to speak to Truth

Very astute comments by Tony Gray, who is a person for whom I have always had a lot of respect. Of course the irony is that TTCB has appointed the same Pooran as captain of the Red Force for the upcoming tournament. Maybe this was to give him a chance to improve his leadership skills. While I will not be surprised if Pooran is removed as skipper for the next international series a la Holder, I think that it would be better for his own personal character and development if he were to at least offer to stand down as captain. If he reviews his year of captaincy, he will see how little effect he has had on the team as a leader and should realise that such a move is not only for his own good but for the good of his team.

Seems like every time a newspaper wants some to cuss the current coach and players they contact Tony Gray

agree with gray totally.......goes back to the days of sammy. Sammy just happened to have leadership qualities and good vibes that could inspire the players around him. When Holder was given the mantle because Whycliff had fell out with everyone else, the same thing happened. Its actually to Holder's credit that he transformed himself into a world class allrounder while having the added pressure of captaincy. Plenty players would not have recovered from the successive beatings by AB and Guptill and the Australia series the same year.

Holder the cricketer you must respect and also feel that he still has some left in the tank. If he could improve his delivery position, he could be even more dangerous as a bowler. He is still to realise his full potential as a batsman. Just remember that late cut he played in the CPL. That was sublime. As a captain, however, he just does not have the mojo and should stay away from all captaincy positions and remain as advisor in chief on the field based on his experience.

One of your governments told me that they were very cautious about their diaspora? They claim wicked intentions and no good motives. I know agree from reading this.

This type of reasoning is so antiquated no wonder these guys are promptly ignored. In T20 cricket these days it's par for the course and not who can bowl the fastest.

How many times have we seen teams opening the bowling with spinners in T20, get early wickets and establish an advantage?

Maybe that is how it used to be in your days Mr. Gray but now the technology allows teams to study their opponents and if a slow bowler can do the job based on who is opening the batting, then that's how it will play out ....

Those are the important facts Mr. Gray. I do hope the board and selectors take your advice.

What lack of preparation? The team has been together for a year and still suffered from the following deficiencies.

Men getting out de same way time and time again swiping to cow corner
Players inability or unwillingness to play with soft hands and find gaps and pick up ones and twos
Not recognize dat boundary size makes a difference
Bowlers unable or unwilling to bowl a particular line

How much more preparation did dey really need? Or is it dat WI has been operating with an archaic game plan dat its ok to swing and miss 5 times if you can hit de sixth for 6 and bowl widout discipline?

According to Daren Sammy now, we lacked inspiration and tactics.

Of course this is after he said West Indies will produce something special at the WC.

The team has not been together for a year. Neither has the players on the team been playing any particular role for a year. I have made the point before that alot of WI loses are due to bad coaching tactics and bad captaincy as a result. No matter how good the players are the team is going to lose more than they win if the tactics are bad. Brazil will lose if u put the best strikers to play defence and the defence to play as forwards.

As for the team being together for a year - that is not true. Cariah and Reifer has never played a T20I for the WI and was never part of any WI T20 squad ever. Johnson Charles and Evin Lewis did not play for the WI in the past year. Charles in fact did not play for the WI since about 2016. Joseph, as surprising as it was, played his first T20I for the WI on July 29 this year and only played five T20I for the WI before making the trip to Australia. Cottrell was out of the team injured for most of the year and only played in the series against England at home and away to India. Obed McKoy after playing on Oct 23, 2021 did not play a T20I again for the WI until July 2 this year. So he was out for a good 8 months in the past year also due to injury. That's seven players out of the 15 man squad who did not play consistently for the WI over the past year. Four of those players did not play for the WI at all in the year leading up to the World Cup. So what team are you saying has been together for the past year?

The WI was unprepared despite playing so many T20I over the past year. Too many chopping and changing and using players to bat all over the place. At the world cup, Evin Lewis batted at number 3 for the first time in his T20I career. It is not a role he has ever been asked to play before. Yet at a worldcup he was asked to bat at number 3 in two of the three matches he played. Brooks who batted as an opener and at number 3 in ten of his previous eleven T20I for the WI was suddenly asked to bat at number 5 and 6 at the World Cup. Pooran who batted at number 3 in 16 of his last 25 matches before going to Australia was now being asked to bat at number 4 and 5 at the World Cup. Brandon King who has opened in every T20I match he has played since December 2019 was suddenly asked to bat at number 3 or 4 at the World Cup. Rovman Powell who has one century and four 50s in T20I all while batting at number 4 or 5 was pushed to number 6 for the World Cup. I hope you all can see how unsettled the team was and how no batter appeared to understand their role in the team at the worldcup. They were being asked to play roles at the worldcup that they were unfamiliar and they failed at it. This was poor planning on the part of the coach. We went to the World Cup with 15 players. We didn't go with a team.

Agreed but once you play 3 openers, one of them will have to bat at 3 or lower in the order.

This is exactly why the team did not make any sense. The squad had 4 regular opening batsmen none of whom batted anywhere other than as opening batsman prior to the world cup. Mayers, King, Charles and Lewis has always only opened the bating. So picking all four always meant at least two of them would bat out of place and in a position they are unfamiliar. Why wait until the worldcup to have this experiment? How can you be experimenting at the worldcup? How can the first time a player is being asked to do something be at the worldcup?
