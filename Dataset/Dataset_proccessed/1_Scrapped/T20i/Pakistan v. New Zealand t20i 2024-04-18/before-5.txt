PK-W vs WI-W (Pakistan Women vs West Indies Women), 1st ODI Match Preview

In the last Women’s One Day International (WODI) match, Pakistan’s middle-order batters did well, scoring between 23 and 68 runs each. Bismah Maroof scored the most runs but took a bit longer. She hopes for a faster pitch in Karachi. Natalia Pervaiz plays aggressively in all formats and will be exciting to watch when she bats. We think Nashra Sandhu and Ghulam Fatima will be the most effective against West Indies Women with the ball. But it’ll be tough for all bowlers to keep the runs down.

In their last Women’s One Day International (WODI) match, West Indies Women were severely beaten by Australia Women. They only scored 103 runs before Australia Women quickly chased the target in less than 16 overs! But that was last year, and the team they’re facing now isn’t as strong as Australia. West Indies Women will rely on players like Hayley Matthews and Stafanie Taylor to lead the team. How well they play will determine the result of this match.

Our prediction favors the Pakistan women’s win.
