Pakistan vs New Zealand Live Score: It’s a Wicket. Tim Robinson is out and New Zealand at 2/1 after 0.2 overs

Pakistan vs New Zealand Live Score: OUT! TIMBER! Cleans him up. Trademark Afridi. This is full and he gets it to shape back in. It comes back in late. Robinson looks to hit it down the ground but this sneaks between the gap of bat and pad and hits the stumps. Perfect start for the hosts.
