Sports is one of the most unpredictable industries in the world. One day, you're the best player in the world, and the very next day, you suffer an injury, and suddenly, owners start finding your replacement. This is why having a government job is quite essential for every sportsperson in the country. However, in Harmanpreet's case, she struggled a lot to get a government job. Despite contributing so much to women's cricket, she didn't get employment in Punjab Police.

Well, as per Yadwinder Sodhi, he and Harmanpreet requested the former Chief Minister of Punjab, Prakash Singh Badal to give her a government job. Opening up about the same, Yadwinder Sodhi said:

"Even after playing for India at a very young age, and having done well, Harmanpreet Kaur was struggling for a job. We requested Punjab Police to employ her, we even met former Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal a few times, but all we got in return was 'You are a female cricketer. There is no scope for any employment with Punjab Police'. She went through all this."
