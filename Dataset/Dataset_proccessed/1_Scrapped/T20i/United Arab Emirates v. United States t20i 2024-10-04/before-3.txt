Fresh from their away T20I series win against Pakistan, the Proteas Women begin their 2024 ICC T20 Women’s World Cup campaign against the West Indies at the West Indies Dubai International Cricket Stadium in the UAE, on Friday, 4 October, 2024.

As the 2024 ICC T20 Women’s World Cup kicks off in the UAE, the Proteas Women are embracing a heartfelt message, “Always Rising – For Me, For Her, For Them, For All, For South Africa, For The Proteas.”

This powerful campaign highlights their deep connection with fans, family, and their beloved country, reminding them of the unwavering support that fuels their ambition.

“Carrying a piece of home with me during the tournament gives me strength. I know I’m not alone out there.”
Proteas Women Captain, Laura Wolvaardt

In a touching tribute, the players will don customised shirts with embroidered names of family members and close friends. These names, between one and five individuals with special significance to the wearer are stitched on the inside of their collars and hems, allowing each player to carry a piece of home into the heat of competition. 

“It’s such a special touch! When I look down and see the names of those most important to me, it reminds me to always give my best.” 
Wicketkeeper Sinalo Jafta, who honoured her mother and counsellor

Beyond the emotional bonds, the Proteas Women will focus on key tactical elements to build on their 2023 T20 World Cup finalist performance. Adapting to the slower pitches and extreme heat of the UAE is essential. Spin bowling, led by the talents of Nonkululeko Mlaba and new-comer Seshnie Naidu, will be critical in controlling opposition batters on turning tracks.

A consistent top order, with openers like Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits, will need to lay solid foundations. The middle order must then capitalise with power-hitting in the death overs, aiming to add crucial runs to either defend or chase competitive totals.

Handling pressure is a key focus for the Proteas. As finalists in 2023, they understand the importance of staying composed in high-stakes moments, especially during close finishes. Their depth in both bowling and batting will offer flexibility, and managing overs strategically will be crucial to adapting to the UAE’s unique conditions.
