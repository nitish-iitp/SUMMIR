The ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2024, initially set for Bangladesh, has been relocated to the UAE due to civil unrest. The tournament starts on October 3, with Pakistan facing Sri Lanka in Group A. Ten teams divided into two groups will compete, aiming to reach the October 20 final.
The 9th edition of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup is set to kick off in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, October 3, 2024. Initially, the tournament was scheduled to be held in Bangladesh, but due to the ongoing civil unrest in the country, the ICC decided to relocate the event to the UAE to ensure the safety of the players. Despite the venue change, Bangladesh will still be recognized as the host nation for the tournament.
The tournament features 10 qualified teams, divided into two groups of five.
Each team will play one match against the other four teams in their group between October 3 and October 15. The top two teams from each group will advance to the semi-finals, which will take place on October 17 and 18. The winners of the semi-finals will face off in the final on October 20.
On Thursday, October 3, the Pakistan women’s national cricket team is set to kick off the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup campaign against Sri Lanka in a Group A match at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium.

As the Pakistan women’s cricket team prepares to face Sri Lanka in their Group A match of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup, both teams have announced their squads for the highly anticipated clash.
Pakistan, led by captain Fatima Sana, will look to regain their footing after a tough set of warm-up matches. Their squad features a blend of experienced players like Nida Dar and emerging talents such as Tuba Hassan. However, Sadia Iqbal's fitness remains a concern, with her participation subject to medical clearance. Key players to watch include Muneeba Ali, Nashra Sundhu, and Omaima Sohail, who bring valuable skills to the lineup.


The full squad includes:


Fatima Sana (c), Aliya Riaz, Diana Baig, Gull Feroza, Iram Javed, Muneeba Ali, Nashra Sundhu, Nida Dar, Omaima Sohail, Sadaf Shamas, Sadia Iqbal (subject to fitness), Sidra Amin, Syeda Aroob Shah, Tasmia Rubab, and Tuba Hassan.
Sri Lanka, fresh off their successful Asia Cup campaign, is captained by the experienced Chamari Athapaththu. With a strong lineup of players, including the in-form Harshitha Madhavi and reliable bowlers like Inoka Ranaweera and Sugandika Kumari, the team entered the match with high expectations.

Their squad comprises of:


Chamari Athapaththu (c), Anushka Sanjeewani, Harshitha Madhavi, Nilakshika de Silva, Inoka Ranaweera, Hasini Perera, Kavisha Dilhari, Sachini Nisansala, Vishmi Gunaratne, Udeshika Prabodhani, Achini Kulasuriya, Sugandika Kumari, Inoshi Priyadharshani, Shashini Gimhani, and Ama Kanchana.
