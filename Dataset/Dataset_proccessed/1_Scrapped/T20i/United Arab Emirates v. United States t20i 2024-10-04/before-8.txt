Women's T20 World Cup 2024 telecast and live streaming


The Women's T20 World Cup 2024 will be available for live viewing in India on Star Sports and will also be streamed live on Disney+ Hotstar.

Venues for Women's T20 World Cup 2024


The tournament will be held across two venues in the UAE, namely:


Sharjah Cricket Stadium, Sharjah
Dubai International Stadium, Dubai

The Women's T20 World Cup is poised to be an exciting event, showcasing some of the best cricketing talent from around the globe. Fans are eagerly anticipating thrilling matches and the emergence of new stars in the women's game.

ICC Women’s T20 World Cup key facts you must know about



Unlike the men's event, which expanded for the 2024 edition, the women's competition remains limited to 10 teams. Group A includes Australia, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Group B features Bangladesh, England, Scotland, South Africa, and the West Indies.


India finds itself in a challenging group alongside Australia, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, and Pakistan. Their campaign begins on Friday (Oct 4) against New Zealand, followed by a face-off with Pakistan on Sunday (Oct 6), and a rematch with Sri Lanka on Oct 9. These games are in Dubai, and the much-anticipated clash against Australia is on Oct 13 in Sharjah.


Only two teams from each group will advance to the semifinals, with Australia likely to secure one spot. India must avoid early slip-ups to stay in contention.


This is the 9th edition of the tournament, and Australia has claimed the title six times, including the last three. England won the inaugural tournament in 2009, and the West Indies triumphed memorably in 2016 at Eden Gardens.


For the first time in an ICC event, women will receive the same prize money as men. The winning team will take home USD 2.34 million, a significant increase from the USD 1 million Australia won in 2023. The runners-up will earn USD 1.17 million.


All 10 umpires and three match referees officiating the tournament are female. India is represented by GS Lakshmi as match referee and umpire Vrinda Rathi. DRS will be available in all 28 matches, with a Hawk-eye Smart Replay system.


Indian commentators Mithali Raj, Anjum Chopra, and WV Raman will join a panel that includes Mel Jones, Lisa Sthalekar, Katey Martin, and Sana Mir. Other familiar voices include Ian Bishop, Nasser Hussain, and Alison Mitchell.


In India, matches will be broadcast on Star Sports, with Disney+ Hotstar offering online streaming. Day matches begin at 3:30 PM IST, and evening matches start at 7:30 PM IST.


The tournament was relocated from Bangladesh to the UAE, with Sharjah Cricket Stadium hosting the opener on October 3, and Dubai International Stadium hosting the final on October 20.


India’s squad, with no major surprises, is aiming to go beyond their 2020 runner-up finish. They secured wins in their warm-up matches against West Indies and South Africa.


Women's T20 World Cup: India aims for glory with men's team's triumph as inspiration


The Women's T20 World Cup is fast approaching, with the ninth edition of the tournament set to take place in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The opening matches will feature Bangladesh against Scotland in Sharjah at 3:30 PM IST, followed by Pakistan facing Sri Lanka at the same venue at 7:30 PM IST on October 3. India will kick off their campaign against New Zealand in Dubai on Friday at 7:30 PM IST, right after the 2016 champions, West Indies, take on South Africa at the same location.
Australia, the reigning champions, have won the last three titles consecutively and have been the champions all but twice since the tournament's inception. England claimed the inaugural title in 2009, while West Indies triumphed in 2016. Australia will look to secure their seventh title when they face Sri Lanka in their opening match on Saturday at 3:30 PM IST in Sharjah.
India has reached the final once, in 2020, where they lost to Australia by 85 runs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Following the men's team's dramatic victory in the T20 World Cup earlier this year, captain Harmanpreet Kaur has expressed that the women's team is drawing inspiration from their male counterparts’ success.
