India vs Bangladesh T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights

India vs Bangladesh T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights: India beat Bangladesh by five runs in a rain affected Super 12 encounter in Adelaide on Wednesday. With this outcome, the Men In Blue climb top of the Group 2 table as they now have six points from four matches. The match started with Bangladesh inviting India to bat first. India got off to a slow start, losing skipper Rohit Sharma for 2. However, fifty from KL Rahul and an unbeaten 44-ball 64 by Virat Kohli powered India to 184/6 in 20 overs. In response, Bangladesh started strong with Litton Das leading the run chase. He went to slam a 21-ball 50, before rain stopped the play, which also saw the target get reduced to 151 in 16 overs. As soon as the action resumed, Bangladesh kept losing wickets in a hurry, which started with Das getting run-out for 60. Soon Mohammed Shami provided India with the second breakthrough. Arshdeep Singh then struck twice in the same over and Hardik Pandya scalped two in the following over. Catch all the Highlights of IND vs BAN, T20 World Cup:
