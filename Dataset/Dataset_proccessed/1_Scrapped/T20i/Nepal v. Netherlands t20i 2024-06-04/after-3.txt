That's it for our ball-by-ball coverage from this game. Ashish Pant will have the report there for you to read shortly. Till next time, take it easy.

Tim Pringle was Player of the Match for his 3 for 20, by the way.

Netherlands captain Scott Edwards: "Our bowlers were awesome up top. We got two or three wickets in the powerplay. All five of our bowlers were brilliant. Ideally we would have got the runs a little quicker, but it was great the way Max batted, and Bassie finished it off well. We've got to play consistent cricket right way through this tournament."

Nepal captain Rohit Paudel: "The conditions while batting were really challenging. Netherlands bowled really well. We could have stretched it a little more and had more partnerships through the middle. I was moving laterally and using the crease to upset the bowlers. After the start I got I could have done better.

"As a bowling unit we did really well. The last catch that I dropped was very well and we didn't catch well. I want to thank the crowd. It felt like we were playing in Nepal. We are really grateful to them."

But it was the Netherlands bowling effort that brought this win about. Left-arm spinner Tim Pringle and Logan van Beek took three wickets each, and Paul van Meekeren and Bas de Leede took two apiece. Vitally, none of those bowlers went for more than a run a ball. As hard as Nepal defended, you always suspected Netherlands would hunt down 107.

Pratik Dahal: "You can't afford to drop catches especially at this stage. Certainly a couple of easy drop catches cost Nepal the match."

Not the dominant win we expected after Nepal were bowled out for 106. But a comfortable win nonetheless in the end, thanks largely to O'Dowd's 54 not out off 48 balls.

Nepal bowled tenaciously, but they did drop three catches - Aasif Sheikh, Sompal Kami, and Rohit Paudel dropping one apiece. If they'd caught those, it may have put a bit of extra pressure on Netherlands - could it even have changed the result?

Bohara to de Leede, FOUR runs

Fullish ball, wide off off, and that's the game! De Leede beats cover with a strong drive and it skips away to the boundary and Netherlands breathe a sigh of relief

Bohara to O'Dowd, SIX runs

Is that a a six? It is. A lovely scoop over the shoulder, and that also takes O'Dowd to fifty. This was a length ball on the stumps, he gets low and shovels it nicely right on to the boundary cushion to collect six.

Bohara to O'Dowd, FOUR runs

There's the boundary they needed! O'Dowd delivers it. This was a length ball on the pads, and he gets across and flicks this fine of the deep square leg and makes a dent in that requirement

40 balls since the last boundary was scored. But They only need 13 more.

Sompal Kami to O'Dowd, 1 run

Almost a chance again. O' Dowd is going for it and hits this full ball down towards long off again. Paudel runs around but can't get to the ball, it bounces a couple of metres short.

17.2
1
Sompal Kami to O'Dowd, 1 run

Dropped! Is that the match? That's captain Paudel down there and he should have taken it. O'Dowd went for the big shot against this fullish ball and Paudel only had to go a couple of metres to his left at long off and hold on and he grasses it. Such a big moment

17.1
1
Sompal Kami to de Leede, 1 run

Attempted yorker first up but it's a low full toss in the end. De Leede drives, doesn't hit cleanly but gets it past the bowler and gets a single

Here's Sompal Kami. Is this the over Netherlands will target. He's coming around the wicket.
