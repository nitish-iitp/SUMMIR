Scott Edwards, the captain of Netherlands says that they got a bit of a read of the wicket and their bowlers used the conditions well to get a couple of wickets in the Powerplay. Credits his entire bowling unit and says that they were excellent throughout the innings. Mentions that ideally they would have wanted to chase it down quicker but the wicket was a bit tricky and Max played a crucial knock to take them home. Ends by saying that it is just about keeping consistency for them and they can challenge any team in the tournament.

!

Rohit Paudel, the skipper of Nepal says the conditions were challenging, they could have played a bit better with tbe bat, they lacked partership and it helped Netherlands to get back in the game. Adds he was trying to use the crease and disturb the Dutch bowler's length and it was working for him. Shares they bowled well but accepts that it could have been different had he would have taken the catch in the fag end of the innings. Ends by thanking the crowd who showed up and says, he feels like they were playing in Nepal.

!

Tim Pringle wins the Player of the Match award. He says that he tried to bowl at the stump and let the surface do it's job. Adds that giving flight is important for a spinner but you also have to vary your pace. Ends by saying that he is happy that they got the win.

...Presentation...

!

For Nepal, they were boosted with some amazing support right from the start but on the field, things didn't went as per planned. Nepal didn't got the partnership they were looking for with the bat. They struggled throughout and ended with a below-par total in the end. The bowlers didn't had much chance with such a low score to defend but they tried their best and scalped a couple of wickets however, were not helped by some disappoint fielding performance as they dropped a couple of chances and at times when if had they taken the catch, the game could have tilted in their favour.

!

Netherlands are up and running in the Group D! The victory though was well set up by their bowlers. It was a crucial toss to win for Scott Edwards who made a great decision to bowl first in overcast conditions. His bowlers were right upto the mark, just basic execution was needed as the pitch was assisting seamers and spinners equally. Tim Pringle took the opening wicket and ended with three eventully while Logan van Beek took two wickets in the final over to end with three wickets as well. With bat, Netherlands kept losing wickets reguarly but they needed someone to play the anchoring role and it was Max O'Dowd who put up his hand and scored a fine fifty to get his team over the line. Netherlands could have gone the hard way but they chose to be cautios right till the end to get the two points which is understanable knowing the pitch was helping the bowlers.
