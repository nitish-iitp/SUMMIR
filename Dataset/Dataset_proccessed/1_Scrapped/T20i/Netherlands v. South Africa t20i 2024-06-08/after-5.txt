Netherlands vs South Africa 2024 T20 World Cup Highlights: David Miller struck a high-quality 59 not out to help South Africa recover from a terrible start and post a four-wicket win over the Netherlands in their T20 World Cup match. Miller hit a 51-ball 59 to guide SA to their second win in as many matches, while putting on a crucial stand for the fifth wicket with Tristan Stubbs. The Proteas finished at 106 for six n 18.5 overs chasing 104. South Africa were reduced to 12/4 inside the powerplay but they recovered strongly, riding on a 65-run stand between Miller and Stubbs (33, 37 balls, 1x4, 1x6). Earlier, pacer Ottneil Baartman returned a four-wicket haul as SA restricted the Netherlands to 103 for 9. Baartman produced a measly spell to record 4-0-11-4 while Anrich Nortje (2/19) and Marco Jansen (2/20) provided strong support as the Proteas bowlers dominated the Dutch batters. (Scorecard)

Right then, that is it from this exciting game where South Africa manages to break their curse and defeat Netherlands but it was not easy at all. However, the action is going on in the T20 World Cup where England is taking on Australia in a crunch game. You can just switch tabs to catch all the action of that match. Cheers!

!

Aiden Markram, the victorious skipper of South Africa says that it was a bit nerve-wrecking. Credits the Netherlands bowlers for making it really hard for them. Adds that their opponents have shown that they can beat big teams and knew it would be scrap. Mentions that the win is very important and to squeeze a win like this, no one would have given them a chance after being four down. Says that the wicket played better, the bowlers did fantastic but they need to get their confidence back in the batting department.

!

Scott Edwards, the captain of Netherlands credits South Africa for the way they played. Mentions there was a bit in the widket with the new ball but the pitch flattened out. Adds they pride on playing good cricket and the guys standing up. Ends by saying he backed his team till the last ball and had they got Miller, they could have won.

!

David Miller is the Player of the match for his match-winning knock. He says that it was a great finish. Adds that the wicket played better than the last game. Credits the Netherlands bowlers for their efforts and says they made it really difficult for them.

... PRESENTATION TIME ...

!

Credit to Netherlands to take it so deep! They bowled brilliantly with the new ball. When the surface was offering something. They made most of it but as the sting from the surfaces faded, they struggled to bowl wicket taking balls. Also, the extras did not help but a whole hearted performance from them.

!

Cometh the hour, cometh the man! David Miller, you beauty! South Africa have crawled over the line! What we thought would be an easy win, turned out to be hard work for the Proteas. At one stage they were 4 down for not a lot and in huge trouble but it was Stubbs and Miller who steadied the ship and took them to safer shores. They batted sensibly and added over 50. Stubbs and Jansen fell in quick succession but Miller stayed there till the end and gets his side over the line.
