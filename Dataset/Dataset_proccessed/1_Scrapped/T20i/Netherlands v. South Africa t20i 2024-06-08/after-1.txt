David Miller hit a match-winning fifty against Netherlands
South Africa survived a massive scare to make it two out of two

David Miller hit a brilliant fifty to help South Africa avoid a massive scare, securing a four-wicket victory over the Netherlands at Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, New York. In a tense T20 World Cup match, Miller's composed innings of 59 runs off 51 balls was pivotal in rescuing South Africa from a precarious position and steering them to triumph with two balls to spare. Chasing a modest target of 104, South Africa found themselves in deep trouble at 12 for 4, as the spectres of past collapses in Adelaide and Dharamsala loomed large.

The top order's early collapse evoked memories of those infamous past matches, but David Miller stepped up to banish those ghosts with a composed and unbeaten 59 off 51 balls. Supported by Tristan Stubbs, who contributed a crucial 33 off 37 deliveries, Miller orchestrated a vital 65-run partnership that pulled South Africa out of the abyss. The Netherlands, sensing a historic upset, fought back with two late wickets to reignite their hopes. However, their efforts fell short as South Africa, displaying newfound resilience, managed to cross the finish line, securing the win with a few overs to spare.

NED vs SA: HIGHLIGHTS

South Africa secured their second consecutive win in Group D, handing the Netherlands their first defeat after the Dutch team's victory over Nepal in Dallas. The Netherlands struck early in South Africa's innings, with Quinton de Kock run out on the first ball due to a mix-up. This led to a sudden collapse, as Reeza Hendricks was bowled and captain Aiden Markram was caught down the leg side, leaving South Africa reeling at 3-3. Heinrich Klaasen's dismissal in the fifth over put South Africa in a precarious position at 12-4. However, Tristan Stubbs and David Miller steadied the innings with a 65-run partnership. Despite Stubbs falling in the 17th over, Miller ensured South Africa reached the target with 27 runs still required for victory.

SA RESTRICT NED

South Africa's bowlers produced a brilliant performance to restrict the Netherlands to a modest 103 for nine wickets in their T20 World Cup Group D encounter at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium on Saturday. Ottniel Baartman was the star of the show, delivering a dazzling four-wicket bowling performance. Baartman finished with exceptional figures of 4-11 off his four overs, spearheading a South African bowling attack that never allowed the Dutch batsmen to settle. Supporting Baartman, Marco Jansen and Anrich Nortje each claimed two wickets, keeping the Netherlands on the back foot throughout their innings.

The match began disastrously for the Netherlands, with Jansen striking in the opening over. Michael Levitt was caught behind for a duck after a review confirmed the dismissal, setting the tone for the Dutch innings. South Africa's second wicket came swiftly as Max O'Dowd edged behind off Baartman, with Jansen taking a superb one-handed diving catch at first slip, leaving the Netherlands struggling at 15-2 after four overs. The situation worsened in the following over when Jansen uprooted Vikramjist Singh's stumps, reducing the Netherlands to 17-3. Bas de Leede's dismissal for six, caught off Nortje, compounded their woes as the ball rocketed up off the wicket.

South African skipper Aiden Markram's brilliant fielding resulted in a run-out of Scott Edwards for 10 in the 12th over. Just three balls later, Nortje struck again, with Teja Nidamanuru's leading edge landing in Heinrich Klaasen's hands at deep third man, making it 48-6. Despite a brief fightback from Sybrand Engelbrecht and Logan van Beek, who scored 40 and 23 respectively, Baartman returned to clean up the tail, reaffirming South Africa's control in the final overs.

South Africa will face Bangladesh on Monday, while the Netherlands will play against Bangladesh on Thursday.
