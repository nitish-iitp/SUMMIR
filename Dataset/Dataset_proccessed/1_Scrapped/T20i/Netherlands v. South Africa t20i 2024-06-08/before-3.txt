Summary

Eid al Adha is also referred to as Qurbani Eid as it follows the completion of the annual Hajj pilgrimage, one of Islam's five pillars, to Mecca in Saudi Arabia but while Hajj takes place from the 8th day to the 12th day of Dhul Hijjah, the festival of Eid al Adha (also known as Bakra Eid, Bakrid, Bakhreid, Eid al-Adha, Eid Qurban, Qurban Bayarami or the Feast of Sacrifice) falls on the 10th day of Dhul Hijjah, making it one of the most blessed days of the year for Muslims across the world but its date is decided only after the crescent moon sighting for the last month of Islamic lunar calendar - Dhul Hijjah/Zil Hajj. Hajj is the pilgrimage that every Muslim must make at least once in their lifetime if they are able but the Qurbani or sacrifice is carried out by all Muslims even if they are not performing Hajj, following the Eid prayers, which are performed in congregation in the morning.

Eid ul Adha 2024: What are the things that the one sacrificing should avoid in Dhul Hijjah 1445 AH?

The Sunnah indicates that the one who wants to offer a sacrifice must refrain from taking anything from his hair, nails or skin from the first day of Dhu’l-Hijjah until he offers his sacrifice, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you see the new moon of Dhu’l-Hijjah, if any one of you wants to offer a sacrifice, let him not remove anything from his hair or nails until he has offered his sacrifice.” If a person deliberately takes something (from his hair or nails), he must seek the forgiveness of Allah but he does not have to pay any fidyah (penalty) and his udhiyah is still valid. Whoever needs to remove some of his hair or nails because leaving it will cause him harm, such as a torn nail or a wound in a site covered by hair, should remove it and there is no sin on him if he does so.

Eid ul Adha 2024: Procedure of Dhul Hijjah 1445 AH moon sighting for determining date of Bakreid 2024

Traditionally, Muslim communities rely on eyewitness testimonies from reliable sources to confirm the sighting of the new moon where local religious authorities or committees often oversee the process and skilled observers are appointed to look for the crescent moon shortly after sunset on the 29th day of the preceding Islamic month. If the moon is sighted and confirmed by these individuals, the announcement of the onset of the month of Dhu al-Hijjah (the twelfth or last month of the Islamic or lunar calendar) is announced and simultaneously, the date of Eid-ul-Adha is declared.

However, if the moon is not sighted, the month of Dhul Hijjah is extended by a day and the moon sighting process is repeated on the following evening after maghrib prayers. In recent years, advancements in technology have facilitated the moon sighting process and many Muslims now use astronomical calculations and scientific data to predict the visibility of the moon accurately.

This approach combines traditional practices with scientific knowledge to determine the start of the Islamic month but it is important to note that different regions or communities may follow different methods and criteria for moon sighting. Some rely solely on local sightings while others consider global sightings or rely on official announcements from designated authorities however, the goal is to ensure the unity and consensus within the Muslim community regarding the start of important Islamic events such as Eid-ul-Adha.

Dhul Hijjah 1445 moon sighting: Will Eid ul Adha 2024 fall after Hajj 2024? Know facts and misconceptions

It is often assumed that Eid ul Adha falls a day after Hajj however, it is not true. Also, this has never been the norm followed by Muslims all over the world. After the first day of Dhul Hijjah is established, then the tenth day of that month is calculated hence, the date of Eid ul Adha is different for different places. On a more elaborate note, Hajj, the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, takes place from the 8th day to the 12th day of Dhul Hijjah where on 8th Dhul Hijjah (Yawm at-Tarwiyah), pilgrims begin their Hajj rituals; on 9th Dhul Hijjah (Yawm Arafat), the most significant day of Hajj, pilgrims gather on the plain of Arafat to pray and seek forgiveness while on the day of Eid ul Adha i.e. 10th Dhul Hijjah (Yawm an-Nahr), pilgrims perform the ritual of animal sacrifice (Qurbani) to commemorate the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to Allah. Allah provided a ram to sacrifice instead. Finally, Hajj ends on the 12th day of Dhul Hijjah.

Dhul Hijjah 1445 moon sighting date: When will Muslims in India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, Hong Kong, Sultanate of Brunei and other South Asian nations celebrate Eid ul Adha or Bakrid?

Muslims in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, Hong Kong, Sultanate of Brunei and other South Asian nations will gear up to sight the crescent moon of Dhul Hijjah on June 07, 2024, after the maghrib namaz or evening prayers. If the new moon is sighted tonight, Eid-ul-Adha in these countries will be celebrated on June 17, 2024 otherwise on June 18, 2024. This is because the beginning of the Islamic month of Dhu Al-Hijjah marks the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia and is followed by Eid Al Adha on the tenth day.
