NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe, the captain of the French national team, has confirmed that he will not be participating in the upcoming Paris Olympics.
"For the Olympics my club has a position which is very clear so that means I think I will not participate in the Olympics. That is how it is," Mbappe was quoted as saying by AFP on Sunday.

The men's Olympic football tournament is scheduled to begin on July 24 and conclude with the final on August 9. However, this timeline conflicts with the start of the Spanish football season, which is set to commence a week later.
Additionally, Real Madrid is scheduled to face Atalanta in the UEFA Super Cup in Warsaw on August 14, further complicating Mbappe's potential participation in the Olympics.
"Joining a new team in September would not be the best way to begin my adventure," admitted Mbappe, who had previously stated a wish to be able to play for Thierry Henry's French Olympic team.
