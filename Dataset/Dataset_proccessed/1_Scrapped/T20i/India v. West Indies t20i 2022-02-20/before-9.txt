So, after the ODI series, India clinches the T20I series! But can they do the clean sweep? We have to wait to find out. The final T20I will be played on 20th February at 7 pm IST (1:30 pm GMT). Do join us early for the build-up as well. Till then, Adios!

Rishabh Pant is the Player of the Match. He says as long as the team wants, he is happy to bat anywhere. About the drop catch, he says it was Bhuvneshwar Kumar's catch but it happens in the game. Tells that he just played with the situation and is practicing hard. Mentions he and Iyer were just telling to each other to keep it simple and play according to the ball. Says it is not easy to play every match but he is enjoying every time. Adds at the back of his mind, he was happy how Rovman Powell was smashing as he will play for Delhi in the Indian T20 League.

Rohit Sharma, the skipper of India says that they are always at scare whenever they play against West Indies, they knew it would be very tough and they were prepared. Mentions that Bhuvneshwar Kumar was fantastic, he was calm under pressure and experience did matter, and he did execute the plans well with the yorkers. States that Kohli's innings was very important and he hit the ball very well and took the pressure off him while batting. States that he is happy to see Venkatesh Iyer perform, he backs his skills and he is very confident as a player, they need such players in the side. Also, says that the fielding was sloppy, they could have been better in the field, but they will minimize these errors in the next game.

Kieron Pollard, the skipper of West Indies. He says Rovman Powell batted really well and the partnership between him and Pooran was good. He tells that they took the game till the end and is actually happy with the performance. Tells the start was not that bad with 40 runs and 9 wickets in the bank. Says they can see it from different angles. Adds they were slow in the first game and in the middle phase but they did well in this game.

Presentation coming up...

Bhuvneshwar Kumar is down for a chat. He says that he was believing in himself, and he backed himself with the yorkers. Mentions that Rovman Powell was hitting the ball really hard, but again they backed themselves and stuck to their plans. States that they did try a few slower balls, but he changed his plan not to ball slow to Powell. Informs that his body feels good!

With Rovman Powell and Nicholas Pooran out there hitting everything away, you feel it is an easy chase but sometimes you have to credit the opposition on how they played. The openers of West Indies fell after giving a decent start but it was then the Powell-Pooran show. They put up a 100-run partnership and looked like it is going their way but India's last three overs were top notch. It was all set up for West Indies to chase this down but the target was just too big in the end.

The pacers started well for India as there was swing but they didn't get any reward. The spinners then came into the action and got both the openers. The fielding kept India at the bay. Two catches were dropped and both went on to score half-centuries. Even the dew kicked in later in the innings and it needed something special from the bowlers. They were still in the game with 29 runs to defend in the last two overs. Bhuvneshwar Kumar bowled a splendid penultimate over and then Harshal Patel followed him with an outstanding one. Good job overall and Rohit Sharma will be a happy man.

Brilliant bowling from Harshal Patel, this game went till the very last over but Patel did very well, in the end, to defend 25 runs against Rovman Powell and Kieron Pollard. Meanwhile, Yuzvendra Chahal goes straight to Rovman Powell and checks his bat. You feel for him. He played so brilliantly but failed to take his team over the line. With this, India clinches the T20I series as well as they go 2-0 up. This is also India's 100th win in T20I history.
