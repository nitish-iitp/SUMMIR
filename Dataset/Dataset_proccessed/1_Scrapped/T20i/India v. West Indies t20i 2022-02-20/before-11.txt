Already having wrapped up the series, India would be heading to the 3rd T20I against West Indies with a lot of confidence and momentum, seeking to complete another clean sweep over the Caribbean side. The hosts have been clinical, to say the least in both the games played so far. In the first match, barring Nicholas Pooran and cameos from Kyle Mayers and Kieron Pollard, no batter got going and India eventually chased down the total, despite a small hiccup. In the second game played a day ago, the hosts batted first and posted an imposing 186/5 despite struggling to score early runs. West Indies responded well and despite knocks from Nicholas Pooran and Rovman Powell, India came out on top with an eight-run win, effectively sealing the series win ahead of the last match. Virat Kohli Given Bio-Bubble Break by BCCI, To Miss Third T20I Against West Indies

India are reportedly set to be without both their half-centurions from the 2nd T20I--Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant with the BCCI giving them a break from the bio-bubble. That opens up opportunities for Rohit Sharma to try out some players from the bench. In Kohli's absence. Shreyas Iyer is likely to come into the squad while Ishan Kishan is expected to don the wicketkeeper's gloves with Pant on a break. Also, there can be room for accomodating another batter or even a bowler, based on the team's requirements. Rishabh Pant Also Given Break, Wicketkeeper To Skip Third T20I Against West Indies, Sri Lanka T20Is

It is likely that there would be other changes with the captain and team management deciding to try out other players. The 3rd T20I might seem to be a dead rubber but it isn't. India would reportedly be the top-ranked T20I side if they manage to beat West Indies in the 3rd match.
