DC issued the strict 'Code of Conduct' guidelines for its players after one of their cricketers reportedly misbehaved with a woman at a franchise party.

The Delhi Capitals are going through a rough phase both on and off the field. They are languishing at the bottom of the IPL 2023 points table with just two wins in seven games and to top it all they have been marred with controversies one after the other even away from the field. A week or so after kits of their top cricketers went missing only to be recovered a couple of days later, it has now come to light that a DC cricketer reportedly misbehaved with a woman at a party prompting the franchise to come up with strict guidelines for all its squad members.

According to a report published in The Indian Express, DC issued the strict 'Code of Conduct' guidelines for its players after their win over Sunrisers Hyderabad on Monday. The incident of the player misbehaving with a woman happened a few days before that at a franchise party. The Code of Conduct, however, does not give out any details of the incident or mention anything about it. One of the major points of the guidelines is that the players won't be allowed to bring guests to their respective hotel rooms after 10 pm. They can entertain guests at the hotel common area or cafeteria.

The advisory also adds that a breach of any kind could lead to a fine and even a termination of the contract. The move is done to protect the franchise's image.

The report further adds that family members are allowed to travel with the respective player or a support staff member but if they want to bring them to the hotel room then they will have to take prior permission from the franchise.

After losing five matches on the trot, DC made a comeback by registering successive wins. They beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by defending their lowest total in the IPL. The Delhi franchise put up 144/9 in their 20 overs, before restricting the Sunrisers Hyderabad to 137/6.

Delhi Capitals needed to defend 13 runs in the final over and speedster Mukesh Kumar ensured that his team crossed the line by conceding just five runs. Speaking about his performance, the fast bowler said, "I always dreamt of winning a match for Delhi Capitals in the last over and that's what I tried to do. I wanted to make full use of the opportunity when I was told that I would bowl the last over. I held my nerve and focused on my target," as quoted by Delhi Capitals.
