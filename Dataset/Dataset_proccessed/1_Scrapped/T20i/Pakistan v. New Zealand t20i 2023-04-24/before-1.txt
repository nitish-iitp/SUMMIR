An incisive spell of fast bowling by rookie Kelvin Pitman jolted the more experienced members of Team Headley and enabled the West Indies Academy to record an easy win inside three days in the opening match of the Headley/Weekes Four-Day Tri-Series.

In just his first First-Class match, Pitman was introduced from the northern end and grabbed three wickets in a thrilling passage of play before lunch on the third day.

He retuned figures of 3-27 from seven overs as Team Headley were bowled out for 122 in the second innings. This left the Academy with an easy job to secure the victory and they reached the target of 59 for three wickets early in the third session.

Pitman started with the wicket of keeper Tevyn Walcott, who was brilliantly taken behind by Tevin Imlach and moments later castled first innings century-maker Joshua Da Silva with a brilliant full length delivery. He rounded off when he had left-hander Kieran Powell smartly taken behind by Imlach as Team Headley slipped to at 61-6.

Earlier the hard work was done by skipper Nyeem Young, who bagged 3-17 from 10 accurate overs of swing bowling. He had accounted for Darren Bravo on the second evening and on the third morning bowled both Kavem Hodge and Sunil Ambris.

Left-arm spinner Joshua Bishop (2-18) mopped up the tail, after Justin Greaves (30 not out) and Akeem Jordan (28) offered some resistance with the bat.

Young was one of five debutants at the First-Class level in his team and was understatedly delighted with the performances.

He said: “This was a very good performance. We played outstanding cricket in this match and earned this victory. Johann Layne bowled a great spell on the first day to get a five-for and Kevlon Anderson batted brilliantly to get his century yesterday (Thursday). Today, we came back and backed that up with some outstanding bowling. We also fielded well and caught well.”

In pursuit of victory the Academy lost early wickets and slipped to 13-2 in the fourth over. However, opener Keagan Simmons hit four polished boundaries as he ended on 31 not out off 57 balls. Off-spinner Chaim Holder took the three wickets for 22 runs off eight overs.

The next match will see West Indies Academy take on Team Weekes, starting next Wednesday from 10:00h.

All matches in the Headley Weekes Tri-Series will be streamed LIVE on the Windies Cricket YouTube channel with live scorecards and ball-by-ball scoring on the Windiescricket.com live match centre. (CW

Guyana Diaspora Forum

We have a large database of Guyanese worldwide.  Most of our readers are in the USA, Canada, and the UK.  Our Blog and Newsletter  would not only carry  articles and videos on Guyana, but also other articles on a wide range of subjects that may be of interest to our readers in over 200 countries, many of them non-Guyanese  We hope that you like our selections.

It is estimated that over one million Guyanese, when counting their dependents, live outside of Guyana.  This exceeds the population of Guyana, which is now about 750,000.  Many left early in the 50’s and 60’s while others went with the next wave in the 70’s and 80’s.  The latest wave left over the last 20 years. This outflow of Guyanese, therefore, covers some three generations. This outflow still continues today, where over 80 % of U.G. graduates now leave after graduating.  We hope this changes, and soon.

Guyanese, like most others, try to keep their culture and pass it on to their children and grandchildren.  The problem has been that many Guyanese have not looked back, or if they did it was only fleetingly.  This means that the younger generations and those who left at an early age know very little about Guyana since many have not visited the country.  Also, if they do get information about Guyana, it is usually negative and thus the cycle of non-interest is cultivated.

This Guyana Diaspora Online Forum , along with its monthly newsletter, aims at bringing Guyanese together to support positive news, increase travel and tourism in Guyana and, in general, foster the birth of a new Guyana, which has already begun notwithstanding the negative news that grabs the headlines.  As the editor and manager of the publication, I am committed to delivering Blog entries and Newsletters that are politically balanced, and focused on the positive ideas we wish to share and foster among Guyanese.
