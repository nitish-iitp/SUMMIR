India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: WI skipper on a historic win

Rovman Powell: It is difficult to put words. Even adjectives are difficult to be put here. There was a lot at stake. We sat down and had a meeting last evening. The people in caribbean were longing for something nice. Credit to the coaching side. We could have easily panicked after the loss. Our plans were good. I am very big on individual performances. If one can perform, the team will benefit. Credit to the bowling unit that they controlled this powerful batting line up from India. a lot of credit has to go to the fans. When the chips were down, they have supported us.

India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Indian captain mulls on the series loss

Hardik Pandya: We lost the momentum when I came in and couldn't capitalize on the momentum. I believe we gonna challenge ourselves. We try to get better. In hindsight, it is fine. We don't need to explain much. I know how the boys are within the group. We have enough time to figure out. Losing is good at times. On the positive side, we have done a lot of learnings. The boys showed character. Credit to them. They kept coming and tried something new. It is part of the process. It is what I feel at that moment. If I see a situation, I generally prefer something. No rocket science, just my gut feel. Every youngster who is coming in, is showing character. I can't be more happy when I see a youngster comes in and puts his hand up. A big thank you to everyone. The T20 World Cup would be here.

India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Player of the series

Okay so here's the thing, something that actually speaks a lot of the amount of cricket that's being played in the modern times. Nicholas Pooran is the player of the series but can't receive the award and have a chat as he has left the venue for a flight he has to catch.

00:47 (IST)
14 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Player of the match

Romario Shepherd: Makes me feel happy. We ended up on the winning side. Thanks to Pooran and team. From the ODIs to now, I have been bowling well. The best so far I feel. Especially, the plan was to take wickets. Means a lot to us. We have been through hard times in the last few months.

14 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: WI win

Yashasvi Jaiswal handed the ball in what is most likely the last over. It is as Brandon King smacks one straight down the ground for six. THE WEST INDIES HAVE WON THEIR FIRST BILATERAL T20I SERIES AGAINST INDIA SINCE 2016. A thoroughly deserving win on the day. 

00:30 (IST)
14 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: WI on the edge

Tilak Varma into his second over and the script is no different. King slaps one past cover point for four before slotting a tossed up delivery over long off for six. 160/2 and WI are on the precipice of a historic series win.

00:27 (IST)
14 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: King takes the aerial route

Chahal continues from the other end. Brandon King takes him to the cleaners. The first six is down over long on while the second is more squirer - a slog sweep over deep mid wicket. 16 runs come off the over, 148/2.

00:20 (IST)
14 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Hope keeps WI going

Axar Patel is brought in to bowl, for the first time in the game. Shai Hope with a thumping drive through covers for four. The Windies pull back momentum in their favor again following the break. Eight runs come off the over. 132/2 after 15 overs.

00:12 (IST)
14 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Varma nabs Pooran

Tilak Varma has been handed the ball. And right off his first delivery, Nicholas Pooran goes for a front foot press, but seems to have vacated his crease behind and Samson has taken the bails off to induce a stumping appeal. Umpire's go upstairs. The backfoot seems to have landed just in time and Pooran's safe. The southpaw goes for a reverse sweep off the next one and is caught at first slip by Hardik Pandya. India take the review after the first umpire denies the appeal. But Pooran has already walked away. Varma gets a maiden wicket in Indian colors. Five runs come from the over. WI, two down for 124.

00:09 (IST)
14 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Play resumes

Right then, light drizzle still going but the umpire signals for play time. Yuzvendra Chahal continues his over. Closes it with just the two runs off his three balls. 10 runs come from the over. 119/1 after 13 overs.

India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Fifty for King, play stopped again

Brandon King lofts Yuzi Chahal for a six over long off and that's a third maximum the Windies batters have got off the Indian leggie. Fifty up for King. And immediately after his celebrations, the umpires call for another stoppage with the showers coming back on. Covers are back on. As it stands, West Indies are ahead in terms of the DLS. 

23:27 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Kuldeep closes another good spell

He may not have been among the wickets today but Kuldeep Yadav has surely been a cut above the rest of Indian bowlers. His last over provides sufficient evidence. Just two come off it and even though Pooran-King have been at it against most of the opposition bowlers - including Kuldeep's long-time spin partner, Yuzi Chahal - they've avoided going after Kuldeep barring the odd punishable delivery. 4-0-18-0 is where the chinaman wraps his spell. WI, 109/1 after 12 overs.

23:20 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: 100 up!

It was after the drinks break in the Indian innings that WI had turned the screws in the first innings. No such opening available for the Indian bowlers to capitalise here. The batting side haven't put their foot off the pedal. Pooran on the get go as he slog sweeps Yuzi Chahal for a six off the first ball after the break. Another double-figure seize from an over. 11 runs come off it. 107/1 after 11.

23:13 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Drinks break

Mukesh Kumar has been brought in early, as opposed to his recent, solely death overs exploits. India do need him to deliver one of those run rate lowering spells here. Brandon King tries an uppish inside out shot and it falls safe. Gets it right off the last ball as he advances down the ground and slaps it wide of mid off for four. At the halfway stage, Windies are 96/1.

23:08 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Kuldeep persisted with, for good reason

Kuldeep Yadav continues his spell. Into his third over. And for a reason. He's the only Indian bowler who's kept the economy rate under 10. Good one that from the left-arm chinaman with just the five runs coming off it but the West Indies are well and truly on the front foot here. 86/1 after nine overs. 80 required off the last 11 overs.

23:02 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Pandya returns but to no avail

It's pouring down again as Hardik Pandya breaks the spin spell and comes on for his third over. Hasn't had the best of times out there with the ball (or with the bat) today and Brandon King notches up another boundary. A back of a length delivery from the Indian skipper and King cuts it down backward point for four. Another 10 run over for the Windies. 81/1 after eight overs.

22:59 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Pooran reverse slaps Kuldeep

If the first over was a mark of respect from the Windies batters against Kuldeep, the second embodified the liberal approach they've kept for most of the chase now. A tossed up delivery to start off the over is reverse slapped for four. India quickly losing the grip they'd gotten over this defence of 166 with that early wicket. 10 runs from that seventh over, WI are 71/1.

22:52 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Fifty up for WI

Chahal into the attack and gets slogged for a six straightaway. Brandon King on the offensive. Fifty up for WI. Goes length later in the over and King cuts him in front of square for four. 14 runs come from the over. 61/1 after six overs.

22:48 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Spin into the attack, Pooran survives lbw

Much to everyone's surprise, India have held back spin a lot longer. Even after West Indies' duo managed to nab three wickets in exchange of just 49 runs off eight overs. But in his first over, Kuldeep Yadav manages to not only manages to keep the Windies batters at bay but also induces a successful lbw appeal only to be overruled by the third umpire. 47/1 after five overs.

22:42 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: King goes after Arshdeep

The WI opener splits the gap between mid on and mid wicket to place the slower delivery outside off for a boundary. Next up is another knuckleball from the left armer which is full and is met with an even harsher treatment, a six over long on. West Indies, 44/1 after four overs and the rain has returned with a darker cover of the clouds above.

22:35 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Doubles sixes from Pooran

After Pooran smashed Arshdeep for a 6 in the last ball of the previous over, Pandya returns to bowl the 3rd over. Starts with back to back dots. King finally takes a single to go off strike. Ohhhh!! Pooran tries a pull, mishits and it just falls short of Mukesh Kumar. Connects the next ball and dispatches it for a monstrous six!!! He goes again!! And same result. Consecutive sixes to end the over. WI 31/1 after 3 overs

22:27 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Mayers gone!!!

Arshdeep singh in to bowl the second delivery and King takes a single off his first ball. And Singh strikes!! gets rid of Mayers again. Just like he did yesterday. Did not look in control of the shot, it goes straight up and Jaiswal with a dolly. WI 12/1 after 1.2 overs

22:24 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Excellent start from WI

Here come the players with Brendon King and Kyle Mayers to start for the hosts. Hardi, meanwhile, will be opening the attack. Starts with a dot as King defends. Brushes the second delivery to a fielder for a single. Mayers on strike and starts exactly like yesterday as he smashes the 3rd for a six!! Good comeback from the bowler as he beats Mayers twice off back to back balls. The last ball is edged and finds the gap for a four. WI 11/0 after 1 over

22:12 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Play resumes, end of innings

Right then, two balls to go. Axar Patel is caught by Romario Shepherd off the penultimate delivery and Holder gets the wicket. Mukesh Kumar the new batter in edges one behind the wicket for four. 16 come off the last over and India close the innings at 165/9.

22:00 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Rain stops play

Axar Patel has decided to go down the lone ranger route, not much option there. Four byes come behind the wicket for India before he manages to get the connection off a full toss. Sails over long off that one. Another shower and even though there's just the two balls left in close of the innings, the umpires reckon it's enough to hamper the wicket. 161/8 after 19.4 overs.

21:52 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Arshdeep and Kuldeep back in the hut

Well, hello Arshdeep Singh the batter. He's worked on his batting a bit during that county stint and it shows in that maximum he nails off Romario Shepherd in the penultimate over. Over long off. But his stay in the middle ends off the next ball as he misses a pull and the ball clips his off stump. 

Kuldeep Yadav is trapped plumb off the next one and India's long tail is being exposed in the closing stages of the innings. India eight down for 149 and Shepherd is on a hattrick. Yuzi Chahal will take strike for the decisive delivery. India, 149/8 with just one over to go.

21:48 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Holder removes Surya

Surya continues to hold the fort from one end. Another exquisite cover drive for four. Jason Holder angles the next one in, Surya misses the line and it hits him on the knee. Holder is down on both feet appealing for this one. Umpire says not out but the Windies have gone upstairs as there's no bat involved. Three reds for SKY and he's back on his way to the dressing room after a fine 61 off 45 deliveries.

India, six down for 141/6 after 18 overs.

21:40 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Skipper perishes after six

It's been a struggle for Hardik Pandya right from the start of this innings. Having managed to clear one over long off - his first boundary of the innings - off Shepherd, the Indian captain can only find Jason Holder off the next ball. Brings to an end his 18-ball-14. Axar Patel is the new batter in. Another good over for the Windies. 133/5 after 17.

21:37 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Play resumes

And we're back, less than five minutes after the stoppage. Joseph wraps up the over. Two runs come off that last ball. India, 123/4 after 16 overs.

21:23 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Fifty for Surya, rain halts play

Alzarri Joseph into his third over and the disaster that has been this game continues for him. A superb lofted shot over long off as Joseph misses the yorker length and gets punished with a maximum off his first delivery. A second fifty for Surya in the series. Meanwhile, a little shower passes by the venue, not much to be worried about though as it halts midway through the over. Indian skipper Hardik Pandya has found it hard to get into his groove so far and is given another lifeline by Joseph who drops him off his own bowling. And you can acuse us for this but the showers have returned and the umpires have signalled for the covers to be put on as the players vacate the ground. 

21:18 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Surya finds a boundary

Shepherd into his second over and SKY takes the aerial route. A juicy full toss, dispatched over mid wicket for six. India need him to go berserk in order to post a par total on this wicket. 10 runs come off the 15th over. 112/4, India.

21:13 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: 100 up

The spinners have turned the game (pun intended) around for the West Indies. Akeal Hosein wraps up his spell with a three-run over. And then, Chase gives away only five off his last. The duo have only given 49 runs off their eight overs and nabbed three wickets. 100 comes for India. 102/4 after 14 overs.

21:07 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Chase and Windies in control

A fantastic third over from Roston Chase. Just the five runs come from the 12th over and the Windies look to have made a comeback following that Surya-Tilak partnership. 94/4 after 12 overs.

20:57 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Samson departs!

Rovman Powell brings in a new bowler after the drinks break. Romario Shepherd comes in. Surya goes at him first ball but it falls just short of the Windies captain at long on. Wicket comes off the next ball: outside off with pace taken off, Samson nicks it behind and Pooran takes a good one-handed grab diving to his right. India, 89/4 after 11 overs. 

20:51 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: 10 overs gone

Chase with a loosener. Too full to Samson who lofts the low full toss wide for four as extra cover stands still and watches the ball go by to his left. 200 was the ideal total pitched ahead of the game, much in line with India's chase the other day. Surya's words on the stump mic earlier, "Accha hai wicket" supplement the same. Halfway through the innings, India are 86/3.

20:47 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Joseph leaks more boundaries, SKY survives being caught

Alzarri Joseph returns for a second over. Surya flexes a lip-smacking-good shot, in front of the square, as he gets a hold of a fuller delivery wide of off stump and reverts to it with a lofted cover drive for four. The ICC no. 1 T20I batter is almost caught later in the over off a similar shot but Kyle Mayers is unable to get to the miscued shot, much to the agony of Joseph. Meanwhile, Samson is offered width for his own as he cuts one behind backward point for four. 11 come off the over. India, 78/3 after nine.

20:41 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Chase changes the angle, nabs Varma

Roston Chase into his first over. And SKY takes the attack to him immediately. A bending-low slap shot down long on and Chase is furious with Holder's effort at the boundary or lack thereof. Goes round the wicket to crank in on the angle against Tilak Varma. Bowls a wide in the attempt. Varma misses on a slog.

Chase' one-handed catch off his own bowling is appealed by him, Powell and Pooran. The umpires go upstairs. AND LOOKS LIKE HE THE WINDIES HAVE GOT THEIR MAN, THE DANGEROUS IN-FORM SOUTHPAW. A wierdly light appeal that was from the Windies but they have a wicket nonetheless.

India, three down for 67 after eight overs.

20:35 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Tilak, the star in the making, building India's innings

Holder in for a second over. A change of ends for him. Surya picks him for what seems to be going all the way down the ground but Windies skipper Powell has managed to keep the ball in with a spectacular effort at the rope - saving five runs. Tilak Varma makes up for em'.

"Top notch, he really is a star in the making," goes Ian Bishop on-air as the leftie straight bats one down long off for six. Brilliant timing on that. 60/2 after seven.

20:30 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Tilak Varma takes off

India's leading run-scorer in the series, in his first series decider has had enough. Alzarri Joseph couldn't have had a worst start to his spell. Full and on the pads, Varma flicks it over mid wicket for four. Then, a fierce pull shot for six. Followed by a thick outside edge that runs down third man for four and another boundary down the region, this time by opening the face of the bat. Fifty comes up for India in what was the most expensive over of the series so far. 19 from it, 51/2 after six overs.

20:24 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: First maximum for India

No point in holding your cards, reckons Rovman Powell. Wicket taker for the Windies, Akeal Hosein comes in for a third over. The left-armer manages to negotiate just the two runs off his first five deliveries before SKY takes the initiative to send his final ball in the powerplay down the ground for a first six. 32/2 after five overs.

20:20 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: SKY finds his first four, Holder with a comeback

Jason Holder comes into the attack. Two wides to start, Surya finds his first boundary. Offered length and width outside off stump and the Indian number three crunches it through the off side for four. The all-rounder gets his length right after, also reducing the pace on the ball and keeps SKY cramped for space. Seven come off the over. 24/2 after four overs.

20:14 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Gill departs

Shubman Gill frees his arms and pulls Hosein through mid wicket for four. Looking to sweep the left-arm orthodox later, the Indian opener misses on the trajectory is deemed lbw. No reviews needed, thinks Gill, who walks off almost straightaway. India lose their second wicket, Akeal Hosein nabs both openers in his first spell. 17/2 after three overs.

OUCH! The broadcast ball-tracking shows that the ball was missing the leg stump. That review not being taken is going to hurt, indicated by the chatter inside the Indian dressing room as Gill walks back.

20:09 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Mayers with an early over

In a surprising move, Kyle Mayers has got the ball for the second over. Suryakumar Yadav is the new batter in. Expect fireworks from the number one T20I batter soon with Gill requiring more time to get into his groove and an early wicket lost in a crucial game. Four singles come off that over. 10/1 after two.

20:04 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: First runs, first wicket

First ball, and there's a huge shoutout for an lbw appeal. Jaiswal has taken a giant step outside the off stump but misses on the slog sweep altogether. The impact seems outside off stump as well as the Windies decide not to go upstairs. Next ball, Jaiswal goes for the switch hit and gets his first runs on the day. A four. A confident attacking display this from the youngster. Gill's punch is blocked in the point region but he has a single to his name.

AKEAL HOSEIN THOUGH, HAS FOUND A BREAKTHROUGH!

Jaiswal going for another big shot has managed to find the bowler and out comes the 'shut the noise' celebration. The southpaw walks back. India, 6/1.

20:00 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Off we go!

The low returns from Ishan Kishan in the first two T20Is meant India went with Yashasvi Jaiswal as Shubman Gill's partner for the third T20I. It wouldn't mean much as the India debutant would be sent back in the first over. In the fourth match however, Jaiswal combined alongside Gill to score his first T20I fifty (84*) and help India level the series 2-2. That means, the men in blue remain unchanged for the fifth match today and Gill and Jaiswal walk into the middle to kickstart India's innings. The Windies players have their final team huddle. Akeal Hosein has the new ball. Here we go!

19:55 (IST)
13 AUG 2023
India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Series decider time

Right then, it's barely gone by the way India would've thought. Five-match T20I series and we have to wait for the result of the fifth for our winner. West Indies have a chance to wrap up their first bilateral T20I series win since 2016, the year they last won the T20 World Cup. They've had the opportunity to do so over the past two games. India have spoiled that, can they prevent them from winning once again and close their tour of the Caribbean with wins across all three formats? It's showtime in Lauderhill!

Hardik Pandya: We will bat first. Always feel, we should challenge ourselves. It was a good track. It played better than last year. You need to be courageous on these type of wickets. Arsh has a big heart. Even if you can make a good comeback even in the last two balls, it makes a difference.

Rovman Powell: Happy to bowl first. We have been struggling a little. But back-to-back wins put a smile on the faces of our people. I think it is a good surface. You just need to have plans for different batters. We just sat down and tried to come up with our best combination. Joseph, our premier bowler is back for McCoy.

India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: "Kuldeep at his best in last five-six years"

Abhinav Mukund believes Kuldeep Yadav 'is doing the best he has in the past 5-6 years.' Speaking on JioCinema in the building to the game, the former India batter says, 'Earlier, he'd lose his grip and couldn't hold the ball well when he was being attacked (during IPL 2019). But now, even if he gets hit for a six, he can bowl that googly well. He has got that confidence now.'

India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Sunil Joshi on Kuldeep Yadav

“If you look at Kuldeep 2.0, his front arm is nice toward the target, his bowling arm is towards the target, he is running towards the target. Shorter stride, there is a free follow through, he has got quicker through the air. You look at the way he is bowling now,” Joshi had said to The Indian Express.

India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Yashasvi Jaiswal after the 4th T20I

It's not easy, I am happy to go out there and express myself. I would like to thank the support staff and Hardik bhai, they've shown faith. That shows so much impact on my mind. I try to play how team needs and how I can express myself towards the plan. I try to score quickly, how many shots I can play in the powerplay and put my team in a nice shape. Reading the wicket, reading the situation, how I can take the game deep everything is important. My intent is always to score runs. I have played a lot of balls against them (Holder and McCoy in the IPL), helped me to read them. It (partnership with Gill) was really amazing the way we were talking and the way we were taking singles and understanding each other. He batted really well. The way he was rotating the strike, it's really important to build the partnership. I want to thank everyone coming here and supporting us in this heat. Thank you so much.

India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Rovman Powell after the 4th T20I

It's a pretty good batting surface. We were maybe 10-15 runs short. Having said that, Hetmyer and Hope played well. There's quality bowling in our unit. We didn't stick to our plans, you'll always find under pressure against quality batters. From the start of the series, we always knew it's gonna come down to how we bat against spin. We didn't bat well in the middle overs. If we can improve against spin, then we'll do well. It's 2-2, both teams have played well to reach where they are. Tomorrow is the final and in a final, I'd back West Indies. I am feeling okay and ready to the lead the guys again tomorrow.

India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Hardik Pandya after the 4th T20I

There are more Indians here. The way they have been supporting, they've been coming in numbers, they make sure that we give them some entertainment. There is no doubt in their (Gill and Jaiswal) skill set. Going forward, we'll have to take responsibility as a batting group and help out our bowlers. Bowlers win matches. If they can get you a couple of wickets, you can control the game. Shubman and Yashasvi were brilliant. The way they ran in this heat ... and ... making sure they finished the job, it was very pleasing to see. I like to captain how I see the game. I like to go with my instincts. We lost two games but the first game, it was our own error, we were cruising quite well, we messed it up in the last four overs and didn't cross the line. We didn't do much different in the next two games. All these games gives us a lot of confidence. We had to pull up our socks and play good cricket, that's exactly what the boys did. In T20 cricket, no one's favourite. You have to turn up and play good cricket. You got to respect the opposition. They were 2-0 up because they played better cricket than us. Tomorrow we turn up and do exactly what we did today and hope for the best.

India vs West Indies 5th T20 Live Score: Arshdeep Singh on BCCI TV

“I read the conditions quickly and realised that it is pretty flat. I bowled slower ones on my hard length,” Arshdeep Singh told on BCCI TV

Arshdeep’s father Darshan Singh and elder brother Akashdeep Singh was in stands in the fourth T20I against West Indies.

“It was pre-planned,” said Arshdeep.

“Father is in Canada to play some tournament. So he tagged along with my brother and came to USA to watch me play.

“There was a bit of extra support. There was pressure also to perform well in front of them,” he added.

India vs West Indies: Kuldeep Yadav’s mastery with ball, Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal’s big partnership help India level series

If India are to do decently well in the middle overs at the upcoming World Cup as a bowling unit, it’s already clear that much would depend on Kuldeep Yadav. On flattish tracks, no one else is likely to take wickets against the run of play as him. There is Yuzvendra Chahal to an extent but he can’t be punted on to take wickets as consistently as Yadav.

It’s the nature of his bowling perhaps as left-arm wrist spin is still a rare commodity but he does have the batsmen a touch hesitant. More than others for sure on a bright sunny Florida day that promised a 210-plus total but Yadav pegged the West Indies to 178, a par score on this track. If there were any concerns about the chase, it was over pretty soon once Shubman Gill, who were out to three single-digit scores this series, joined the enterprising Yashasvi Jaiswal to take India home with three overs to spare.
