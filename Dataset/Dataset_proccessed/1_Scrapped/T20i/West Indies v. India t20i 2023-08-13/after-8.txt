Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal
NEW DELHI: Young batting sensation Yashasvi Jaiswal not just pummeled the West Indies bowlers to hand India a much-needed win in the fourth T20I at Lauderhill in Florida on Saturday, but the 21-year-old also shattered a long-time record held by compatriot Rohit Sharma.
Yashasvi, who scored an unbeaten 84 runs to give India a resounding 9-wicket win to level the series 2-2, went past Rohit in terms of scoring 75 plus runs in a T20I match, a record that stood for 13 years, 3 months, 6 days.

Rohit was 23 years and 7 days old when he scored an unbeaten 79 against Australia in Bridgetown in 2010.
Yashasvi, who hit 11 fours and smoked 3 sixes in his belligerent knock was 21 years 227 days old when the youngster crossed the 75-run mark.
Yashasvi's brilliant innings earned him the Man of the Match award, as he cracked an explosive 84 not out off 51 balls. He hit 11 boundaries and 3 sixes in his solid innings.
