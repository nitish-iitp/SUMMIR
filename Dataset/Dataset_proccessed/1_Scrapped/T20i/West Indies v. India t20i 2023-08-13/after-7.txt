Brandon King runs and Romario Shepherd wickets lead West Indies to series win over India in Florida
BYALEX LIVIE

UPDATED 13/08/2023 AT 20:14 GMT+1

The five-match T20 International series between West Indies and India boiled down to the final game, after India won games three and four to set up a decider in Florida. West Indies were on the back foot going into the game but they produced a brilliant run chase through Brandon King and Nicholas Pooran to secure the series in impressive fashion on Sunday.

West Indies won the fifth T20 International in Florida to secure a series victory over India.
India won the third and fourth contests to set up a decider, but their momentum was halted as West Indies raced to an eight-wicket win with 12 balls to spare for their first series win of any sort of two or more matches against India since 2016.

India won the toss and captain Hardik Pandya elected to bat, but they made a poor start and were only able to post 165 for 9 from their 20 overs.

West Indies went hard with the bat from the off, got ahead of the rate and cruised to their victory target for a notable series success.
Yashasvi Jaiswal made 84 the previous day to lead India to victory, but he lasted only four balls in the fifth match of the series as he was caught and bowled by Akeal Hosein.
Shubnam Gill and Jaiswal put on 165 for the first wicket in the previous game, but the former followed his opening partner back to the sheds for nine off nine balls after being trapped lbw by Hosein.

Tilak Varma took Alzarri Joseph for 19 in his first over, reinforcing his status as one of the rising stars of the game, but he departed for 27 off 18 balls to a brilliant caught and bowled from Roston Chase.
Suryakumar Yadav made 61 off 45 to hold the India innings together - and the final over went for 16 as India posted 165 for 9 - with Romario Shepherd the pick of the bowlers with 4 for 31 off his quartet of overs.
Kyle Mayers blasted 10 off five balls before falling to Arshdeep Singh for the second time in as many days, but Brandon King and Nicholas Pooran pressed on for West Indies.
King and Pooran were savage on anything loose, and circumspect against the spin threat of Kuldeep Yadav.
There were repeated interruptions for rain, and an extended spell off the field with 49 needed off 45 balls due to the threat of lightning.
Upon the resumption, Hardik turned to Tilak and he secured a wicket with his second ball in international cricket, Pooran (47 off 35) getting a thin edge on a reverse sweep and finding the India captain at slip.
India sniffed an opening, but it was snuffed out by King (85 off 55) who hit Tilak for back-to-back boundaries as West Indies sealed the win with 12 balls to spare - Shai Hope (22 off 13) lofting the winning ball for six to secure victory in style.
