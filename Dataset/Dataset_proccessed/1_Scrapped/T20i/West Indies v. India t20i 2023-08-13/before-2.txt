Bengaluru: Bhargav S and Gloria V Athavale will lead Karnataka’s challenge among men and women at the South Zone inter-state and individual badminton championships in Coimbatore from August 11-14.
However, National champions in men’s doubles, Prakash Raj S and S Kushal Raj, will not pair up following an injury to the latter. Prakash will take the court with Raghu Mariswamy instead.
In women’s doubles, Shikha Gautam and Ashwini Bhat will figure as the top duo.
Tushar Suveer, Ayush Shetty and Jade Anil top the heap in the boys and girls’ junior squads. Tushar’s doubles partner Nicholas Nathan Raj is not in the squad as he suffered cramps during the trials and pulled out to focus on rehab and training for the Hyderabad International and other tournaments. A good performance in Coimbatore will boost the teams’ prospects at the Junior Nationals, scheduled in Bengaluru from September 7-12.
The South Zone meet will begin with separate team championships for men, women and junior boys and girls, unlike the mixed team championships which was in vogue until last year.
