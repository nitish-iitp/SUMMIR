GCB accommodates fans for abandoned T20 match
August 3, 2021
The Guyana Cricket Board (GCB) has moved to compensate those fans who missed out on the cricket action on Sunday, owing to the game being washed out.
The GCB on Monday issued a missive that fans who bought tickets for Sunday’s game are now eligible to enter today’s game with those tickets.
A heavy downpour caused Sunday’s game between West Indies and Pakistan to be called off
The missive reads: “The Guyana Cricket Board wishes to inform the public that tickets purchased for the cricket match on Sunday, August 1,2021, West Indies v Pakistan will be accepted for entry into the Guyana National Stadium, Providence, for the WI v Pakistan T20 match on Tuesday, August 3, 2021.
In this regard, patrons will be accommodated in the orange stand.
Fans are asked to note that cricket tickets and car passes will be sold at Guyana National Stadium, Tuesday, August 3, 2021, and at the GCB office on Regent Road, Bourda.”
