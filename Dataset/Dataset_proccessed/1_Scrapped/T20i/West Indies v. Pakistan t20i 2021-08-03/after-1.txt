Fourth T20 abandoned; Pakistan win series 1-0

Only three overs were possible in the fourth and final T20 International between West Indies and Pakistan at the Guyana National Stadium, Providence, on Tuesday.

Persistent rainfall forced the players and officials off the field early, and following an inspection at 13:25h, play was set to resume at 14:00h with a nine-over-a-side contest.

However, the drizzles came back just minutes before the restart, forcing officials to put to halt to proceedings.

The outcome means Pakistan have won the four-match series 1-0 by winning game two by seven runs after posting 157-8.

The opening game in Barbados on July 28 was called off after just nine overs owing to rain, while the third match was also severely affected by the weather, with just 1.2 overs possible on Sunday last.

The two sides now switch focus to a two-match Test series in Jamaica, with those games starting August 12 and 20.
