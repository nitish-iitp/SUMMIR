Maradona's WC Golden Ball Trophy To Be Auctioned In Paris

Diego Maradona's Golden Ball trophy from the 1986 World Cup has resurfaced. The award, which had been missing for decades, will be auctioned in Paris next month, the Aguttes house said.

Maradona, who died in 2020 at age 60, was awarded the trophy for his scintillating play at the tournament, where he captained Argentina in its 3-2 win over West Germany in the final in Mexico City. Before that, he scored the controversial “Hand of God” goal and the “Goal of the Century" in a 2-1 win over England in the quarterfinals. (AP)

IPL: Samson Fined 30 Percent Match Fees

The Rajasthan Royals captain Sanju Samson has been fined 30 percent of his match fees for breaching the IPL Code of Conduct in the 20-run loss match against Delhi Capitals. The offence committed by Samson, who made 86 during RR's unsuccessful run chase of 222 was not specified but most probably it is due to arguing with the umpires when he was given out after Shai Hope took a catch just near the boundary ropes in the 16th over.

Paris Olympics: The Torch Is Arriving!

Paris Games organizers have promised “fantastic" celebrations as the arrival of a majestic ship carrying the Olympic torch from Greece is expected to draw a huge crowd Wednesday in the southern French city Marseille, where the Old Port has been placed under high security.

Paris 2024 Olympics Organizing Committee President Tony Estanguet expressed his emotion at the torch's arrival in France.

"The return of the Games to our country will be a fantastic celebration," he said.

The torch was lit in Greece last month before it was officially handed to France. It left Athens aboard a three-mast ship named Belem, which was first used in 1896, and spent twelve days at sea. (PTI)
