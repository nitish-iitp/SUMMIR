LKN vs KKR Dream11 Pitch Report of Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow

Surface Nature – Batting Surface  

Average Score – 160 Runs

Fast vs Spin on Venue (Last 10 matches)

Fast Bowler (66 Wkt) = 62%
Spin Bowler (41 Wkt) = 38%

The Lucknow surface exhibits a slightly two-paced nature, making high scores the exception rather than the norm. In the last game, 289 runs were scored, leading us to anticipate a first-inning par total not exceeding 160-165.

LKN vs KKR Dream11 Fantasy Cricket Expert Tips: 

KL Rahul, Marcus Stoinis, and Nicholas Pooran are the key batsmen for the Lucknow Super Giants. Our top batting picks for the Kolkata Knight Riders are Philip Salt, Sunil Narine, and Shreyas Iyer.

We suggest Mohsin Khan, Naveen ul Haq, and Mayank Yadav for the Lucknow Super Giants’ bowling. At the same time, Sunil Narine, Vaibhav Arora, and Varun Chakravarthy are our top choices for the Kolkata Knight Riders.

Having a maximum number of Kolkata Knight Riders, Batters, and bowlers on your fantasy team is good, as this will help you score more fantasy points. 

If you consider Marcus Stoinis a captain or vice-captain in your fantasy team, he will be the X-factor. That will be the game-changer move.
