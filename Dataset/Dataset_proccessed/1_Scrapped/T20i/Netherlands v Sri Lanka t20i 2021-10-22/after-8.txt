EAGLES SOAR IN DUBAI

 Julia Heita  22 October 2021

By: Dwight Links

Namibia won their second match of the T20 World Cup against the Netherlands. The Eagles won by six wickets as they scored 166 for four wickets from their 20 overs. The Netherlands scored 164 for four from their innings.

The match at the Sheik Zayed stadium was a test of strength for the Eagles, who lost their first match against the powerhouse Sri Lankan team by seven wickets on Monday.

David Wiese was named Man of the Match for his statistics of 1 wicket for 32 runs from his four overs, while he scored 66 runs not out from 40 balls faced for Namibia.

Namibia’s captain Erasmus said this is a special moment for the country as their first win at an international platform.

“The Dutch have had the better of us for a couple of years. And we stepped up on the day,” Erasmus said.

The captain was proud of his bowlers as he noted that the pitch was ideal for the match.

“I think both sides could not capitalise on the opportunities that the field presented during today’s match,” Erasmus added.

Namibia began their chase on a nervy start when the opening partnership of Stephan Baard (19 from 20 balls) and Zane Green (15 from 12 balls) both fell from the Dutch bowlers and fielding defence.

Green fell first in the fifth over bowled by Fred Klaassen, while Baard lost his wicket in the eighth over to Pieter Seelaar, with Namibia 47 for two wickets by the tenth over.

Craig Williams put in a brave performance as third batsmen when Colin Ackermann bowled him.

Captain Erasmus and David Wiese then partnered up to stable the Namibian batting order that saw them amass a combined runs total of 98 runs before Erasmus fell when Scott Edwards caught him off the bowling of Timm van der Gugten.

Wiese then partnered up with Johannes Jonathan Smit to finish the chase for the Eagles with 166 for four wickets, a successful chase of the Dutch total.

Wiese said that the conditions were very challenging in the Dubai afternoon heat and humidity.

“It’s a big win for the opportunity that Namibia gave me after selecting me to play for the country,” Wiese said.

Namibia won the toss and decided to field first, with the Dutch opening partnership of Max O’Dowd and Stephan Myburgh. The former scored 70 runs off 56 balls who Namibian skipper Gerhard Erasmus ran out.

The Dutch reached a total of 164 after completing their 20 overs through 12 fours and three sixes. Namibia committed 13 extras during the innings to stifle the Dutch scoring.

The Eagles performance was strong after the fall of Baard’s wicket in the ninth over when Erasmus and Wiese partnered that saw Namibia record 19 fours and six sixes in their run chase to 166 for four wickets, ending in over 19.

Namibia faces Ireland on Friday 22 October. The Irish beat the Dutch in their first match and face Sri Lanka later today.
