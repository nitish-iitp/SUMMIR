Australia finished off their tour of Pakistan in style as captain Aaron Finch's half-century helped them chase 163 to beat the hosts in the one-off T20 International (T20I) in Lahore on Tuesday. Babar Azam scored 66 off 46 deliveries, while leg-spinner Usman Qadir finished strong with an unbeaten knock of 18 off just six deliveries to help Pakistan post 162/8 in 20 overs. Australia pacer Nathan Ellis starred with the ball as he went on to pick four wickets. Finch then scored 55 off 45 to anchor the chase, while Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Marcus Stoinis and Ben McDermott also chipped in with useful contributions. Shaheen Afridi, Qadir and Mohammad Wasim all picked two wickets for Pakistan, but the visitors managed to chase the target down with five deliveries to spare to register a three-wicket win. (SCORECARD)
