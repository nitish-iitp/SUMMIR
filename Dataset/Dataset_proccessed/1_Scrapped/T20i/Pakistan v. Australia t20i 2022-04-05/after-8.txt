Watch: Babar Azam smashed a glorious six over extra cover during the one-off T20I between Pakistan and Australia.

The penultimate ball of the sixth over of the Pakistan innings, bowled by Ben Dwarshuis, was sent for a classy maximum by Babar, who went on to smash his 26th T20I fifty against Australia. Dwarshuis bowled a fuller delivery, which saw Babar back away to the leg-side before thumping an inside-out extra cover drive for a big six.

Babar hit another maximum in his knock of 66 of 46 balls, which helped Pakistan score 162-8 after being sent in to bat by Australia. No other player from the side could score more than 25 runs in the innings.
