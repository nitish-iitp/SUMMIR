The 85th Annual Mount Lavinia Two Mile Sea Swim Championships 2024 will be held on the 15th and 16th of March 2024 at Mount Lavinia. It has been organised by the Sri Lanka Aquatic Sports Union in collaboration with Mount Lavinia Hotel for the past 85 years. The press conference of the 85th Annual Two-Mile Sea Swim was held yesterday, 13th of March, at the Mount Lavinia Hot.

This sea swim championship runs under four categories: junior girls & boys (under 15) and open women and men.

The junior and the open women’s events will be held on the 15th of March, and the open men’s event will be on the 16th.

The swimmers are given a cut-off time of 90 minutes to complete the race. However, only those who complete the course within 70 minutes for men and 75 minutes for women will receive points. All swimmers who complete the course within 90 minutes will receive certificates.
