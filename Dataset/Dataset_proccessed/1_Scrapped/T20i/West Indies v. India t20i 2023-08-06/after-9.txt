IND vs WI Live Score: Sanju, Surya eye comeback after dry spell

India will hope for a much improved show with the bat. Surykumar Yadav's bat has remained quiet so far in the tour, managing run a ball 21 in the first T20I. He would look to get his bat talking soon irrespective of the format and present a case for himself for the upcoming ODI World Cup.

The same applies for Sanju Samson, who had scored a half-century in the third and final ODI, which India won by 200 runs.

IND vs WI Live Score: A look at Windies squad

West Indies may have declined in the Tests and ODIs, but they still pose a great threat when it comes to the shorter format. The team boast of some of the best T20 specialists, which include Nicholas Pooran, Kyle Mayers, Shimron Hetmyer, Rovman Powell, Romario Shepherd.

Meanwhile, India have fielded a very inexperienced unit, which provides a good testing ground for the newcomers, who have been elevated to the international stage after a splendid IPL.

IND vs WI Live Score: Yashasvi or Ishan?

As Ishan Kishan has been on the run since the Test series, the think tank might consider giving him some rest as they also have Sanju Samson as a wicketkeeping option.

If that is the case Yashasvi Jaiswal can come at the top and open the innings with Shubman Gill.

IND vs WI Live Score: Focus on future

The five-match T20 series provides India with a good window to check out the promising talents, who have been elevated to the national squad on the basis of their IPL performances. 

With an eye on the future, in particular the 2024 T20 World Cup, the selectors are backing a young unit. All the T20I series, which have been played post the World Cup last year, didn't feature senior pros Rohit Sharma or Virat Kohli in the squad. Hardik Pandya has mostly led the team and Jasprit Bumrah, who is making a comeback after a serious injury, will lead the side in the upcoming series against Ireland.

IND vs WI Live Score: What happened in the previous encounter

Batting first West Indies scored 149/6 in 20 overs. Nicholas Pooran and skipper Rovman Powell, who are returning to international duties, scored 41(34) and 48(32) respectively. 

In response, the opening pair of Shubman Gill and Ishan Kishan fell cheaply. Debutant Tilak Varma showed some intent but at the end India could only manage 145/9 in their 20 overs, losing the contest by four runs.
