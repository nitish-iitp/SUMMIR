Following a successful bilateral series in the previous inaugural edition, the Women’s Continental Cup is back for its second edition. This time, the tournament promises to be even bigger and better, featuring four teams competing in eight games over the course of three action-packed days.

The 3-match bilateral series last year was played between hosts Romania and Malta, and the visitors secured a series win with three straight dominant wins. Romania will once again be the hosts for the 2nd edition, and they will be joined by defending champions Malta, Greece, and the Isle of Man in the forthcoming edition scheduled to be played from the 4th to the 6th of August.

Romania and Greece last clashed in a T20I during the Women’s Balkan Cup in September 2022, with Greece emerging victorious in a one-sided final. The Isle of Man enters the competition on the back of a clean sweep series win over Austria, played on the 30th and 31st of July 2023. On the other hand, Malta hasn’t played a T20I since the inaugural Women’s Continental Cup in August 2022.

Format: Women’s Continental Cup 2023

The tournament will feature a round-robin format, with each team set to play against all the others once. In the Final, the top-seeded team will face off against the winner of the 3rd place playoff game.
