Telugu Industry

The Highest Gross in TN was ₹216 Crore for PS1

The Highest Gross in AP/TG was RRR with almost ₹400 Crore

Almost Double

AP/TG has now a huge market potential in the last few years post Baahubali as the Theatres now have massive crowds

In the last few years, Post Covid the AP/TG market has grown massively and leads the TN market

Plus the content is also becoming very good with Hero worship slowly being chipped down in favor of Brahmaandam and Content oriented films

Today I would say Tollywood is probably second to Bollywood

Globally too, now Tollywood has larger markets in USA , ro

Is there a secret to auto insurance that will save money?

I once met a man who drove a modest Toyota Corolla, wore beat-up sneakers, and looked like he’d lived the same way for decades. But what really caught my attention was when he casually mentioned he was retired at 45 with more money than he could ever spend. I couldn’t help but ask, “How did you do it?”

He smiled and said, “The secret to saving money is knowing where to look for the waste—and car insurance is one of the easiest places to start.”

He then walked me through a few strategies that I’d never thought of before. Here’s what I learned:

1. Make insurance companies fight for your business

The comparison between the Tamil and Telugu film industries, often referred to as Kollywood and Tollywood respectively, involves several factors, including box office performance, cultural impact, and global reach. Here’s a breakdown of both:

Tamil Film Industry (Kollywood)

Size and Output: Tamil cinema has a long history, with a vast number of films produced annually. It is known for its diverse genres, strong storytelling, and music.
Cultural Impact: Tamil films often reflect the socio-political landscape of Tamil Nadu and have a dedicated fan base not just in India but also among the Tamil dia

Tamil industry is bigger. Not sure who is better. I guess it depends on the director and not the industry.

In 2022 Tamil contributed 38% ( ₹2,950 crore ) of revenue to the southern region.

Telugu contributed 32% (₹2,500 crore) of revenue to the southern region despite RRR alone contributing around 15% ( 1,200 crore ).

Kannada contributed 20% (₹1,570 crore) most of it due to KGF 2 and Kantara.

Malayalam contributed 10% (₹816 crore).

Telugu and Kannada had a spike in their revenue due to the pan-india hits and need to have such major blockbusters every year to maintain similar revenue every year.

Personally I think telugu movies are much better especially in the last 15 years and from 1985 to around 1996 so it is the opposite of what the question is.

Ram gopal varma is the one director who changed the entire movie making process/style/thought process in indian film industry— game changer with Siva

Rajamouli changed the entire commercial reach for movies ( and by far the most successful indian director).

Trivikram — Probably the only director in entire indian history who has multiple movies that can be watched again and again even after 15 years ( most directors will have 2–3 movies atmost

Its Telugu film industry that is superior in terms of quality action, Entertainment and realistic stories(that are close to human being real nature).

1 If you see old movies with NTR and ANR as main casting, you will definitely say those films are very close human mind and nature compared unrealistic acting of MJR and Shivaji in tamil. That is the reason why NTR was elected as evergreen No1 actor in india for 100 years of indian cinema in CNN IBN survey.

2. Take director K Vishwanath films, you will always find a classical and poetical way of representing a social message. films with Chiranjeevi

I’ve tried a handful of tools—Jira, Asana, Trello, and Monday—and while they all excel in specific areas, ClickUp has been the everything app for managing projects end-to-end.

This question has two parts -

which industry is bigger ?
Which one is better ?

Let us analyse it individually ,

But before answering let’s be clear that both industries are thriving and both are competing with even Bollywood, Not to mention Kannada movie industry where KGF 1&2 shattered entire Indian industry, Kannada film like kantara even echoed the Indian spirituality and became a masterpiece.

Malayalam film industry- I would say it’s equivalent to Korean industry of south india - with most movies gives a novel like sense , movies like pre mam , Hridayam , court room drama like Jana gana mana ,

Which film industry is dominating south India Tamil or Telugu?

Interesting question and it has many answers depending on which side of the fence you are. For Telugu speaking people, their movies are bigger and for Tamil speaking people it is their’s. Going by the statistics of box office collections, and excluding Baahubali here (since it is a one off case), one would lead to believe that Tamil movies are bigger, because their big movies have raked in bigger moolah at the box office. Be it be Enthiran or Shivaji or Viswaroopam. But, it needs a more indepth analysis into these numbers and then you will get the true picture.

The big Tamil movies are invariab

When you say which film industry is bigger, lots of factors has to be taken into consideration.

Reach : Telugu speakers are more than tamil speakers not just in india but even considering the numbers in the world.

Craze : Many times stars from other industries have openly acknowledged the film craze in telugu people and that people dont mind watching numerous times when they like a movie. even if a movie is not good, people go to watch why the movie wasn’t good.

Theatres : The number of theatres in the telugu states is almost double the number of theatres in TN.

Studios : Since the past 10–15 yrs,

Tamil film industry or Telugu film industry?

In terms of different movie's, talent - Tamil film industry would be first.(not that Telugu film industry is lack of talent)

Why?

Now, when you watch both Tamil and Telugu movies , you would easily understand that,or by seeing the remake's that the Telugu film industry is making these days.

Nothing wrong though , but it shows the lack of talent or should i just say that talent is not much encouraged here.Telugu film industry's main target would be a success. They want a hit movie for which they want big heroes, big budget, sad that they

Which film industry is dominating in South India, Tamil or Telugu?

There is actually no domination in South Indian film industry. I'm Tamil and I really admire the movies produced by the Malayalam film industry.

Based on popularity and high budget movies Tamil and Telugu stands neck to neck. Both the industries have a huge box office collections.

When it comes to quality of the script and acting, Malayalam wins the race. Malayalam industry produce more and more good movies with innovative story lines and with some finest acting performances.

It actually depends on the taste of the individual towards movies. I hate commercial potboilers and hero-centric masala fi

Posting my previous answer for similar question.

I want to say in simple manner , I don't want to dig olden days ,I want to say what's happening right now .

Tollywood:

1. Family background cine industry,they don't have artists (Now a days heroes are not at all artists) except Vijay Devarakonda.

2.Technicians, supporting characters (Except lead male actor, directors,lyticist),most of the times music Composers working in Telugu cinemas mostly Tamilians.

3. Mostly we can see Drama, Action,Masala ,RomCom,Comedy genres. So they don't want to show audiences the other side of movie making.

4. Very few movi

Which film industry is dominating in South India: Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam?

Here are multiple aspects of South Indian film industry and let's see which film industry dominates in each aspect.

Popularity:

Telugu and Tamil are most popular among the four. Many of the movies are either dubbed or remade into other languages. Collections are also a good example for popularity

Malayalam movies post premam era have gained a lot of viewership but will only fall next to Tamil and Telugu in the list.

Kannada movies are indirectly popular . Some of them are remade into other languages.

This aspect should not be viewed seriously because popularity is not the measure of greatness and i

Which film industry is dominating south India Tamil or Telugu?

I believe, you are asking, which is bigger w.r.t revenues.

Right Now - (Probably) Tamil.

There was a time, Telugu Film Industry was much bigger than the Tamil Film Industry - but that was a decade (and a half) ago.

In fact, it is believed that Tamil Nadu Government has placed a tax of 15% on Non-Tamil Films while collecting no tax from Tamil Films (which was then cham to only movies with Tamil Titles in 2006) - to protect the Tamil Industry from the influx of Telugu Movies.

From then (post 90s) - Quality of Telugu Movies went down & Tamil Industry started expanding its market.
