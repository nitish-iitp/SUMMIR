Retired High Court judge Kusala Sarojini Weerawardena (right) presents the football probe Report to Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe

Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe claims there is enough evidence to show that millions of rupees in funds belonging to the Football Federation of Sri Lanka have been mismanaged and squandered.

He made the remarks after receiving the Report following a probe into the activities of the Football Federation of Sri Lanka last Tuesday.

The Committee that compiled the Report was headed by retired High Court Judge Kusala Sarojini Weerawardena and the other members were Kingsley Fernando, retired DIG Sudath Nagahamulla, retired Rear Admiral Ananda Peiris and former football player Susil Rohana.

Minister Ranasinghe said the Report has shown many shortcomings regarding Constitutional matters as well as financial mismanagement running into millions of rupees that were not used for the benefit of the sport.

According to the Committee findings most of the financial mismanagement had taken place after 2018 which has been the worst period.

“We are unable to disclose any names at present as we have to forward the Report to the Attorney General for his advice and appropriate legal action.

“The names of those involved will then be disclosed and legal action will be taken against them as early as possible so we can look to FIFA the world governing body of the sport to have the ban on us lifted.

“We had to go through all this because of the ban imposed by FIFA,” said Minister Ranasinghe.

He also said that officials who held office during the period that was investigated by the Special Committee will not be able to contest any position or hold any other position connected to the Sri Lanka Football Federation in the future.
