Earlier in the innings, Ireland got off to a quick start, thanks to Ross Adair, but they kept losing wicket at regular intervals once he slipped out, which kept breaking their flow. Curtis Campher’s 49 gave them some boost, but the same story repeated in the death, when the wickets kept tumbling. Patrick Kruger stood out with the ball earlier with his four wicket haul.

Ireland, desperate for a breakthrough, found hope when Craig Young delivered a top ball to dismiss Hendricks. Soon after, Mark Adair struck, sending the well-set Rickelton back to the pavilion, giving Irish fans a glimmer of hope with both openers gone in quick succession. However, any chance of a comeback was swiftly extinguished as Aiden Markram and Matthew Breetzke comfortably guided their side home with 14 balls to spare. The dew proved to be a major setback for Ireland’s defense, making it difficult to contain the chase.

South Africa were off to a flier. Ryan Rickelton and Reeza Hendricks set the tone early, launching an aggressive assault during the Powerplay that left Ireland on the back foot. Rickelton, the primary aggressor, recorded a brilliant half-century, while Hendricks provided steady support. By the halfway mark, the pair had taken their team to a commanding 97 for no loss, with Rickelton on 56 and Hendricks on 34, making it a one-sided affair in the first half of the chase.
