After clean sweeping New Zealand 3-0 in the one-day international series, team India now faces the Kiwis in a three-match T20I series beginning Friday, January 27, 2023, at the JSCA International Stadium Complex in Ranchi. The second and the third matches will be played on February 29 and February 1 in Lucknow and Ahmedabad respectively.

Speaking about the 50-overs series, young opening batter Shubman Gill was at his best as he racked up a staggering 360 runs in three games, equaling Babar Azam’s record for most runs in a three-match bilateral series. Gill struck a double century and a century to clinch the Player of the Series award. In terms of wickets, seamer Shardul Thakur and spinner Kuldeep Yadav picked up the joint-most wickets (six).

The action now moves to the shortest format with India looking to continue their sheer domination on home soil while the Black Caps would hope to win their first game of the tour by sealing the opening encounter in Ranchi. In an ODI World Cup year, the T20Is mean little but it presents another opportunity for the hosts to extend their home record while for the Kiwis, another chance to get used to the sub-continent wickets and prepare well for the marquee event (ODI World Cup) slated to be held later this year in India. 

IND vs NZ: T20I Head-to-Head Records

Talking about the Head-to-Head records, both sides have met each other in 22 T20 internationals so far with the Men in Blue winning on 12 occasions and the BlackCaps on nine. One game ended up in a tie. In India, both have clashed eight times with the home side winning five and New Zealand three.

IND vs NZ: T20I Record and Stats at JSCA International Stadium Complex, Ranchi

The spin bowlers might play a key and crucial role on the 22 yards in Ranchi. It’s a relatively big stadium and the surface also offers the spinners grip and turn. Sides bowling first have won two out of the three T20Is played at the venue.

India has played three matches and won all of them. The last game here was also played out between India and New Zealand back in 2021 when the hosts sealed the deal by a margin of seven wickets.
