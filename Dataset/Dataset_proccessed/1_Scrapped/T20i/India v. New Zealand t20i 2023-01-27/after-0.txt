India vs New Zealand Live Cricket Score:

India vs New Zealand 1st T20 Highlights: India needed a big partnership between captain Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav after New Zealand tore their top three apart within the first four overs. The pair put up 68 runs off 51 balls and seemed to have made a platform for India to challenge from. However, Suryakumar first fell just before reaching his half century and Pandya then fell in the next over. India crumbled after that and were restricted to a score of 155/9.

India vs New Zealand 1st T20I Live: New Zealand beat India by 21 runs

India are 155/9 after 20 overs. India's batting has failed quite miserably but the fact remains, if New Zealand had not smashed those 27 runs in the last over, this match would have been a nail biter. The Kiwi bowlers, led by Mitchell Santner (2/11) and Michael Bracewell (2/31), spun a web around the home batters, restrict India to 155 for 9 in 20 overs.

Mavi has been run out at the non-striker's end, Santner, of course, is the man who hits the stumps on the move. The New Zealand captain has made absolutely no mistakes today in the field or with the ball.

That should be the match. Hooda had no choice but to go after Santner, comes forward but Santner pulls his length back and the Santner takes it past the batter. Easy stumping for Conway.

IND vs NZ Live score: Dropped!

Some luck for India. Sundar gets a top edge and the ball goes up behind him. Conway and Sodhi running for it, the former pulls out but Sodhi has too much to do. He puts in the dive but cannot get it to stick.  

Jan 27, 2023 9:51 PM IST
India vs New Zealand Live Cricket Score: OUT! It's the captain!

Pandya with a big heave off Bracewell, it takes a top edge and goes many a mile high up in the air. Bracewell claims it, positions himself well and takes the catch. 

Pandya c & b Bracewell 21 (20), India 89/5 in 12.2 overs
