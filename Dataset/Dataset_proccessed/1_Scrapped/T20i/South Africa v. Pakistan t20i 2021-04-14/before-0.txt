This is what Rashid Khan does in T20 leagues - Qalandars very lucky to have him - just needs support from other bowlers.

Took the wicket of Roy when it seemed he would demolish LQ bowling.

Look at him in the field today - diving around, trying to save every single run for his team.

Yet some of our guys cannot be bother to even dive and couldn't care less about their fielding.

Inspirational cricketer!

Shoaib Malik needs to learn from Rashid Khan.

Rashid also plays in many T20 leagues around the world. And he does so with the same enthusiasm, every time. You never get the impression that he's around to collect a paycheque only.

Great cricketer Rashid is but credit also needs to be given to the Lahore Qalandars management, David Wiese and Captain for creating a environment where all their players are giving their 100%. Players like Rashid Khan have mentioned that the environment is exceptional.

His team easily winning the match against MS but he's still diving around in the field as if his life depended on it.

looks like he enjoys playing for lahore, could easily forego this tournament and it wouldn't make a dent to his career or earnings, but he legit looks like hes having a great time.

i was hoping the psl could help batters work him out a bit better, but looks like hell be tormenting pak whenever they play afg again.

Do England meet Afghanistan in the world cup? Rashid Khan can have his revenge on Indian wickets. So many FTBs cashed in, in the 2019 world cup. Real test will be in this world cup.

Rashid Khan was very ineffective today against Bangladesh while defending a target of 156 in their ICC World Cup 2023 Opener. In his 9 overs, he gave away 48 runs and took no wickets. Considering the score to defend, I will say that it was expensive as Rashid is a world-class bowler and Afghanistan expected more from him today.

Nasser Hussain on comms, talking about how a large chunk of Rashid's deliveries target the stumps (or just about). And if a batsman misses it, he'll get out. Just does the basics so well.

Rashid pulls out of BBL 13 for back surgery

A massive blow for the Adelaide Strikers with Afghanistan leg-spin whiz Rashid Khan to skip the tournament with injury

The Adelaide Strikers have been rocked by news that Rashid Khan will miss this summer's KFC BBL with a back injury that requires surgery.

The Strikers announced today that Rashid required a "minor operation" and had withdrawn from the season.

It's a second major blow for the BBL after the Melbourne Stars announced last week that Harry Brook had pulled out of the competition.

Rashid and Brook were the top two picks at this year's KFC BBL|13 Draft, the second such event.

Last summer's draft was also hit with top picks pulling out, including No.1 pick England's Liam Livingstone.

Adelaide Strikers GM of Cricket Tim Nielsen said it was a big loss to be without the leg-spinner who had played for the club since BBL|07 in 2017-18.

"Rashid is a beloved member of the Strikers and a fan favourite who has been with us for seven years, so he will be extremely missed this summer," Nielsen said.

"Rashid loves Adelaide and the Strikers, and we know how much he loves playing in the BBL, and we support him as he has treatment for this injury to ensure his long-term involvement in the game.

"Our list management and coaching staff will now look at our options for replacing Rashid for the upcoming season and a replacement player will be announced in due course."

Rashid had threatened last January that he was "strongly considering" not returning to the KFC BBL in protest over Cricket Australia cancelling a scheduled ODI series against Afghanistan.

Rashid has played every season with the Adelaide Strikers since bursting onto the scene as a 19-year-old to be the leading wicket-taker in BBL|07.

Rashid was Afghanistan's leading wicket-taker at the recently concluded men's ODI World Cup with 11 wickets in nine games, with a best of 3-37 and economy of 4.48. He is the Strikers all-time leading wicket-taker with 98 in 69 games.

The Adelaide Strikers will maintain retention rights for Rashid for next season's BBL draft.

This season, however, they will look to fellow leg-spinner Cameron Boyce to try and fill the void. Boyce returned to Adelaide ahead of last summer's BBL|12 for his second stint with the club and collected five wickets in six games with an economy of 6.95.

The Strikers also have off-spinning allrounder Matt Short – who is currently representing Australia during their T20 tour of India – and Ben Manenti to supply additional overs of spin throughout the season.

The club is also permitted to sign other overseas players to replace Rashid.

The nature of Rashid's back injury remains clouded. It is unclear what his return to cricket looks like, and if he will be fit to play in other T20 franchise competitions this summer.

Last year, after finishing his stint with the Strikers in early January, Rashid played for Mumbai Indians-owned franchises in both the SA20 and ILT20 competitions.

Afghanistan's next bilateral series is a three-match T20 tour of India beginning on January 11.

Rashid Khan is back in business despite recently undergoing back surgery, as Afghanistan has announced his name in a 19-man squad for the upcoming T20I series against India.

Rashid Khan makes a comeback to the Afghanistan side for the first time since the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023. However, there are doubts over his availability for the three-game series given that he's recovering from back surgery.

In his absence, Ibrahim Zadran has been named as the stand-in skipper.

Jonathan Trott puts 'no real timeframe' on influential Rashid Khan return

Rashid Khan pulled out of the ongoing Big Bash League owing to a minor back injury. Following which, the wrist-spinner underwent a back surgery and is yet to make his return to professional cricket. Speaking about the same, Afghanistan head coach Jonathan Trott mentioned that the cricketer is still recovering and there is no real time frame regarding his possible return to the national squad.

Trott added that the team management is in no mood to rush him back as he is a very influential cricketer and is expected to play a big part for Afghanistan in the upcoming T20 World Cup. Trott added that the spinner is working extremely hard and is training with the rest of the cricketers ahead of the third T20I against India.

“It is a case of us making sure that we are really careful with his back. He is such an influential player, we have to make sure he is 100 per cent ready and not rush him back from that type of surgery. It is important to give him the right time and he is working extremely hard and he is here with the team,”

“He is very passionate and dedicated to the Afghan national side. When he is ready, he will be the first one to get on the field. He has got a few more appointments and check-ups to make sure everything is okay. So there is no real time frame. I hope it is sooner rather than later. But there is no pressure and no rush,” the former England international added.

Rashid is expected to be completely fit before the upcoming edition of the Indian Premier League. He is one of the leaders in the Gujarat Titans locker room and will once again play a very important role for the team in the upcoming edition, especially with Hardik Pandya not there anymore. He will target IPL as a dress rehearsal before the T20 World Cup, which is slated to begin on June 1.

Reflecting on his journey, as quoted in a interview posted by Afghanistan Cricket Board, Rashid acknowledged the challenges he faced during his recovery period, he said:

"The last three months were difficult because I had surgery. I had been suffering from a back injury for the last seven to eight months and the doctor had asked me to have surgery even before the World Cup but I decided to play the World Cup and have surgery afterwards because it was such an important event for us but Alhamdulillah I am back on the field and feeling well now and now my focus is on returning to the field and bringing joy and success to the nation,”

"The plan is to represent the country in the upcoming series and the training has been underway and thankfully it went well and I hope that the following few days will also be well so that I can wear the national jersey again and continue to do well for my country,"

What a great performance by Rashid Khan against Ireland in the 2nd T20I! His all-round magic of 25 runs from 12 balls with the bat and taking 4 wickets for 14 runs earned him the Man of the Match award.

Rashid Khan, while speaking in an interview with a local Indian media outlet, talked about his performance post-surgery:

"The performance is not of that level which I have been doing for the last seven years. Definitely, this year, I have struggled a little bit, but this happens as it became very hard for me to come back and play straightaway after surgery."

"But I feel I am getting better and hopefully I will be back to being the player I was. This year, I felt there were a few games where I could have done better, but it just happens and you keep learning from it."

Rashid Khan Returns to Kabul​

Officials from the Afghanistan Cricket Board, by publishing photos of Khan's return to Kabul on their Facebook page, said that this renowned national cricket team bowler has returned to the country after four years.

Due to busy schedule and participating in various commercial cricket tournaments, Rashid Khan Arman had not been able to travel to Afghanistan in recent years.

Upon his return to the country, this national cricket player was warmly welcomed by Afghanistan Cricket Board officials and several other players of the sport.

Rashid Khan Arman, Afghanistan T20 captain, has returned to the country after four years, having recently concluded his participation in the Indian Premier League as part of the Gujrat Titans following his team's elimination from the competition.

Afghanistan’s Khan is set to travel to the West Indies in the coming days, the venue for the 2024 T20 World Cup.

The Afghanistan national cricket team will participate in the T20 World Cup in the United States and the West Indies, with Rashid Khan Arman as the captain.

Rashid Khan produced the best bowling figures by a captain at the men's T20 World Cup today against Bangladesh in ICC T20 World CUp 2024.

4 overs, 17 runs, and 4 wickets as well. This guy is a next level spinner.

Afghanistan team truly deserves all the praise.

From minnow to test nation. Their the new Pakistan of world cricket.

They have aggressive openers, great pacers and gun spinners, but a weak middle order. Kinda like classic Pakistan lol

No. If the Pak people living abroad played for Pakistan they would be living in Pak too. Rashid Khan plays for Afghanistan but lives in the UAE I believe    !!

Rashid Khan delivered an outstanding all-around performance, scoring 50 off 23 balls (SR: 217.39) and taking 1/17 (Econ: 4.25) against Texas Super Kings in MCL 2024. MI New York fell short of victory despite his heroic efforts.

He is even excelling on USA pitches.

Rashid Khan to skip BBL in blow to CA and Strikers​

Rashid Khan will skip the Big Bash League for a second straight summer, in a hammer blow to both Cricket Australia and the Adelaide Strikers.

Officials confirmed the headline acts for next month’s draft on Monday, with West Indies marquee man Shamar Joseph the biggest new name available.

But AAP has been told Rashid will not feature, with the hugely-marketable Afghanistan wrist-spinner opting not to nominate for the September 1 draft before Sunday’s deadline.

It is understood the Strikers had been in communication with Rashid’s management before the decision not to play this summer.

Rashid has taken the most wickets of any overseas player in BBL history with 98 in 69 matches for the Strikers, with the previously world top-ranked T20 bowler developing a cult following around the country.

Rashid had previously threatened to boycott the BBL over Australia’s refusal to play Afghanistan in bilateral cricket, which came because of the ruling Taliban’s stance on women’s rights.

Cricket Australia is adamant that is not the reason behind his decision not to miss the BBL, but rather it was due to his busy schedule.

AAP has also been told the organisation has no issue with Rashid’s views, and would welcome the Afghan spinner back to the competition next summer.

Afghanistan are slated to play Zimbabwe in Tests and white-ball matches in December, while Rashid is committed to play in the SA20 in South Africa from January 9.

Fellow Afghan player Mujeeb Ur Rahman is one player who has nominated for the BBL draft, but unlike Rashid, he is not contracted to play in South Africa.

This season’s absence comes after Rashid was ruled out of last summer’s BBL with a back injury, after initially nominating and being retained by the Strikers.

Rashid’s decision not to play in this summer’s BBL came as Australia’s Test captain Pat Cummins indicated on Monday he also would not feature.

As per reports:

Rashid Khan has been ruled-out of Afghanistan's upcoming Test match against New Zealand after suffering a recurrence of a back injury while playing a domestic cricket league in Afghanistan.

Rashid has already spent significant time out of both franchise and international cricket with back injuries over the last year. He underwent surgery on his back following the 2023 World Cup, but played throughout the 2024 T20 World Cup, as well as appearing in Major League Cricket and The Hundred. He was ruled out of the final part of his stint in The Hundred with a hamstring injury.

In an interview with Robin Uthappa on a local Indian media outlet, AB de Villiers said:

“Rashid Khan, tough to pick at night once again. Got him a few times and he would always come back. Always in your face. He hit him with three sixes, as he was trying to get me out the next ball. And those are the kind of bowlers I always found difficult to face and always had a lot of respect for.”

On his 26th birthday, Rashid Khan delivered an outstanding performance for Afghanistan in their second ODI match against South Africa in Sharjah. The spin sensation claimed a remarkable five-wicket haul, helping to limit South Africa to a mere 134 runs, as Afghanistan defended a substantial total of 311.

This feat marked Rashid as the first cricketer in the 53-year history of One Day International (ODI) cricket to secure a five-wicket haul on his birthday. Prior to Rashid's achievement, the closest performances on a player's birthday in ODIs were by Vernon Philander with 4/12 against Ireland in Belfast, 2007, and Stuart Broad with 4/44 against Australia in Cardiff, 2010.

Rashid Khan gets married in dazzling event in Kabul; Mohammad Nabi, Mujeeb-ur-Rahman and other Afghanistan stars attend

Afghanistan cricket's poster boy Rashid Khan has got married in a dazzling ceremony in Kabul. A number of Rashid's Afghanistan teammates attended the event, in which he got married along with three of his brothers on the same night. Pictures and videos posted by the players and a number of fan pages of Rashid and Afghanistan cricket have gone viral.

Afghanistan veteran Mohammad Nabi posted four photos from the event on X. "Congratulations to the one and only King Khan, Rashid Khan, on your wedding! Wishing you a lifetime of love, happiness, and success ahead. @rashidkhan_19," he said in his post.

Rashid is currently on break from Test cricket for Afghanistan as he manages his back after undergoing surgery last year. According to PTI, Rashid and the team management had decided mutually on his break from the longest format considering his back issues.

Rashid was out of action for four months after undergoing a back surgery following the 2023 ODI World Cup in India in October-November. He was, hence, not named in the squad that was set to face New Zealand in a one-off Test in Greater Noida, India. However, the match itself couldn't happen due to the poor condition of the ground

Great to see so many players from Afghanistan in IPL: Rashid Khan

27th November, 2024: The Indian Premier League (IPL) has seen some exceptional talent featuring in the competition from Afghanistan. Spinner Rashid Khan who is presently a part of Bangla Tigers in the 2024 Abu Dhabi T10 tournament being played at the Zayed Cricket Stadium, has expressed delight on seeing the Afghan players being a part of the league.

"It's a great news for Afghanistan cricket to have more players in the IPL. It is the biggest league in the world. It's just the beginning for the players back home. It's good to see how they are getting into that space and making a place for themselves. This shows that Afghanistan cricket is growing and I'm so happy and excited to see all of them play the tournament," he said.

The right-handed spinner who has had a decent run in the last two matches for the Tigers is of the opinion that T10 format is a bit difficult for the spinners but bowling in the right areas is the key.

"T10 certainly is a difficult format for the spinners. The batters are always looking to attack. Moreover, the ball is also new so, it becomes challenging to get the turn. But you have to put your best foot forward and bowl in the right areas."

"You have a good boundary size and also the ground, and the wicket is a little bit supportive. If you have the skills, you can come and perform. It's just the matter of one delivery and you can dismiss a batter," he concluded.

Bangla Tigers have won two matches out of the four that they have played and will now lock horns with Ajman Bolts on November 27, 2024 in their next fixture.

RASHID KHAN named MI CAPE TOWN CAPTAIN for SA20 2025​

The Afghan powerhouse, the spin wizard, the game-revolutionizer. With a zippy, quick armspeed, and a complete departure from the age-old techniques of leg-spin bowling, he’s put Afghanistan right on the cricketing map by bamboozling batters left, right and centre.

We missed him in the previous season of the SA20 after back injury kept him out of action, but he’s back in the role of the skipper. There’s a fair bit of unfinished business for MI Cape Town after a couple of tough seasons. 2025 offers us our redemption, and trust skipper Rashid Khan to have his eyes set on the target, the silverware.


Aye, Aye Skip! RASHID KHAN named MI CAPE TOWN CAPTAIN for SA20 2025

Rashid Khan scripted history with a remarkable seven-wicket haul, leading Afghanistan to a 72-run victory over Zimbabwe in the second Test at Queens Sports Club, Bulawayo. His figures of 7/77 are the best by an Afghan bowler in Test cricket. Rashid bowled out Zimbabwe for 205 on Day 5, dismissing captain Craig Ervine for 53 and sealing Afghanistan's 1-0 series win.

Rashid Khan is one of the most prolific wicket-takers after six Tests, surpassed only by 19th-century Australian seamer Charlie Turner.
