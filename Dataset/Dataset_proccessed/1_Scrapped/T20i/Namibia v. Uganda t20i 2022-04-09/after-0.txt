Cricket Cranes set up T20 series decider with Namibia after 7-wicket win

Saturday Result

Namibia 177 runs for 4 wickets for 20 runs
Uganda 178 runs for 3 wickets in 19.5 overs
Uganda won by 7 wickets (with 1 ball to spare)

Fixture - Sunday, 10th April

Namibia vs. Uganda - 1:00 pm, Trustco United CC

Having lost by 8 wickets in the T20I Series opener against Nambia on Friday, the Cricket Cranes picked themselves up to stun The Eagles by 7 wickets on Saturday at the Trustco United Cricket Club Oval in Windhoek.

It was Uganda's first T20 win over Namibia.

The three-match series decider will be played on Sunday afternoon at the same ground and the Cricket Cranes will be eager to double the act against the Namibians, who have already qualified for the T20 World Cup that will be staged in Australia later this year.

For Uganda to reach the coveted showpiece, the Cricket Cranes must fly to Zimbabwe in July and finish among the top two nations in the ICC T20 Global Qualifier B.

Cricket Cranes skipper Brian Masaba won the toss and asked the opposition to bat and rotated his bowlers well as Namibia limped to 75/3 after 11 overs.

However, Nabia captain Gerhard Erasmus set the park ablaze with an unbeaten century off just 47 balls to help Namibia set a commanding 177 for the loss of 4 wickets.

All-rounder Riazat Ali Shah stood out with the ball, registering 2 for 24 in 4 overs, and also anchored Uganda's chase with an unbeaten 57 off 43.

Man of Match Dinesh Nakrani put the hosts to the sword with chance-less innings of 77 runs off 39 balls littered with eight fours and three maximums to give Uganda a deserved victory.

Early Arnold Otwani (16 off 10) and Kenneth Waiswa (24 off 24) laid the ground for Uganda.

In the series decider on Sunday, Cricket Cranes will once again be expected to throw the kitchen sink at the opposition, who are ranked 16th in the world whereas Uganda are nine places below at 25.
