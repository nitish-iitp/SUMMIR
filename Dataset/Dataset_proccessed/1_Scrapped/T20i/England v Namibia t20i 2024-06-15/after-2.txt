Right, job done for England. Now they must wait. We'll be back with full coverage of the Scotland-Australia game from 01:00 BST.

Read Matt Henry's match report from Antigua while you wait for the action in St Lucia.

Bye for now.

'It's a big relief'

23:15 BST 15 June 2024

England captain Jos Buttler: "It's a big relief. It's been a stressful day with the rain coming down, but I think we put in a really good performance. We were well prepared.

"I thought that was a really good score on that wicket. When I go out I thought 85/90 might be a good score.

"We had the two games rained out against Pakistan in England, the Scotland game, everyone's dealt with everything that's been thrown at us really well."

I can. It's because England started their innings thinking they had 11 overs, then had it cut to 10. The theory is it is a disadvantage to the batting side to have their overs cut mid-innings for reasons like use of resources, momentum, etc. Therefore, the target gets a bump to negate that disadvantage.

Sorry. I know it's a bit late with the game over. But could someone explain why a DLS target was provided when both teams had an equal amount of overs and the interruption did not happen mid-inning?

Gavin: I'm definitely the kind of guy that would be retired out by my team. Not though slow scoring, but from boring my team with my love for garden strimmers before the match.

I suspect Brook and the rest of the England team will find the energy to stay up for that one. They will either be packing for St Lucia to take on West Indies on Wednesday night, or heading for a flight back to Heathrow.

'We didn't think we'd get out there'

23:04 BST 15 June 2024

Player of the match Harry Brook: "There was a lot of anxiety, we didn't think we'd get out there. Thankfully the rain stopped.

"We took quite a bit of information from our batting out onto the pitch when fielding. Toppers started beautifully, taking chunks out of the pitch, it was tough for them boys.

"Facing the spin in the middle was quite tough, you didn't quite know how it was coming out of the pitch. I was plinking twos and getting knackered in the end.

"I've been asleep before the night games have finished, hopefully I can stay up for it."

In case you're wondering, I'm hearing the weather in St Lucia is lovely. That Scotland-Australia game starts at 01:30 BST.

The players shake hands in the sunshine. England got a lot right there. They picked the right team and recovered from an iffy start with the bat.

Dead simple now. Scotland need a point from the game against Australia in order to go through. Lose and it's England through to the Super 8s.

It's been an excellent performance by England. It's very tricky to remain positive while waiting for the rain, fearing they'll be turfed out of the tournament. But what they've produced on the pitch has been excellent.

Out!

David Wiese is caught at long-on and leaves the international stage for the final time. What a performer he has been for Namibia.

Some of the England players rush to shake his hand. He raises his bat and helmet as he departs. An emotional moment.

Apologies for continually saying the target is 127. It's definitely 126. Namibia won't get either.

It's length from Chris Jordan and Michael van Lingen picks out Harry Brook, taking a good catch above his head at long-on. Brook has had a good day.
