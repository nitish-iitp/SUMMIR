SWEET MOMENT—Malawi U-19 Cricket side after edging out Kenya
SHARE

Malawi Under-19 Women’s Cricket Team has been drawn against Nigeria and others in Group B of this year’s Under-19 T20 World Cup-Africa Qualifiers.

Zimbabwe and Tanzania complete teams in Group B while Group A comprises Rwanda, Namibia, Uganda and Kenya.

The Africa zone qualifiers will run from September 22 to 29 in Kigali, Rwanda.

Cricket Malawi President Vivek Ganesan said the developmental squad continued with camping following its success in Kigali when the side won the International Cricket Council (ICC) Under-19 Women’s T20 World Cup Sub-Regional trophy.

“The camp will be more intense to prepare for the higher standard of competition. The squad will remain the same as they all are still eligible. The strengthening will come through further honing their skills as well as preparing physically and mentally,” Ganesan said.

He attributed the team’s success to hard work, determination, discipline and an efficient support structure with dedicated support staff.

“The qualification to division one means we are competing against the best teams in Africa, and we all believe that this is where we belong, at the top of Cricket in Africa,” Ganesan said.

The team’s captain Ketrina Chingaipe called for support, if the side is to do well at the event.

“They should continue supporting us the way they did before we went for the qualifiers,” Chingaipe said.

At the ICC Under-19 Women’s T20 World Cup Sub-Regional Qualifiers, the team won the accolade with a perfect record amassing 12 points after winning all six games.
