ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier A 2024 Points Table

Bayuemas Oval, Kuala Lumpur, hosted the 16th encounter of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier A between the Maldives and Mongolia, with the former emerging victorious by a mammoth 117 runs.

Meanwhile, the 18th game of the campaign saw Singapore successfully chase down a target of 153 runs set by Kuwait, winning the second fixture of the day at the YSD-UKM Cricket Oval, Bangi.

After the completion of 17 games this season, Hong Kong dominates the ICC Men’s T20 World Qualifiers A with a perfect record of four wins in four matches. They retain the top spot, having garnered eight points and a colossally positive net run rate of +8.182.

Kuwait, despite a loss against Singapore earlier today, hold tight to the second position with four wins in five matches and a net run rate of +5.053. A five-wicket win over Kuwait launched Singapore to the third position from fourth and a net run rate of +2.308 in five games.

Malaysia (six points) slipped down to the fourth position from third with the same number of points as their predecessor’s but a slightly inferior net run rate of +1.948. Having scored two wins in six matches, the Maldives occupy the fifth spot with four points so far this season. After establishing a resounding 117-run win over Mongolia, their net run rate improved from -3.016 to -1.368.

The likes of Myanmar and Mongolia continue to languish at the bottom of the points table. Myanmar, having won just a single game in their five league stage games are in the sixth position with two points and a net run rate of -3.168. Mongolia has had an abhorrent tournament, losing all five of their games, resulting in zero points and an abysmal net run rate of -6.826.

Maldives thrash Mongolia by 117 runs; Singapore eke out a five wicket win over Kuwait

The Maldives opted to bat first in the first match of the day against Mongolia. As it turned out, it was a good toss to win as the Maldives posted a competitive first innings total of 178/6 courtesy of batting contributions from skipper Azyan Farhath (55 off 49), Gedara Wijesingha (56 off 39), and Umar Adam (32 off 12).

In response, Mongolia were bowled out for a mere 61 runs in 19.1 overs, with Od Lutbayar (18 off 17) top scoring in a hapless batting lineup. The wreckage was primarily led by Maldives skipper Azyan Farhath (4/5), helping his side win the first game of the day by a healthy margin of 117 runs.

The second game of the day saw Kuwait batters Ravija Sandaruwan (56 off 36) and skipper Mohammed Aslam (45 off 42) make sizable contributions to score 152/9 in the first overs against Singapore. Ramesh Kalimuthu (5/21) helped Singapore restrict Kuwait for a below-par score.

Chasing 153, William Simpson (46* off 39) held the Singapore batting lineup till the end alongside teammates Anish Paraam (41 off 23) and Surendran Chandramohan (30* off 17), cruising to a five-wicket win over Kuwait with seven deliveries to spare.
