PREVIEW

Namibia (NAM) and Zimbabwe (ZIM) will be taking on each other in the final of the Men's African T20 League. The match is set to happen on March 23. The final of the tournament will be taking place at Achimota Senior Secondary School A Field in Accra. Both the teams would be looking forward to the big game. It is interesting to note that both the finalists of the tournament are from Group B.

While Zimbabwe topped the group with three wins, Namibia ended the group stage in the 2nd position and qualified for the semifinal. In the knockout stage, Zimbabwe overcame the challenge of Kenya, who finished second in Group A. On the other hand, Namibia faced the tough challenge of Uganda, who finished Group A. The final is expected to be a banger, as two good teams will be up against each other.

Zimbabwe probably have a better chance of winning. They have won all their last four matches. On the other hand, Namibia have won and lost two of their last four games. In the group stage match between the two sides, Zimbabwe beat Namibia. While the former would be hoping to repeat the feat, the latter would be willing to reverse the result. That promises to be a great contest between the two sides on the big day.
