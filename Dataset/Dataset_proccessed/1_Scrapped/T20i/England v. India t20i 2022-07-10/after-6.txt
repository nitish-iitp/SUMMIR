England vs India 3rd T20I: Hosts defend 215 to avoid whitewash against India
By Mumbai Indians | 10 JUL, 2022

Read it in Hindi.

Read it in Marathi.

England beat India by 17 runs at Nottingham to avoid a 3-0 whitewash in the three-game T20I series. The Men in Blue clinched the T20I series with a 2-1 win.

The hosts’ score of 215/7 in 20 overs proved a bit too much for India, who could only score 198/9 despite Suryakumar Yadav’s heroic innings of 117 in 55 balls.

England batted first upon winning the coin toss. Phil Salt and Reece Topley replaced Matt Parkinson and Sam Curran for the hosts. At the same time, India brought in Shreyas Iyer, Avesh Khan, Umran Malik and Ravi Bishnoi for Hardik Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah and Yuzvendra Chahal.

England lost their first wicket in 3.4 overs, with skipper Jos Buttler hitting 18 off nine balls. The opener was going for a flat-bat drive through the covers, but a misjudgement in his shot saw Avesh Khan’s length ball hit the stumps off the inside edge.

Upon reaching 50 in 5.4 overs, the hosts ended their powerplay phase at 52-1.

Jason Roy would depart for 27 at the start of the eighth over. A back of a length from Umran Malik took a top-edge, and Rishabh Pant completed a simple catch.

Phil Salt lasted 12 minutes at the crease as Harshal Patel’s dipping low full-toss ended as a yorker, hitting the base of the off and middle stumps.

Dawid Malan helped England recover from 86/3 to 167/3 in six overs, reaching his half-century in 30 balls in 12.2 overs.

The 17th over, bowled by Ravi Bishnoi, proved decisive for India. He dismissed Malan for 77 and Moeen Ali for a golden duck. The spinner ended his final over with two runs and two wickets.

Following Avesh Khan’s costly 18th over that yielded 21 runs for England, Harshal Patel ended his spell with the dismissal of Harry Brook and eight runs in his fourth and final over.

With 17 runs and a run-out off the last ball in the final over, England set India a mammoth target of 216 to win the third T20I at Nottingham.

India’s run-chase began with Rishabh Pant departing for one run in the second over. Reece Topley’s delivery took an edge of the bat and Pant’s back leg before going towards wicket-keeper Jos Buttler.

Virat Kohli, who came in to bat at number three, came in aggressive with a boundary and six off three deliveries from David Willey. However, Kohli would soon depart as he attempted to slap a wide-length delivery through the covers but found Jason Roy at short extra cover.

Topley ended his second over with the wicket of India captain Rohit Sharma. Rohit hit the pacer’s slow delivery towards square deep midwicket, where Phil Salt completed the catch.

India reached 50 off a single in 7.1 overs and would reach 82/3 in 10 overs. At the same stage, England were 86/3.

Suryakumar Yadav, the anchor of India’s fightback, reached fifty in 32 balls. He would hit a couple of sixes in the 13th over - bowled by Liam Livingstone - that yielded 21 runs.

India reached 150 in 15 overs, but they would lose Shreyas Iyer on the first ball of the final phase. Iyer attempted a dab shot over Buttler, but Reece Topley’s back-of-a-length delivery took a slight deflection and went straight to the gloves of the England captain.

The dismissal ended a 119-run stand between Sky and Shreyas for the fourth wicket and saw India recover in a vital phase between overs 6 and 15.

Suryakumar Yadav became the fifth Indian cricketer to register a century in T20 international cricket when he reached his maiden hundred off 48 balls.

Dinesh Karthik would end up as David Willey’s second and final victim of his bowling spell. The seasoned batter tried to flick beyond fine short leg, but Willey’s delivery was pitched outside leg stump. A player review confirmed this, and Dinesh Karthik was adjudged out by Leg before wicket (LBW).

England added another crucial wicket to their kitty as Richard Gleeson dismissed Ravindra Jadeja LBW.

With 41 runs required off 12 balls, Suryakumar Yadav slammed 14 runs off three deliveries but his fine innings ended in 18.5 overs. Sky’s knock of 117 in 55 balls is the second-highest individual score for India in T20Is after Rohit Sharma’s 118 vs Sri Lanka in 2017.

The final over saw Chris Jordan defend 21 runs as he grabbed two wickets and gave away just three runs. India finished with a score of 198/9 in 20 overs.

The 17-run loss meant India suffered their first defeat in 20 matches under Rohit Sharma’s captaincy across all formats. The last time a Rohit-led India team slumped to a defeat was a 2019 T20I against Bangladesh in Delhi.

With the T20I series now done and dusted, England and India will clash in the first game of the three-match ODI series on Tuesday, July 12. The fixture, to be played at The Oval, will begin at 5:30 PM IST.
