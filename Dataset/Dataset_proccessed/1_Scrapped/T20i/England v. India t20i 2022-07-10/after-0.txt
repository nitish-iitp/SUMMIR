A slower one, shorter. Sharma looks to pull but misses to get hit on the body.

1.1 overs (0 Run)
OUT! PANT SIGNALS FOR THE DRS BUT THE TIME RUNS OUT! He has to walk back and England strike early! He has been given out caught behind and had he not hit it, he should have gone upstairs straightaway. Rohit was probably worried about the LBW and hence, was hesitant in asking him to go up but the impact seemed high. Excellent start for Topley who comes back into the side and strikes. This is angled into the body, Pant looks to heave it on the leg side. It goes off something to the keeper who takes it and appeals. The finger is raised. Pant indicates he did not hit it, Rohit asks him where did it hit him on the pad. Eventually time runs out and India have lost their opener. Virat Kohli walks out to bat! Can the great man deliver when his side needs him too?
