Krunal Pandya has been delivering crucial performances in the IPL 2024 for Lucknow Super Giants. He scripted history in the IPL 2024 as he bowled the most economical spell for LSG in the history of the Indian Premier League. The 33-year-old attained the milestone in the IPL 2024 match against Gujarat Titans at the Ekana Cricket Stadium.

He bagged three wickets by conceding 11 runs in four overs with an economy of 2.75. He registered the wickets of Sai Sudarshan, BS Sharath and Darshan Nalkande.

This is the most economical spell of four overs by an LSG bowler in IPL. Pandya broke his own record, having previously delivered a 2/11 in four overs spell against Punjab Kings back in 2022. Mark Wood, the English fast bowler, also delivered a four-over spell of 5/14 against Delhi Capitals last year.

Krunal loves playing against GT it seems as numbers prove it. In five matches, he has taken six wickets against the franchise at an average of 17.66 and an economy rate of 5.3. He has also maintained a strike rate of 20 against GT. He has also scored 51 runs in five innings against GT at an average of 17.00, with the best score of 23*, often coming down the order.

Overall this season, Krunal has picked five wickets in eight matches at an economy of 7.43.
