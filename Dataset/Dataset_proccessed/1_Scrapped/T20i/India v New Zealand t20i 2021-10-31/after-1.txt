T20 World Cup 2021, India vs New Zealand Highlights: A Virat Kohli-led India lost to a clinical New Zealand by eight wickets in an ICC T20 World Cup Super 12 match on Sunday, virtually dashing their hopes of making the semifinals. A timid India could only manage a below-par 110/7 in their vital match and then saw New Zealand chase down the target of 111 with 33 balls to spare. Opener Daryl Mitchell top-scored for New Zealand with 49 off 35 balls, while skipper Kane Williamson made an unbeaten 33.

Sent into bat by New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson, India lost wickets at regular intervals and struggled to pose any serious threat to a disciplined Kiwi attack. Leg-break bowler Ish Sodhi and left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner returned exceptional figures of 2/17 and 0/15 from their respective quota of four overs each. Pace spearhead Trent Boult picked up 3/20.

Brief scores: India: 110/7 in 20 overs (Ravindra Jadeja 26 not out; Trent Boult 3/20, Ish Sodhi 2/17).

New Zealand: 111/2 in 14.3 overs (Daryl Mitchell 49; Jasprit Bumrah 2/19).

The Will.i.am.Song (lounge version) ðŸŽºðŸŽ·ðŸŽ¼

How does Kane Williamson finish a game? The ball might have been full, pitched on his leg and seemed to be asking to be hit. It would have been so tempting to do a Dhoni, swing the ball, send it sailing over the cow's corner and seal it with a six. Not Williamson, he nudged the Shardul Thakur 'bad' ball to deep square and walked to the non-striker end, pushing India to the brink of WorldT20 elimination. The deed done, two points in kitty and campaign back on track. Williamson might not believe in Dhoni's turbo charge towards the finish line but he does have a blank face after crossing it. The finish might be low-key but an over before Williamson had probably played the shot of the game that would have made the fans and pundits shake their heads in disbelief. The world plays the ramp-shot over the slips or keeper but Williamson has the poise and skills to send the ball to fine-leg. Indian keeper Rishabh Pant was stunned as the New Zealand skipper sent a short ball from Hardik Pandya over this out-stretched left hand. It was the kind of demoralising stroke that brings a collective realisation to the opposition camp that they are up against a far superior opponent, who wouldn't give you an inch, wouldn't slip up and show no emotion.

Kane's iron fist in velvet glove ðŸ¦¾ðŸ§¤

With New Zealand needing just 13 with another six overs to go, knocking the ball around would have sufficed. Kane Williamson's side was going for the slow kill and wisely so by taking singles and twos. With the classy New Zealand skipper guiding the ship home, the Indian bowlers could expect some mercy -- they would not be bludgeoned to humiliation. Williamson is more of a laser-beam surgeon than a farmer with a sickle. Hardik Pandya ambling in rather than running in full steam would get the Williamson treatment. Hardik went for the slower bouncer hoping to get Williamson to mistime. Cool Kane though waited and guided it over the leg slip region rather than over the standard first slip area. It wasn't an upper cut nor a ramp shot but the lightest of touch bundled with timing. Two balls later he stepped down the track and unfurled the extra cover drive for another four.  This was Williamson's version of the iron fist in velvet glove.

Skipper Forlorn: Grim brothers tale ðŸ˜Ÿâ˜¹ï¸

Not long after Kane Williamson hit the winning run, Virat Kohli lifted his cap, scratched his head and ruffled his hair. The face was grim. The expression that was ever present through the evening - when he sat in the dug-out after he had been dismissed, when he watched the wheels come off India’s batting, and now at the end of the game. On the field, a short while before the end, he failed to collect a throw at non-striker’s end and the ball rammed into his knee. He hobbled away to his fielding position in pain. It was that kind of night: nothing he tried had come off. The rejigged batting order hadn’t come off. It would have been one thing had they tried to hit and got out but it was a strange meandering of sorts. To borrow Kohli-speak, the intent wasn’t visible, they weren't "brave enough". There were 54 dot balls; nine overs of nothingness in a T20 over, surely that wouldn’t have been the plan. He drove a leg-break from outside off to wide long-on; usually he would have gone over covers. He saw most of his top order batsmen combust. In the end as he walked away, MS Dhoni followed Ravi Shastri on to the field to shake hands with New Zealand players. There were lots of cooks in the team and we know how that cliche goes.

Kohli reflects on result

"I thought we were brutal up front. We weren't brace enough when we entered the field, but NZ sustained that pressure. Every time we took a chance, we lost a wicket. It's most often a result of hesitation of whether you should go for a shot or not."

22:29 (IST)

NZ win by 8 wickets

Hardik comes to bowl the 14th over. And Williamson hits a 4. 100 up for New Zealand. Just 9 needed now. And a wide ball. And another 4 to follow. This might be over in this over. Nope. Still time left. 14 done. NZ 108/2. And it's all over in the next over. New Zealand has beaten India by 8 wickets as India's campaign enters rocky terrain.

Things are getting pretty interesting ?

WICKET!!!

Bumrah to complete his spell with the 13th over. This one is probabaly over. There aren't just enough runs on the board and NZ have a lot of batting left. And Bumrah snares Mitchell. The danger man is gone. NZ 96/2 after 12.4 overs.

22:12 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
NZ almost home

Over number 12 begins. Bumrah bowled the 11th one and gave away just 6. India need wickets though and they need them quickly. And Hardik Pandya will bowl the 12th. Let's see if he can pull out the rabbit from the hat. 5 off this. 12 gone. NZ 94/1.

22:01 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
10 overs gone

And another super six from Mitchell. Shardul's ball is off to the rafters. And the fourth is hit for a boundary. So does the fifth. Mitchell is literally flaying this Indian attack. 14 runs off this over. 10 overs are gone as we go to drinks. NZ are perfectly placed in this run chase. NZ 83/1 after 10 overs.

21:56 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
NZ ticking along

And the 9th over begins. To be bowled by Varun. This is the last over of his spell. India need wickets now. 5 runs off this over. All that is well and good but wickets will be India's priority. NZ innings ticking along pretty nicely. NZ 69/1 after 9 overs.

21:49 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
WHAT A SIXXXXX

Shami comes in the attack for the 7th over. And Shami is punished in the 5th ball. What a 6. 11 off this over. NZ 55/1 after 7 overs. 

21:43 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
Powerplay done

Last over of powerplay begins. Jadeja in to bowl. And a 6 from Mitchell. Just like that. Floats this up slightly too full on off stump, and he clears his front leg and lofts it cleanly over the long-on boundary. Mid-on was in, so no risk there either. And another 4 to follow. That's 10 in 3 balls. And finds another gap and gets a second 4. This over is turning into a nightmare. 6 overs gone. NZ 44/1.

21:34 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
WICKET!!!

And Bumrah gets the treatment now. Guptill putting on the pressure on Bumrah. Length ball on off stump, and that's a good hit from Guptill. Makes himself plenty of room and frees his arms to flat-bat it and just clear the leaping fielder at mid-off. AND GONE. Guptill is gone. Shardul takes it. NZ lose one. Guptill has to walk. NZ 24/1 after 3.4 overs.

21:31 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
Back to back boundaries

And an expensive third over. Unravelled all the good work of the previous 2 and India are back to square one. Back to back fours in the second and the third ball of Varun's over. 12 off it. NZ 18/0 after 3 overs.

21:28 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
Haunting to a hello-in catch ðŸ‘¥....ðŸŽƒ....â˜ºï¸

Gathering himself after snaffling Virat Kohli’s catch at long-on—a skier that could have been easily lost in the floodlights—Trent Boult's eyes flickered backwards to see if his heel had nudged the ropes, and he took a deep sigh of relief. A broad smile crackling on his face, he pointed his index finger at the ropes, as if the ropes had life and he was exchanging a pleasantry or a word with them. A fairly standard catch, there was nothing spectacular about it other than good hands. Except that, for Boult, it would mean the semi-exorcism of a ghost that could still be haunting him. The ghosts of the 2019 World Cup final, where he devoured a terrific catch of Ben Stokes in the 49th over, only to lose his balance and fall over the ropes. In the context of the game, the catch was defining. Perhaps, in the context of the tournament, too, this catch could turn out to be defining.

21:26 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
Brilliant over

Bumrah has come to bowl the second over. 3 dot balls to begin. Good bowling. It's a pity that the bowlers have so little to defend. Brilliant bit of bowling just 1 off it. NZ 6/0 after 2 overs.

21:22 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
First over gone

Varun begins the 1st over. Guptill straight off the mark with 2 runs. New Zealand will look to end this one early. Decent over. NZ 5/0 after 1 over.

21:19 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
Chase begins

And to start the chase New Zealand stick to the trusted opening combination of Martin Guptill and Daryl Mitchell. Varun will start the attack.

Out they go!
110 on the board from India.
Time to chase.

India struggle to 110/7

Last over now. Starts with 2 and 100 comes up for India. And the third ball is hit for a massive 6. And another 2 in the 5th ball. And NZ have dropped a catch in the last ball of the innings. India end at 110/7 after 20 overs. To put in context, how badly India has struggled, you need only look to 54 dot balls that were bowled in the Indian innings.

India end up with a score of 110/7.

WICKET

It's the same bowler and the same fielder again as it's taken at long-off. Good length and turning away from middle stump. Thakur plants the front leg down and looks to loft it straight. Not the pitch for it, a dolly for Guptill on the line. Boult gets his 50th wicket.

21:00 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
WICKET

19th over starts. The last ball of the last over went for a boundary. Jadeja does something out of the ordinary and pulls it off. Just 8 off it though. Now, Boult comes to bowl the penultimate over and immediately snares Hardik. It's hit straight to long-off and Guptill does not make mistakes there. IND 94/6 after 18.1 overs.

Hardik Pandya fails to get any elevation and holes out in the deep.

He is gone for 23 as Boult gets his second. #T20WorldCup | #INDvNZ | https://t.co/dJpWyk0E0j pic.twitter.com/K0XXLes2qa

And finally a 4

17th over starts and Boult is back in the attack. And finally a boundary to end this over. Lovely placement this. Boult misfires though. This is short and angled across and is too wide outside off to tuck Hardik up. He hangs inside the line and slashes it over backward point. First boundary in 71 balls. IND 86/5 after 17 overs.

20:48 (IST)

The balle-balle buoy for Black Caps ðŸ™ŒðŸ¼ðŸ™ŒðŸ¼ðŸ‘¯ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸

It wasn’t his best ball but it was enough to take out Rohit Sharma. It was a pretty short leg break from Ish Sodhi but Sharma couldn’t find any timing on his heave-ho and holed out to long-on. Sodhi got greedier and knocked out Virat Kohli too. A floated leg break outside off stump and Kohli chose to go across the line rather than an inside-out hit over covers, and holed out to long-on. Sodhi was born in Ludhiana in Punjab and went to New Zealand at the age of four. He speaks Punjabi and can even do a nifty Punjabi rap on demand. When he played IPL for the first time in 2018 for Rajasthan Royals and was warming up ahead of the game, the crowd chanted ‘Ish Sodhi, Ish Sodhi!” And he was pretty touched by it. Since he was a kid, he has come to India often to visit his birth town, a small pind called “Sidhwana”. Whenever he visits his hometown, he gorges on Makkah wala Alu Parthaa and Kaju ka Barfi and lots of chicken tikka and fish. That’s where his interest stops, though. “I have never thought about playing for India since I have played cricket all my life in New Zealand,” he said once. He grew up idolising Anil Kumble and Mohammad Azharuddin and walked with a jersey with VVS Laxman’s name after the wristy batsman’s 281 against Australia. Now, kids in New Zealand walk around with his name on the back. From a small pind to a small country with big achievements.

NZ lose review

Williamson reviews for lbw against Jadeja. He's struck on the back leg in front of off, but he was hopping. And they lose the review. It was missing stumps. 6 off the 15th over. IND 73/5 after 15 overs.

20:41 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
INDIA HALF DOWN

Milne in to bowl the 15th over. Indian batters really need to start hitting big ones right now. And Pant is gone now. India are half down. He has been clean bowled. Inside edge and onto middle stump! IND 70/5 after 14.3 overs.

Bowled him ?

Milne with a scorcher to get the wicket of Pant.

India's struggle continues

13th over and Southee is back in the attack. 2 relatively new batsmen in the crease. This is their chance to anchor the innings. The 11th over went for 4 runs while the 12th went for 6.  This over went for just 4 runs and the next by Sodhi goes for just 5. India struggling. IND 67/4 after 14 overs.

20:21 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
Kohli departs, IND 4 down

New Zealand have started to put pressure on this Indian batting lineup as the 9th and the 10th over went for 2 and 5 respectively. India needed those big shots and they LOSE KOHLI now. Again a shot, straight to the sky and it's caught. He's holed out to long-on! First ball after the drinks break. IND 48/4 after 10.1 overs.

If Milne doesn't, Guptill will ðŸ¥ºðŸ¤¹â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤ 

Rohit Sharma is a compulsive puller/hooker and Trent Boult, a teammate at Mumbai Indians, threw in the bait with a short one. Rohit, in at No.3, as India gave Ishan Kishan his spot at the top of the order, must have been itching to have a go. The ball went to Adam Milne at deep fine leg, who lost sight of it in the blinding 'ring of fire' lights installed on the stadium roof. The ball went through his hands and Milne looked downcast. Earlier he had advanced too much from the edge of the circle when KL Rahul lofted it over mind-on. Milne was drafted into the squad in place of an injured Lockie Ferguson. If he wanted to make a good first impression at the T20 World Cup it was not to be. His first over, the fifth of the innings, made things worse as KL Rahul and Sharma took 15 runs off him. Good 'ol Marty Guptill though would shun all sweaty palmy grips and run and fall forward, clutching onto the catch.

Sodhi in to bowl the 8th over and India lose another. t's short outside off, and Rohit can free his arms through the pull, and he doesn't quite catch it properly. Guptill moves forward quickly from long-on, and takes an excellent catch tumbling forward. Rohit not so lucky this time. IND 40/3 after 7.4 overs.

If only Adam Milne had taken a regulation catch at deep backward square leg, it would have been utter chaos in the Indian camp. At least in the stands where wives of the cricketers were sitting.Trent Boult had just taken out Ishan Kishan with a leg side half volley which was drop-kicked straight to man in the deep behind square. Boult then hurled a well-directed bouncer, angling away from Sharma, who was demoted to No.3 and had walked in at the fall of Kishan. It was hooked almost instinctively by Sharma and it flew straight to Milne, who dawdled towards it and waited. Perhaps, he could have taken one more step and the ball would have dropped into his palms at a comfortable height. Instead, he waited and the ball dipped towards his shoe laces and he clanged it. In the stands, Mrs Sharma buried her face into her palms and Mrs Ashwin, sitting beside her, rubbed her back to soothe her jangled nerves. Awwww.

Kohli & selection conundrums ðŸ¤¨ðŸ˜³ðŸ¤¥ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸

ou can never read Virat Kohli's mind when it comes to the playing XI. Him playing Shardul Thakur was not a surprise, but the faux all-rounder getting picked for Bhuvneshwar Kumar might have disappointed fantasy team gamers. The switch meant those on the field for the crucial World T20 game were Hardik and Shardul - remember he had been included in the squad at the 11th hour as the former's back-up. Pre-match there was speculations that India might have three spinners, with R Ashwin replacing one of the pacers. No, wrong again. Some even said mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy shouldn't have played before Ashwin even in the first game. Would Kohli get the most-experienced spinner for the make-or-break game? No. The conservative among the pundits, though, were clear - since you might have played your best eleven for the Pakistan game there was no reason for changing things after just one loss. Kohli stumped them too. One last bit. After India lost the toss, you anticipated Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul to walk out. No, Ishan Kishan came up the order. Didn't Kohli get all sarcastic when someone suggested something similar at the press conference after the Pakistan loss?

20:00 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
WICKET!!!

And the boundaries continue to flow, though not in the intended direction. Shortish slower ball in the corridor, and it keeps a touch low as Rahul swivels through a pull. Bottom edges it past his off stump, down to the fine leg boundary. And Rahul is gone. New Zealand get their second, via another catch at deep square leg. Short ball on off stump, and it was there to be pulled, but Rahul ends up picking out the only fielder back on the leg-side boundary. IND 35/2 after 5.5 overs.

19:56 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
Rohit, Rahul hit stride

And Rahul pounces on Milne. That dropped catch might be on his mind and he makes a not so good start. Gets hit for a 4 by Rahul in the first ball. And now Rohit Sharma makes him pay. A four and now a 6 to follow. Absolutely wallops him. 14 off the over. India finding its groove. IND 29/1 after 5 overs.

19:47 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
Rohit dropped

And Rohit Sharma was nearly gone in the first ball. Milne puts down a clanger at long leg! This ends the 3rd over. How expensive could that be?

19:44 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
WICKET!!

Boult comes in  to bowl the third and Kishan has hit him for a boundary. That'll do a world of good for his confidence. And he is gone. Boult strikes. India lose their first wicket. IND 11/1 after 2.5 overs.

19:40 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
First boundary

Second over starts. Southee to bowl. And there's India's first boundary. Overpitches slightly, and Rahul meets it with the full face, though it turns a little on impact, and drives it over the leaping fielder at mid-on. IND 6/0 after 2 overs.

19:35 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
First over gone

Now then, Rahul facing Trent Boult. Off the mark in the second ball. Big appeal for lbw, and it's not given, though it looked pretty close! Was there an inside edge on it? New Zealand think of reviewing, but decide against it. Just 1 run off the over. IND 1/0 after 1 over.

19:31 (IST)
31 OCT 2021
Here we go!!!!

Ishan Kishan opens for India, as expected, but it's KL Rahul who walks out alongside him. No Rohit Sharma. India will look for a minimum of 165 on this pitch. If dew sets in, 180 will be a minimum needed. NZ have come in with the extra pacer and bowling first is just what they wanted with that decision. And Boult will open the NZ attack.

Will Boult spur NZ on?

India will have to contend with the speed of Boult. Here's the man himself talking about the depth of the Kiwi bowling lineup

? "The depth of fast bowling is really healthy in New Zealand."

Trent Boult believes the Kiwis can compete with the best because of the pace battery at their disposal ??#T20WorldCup https://t.co/duapKA8STB

On this day:

On this day, in 2005, MS Dhoni went into destroyer mode against Sri Lanka to notch up his highest ODI score. This time, Dhoni is in the mentor's role of the Indian cricket team. Can this throwback inspire them against a very game NZ?

1?8?3?* Runs
1?4?5? Balls
1?5? Fours
1?0? Sixes#OnThisDay in 2005, @msdhoni went berserk against Sri Lanka to notch up his highest ODI score. ? ? ? ? #TeamIndia

Watch that sensational innings ? ? pic.twitter.com/FgMEhzmXet

What to expect tonight:

At the outset, a must-win game against a bogey team is never good news. New Zealand has inflicted ‘dignified’ hurt on India twice at ICC events in the last two years. A third time at the T20 World Cup on Sunday might force the tournament’s most glamorous outfit into an early exit.

Hello and Welcome

Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the Super 12 match between India and New Zealand. Virat Kohli will be facing the most defining test of his captaincy career as he expects his men to be the proverbial “phoenix rising from the ashes” in Dubai today. Having endured a nightmare last Sunday against Pakistan, a match that they would like to forget in a hurry, India have a lot of course correction to do against the Kiwis, more so in getting the roles assigned for the players right.

It wont be easy against a quality New Zealand, which will come hard at India having also lost to Pakistan in their opening game. Tim Southee and Trent Boult, especially have been a nemesis for the Indians in big games. However, their soft underbelly is batting where Kane Williamson is still not hundred per cent and Martin Guptill also had a foot injury. It’s effective without being flamboyant, although, Devon Conway is a flashy batter. And herein lies India’s chance but for that, their bowlers need to implement the game plans perfectly, something they couldn’t against Pakistan.
