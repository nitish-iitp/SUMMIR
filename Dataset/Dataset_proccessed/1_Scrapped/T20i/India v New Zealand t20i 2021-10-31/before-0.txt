LIVE Cricket Score Pakistan vs New Zealand: T20 World Cup 2021 PAK vs NZ Match Latest Updates (AP)

Pakistan vs New Zealand, HIGHLIGHTS, T20 World Cup 2021 Match Latest Updates: Chasing 135, Pakistan started well as Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan added 28 runs for the first wicket. Tim Southee removed Babar Azam and Fakhar Zaman joined Rizwan in the middle. However, his stay was shortlived as he could only score 11 runs. Pakistan lost three more wickets after that before crossing the 100-run mark. Shoaib Malik and Asif Ali are in the middle right now.

Pakistan were absolutely brilliant in their opening game against India. And, after breaking their World Cup jinx and now, they will be gunning to take down New Zealand in Match 19 in Sharjah Cricket Stadium. Their captain Babar Azam has already said that his side will not sit back and revel in this glory as they have to be at their best against all sides in the upcoming matches.

“We have not just come here to win against India, we have come here to win the World Cup, always remember that,” the captain said after the match and this could well signal the approach of Pakistan in the match against New Zealand.

New Zealand, on the other hand, have not been in the best of forms as they come into this match after having lost their warm-up games against England and Australia. They are still sweating over the fitness of skipper Kane Williamson who is struggling with elbow pain.

Sharjah, pitch report:

The relaid pitch in Sharjah is slow and sluggish and it offers a lot of assistance to the spinners. However, as Sri Lanka showed in their win over Bangladesh, that run-scoring and chasing is not too difficult if batters chose the right ball and execute their strokes properly. Since dew might play a role, the captain winning the toss might be tempted to bowl first.

Sharjah Cricket Stadium, Sharjah records (T20):

Total matches played: 16

Matches won batting first: 9

Matches won bowling second: 7

Average 1st Inns score: 142

Average 2nd Inns score: 128

Haris Rauf Was Adjuged the Player of the Match

“I want to thank Allah. The team fielded very well and supported the bowlers. The fans supported us throughout and helped us to this win”, Haris said. “I’ve been playing here for two years. We support each other and discuss our plans with each other. That gives us confidence and support. Guptill’s dismissal was the key one. They were building momentum at that time. I just want to thank Lahore Qalandars, too, who supported me a lot. They’re the reason I’m here.”
