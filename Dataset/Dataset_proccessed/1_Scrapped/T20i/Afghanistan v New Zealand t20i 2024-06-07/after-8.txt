Goodbye for now!

That’s it from Afghanistan’s 83-run win against New Zealand at the T20 World Cup.

That match between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh is ongoing so do switch across to the remainder of our coverage of that one.

Then we are back on Saturday with holders England against Australia before it’s the big one on Sunday between India and Pakistan in New York.

For now, though – from me, Kevin Hand – it’s goodbye.

The reactions to Afghanistan win start to come in

Afghanistan has been playing the best cricket in the last few major tournaments, of course if they beat any big teams now, we can't call it upsets, they have quality batsmen and quality bowlers, Which they have been better and better day by day. Congratulations Afghanistan to…

Rashid Khan hails ‘one of the greatest’ Afghanistan performances

“It’s one of the greatest performances from us, especially in T20 and against New Zealand – a big team,” the Afghanistan captain said at the post-match ceremony.

“It wasn’t an easy wicket to score on but they [the openers] took it deep. It’s a great win and a great feeling to lead this win against New Zealand.

“Anything 160-170 that we score on these wickets then we are going to have a chance with our bowlers.

“The seamers and the spinners started well – especially Nabi. If we use our skills, it will be very hard for the opponents to score runs.

“We have to give 100 percent effort and energy whether we win or lose. For me, effort is everything – I don’t care about losing or winning. The energy around the team makes me more happy.”

New Zealand captain Kane Williamson admits shortcomings

“Congratulations to Afghanistan. They outplayed us in all aspects of the game,” he said at the post-match ceremony.

“They scored a good total on a tough surface but it simply wasn’t good enough for us.

“You’re dealt the cards you are dealt and the boys have been working hard for this game, but we will move on quickly because the tournament is short.

“It’s about taking a step in the right direction first because that performance was not good enough. We know we have a challenge coming up in West Indies, but it’s about us being better.”

Gurbaz is Player of the Match

“We were waiting for this victory for three years – finally we beat them,” he told the ICC broadcast after top scoring with 80.

“The trust was there from the very start that if we could beat any team in this competition it was New Zealand on this wicket.

“We were very happy with the total. We were a little frustrated in the middle. I didn’t start the way I wanted but in the end, I played some good shots.

“The boys bowled really well and against a team like New Zealand.”
