2024 T20 World Cup news updates
Rohit Sharma requests New York police to have go easy on pitch invader

During India’s warm-up game with Bangladesh in the T20 World Cup, a fan breached security and ran on the ground in New York towards Rohit Sharma. The number of pitch invaders have risen alarmingly in the recent past and the New York Police Department were on their toes as they locked down the fan on Saturday. The India skipper, however, was seen asking the personnel to have mercy on the intruder.

Ravindra Jadeja’s controversial non-stumping

Ravindra Jadeja survived being stumped on the first ball against Bangladesh after the camera angles proved inconclusive during the warm-up game. Walking out to bat after the fall of Suryakumar Yadav’s wicket in the 17th over, Jadeja looked to slog Tanvir Islam across the line and missed. Wicketkeeper Litton Das whipped off the bails and appealed for a stumping. No part of Jadeja’s foot was behind the line but the TV umpire ruled him not out with the camera angles not providing enough evidence to rule him out.

Corey Anderson picks up wicket with first ball for new team in the T20 World Cup

Corey Anderson, who represented New Zealand from 2012 to 2018 and played in the 2014 and 2016 T20 World Cups, is representing co-hosts United States of America in the 2024 edition. He became only the fourth bowler to pick up wickets for two teams in the men's T20 World Cup, after Roelof van der Merwe, Dirk Nannes and David Wiese, when he dismissed Navneet Dhaliwal on the first ball he bowled in the tournament against Canada.

Mitchell Marsh confirms he won’t bowl in the initial part of T20 World Cup

Australia skipper Mitchell Marsh, who was ruled out of the IPL due to a hamstring tear, has been recovering slower than he had initially hoped for. He will not be bowling in the T20 World Cup initially as a result. Marsh did not bowl in Australia’s warm-up games against the West Indies and Namibia either but hopes to recover fully towards the latter half of the event.
