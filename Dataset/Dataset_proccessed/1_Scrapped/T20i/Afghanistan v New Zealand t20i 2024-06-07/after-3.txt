NZ will hope for a winning start

New Zealand will start their campaign in the T20 World Cup 2024 as they take on Afghanistan on Friday, June 7 (Saturday, June 8 IST) at Providence Stadium, Guyana. The Kiwis are coming into the tournament after having a 2-2 tied series against Pakistan in April. However, most of the players of the T20 World Cup squad were not a part of the series.

New Zealand will be led by their star batter Kane Williamson and boast of a strong squad having the likes of Glenn Phillips, Daryl Mitchell, Rachin Ravindra, Trent Boult, and Lockie Ferguson among others in their team. The Kiwis have been a regular feature in the knockout stages of the T20 World Cup since the 2016 edition, however, they’ve failed to lift the coveted title.

Hence, Williamson and his men will be eager to end their drought in the ongoing edition and start the tournament on a winning note. On the other hand, Afghanistan are coming into the game having beaten Uganda by 125 runs in their opening fixture. The Rashid Khan-led side has several match-winners in their team capable of taking any opposition by surprise on their day.
