YOUR SAFETY IN AND AROUND THE GROUND

The Kia Oval takes the safety and security of all guests very seriously and as such, there will be enhanced security measures in place for all our events.

When arriving to the ground by foot, please use the pedestrian crossings at both the Vauxhall and Oval end of the ground as the roads are very busy. If you arrive using TfL’s London Santander Cycles, please ensure that you park them in the allocated docking stations.

We strongly advise that all fans arrive to the ground early to avoid any delays in entering. The gates will be open 2 hours prior to the start of the matchday.

Please be aware of the risks of cricket balls entering the stands from the field of play. We ask that all fans stay vigilant of airborne cricket balls whilst in their seat and in the vicinity of the playing field. It is also important for fans to be cautious of ball games when walking around the concourse of the ground, particularly during breaks in play.

Wristbands will be handed out by Kia Ambassadors to children at the gates. This will allow parents and guardians to add their contact details to; so that in the event of a child being lost, a member of staff will be able to help.

GROUND MAP
WHAT YOU CAN BRING?

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has implemented a ban on the importation of alcohol, glass containers and metal cans. Following close consultation with the Police and Health and Safety advisors, alcohol will not be permitted on Vitality Blast match days.

Due to the availability of space, we advise all fans to avoid bringing any large luggage items into the ground. All bags that you bring into the ground must be able to be stored under your seat and kept with you at all times.

A complete list of prohibited items include; alcohol, glass, cans, musical instruments, flares, laser devices, air horns, fireworks, weapons and whistles.

ACCESSIBILITY

As we are constantly striving to improve our standards, facilities and attitudes accordingly, we have launched a non-visible disability wristband. This optional wristband will enable fans with a non-visible disability to easily identify themselves to Club staff on match-day, should they need any assistance, without having to give an explanation or the nature of their disability. Staff can then support the individual in the appropriate way.

If you require a wristband, please collect it from Pavilion Reception upon arrival or email accessibility@surreycricket.com and one will be posted to you ahead of the match.

Fans attending with accessible needs can view our access guide here.
