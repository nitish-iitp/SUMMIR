India vs Afghanistan Live Score, IND vs AFG 1st T20I: Rinku Singh gives special mention to MS Dhoni!

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, IND vs AFG 1st T20I: Playing the role of a finisher in the series opener, Rinku Singh gave MS Dhoni a special mention after India eased past the visitors at Mohali. Rinku recalled his interaction with CSK legend Dhoni following India’s win over Afghanistan. Rinku remained unbeaten on 16 off 9 balls.

"I have got a habit of batting at 6 and finishing games, I'm feeling very happy with this job. Enjoyed the cold conditions, it was tough while fielding though. I just try to talk to myself, batting at 6, I don't have the chance to face too many balls or score too many runs, that's the thing I keep telling myself. I've spoken with Mahi bhai (MS Dhoni), he just told me to react according to the ball, keep your calm and I just do the same thing. I don't think a lot while batting, just react to the ball," Rinku said after the match.
