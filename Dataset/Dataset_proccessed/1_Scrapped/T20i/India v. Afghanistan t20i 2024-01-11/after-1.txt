IND vs AFG highlights: Mohali: India's batter Shivam Dube celebrates after scoring a half-century during the first T20I cricket match between India and Afghanistan, in Mohali, Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024. (PTI Photo/Kamal Kishore)

IND vs AFG 1st T20 highlights: Shivam Dun starred with 60 as India defeated Afghanistan by 6 wickets to go 1-0 up in the 3-match T20I series. India were in a fix early after they lost Rohit Sharma and Shuvman Gill early. Dube would then step up and form crucial partnerships with Jitesh Sharma and Tilak Varma as India successfully chased down the target. Earlier, Mohammed Nabi top scored for Afghanistan with 42 as India restricted the visitors for 158/5.

Rohit Sharma had won the toss and opted to bowl first against Afghanistan for the three-match T20I series. Although he is unavailable for the first game, Virat Kohli has been involved in the squad, indicating that the duo will likely participate in the 2024 World Cup in The West Indies and the USA.

With both the batters taking up two of the spots in the batting order, the onus is on other youngsters to take their opportunity for the remaining slots in the absence of players like Shreyas Iyer and Ishan Kishan. As per bowling, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammad Siraj, if fit and firing, will take their spots for the World Cup, but for this series, all eyes will be on Arshdeep Singh and how he will go. He can give that left-arm variety to the side in the showpiece event.

India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 1st T20: Shivam Dube stars with 60 as IND defeat AFG by 6 wickets

Well, that's that India beat Afghanistan by six wickets here. Shivam Dube can take a lot of confidence from this inning. Another positive for India is these runs have been chased on the back-off runs from the middle-order batters, unlike the usual template chases India tends to do with the top order doing the bulk of the scoring. On the other hand, Afghanistan will be looking at how they batted in the powerplay and the bowling options they chose to use in the middle overs when there was one left-hander following the other and letting the pressure ease on the batters with bowling seam bowlers. Going into the next game in Indore, they might consider bringing Noor Ahemd into the team as well. That's that from us today catch for all the updates from Indore on Sunday.

11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 1st T20:After 17.2 overs IND 155/4, Dube does no harm to his chances

Dube has played a handy knock here. All the all-rounder needs is an excellent IPL to make himself in contention for the squad to World Cup, at least in conversation. One noticeable thing today has been that he has not looked slog the ball out of the ground but rather constructed the innings to perfection. He rotated strike when he had to build partnerships and is now looking to finish the game as quickly as possible. 

22:02 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 1st T20: After 16.3 overs IND 146/4, Dube plays a good hand

This is an important inning for Dube as in the future when Hardik might be injured, he may be an option India can turn to. Also, with the ball, Dube had a good day. He bowled tight lines and lengths and picked up the wicket. With less than 20 runs to get, it looks like India will take the lead in the series. 

21:58 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 1st T20: After 15.3 overs IND 138/4, Dube changes gears

Shivam Dube has changed gears here. This has been a brilliant inning from the batter. He took his time initially, but as India approached closer to the target, he started attacking the bowlers. The problem with Afghan bowlers has been they are trying to bowl short, but the lines have been not good. 

21:49 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score, 1st T20: After 12.2 overs IND 108/3, Mujeeb strikes

The captaincy from Zadran has been poor. The game will be less than 20 overs, and he is looking to preserve his spinners, which is hard to understand. The Afghan pacers just struggled to put any pressure. As we update, Jitesh is trying to play a pull shot off, and Mujeeb gets himself out. We only have to wait and see if the wicket has come a bit too late. 

21:42 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
IND vs AFG 1st T20 Live Score: After 12.2 overs IND 108/3

Zadran has brought Gulbadin into the attack, and he also bowled an expensive over. He tried to bowl slower deliveries on a wicket that was not gripping. The game is drifting away from Afghanistan here. It is hard to understand why Zadran has been reluctant to bring spin back. 

21:37 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
IND vs AFG 1st T20 Live Score: After 11.1 overs IND 94/3

Just when it looked like Omarzai was bowling a good over, he threw one wide outside the off-stump, which Jitesh slammed for a boundary. It might be a good time for the skipper to bring a spinner back into the attack, as pacers are not able to exert any pressure at the moment. 

21:31 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
IND vs AFG 1st T20 Live Score: After 10 overs IND 83/3

Naveen is not looking good in rhythm. While the other bowlers might have put some sort of pressure, Naveen is not able to keep a lid on the scoring rate. Jitesh has walked into the middle a good cameo from him might seal the game for India. The run rate too seems to be pretty manageable for the hosts at the halfway mark.

21:27 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
IND vs AFG 1st T20 Live Score: After 9.1 overs IND 76/3

Tilak Varma, trying to replicate the hook shot he played against Naveen in the previous over, tried to do the same against Omarzai but got caught at fine leg. It looked like he was going to play a decent hand; however, not to be. Gulbadin, on the boundary, took a fantastic catch. 

21:21 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
IND vs AFG 1st T20 Live Score: After 8.1 overs IND 67/2

We have had a couple of big overs where India extracted 30 runs from the last two, releasing some pressure on them. Tilak Varma, in the over against Naveen, played a good hook shot on the leg side behind the square, and it looks like he got adjusted to the pace of the wicket. 

21:12 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
IND vs AFG 1st T20 Live Score: After 6.2 overs IND 45/2

Mujeeb is in the middle of a brilliant spell here. Though he is not getting much of a turn, he has been hitting the stumps regularly with this new ball. He finished that batting powerplay with a maiden. Dube has come into bat at four. He has got the reputation of being a brutal hitter against spinners. If he spends some time in the middle we might see all those shots come out. Tilak Varma at the other end of the moment seems like he wants to bat a long innings. 

21:07 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
IND vs AFG 1st T20 Live Score: After 4.3 overs IND 30/2

Gill, who was looking in sublime touch, has now departed. Mujeeb got the better of the batter as Gurbaz stumped him. This is a poor start for India, chasing a mediocre total. Dube has entered the middle, and two off-spinners are operating from either end for Afghanistan. This is not a massive total to chase and the conditions are still excellent for batting. India needs to build a partnership here and look to take this game deep. 

21:01 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
IND vs AFG 1st T20 Live Score: After 3.3 overs IND 24/1

Shubman Gill has now played a dab shot on the leg side and a cut shot through the covers. It seems like he is going to put that runout behind quickly and focus on what the team needs to do. Mujeeb has taken the new ball from the other end, something which we have seen often with Afghanistan in white-ball format. Tilak Varma has walked into the middle Mujeeb bowling to the left-hander might be a good match for Afghanistan. 

20:52 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
IND vs AFG 1st T20 Live Score: After 1.2 overs IND 6/1

Rohit Sharma departs early here in Mohali. The batter drove one down the ground of Farooqi's delivery, which the mid-off fielder stopped, and the Indian skipper called for the run and reached the other end. However, Shubman Gill, who was ball-watching, did not respond and had both the players at the same end, and eventually Rohit gave up his wicket. 

20:37 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan 1st T20 Live Score: Mohammad Nabi's innings take AFG to 158/5 in Mohali

Mohammad Nabi's innings has taken Afghanistan to 158/5. Things would have looked much worse for the visitors if not for his cameo in the middle overs. It is a pretty chasable total unless one of the Afghanistan bowlers delivers a spell of a lifetime; as per India's bowling, they did a fantastic job on a flat wicket.

20:26 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score: After 18.3 overs AFG 135/5

Mukesh Kumar picks another one in Nabi of that final ball of his spell and bowls another excellent over backing Arshdeep's previous one. With all the momentum Afghanistan has gained in the middle overs, they are losing it now. They looked like they could have gotten 170 at a certain point in the game, but now it seems farfetched. 

20:17 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
IND vs AFG 1st T20 Live Score: After 17.1 overs AFG 125/4

Arshdeep Singh bowled a good over after a few overs, which have gone for plenty. Rohit still needs to get an over out of Dube, Sundar, or Bishnoi, and it will be interesting to see who he will go to at this stage of the innings. As we update, Omzarai, trying to play a wide ball over covers, gets the inside edge onto the stumps of Mukesh delivery.

20:12 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan 1st T20 Live Score: After 16.2 overs AFG 121/3

Nabi is playing a crucial knock here for Afghanistan. He is changing the complexion of this batting inning. If Afghanistan can get themselves to around that 170 mark, they might have a chance to fight with the ball in the second innings. Omarzai, at the other end, too, has played a lovely hand so far.

20:04 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score: After 14.5 overs AFG 104/3

Omarzai and Nabi are looking to get a move on here. They are playing quite a few shots and connecting them to perfection. Bishnoi has been taken for quite a few runs here. Because he tends to bowl deliveries where the ball goes into the right-hander, it is playing into the strengths of Afghanistan batters. This partnership might just keep Afghanistan in the game. 

19:56 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
IND vs AFG 1st T20 Live Score: After 12.3 overs AFG 66/3

Shivam Dube gets his second over here. He must be bowling quite a bit in the next few months. We have seen how much this Indian team's balance has to be changed when Pandya gets injured. So far, Dube has looked good. The challenge for him would be to get through an over or two in the Powerplay. 

19:51 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan 1st T20 Live Score: After 11.2 overs AFG 66/3

Bishnoi has been brought into the attack now. He is the third spinner in the side. With three wickets already fallen, it must not be much of a challenge for Bishnoi, especially with the variations he has got. Afghanistan batters, on the other hand, need to get a move on now. 

19:47 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score: After 10 overs AFG 57/3

Right before the drinks break, Afghanistan loses another one. Rahmat Shah tried to cut the ball and got the under edge to hit the stumps this time. Axar was brilliant against Australia in that five-match series. It is like he is carrying that good form here. 

19:43 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
IND vs AFG 1st T20 Live Score: After 9.5 overs AFG 57/2

Dube started with a good over here. Out of nowhere, India is in a dominant position in this game. Unless Afghanistan manages to get at least 160-170, it is tough to see how they will compete in this game with India's strong batting line-up. 

19:40 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan 1st T20 Live Score: After 8.3 overs AFG 51/2

There is the first wicket. It is Gurbaz who has struggled to get going throughout the evening. He eventually tried to hit Axar Patel on the leg side but missed the ball and got stumped. As we update, Dube, who has been brought into the attack, picks up Zadran. The batter tried to play the ball through the covers and hit it straight to Rohit Sharma. After looking like, they have got a solid start. Afghanistan has lost a couple of quick wickets here. 

19:31 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score: After 6.2 overs AFG 35/0

Mukesh Kumar closes the Powerplay. He bowled a decent over again. It has been a good power play for India. Zadran and Gurbaz, despite being attacking in nature and the wicket being good to bat on, could not capitalize on these first six overs. Only time will tell if it's just a hangover of that ODI World Cup or if this is how they will play moving forward.

19:27 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
IND vs AFG 1st T20 Live Score: After 5.4 overs AFG 28/0

Spinners Axar and Sundar have been brought from either end, and they have started well. Both bowled quicker through the air and kept targetting the pads of the batter. However, India could not pick wickets yet; so far, so good for Rohit Sharma, as the Afghanistan batters haven't gotten to a flying start here either. Afghans need to get a few big overs quickly here, as do the Afghans. 

19:19 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan 1st T20 Live Score: After 3.4 overs AFG 19/0

Ibrahim, trying to hit the ball over the mid-off region, gives Shivam Dube a chance, which he spills. Only time will tell how much that will cost India. Axar Patel has been brought into the attack. Though the wicket is not slow, it might be sticking in the surface a bit because of its moisture. 

19:14 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score: After 2.3 overs AFG 12/0

Mukesh Kumar did bowl a decent over but could not get the same swing as Arshdeep could get from the other end. He was looking to bowl a bit more on the shorter side. It is very cool here in Mohali, so expect plenty of dew on the outfield. And it is quite an interesting call from Rohit to go with three spinners. 

19:09 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
IND vs AFG 1st T20 Live Score: After 1.1 overs AFG 0/0

Arshdeep Singh starts with a maiden here. The ball was swinging a bit, and Gurbaz, too, was a bit cautious in that over. We have Mukesh Kumar taking the new ball from the other end. There would have been expectations that Sundar might have taken that new ball but with the amount of grass, Rohit might have chosen to go with Mukesh. 

19:04 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan 1st T20 Live Score: We have a slight delay

Gurbaz has some problem with the side screen; hence, we have a few minutes of delay. Arshdeep Singh has taken the new ball for India

19:00 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score: Let's go

The wicket looks excellent, and the atmosphere is buzzing. Expect a high-scoring game here in Mohali. It will be quite an exciting series. Fasten your seat belts and enjoy all the action.

India vs Afghanistan 1st T20 Live Score: Ibrahim Zadran at toss

We wanted to bowl first as well, but it's not a big problem, we'll try and execute our plans. This is massive opportunity to get experience ahead of the T20 World Cup. We'll try and play some positive cricket. Noor Ahamad, Sharafuddin, Saleem Saifi aren't playing, forgot the rest of the guys. 

18:34 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score: Rohit Sharma at toss

We will bowl first. No particular reason, the pitch is good and it doesn't change a lot here. A lot to gain from the 3 games, we haven't had too much T20 cricket leading to the World Cup, there's IPL, but this is an international game and we'll try to achieve a few things. I had a chat with rahul bhai regarding the combination going forward and what we need to do as a group. That's what we'll try to do, but winning is the most important thing. Sanju Samson, Avesh, Yashashvi (who didn't pull off well) miss out.

IND vs AFG 1st T20 Live Score: Pitch report by Deep Dasgupta and Nick Knight

"Square boundaries - 65 metres and 68 metres, straight boundary - 76 metres. Nice tinge of green grass, it'll do a little bit for the quicker bowlers with the new ball. After that, it'll slide on quite nicely. The quicker bowlers have had problems here. The spinners have been flourishing on this surface. Not a lot (for the spinners). When you look at the Afghanistan spinners, you don't focus on what's gonna happen here (on the pitch), you focus on what's happening as the ball comes down. They bowl quick, so as a batter the decision making time is less. They rush you a little bit. I don't think there's going to be any dew. There wasn't last night, I don't think there will be today."

India vs Afghanistan 1st T20 Live Score: Why is this important

Less than six months before they kickstart their T20 World Cup campaign, India will play their last T20 series in the lead up – three matches against Afghanistan at home. The men in blue, who last played T20Is against South Africa, have played a total of 25 matches since the last T20 World Cup, claiming win in 16, and are one of the favorites for the 20-team tournament later this year

18:19 (IST)
11 JAN 2024
India vs Afghanistan Live Score: Ibrahim Zadran ahead of the game

Without Rashid, we will struggle as his experience is invaluable, but even in his absence, we have got quality spinners in Mujeeb [Ur Rahman], [Mohammad] Nabi, Noor [Ahmad] and Qais [Ahmad] All of them have played a lot of cricket, and we have trust in them.

IND vs AFG 1st T20 Live Score: : Rahul Dravid ahead of the game

As of now, we will be certainly opening with Rohit and Jaiswal. But when you have a squad, you have to have that flexibility to do whatever is required if that is in the best interest of the team and gives us the best chance to succeed.So nothing is closed. But certainly, we're really happy with what Jaiswal has done as an opener for us, and he gives us a left-right combination as well at the top.

India vs Afghanistan 1st T20 Live Score: Why no KL Rahul?

While Rohit and Kohli have earned a call-up, KL Rahul has to wait for now. Rahul has played almost all T20 International games as an opener. But with Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Kohli and Rohit in the squad, the top order slots are taken. The selectors believe wicketkeepers Jitesh Sharma and Sanju Samson are better suited as finishers, so Rahul missed out on a slot down the order too. The upcoming IPL will serve as a shoot-out for the two wicket-keeper’s slots for the World Cup.

Fast bowler Mohammed Shami is likely to miss the first two Test matches against England starting from January 25 as he hasn’t resumed bowling post his ankle injury. In another development, World’s No.1 ranked T20 batsman Suryakumar Yadav’s return to cricket could take longer as it is learnt that he is suffering from hernia and needs surgery. Yadav is expected to be completely fit by the time of the IPL.

India vs Afghanistan 1st T20 Live Score: Problem with Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli featuring in Indiaâ€™s T20 team

With six months to go for the next T20 World Cup, India are showing signs of drifting away from their T20 blueprint, in place for the past 14 months, by bringing in Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli back into the fold.

With their presence, two of the three in India’s top-order — which was identified as a problematic area — are back in the XI. Word around is that injuries to Ruturaj Gaikwad and Suryakumar Yadav opened up spots for the return of Rohit and Kohli, who as reported by this newspaper wanted to get back into the T20 fold. But with Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill already in the XI, including Shreyas Iyer as an option at No 3 and grooming Sai Sudharsan would have only made them stick to the plan. (READ MORE)

On Wednesday, The Indian Express reported that Ishan Kishan had been dropped from the T20 squad as the team management wasn’t happy with him asking for a break before the Test series in South Africa.

However, Dravid has said the left-hander will be back into the national fold once he makes himself available for selection, but he must perform in domestic cricke

India vs Afghanistan 1st T20 Live Score: Was it mistrust that resulted in the dropping of Ishan Kishan?

Days after he was dropped from the T20 squad for the home series against Afghanistan, wicketkeeper-batsman Ishan Kishan was in Vadodara, training alongside his new captain at Mumbai Indians – Hardik Pandya. His non-selection in the T20 squad is rapidly turning into a saga. There are those who connect it to the intrigue surrounding Team India’s T20 World Cup captaincy, others talk about the team management’s alleged mistrust of the player.

Making the situation even more complex was the 25-year-old’s recent demand for a break because of mental fatigue. (READ MORE)

India vs Afghanistan 1st T20 Live Score: India to bank on IPL for T20 WC preps

The three-match series against Afghanistan will be the last international games Team India will be playing before the T20 World Cup, which begins in June. The Indian coach admitted that there is no time to prepare for this year’s T20 World Cup, and the management will have to bank on the IPL to pick the team.

“Obviously, for the large part of last year and after the last T20 World Cup, we had to prioritise the ODI World Cup. There’s not a lot of games after the ODI World Cup in terms of the T20 format. So this T20 World Cup is slightly different from that perspective in the sense that there hasn’t been a lot of time to prepare for it, so we had to rely on the cricket we have and also a little bit on the IPL. The boys will play T20 cricket here, as well as the IPL. We might not get many opportunities to play together, so we just have to work around that and adapt,” said Dravid.

India vs Afghanistan 1st T20 Live Score: Will we see Kohli and Rohit opening pair in the later matches?

Dravid kept the door open for the possibility that Virat and Rohit could also be tried as an opening pair. “Nothing is closed (Kohli opening with Rohit). We have no doubt that the kind of ability and skill sets players like Rohit and Kohli possess, they will be able to find answers against different kinds of bowling,” said Dravid.

India vs Afghanistan 1st T20 Live Score: Why India need to find a spot to accommodate Yashasvi Jaiswal at the top?

When India brought back Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli back into the fold for the Afghanistan series, there was this inevitable question as to where they would bat. With Kohli unavailable for Thursday’s T20I because of personal reasons, India are set to open with Rohit and Yashasvi Jaiswal. But going forward, India head coach hasn’t ruled out the possibility of Rohit and Kohli partnering at the top, a move that totally deviates from the blueprint they have followed for the past 14 months. It also puts a question mark over the place of Yashasvi Jaiswal in the XI, who has by far been their best opening batsman in T20s. (READ MORE)

India vs Afghanistan 1st T20 Live Score: Jitesh Sharma over Sanju Samson?

As part of their attacking approach in the T20 format, the management has also given break to Jitesh Sharma, a lower order keeper batter with a penchant to clearing boundaries in the latter stages of the innings.

While Sanju Samson, a more experienced keeper-batter alternate with 24 outings under his belt, is part of the squad, the team management are likely to give Jitesh a longer rope ahead of the T20 World Cup. Adding another pinch hitter lower down the order as opposed to a top order batting alternative – of which there is no dearth already – in Samson, the former seems like a more suited choice.

This may be a final opportunity for Tilak Varma to mark an impression in Indian colors ahead of the T20 World Cup. Varma, who made his debut for India last year, has been a regular number three in the series against West Indies, Ireland, Australia and South Africa. In 14 innings, the southpaw has amassed 310 runs at a strike rate of 141.

India vs Afghanistan 1st T20 Live Score: Rohit Sharma set to open

India’s full time skipper across formats will be leading the team in the three-match series and is likely to be the opener for all three games. The absence of Ruturaj Gaikwad has been talked of as the reason behind Rohit’s return to the squad. The second highest T20I scorer of all time – behind Kohli – Rohit has four hundreds to his name in the shortest format to accompany 29 half centuries. He'll be opening with Yashasvi Jaiswal in this match as revealed by coach Rahul Dravid.
