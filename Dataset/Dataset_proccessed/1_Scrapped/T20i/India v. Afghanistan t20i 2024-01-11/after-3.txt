India vs Afghanistan, 1st T20, Highlights: Ind vs Afg: 

Chasing 159 runs, India lost four wickets, but Shivam Dube, Jitesh Sharma, Tilak Varma and Rinku Singh led the team to beat Afghanistan by 6 wickets at Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium, Mohali in the first T20 International on 11 January.  With this win, India lead the tri series by 1-0. 

India started their innings with a disappointing moment when skipper Rohit Sharma (0) was run out in the first over by Ibrahim Zadran. Following this, Shubman Gill (23) lost his wicket to Mujeeb Ur Rahman in the 4th over. Tilak Verma (26) gave some momentum, however, lost his wicket to Azmatullah Omarzai in the 9th over.

After this, Shivam Dube and Jitesh Sharma built a good partnership. But, Sharma (31) lost his wicket to Mujeeb Ur Rahman in the 14th over.

After this, Rinku Singh (16*) came to the crease and there was no turning back. Shivam Dube (60*) scored his second T20 half century and led India to beat Afghanistan by 6 wickets.

For Afghanistan, Mujeeb Ur Rahman took two wickets, while Azmatullah Omarzai picked one wicket. 

India vs Afghanistan Live Score Updates, 2nd T20

Earlier, Afghanistan settled for 158/5 against India in the first T20 International.

Mohammad Nabi was the top-scorer for the visitors, scoring a brisk 42 off 27 balls to prop up the innings.

Asked to bat first, Afghanistan skipper Ibrahim Zadran (25 off 22 balls) and Rahmanullah Gurbaz (23 off 28) added 50 runs in eight overs, but they could not force the pace during their stay.

Azmatullah Omarzai chipped in with a 22-ball 29.

Left-arm spinner Axar Patel was the most successful bowler for India, with figures of 2/23, while Mukesh Kumar bagged 2/33.

Earlier, India skipper Rohit Sharma won the toss and opted to bowl first against Afghanistan in the first T20 International.

Sanju Samson, Avesh Khan, Kuldeep Yadav and Yashashvi Jaiswal, who was finalised as one of the openers along with the captain on the eve of the first game, will miss the match due to injuries. Rohit said at the toss that Yashashvi "didn't pull off well".

Fans, however, will miss the services of veteran Indian batter Virat Kohli who was named in the Indian XI for the Afghanistan series but isn't available for selection in the 1st game owing to ‘personal reasons’. In Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav's absence, Shubman Gill is expected to take the number 3 spot while coach Rahul Dravid has confirmed that Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal will open the batting for India.

Meanwhile, Tilak Varma, Rinku Singh and Sanju Samson are also expected to find a place in the Indian playing XI, settling almost all spots in the top 6 Indian batting lineup. 

Afghanistan, on the other hand, have suffered a major blow ahead of the India series with star bowler Rashid Khan being ruled unfit to be part of the T20 series. 

Afghan coach Jonathan Trott seems to have taken Rashid's exclusion in good stride noting that it will be interesting to see who will stand up to take the key player's place.

Speaking at the pre-match press conference, Trott said, “Obviously, we are going to miss a player like Rashid, his leadership and the overall package he brings to the side. But it'll be good to see who is going to stand up and take responsibility and pressure, just a couple of months after the World Cup,"

When and where to watch the match?

India vs Afghanistan LIVE: Coach Rahul Dravid backs Ishan Kishan, Shreyas Iyer

India vs Afghanistan LIVE: Amid reports of Ishan Kishan telling lies to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), having mental fatigue, and then being seen partying in Dubai, Indian head coach Rahul Dravid defended the left-handed batter saying Kishan will be back into the national fold once he makes himself available for selection.

Despite not being a regular in the XI, Kishan has been one of the few Indian cricketers who has been a part of the squad in all formats for the past year or so. But when the name was not included in India's squad for the three-match T20I series against Afghanistan, eyebrows were raised.

“He told the team management that he had mental fatigue because he had been on the road continuously and wanted to spend time with his family back home. Instead, he chose to travel to Dubai and was seen partying," Hindustan Times quoted a source as saying.

India vs Afghanistan Live: Speaking at the pre-match press conference, coach Rahul Dravid said, "As of now, We're certainly opening with Rohit and Jaiswal.
