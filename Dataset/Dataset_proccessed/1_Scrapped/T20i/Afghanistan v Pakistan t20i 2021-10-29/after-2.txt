Asif Ali hit four sixes in the penultimate over to hand Pakistan their third win on the trot as they beat Afghanistan by five wickets and six balls to spare in a Super 12 game in the ongoing T20 World Cup 2021 at the Dubai International Stadium. Pakistan started cautiously as they scored 38 runs for the loss of one wicket in the first six over with Babar Azam and Fakhar Zaman holding fort against a spirited Afghanistan bowling. Afghanistan spinners Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Mohammad Nabi and Rashid Khan dismissed three batters as Pakistan required 47 runs in the last five overs with Babar Azam and Shoaib Malik in the middle. Pakistan skipper Babar Azam scored yet another half-century in 45 balls and remianed key to his team's chances in the run-chase of 148 runs. Batting first, Afghanistan's Mohammad Nabi and Gulbadin Naib ended strongly as they collected 43 runs in the last three overs to help the team post 147/6 in 20 overs versus Pakistan. Earlier, Afghanistan skipper Mohammad Nabi won the toss and elected to bat vs Pakistan. Imad Wasim, Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf and Hasan Ali jolted Afghanistan with four early wickets as the batting side ended the powerplay at 49/4. Afghanistan batters struggled to get going versus Pakistan bowlers as they lost six wickets before the end of 13 overs to be placed at 76/6. Both teams went into the match without any changes from their last respective encounters. Pakistan got the better of India by 10 wickets and then defeated New Zealand by five wickets comfortably to win their opening two games. Afghanistan, on the other hand, scripted a historic 130-run win against Scotland and will be no easy opponent for Pakistan. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the top two teams in their groups, with four and two points respectively. (SCORECARD)
