Pakistan vs Afghanistan Live Streaming: Pakistan are eying their third straight win.

T20 World Cup, Afghanistan vs Pakistan (AFG vs PAK) LIVE Streaming: Their confidence sky-high after two consecutive victories, Pakistan’s razor-sharp attack will test the prowess and maturity of Afghanistan’s impressive batters when the two teams clash in a Super 12 Group 2 match in the T20 World Cup today.

The impressive wins over India and New Zealand has made Pakistan the team to watch out in this tournament but the unpredictability factor that has always surrounded this team is something what their Asian neighbours can benefit from. The Babar Azam-led side will certainly go into this contest as favourites but Afghanistan is not a side that can be taken lightly now. A mix of powerful strikers and world-class spinners make them an exciting unit.
