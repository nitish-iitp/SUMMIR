AFG vs PAK Highlights T20 World Cup 2021 Live Updates: Pakistan beat Afghanistan by 5 wickets in their Super 12 match in Dubai. Asif Ali's late blitz, Babar Azam's 50, and the bowlers were the stars of the night. Follow AFG vs PAK highlights on the live blog.
AFG vs PAK Highlights T20 World Cup 2021.

Afghanistan vs Pakistan Highlights: Pakistan bagged their third win on the trot by beating Afghanistan by 5 wickets in Dubai. In their chase of 148 in 20 overs, Pakistan stuttered to 38/1 after 6 overs. They faced an early hiccup as Mujeeb Ur Rahman dismissed Mohammad Rizwan cheaply. Fakhar Zaman and skipper Babar Azam then steadied the team's ship, by finding regular boundaries and rotating the strike ably to register a 50-run partnership. They reached 72/1 after 10 overs. In the next 5 overs, they lost 2 wickets for 29 runs as Fakhar Zaman (30) was dismissed by Nabi, while Rashid Khan scalped the wicket of Mohammad Hafeez, With that wicket, he became the fastest bowler to 100 T20I wickets. Babar Azam reached 50 before being bowled by Rashid Khan. AFG picked up wickets in quick succession. But it was Asif Ali's unbeaten 7-ball 25 that took the side over the line with 6 balls and 5 wickets to spare. Earlier in the first over, courtesy of an unbeaten 35 each from Gulbadin and Mohammad Nabi, and their unbeaten 71-run stand, Afghanistan posted 147/6 in 20 overs. Earlier, we witnessed one of the most entertaining powerplays of the tournament so far. While Afghanistan blasted 49 in the first 6 overs, Pakistan managed to bag four wickets. Shaheen Shah Afridi, Imad Wasim, Hasan Rauf, and Hasan Ali bagged a wicket each. Wasim bagged one more wicket as Afghanistan, at the halfway stage, stuttered to 65/5. In the next five overs, the Afghans could only manage to add 28 runs, while losing Najib to Shadab Khan. Unbeaten Afghanistan, led by Mohammad Nabi, will bat first against Pakistan. Just like AFG, Babar' Azam PAK are also unbeaten and interestingly, both sides remain unchanged from their previous fixtures.

Thank you and goodbye!

Pakistan have gone three in three and I am sure they are now hot favourites in most people's books, if not everyone's. They have seemed the most complete and balanced side so far in the tournament and are pretty much through to the semifinals. We had a great time bringing you the action. Thank you so much for joining us. Tomorrow, Ashes rivals England and Australia will battle in the "Ring of Fire" in Dubai. Expect that to be a cracker as well.

Until tomorrow, this is Shivansh Gupta bidding you goodnight. CIAO!

Afghanistan vs Pakistan Live Score: Babar Azam, the winning captain

"We started well with the bowl, got a lot of wickets like we planned. Maybe gave away 10-15 runs too many at the end. With the bat, we couldn't capitalise the powerplay as we wanted to. At the end, with Malik and Asif Ali, we knew they could do the job. He (Asif Ali) is known for this and I was confident pre-tournament itself that he would deliver when needed."

Afghanistan vs Pakistan: Mohammad Nabi, the losing captain

"We didn't start well but the total on the board was a decent one for this pitch. We discussed that 150 would be a good score and so we dug deep. And then got some runs in the last few overs. I think three spinners are enough. Rashid bowled at the right time and we tried to take the game deep. Asif Ali played really well in the 19th over. Lot of positives from today's game. We fought really well till the end"

Asif Ali, the Player of the Match

Asif Ali is the player of the match. At the post-match presentation ceremony, he says:

"I would like to congratulate Pakistani and all our fans. I was confident of finishing it off from this end and that's what I told Shoaib Malik before he got out. I look at the situation of the match, and I target the bowlers accordingly. I was talking to Shoaib when I walked in to bat and I told him that I was confident enough of getting 20-25 in one over against Karim Janat, which I did."

AFG vs PAK: Asif Ali, take a bow

There was a time when teams would have pinch-hitters, a specialist position. However, that has become obsolete in this day of age where every batter and most bowlers can go big. But Asif Ali, for a second time running, has provided the picture-perfect finish

T20 World Cup: AFG vs PAK Live Score: PAKISTAN WIN BY 5 WICKETS

SIX! Full, into the slot and BAM! Asif Ali, the hero against NZ, is doing the job again. Goes big over long off

DOT

SIX! Asif Ali loves dealing in sixes and this is brilliant. Short from Janat and Asif Ali pulls it cooly for six.

DOT

SIX! THIS IS INCREDIBLE HITTING! Asif Ali has set Dubai on fire. The ring of fire is on fire. Once again, goes deep into his crease, clears the front leg and goes big over long off.

SIX! HE FINISHES IT OFF CARLOS BARTHWAITE STYLE! He goes over extra for six. Finishes on 25 off 7 balls.

AFG vs PAK T20 Live: Naveen-ul-Haq gets Malik, Afghanistan fight back

Naveen-ul-Haq to bowl the 18th.

DROPPED! OUCH! Shoaib Malik absolutely clobbers the ball back towards Naveen and he does well to hold onto it. Then he calls for the physio. Just need to address the knock.

OUT! HE IS GONE AND THIS IS GAME ON! AFGHANISTAN BELIEVE! Wide and full from Naveen. Malik throws the kitchen sink at it but ends up nicking the ball to the keeper.

PAK are 124/5 after 18 overs

AFG vs PAK Live: Rashid Khan to bowl out, cleans up Babar 

Right! Final over from Rashid Khan

SIX! WHAT A SHOT! Shoaib Malik says there is no time to show respect to the dangerous Rashid. Instead, I will go down on one knee and muscle the ball over cow corner for an 82-m six. WOW!

DROPPED! THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE! A top edge from Babar and Naveen-ul-Haq, who took a beauty to remove Rizwan drops a sitter

GONE! BOWLED HIM! FOR SURE THIS TIME, BABAR IS OUT! After being dropped and saved by DRS, Babar eventually falls on 51 to Rashid Khan. Plays across the line and castled.

PAK are 122/4 after 17 overs.
