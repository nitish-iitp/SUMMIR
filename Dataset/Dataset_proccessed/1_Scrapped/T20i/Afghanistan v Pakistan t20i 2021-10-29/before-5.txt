PAK vs NZ Live Score T20 World Cup 2021.

Pakistan vs New Zealand Highlights: Pakistan bagged their second win on the trot by defeat New Zealand by 5 wickets in Sharjah. In chase of 135, Pakistan got to 30/1 by the end of the Powerplay. Tim Southee bagged his 100th T20I scalp as he removed skipper Babar Azam on 9. Then, Ish Sodhi, after being hit for a huge six, got his revenge as he trapped Fakhar Zaman LBW plumb in front. PAK got to 58/1 after 10 overs. The Men in Green lost three more wicket in the next four overs to stutter to 91/5. The highlight of the phase of Devon Conway's freakish, outrageous boundary-line catch to help Mitchell Santner dismiss Mohammad Hafeez. Eventually, the duo of Asif Ali (27* off 12) and Shoaib Malik (26* off 20) put up a winning 48-run stand to take their side home with 5 wickets and 8 balls to spare.  Earlier in the first innings, New Zealand started steady as they reached 42/1 by the end of the Powerplay. Martin Guptill, 17 off 20, was cleaned up Haris Rauf in the 6th over. In the next four overs Imad Wasim removed a dangerous-looking Daryl Mitchell and Mohammad Hafeez sent Jimmy Neesham packing on 1 as the Black Caps reached 60/3 after 10 overs. Skipper Kane Williamson stitched a few boundaries and just as a stand with Devon Conway started to build, Hasan Ali caught Kane short of his crease with a direct throw. NZ reached 100/4 after 15 overs. Eventually, Haris Rauf removed Conway, Phillips in the same over and finished with a four-wicket haul. NZ posted 134/8 in 20 overs.

Pakistan's Babar Azam, the winning captain, speaks

“Feels great to win and we'll look to carry forward the confidence. The spinners started off brilliantly, and Haris and Shaheen carried it through. I would like to compliment our fielding, that has carried us through here. I thought we gave 10 runs too many. But this cricket and it happens. While batting, there were wickets early on and we needed a partnership. Malik showed experience and Asif Ali contributed too. Every match is crucial. There is no easy match. We'll look to play it day by day and game by game.”

Kane Williamson, the losing captain, speaks 

"It is very disappointing. We were optimistic at the halfway stage. It was going to be really tough, we were a boundary or two at being above par. There were small margins, but we couldn't nail it at the back end. Credit to Pakistan, they are a strong side and were very smart. I thought our bowlers were outstanding for 80% of the game. Quite tough to swallow. We were going into the second half, but this is a very good Pakistani side and are a team to watch. It is a game of small margins, we go to a different venue against India. We will have conversations and play accordingly. There were a few good decisions, but there are very small margins in these low-scoring games."

T20 World Cup Live Score: Haris Rauf is the Player of the Match 

“I am happy with the performance, thanks to the team, the fielding unit, the support staff and the fans for all the support they've given us. There's competition in the bowling unit, we talk with each other, assess the conditions and we do get confidence from each other. The wicket of Guptill in the powerplay was the best amongst the four wickets. Thankful to everyone, keep supporting us right through”

18.1 – 1 run

LATE SIGNS OF CONCUSSION, AS IT LOOKS LIKE! The physio is back out and Asif Ali is probably showing late signs of concussion. Hope he is okay

Pak need 8 from 11. I am sure he would try his best to stay out there and finish the job. 

Right, he is good to go!

18.2 – DOT BALL

18.3 — SIX! DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE INJURY HE SAYS. Short from Boult and he muscles the pull shot over cow corner for 6

PAK vs NZ Live Score: Malik joins the attack

Asif Ali is fine and we are back underway!

FOUR! Short, slow and wide from Santner. The experience of Malik allows him to cut it past point for 4.

SIX! THAT IS HIGH INTO THE NIGHT SKY AND IT LANDS IN THE STANDS! Tossed up again and Malik goes down the ground and hits it right over the bowler's head for a six. Full face of the bat. 
PAK are 126/5 after 18 overs.
