Commentary
3:47 PM IST Right then, that is it from this T20I series where it ends 1-1 between England ​​​​and Australia. The trophy has been presented to both the captains, Phil Salt and Mitchell Marsh as they lift it together. Now, both teams will be shifting their focus on the 5-match ODI series. The first game will be played on 19th September, Thursday at 11.30 am GMT, but as you know, you can always join us early for all the build-up. Until then, cheers and goodbye!
3:44 PM IST Phil Salt, the captain of England says that he is proud of the way the team came back after being pushed back in the first game and is disappointed with the way the series ends. Adds that the brand of cricket they play is a big positive and they want to win bilateral series' and then focus on bigger tournaments. Concludes that he has enjoyed the challenge and added responsibility of captaincy.
3:43 PM IST Mitchell Marsh, the skipper of Australia says that it would have been nice to finish with a deciding match but onto the ODIs now. Adds that Jake Fraser-McGurk is an exciting talent and they gave a chance to the young players in Scotland and everyone had different roles across the five games. Ends by saying that they will have a few players coming back into the side but it is always nice to see a young group perform in England.
3:41 PM IST Liam Livingstone is the PLAYER OF THE SERIES for his all-round performance with both bat and ball (124 runs and 5 wickets). He says he has enjoyed his cricket and is glad to be involved more in the game. Adds that he likes to bat wherever possible and loves to represent England but to be sent up the order was great.
3:37 PM IST Jos Buttler is named the T20 PLAYER OF THE SUMMER for his excellent performances in the T20I series against Pakistan and the T20 World Cup 2024.
