In short:

Former Test skipper Ricky Ponting says T20 star Jake Fraser-McGurk has the capability to star in Tests and ODIs for Australia, if given the opportunity to build his international career.  

Ponting, who coached Fraser-McGurk in the IPL, spoke to the young batsman after his tough start to Australia's tour of England, before the 22-year-old made his first T20I half-century in Cardiff.   

What's next?

Australia plays England in the final T20 international in the three-match series on Monday morning Australian time.

Ricky Ponting is backing T20 phenomenon Jake Fraser-McGurk to become a star for Australia in all formats of international cricket.

Batting great Ponting, who's helped hone the brilliant 22-year-old while coaching Delhi Capitals in the IPL, was thrilled to see his protege blasting to his first international half-century during the defeat against England in the second T20I clash at Cardiff.

The former Australia captain hailed Fraser-McGurk as "a very exciting young package", adding that "the scary thing is that I think there's a whole lot of improvement to come."

Yet, Ponting believes Fraser-McGurk, who proved a sensation in India with his 330 runs at an incredible strike rate of 234, is far more than just a stand-and-deliver T20 merchant, suggesting his talent could allow him even to shine in the Test arena.

A five-wicket haul by Australia's Matt Short cannot stop England — led by a brilliant knock of 87 by big-hitting Liam Livingstone — from winning the second T20 international in Cardiff, to level the series.

"It's really pleasing to see. Everyone who saw him tonight would realise the talent that he has got," Ponting told Sky TV in Cardiff on Friday, after Fraser-McGurk took advantage of his recall because of captain Mitch Marsh's illness by compiling a superb 29-ball half-century.

After Fraser-McGurk had been dropped for the opening match following a difficult baptism in British conditions on the Scottish leg of the tour, during which he was dismissed for a duck twice, Ponting revealed he had "reached out" to encourage the youngster.

Fraser-McGurk responded brilliantly when given the chance at Sophia Gardens, even if there is no guarantee he will play in the T20 series decider in Old Trafford on Sunday, with the scores locked at 1-1.

"The unfortunate thing for him is he probably going to go straight back out at the team next game when the skipper comes back," said Ponting.

"But he's a very bright talent. I think he's got the capabilities to play all three formats for Australia. I think he's good enough to work it out.

"If he gets an extended run in this format, he'll find himself in the the one-day side as well as the T20, I'm sure.

"And then over the next couple of years, with some more first-class cricket, I think he can turn out to be a three-format player for Australia."

Australia will be looking to achieve their first triumph in a bilateral men's T20 series against England since 2014, following losses in 2020 and 2022, but they must also beat the notorious Manchester weather with Sunday's forecast of rain hardly promising.

The likelihood is that Josh Hazlewood, whose recovery from a calf injury is being managed carefully, will be given the nod to return for the decider.

Ponting feels the key could lie in how Adam Zampa, the man he considers Australia's "most important player", now responds to his legspin having been dispatched with such impetuous brilliance by England's own exciting new boy, Barbadian-born all-rounder Jacob Bethell, in the Cardiff defeat.

"Bethel was good enough to take Zampa down," noted Ponting, after the 20-year-old left-hander took a match-changing 20 off the spinner's third over, featuring two sixes and two fours.

"If teams do get the better of Adam Zampa, Australia find it hard to win. He's gone for 37 runs, no wickets, and he's the key for Australia through those middle overs, to make the breakthroughs and break partnerships. That didn't happen tonight," said Ponting.

"When you get on top of a world-class, quality spinner like Zampa in game two of a tournament, he's the one that's under pressure next game."
