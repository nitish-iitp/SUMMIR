NEW DELHI: England cricketer Liam Livingstone says he's beginning a 'new career' after facing over two years of injuries.
The 31-year-old returned from ankle ligament damage to join England's T20 World Cup win in 2022, only to suffer a knee injury during a Test match in Pakistan shortly after.
Due to ongoing form and fitness issues, Livingstone is not part of England's current one-day international squad.
However, he is playing in the ongoing T20 series against Australia.
In the first match in Southampton, Livingstone showcased his skills by taking 3 wickets for 22 runs and scoring 37 runs off 27 balls, although England lost by 28 runs.

"I feel like a little kid again, I feel like I'm starting a new career to be honest," Livingstone said. "Life with niggles is not very fun.
"Mentally, more than anything, it feels really nice to be back playing cricket pain-free and I think, if I get back to my best, I feel like I'm an asset to any cricket team I play in.
"I'm back playing cricket with a smile on my face, that's when I play at my best. Fingers crossed it stays that way for a while."

Livingstone earned his reputation in white-ball cricket as a 'finisher' whose aggressive batting style made him valuable at the end of matches.
But on Wednesday he batted in the top four for only the ninth time in 49 T20s, and enjoyed the additional responsibility.
"Series like these where you get an opportunity further up the order, it's a chance for me to stake my claim," he said.
"I guess winning games of T20 cricket for England may enhance my chances of getting back into the one-day team. But it is what it is, I'm 31, I'm not going to sit here and cry about not being picked."
