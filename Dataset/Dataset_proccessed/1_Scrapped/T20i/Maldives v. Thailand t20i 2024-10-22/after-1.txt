India's Likely XI for 2nd Test vs New Zealand: After a high-flying Test series win over Bangladesh, the India National Cricket Team suffered a crushing defeat against the New Zealand side. The team that struggled in Sri Lanka dominated the game in Bengaluru and raised many questions over Team India’s approach to the game. Yet the side gave a tough fight in the second inning and bowlers also did their best to keep the side in the match. The second Test would be crucial as it could decide the outcome of the series. In this article, we shall take a look at how India's playing XI might be for the IND vs NZ 1st Test 2024. Virat Kohli Arrives In Pune After Short-Break In Mumbai Ahead Of IND vs NZ 2nd Test 2024 (Watch Video).

Indian team is placed right at the top of the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) 2023-25 standings and they consolidated that spot after winning the two-match Test series against Bangladesh 2-0. But the side will be looking for a far bigger picture as they will play against Australia next for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli will look to keep the Indian side’s current dominance in Test Cricket intact and return to action in Pune. Here are possible changes expected in the India vs New Zealand 2nd Test. IND vs NZ 2nd Test 2024: Assistant Coach Ryan ten Doeschate Confirms Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill Available As Team India Face Selection Dilemma in Pune.

Top-Order: Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal have formed quite a dominant partnership with a perfect right-left hand combination and their ability to go big early on. Rohit Sharma in particular needs to score in three figures but has experience to play on any surface. Yashasvi Jaiswal is proving to be an ideal partner for the Indian captain who is able to hold one end and at the same time can match Rohit’s strike rate when needed. While there was a bit of doubt regarding Shubman Gill's participation, with a report stating that the youngster has recovered and is available for selection. This raises questions over Sarfaraz Khan and KL Rahul’s selection. While Sarfaraz proved his ability to contribute in the recent match, KL Rahul’s form puts him in doubt for the place in the team.

Middle-Order: Virat Kohli can now bat down to his preferred position at four. However, Sarfaraz Khan and Rishabh Pant will form the middle order which was the mainstay of the Indian batting line-up in the first Test against New Zealand.

All-Rounders/Spinners: Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja will be the all-rounders for Team India in this match also. Duo delivered with the bat and ball in the first match. Even though they were unable to support Sarfaraz in the second inning, their experience and knack of picking wickets handed them direct entry into the Indian playing XI. David Warner Ready to Come Out of Test Retirement, Star Opener Claims to Be Available For India vs Australia Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25 If Selectors Consider: Report

Pace Bowlers: Jasprit Bumrah, Akash Deep, and Mohammed Siraj are in-form bowlers and will lead the attack once again. Mohammed Shami is working on his fitness and shall be analyzed for the series against Australia.

India's Likely XI vs New Zealand for 2nd Test 2024:

Rohit Sharma, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Sarfaraz Khan, Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravi Ashwin, Akash Deep, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj
