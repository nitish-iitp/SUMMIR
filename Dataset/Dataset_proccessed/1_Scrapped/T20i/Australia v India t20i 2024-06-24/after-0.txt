Righto, that’s my work here done. Congratulations to India for a consummate display and commiserations to Australia who gave it a good go. I hope the next few hours aren’t too twitchy as they wait to find out their fate. (Promise)

England will take on India in Guyana on Thursday, do join us for that one. Thanks for your company, goodnight!

Here is that Axar Patel catch that I was waxing very lyrical about. I stand by it.

Mitchell Marsh speaks (and is refreshingly honest):

It’s disappointing. We’re still technically a chance to go through but today India got the better of us. I think over the course of 40 overs there’s a lot of small margins, but honestly, India were the better team.

“We’ve seen for the last fifteen years what Rohit Sharma can do in that kind of mood and he got off to an absolute flier! In a run chase like that you’re still in it if you can keep it at ten runs an over for as long as possible. India were too good for us today. Come on, Bangladesh!”

Toddler safely in slumber. Let’s get some post match quotes.

Rohit Sharma is the Player of the Match.

His 92 off just 41 balls really was jaw-dropping, some of the stroke-play left this OBO scribe grasping for the right words. Any words.

It was a good wicket, and you want to try and back yourself to play your shots. I’ve been trying to do that for a few years now, and I’m glad it came off today. The fifties and hundreds don’t matter, I wanted to bat with the same tempo and carry on.”

It’ll be nice [to play England in the semi-final]. Nothing changes for us, we want to focus on what we can do as a team, and take the game on.”

I’m just going to grapple with a toddler for a minute or two, will be back shortly with the post-match reaction. Good game that – India too strong in the end, they picked up crucial wickets when they needed and stifled with spin through the back end.

INDIA WIN BY 24 RUNS!

Clinical display from Rohit’s men – they march onto Guyana to play England. Australia come up short and now have a nervous watch of Afghanistan v Bangladesh later on, calculator in tow, to see whether they can sneak the last semi-final spot.

So it's England v India in one semi-final (Guyana on Thursday), and South Africa v Afghanistan or Australia (or possibly, though not likely, Bangladesh) in the other (Trinidad on Wednesday).

Australia need 29 runs off the final over. Hardik Pandya is the man chosen to bowl it.

24 Jun 2024
20.13 CEST

19th over: Australia 177-7 (Cummins 8, Starc 3) Bumrah to finish his spell. Shot! Pat Cummins manages to flick a length ball away on the breeze for SIX! A jabbed single and a scampered two, along with a leg-bye, make it ten off the over as Bumrah finishes with 1-29 off his four overs.

Share
24 Jun 2024
20.11 CEST

18th over: Australia 167-7 (Cummins 1, Starc 1) The bowlers are going to have to get Australia close. 39 runs needed from 12 balls.

WICKET! David c Bumrah b Arshdeep Singh 15 (Australia 167-7)

Tim David flat bats a length ball from Arshdeep down the ground for four – nearly decapitating the umpire in the process! That was hit hard. SIX! A full toss by Arshdeep is given the treatment by David.

Gone now! Arshdeep gets his revenge – a length ball with a hint of tail away is edged to Bumrah at short third. David has to drag himself off the field.

17th over: Australia 153-5 (David 2, Wade 1) Matthew Wade joins Tim David. Wade gets a single to get David on strike. Bumrah finishes the over with a yorker that for once isn’t perfect – David digging out for two down the ground. Just five runs and the wicket of Head off the over – Australia need 53 from 18 balls. Bumrah has six of them up his sleeve.

WICKET! Head c Sharma b Bumrah 76 (Australia 150-5)

Bumrah wins the battle! A slower ball sorts out Travis Head as he mis-times a whip over leg that ends up in the hands of Rohit Sharma at short cover. Brilliant and brave knock from Head, but has he left too much to do?

Right then, here is the game, right here, right now. Jasprit Bumrah is coming on to bowl at Travis Head. The bowler has two overs left, the batter is well set on 75.

16th over: Australia 148-4 (Head 75, David 2) Arshdeep Singh to bowl the sixteenth. Gah! Four byes speared down the leg side are not what India are after but Australia will take them any which way. Decent over in the end though, lots of blockhole and only seven runs off it in the end.

58 runs needed from 24 balls

15th over: Australia 141-4 (Head 73, David 1) Tim David, no stranger to a massive hit, joins Head in the middle. Boundaries needed. There’s one. Head clears his front leg once more and flat bats for four. He pinches a single to keep the strike too. Australia need 65 runs from 30 balls – the game teetering on a knife’s edge.

WICKET! Stoinis c Pandya b Patel 2 (Australia 135-4)

Slipping away for Australia! Stoinis tries the reverse-sweep but spoons it tamely into the lap of Hardik Pandya at backward point. A lot resting on Travis Head now.

Share
24 Jun 2024
19.45 CEST

14th over: Australia 135-3 (Head 68, Stoinis 2) Head flat bats through midwicket to get four as Marcus Stoinis joins him at the business end. Seven runs and the wicket off Yadav’s over – he finishes with 2-24 off his four overs. Brilliant effort.

Share
24 Jun 2024
19.42 CEST
WICKET! Maxwell b Kuldeep Yadav 19 (Australia 128-3)

Huge moment! Yadav spins one from outside leg and Maxwell advances to biff it over the leg-side – as if in slow motion the bat comes down but the ball turns past it and into the stumps!

Share
24 Jun 2024
19.39 CEST

13th over: Australia 128-2 (Head 63, Maxwell 19) Axar jams the Aussie accelerator, just three runs eked off his speared deliveries. Pressure reverts back on to Australia. 78 runs needed from 42 balls.

12th over: Australia 125-2 (Head 62, Maxwell 17) The margins in this format are tiny. Yadav bowls five balls for just three runs but can’t get out of the over cleanly – his final ball is a smidge overpitched and Head pounces on it, driving up and over for SIX. Nine off the over – 81 needed from 48 balls. We’re going down to the wire here aren’t we?

11th over: Australia 116-2 (Head 55, Maxwell 15) Maxwell glides Jadeja through point for a clever four and then unfurls an audacious reverse hit for SIX. Australia well in this game with these two at the crease. A Maxwell reverse-sweep makes it seventeen runs off the over.

Australia need 90 from 54 balls.

10th over: Australia 99-2 (Head 54, Maxwell 0) Travis Head targets Hardik Pandya again, rocking back and cutting for four before an Axar misfield at long-leg (sublime to the… lackadaisical) gifts four more to see Head bring up FIFTY off 25 balls. His second of the tournament – the moustachioed one is keeping Australia in the fight once more.

Axar Patel, what a CATCH! 😱🙌 pic.twitter.com/kdrnAsLnf4

Here’s a still of the Axar catch. That is his non dominant hand and the ball was tracing through the sky off the middle of Marsh’s blade.

9th over: Australia 87-2 (Head 42, Maxwell) Glenn Maxwell is in at number four, Australia need him at his bombastic best right now. He’ll be at the non-striker’s end as Hardik begins a new over to Head.

19.20 CEST
WICKET! Mitchell Marsh c Patel b Kuldeep Yadav 37 (Australia 87-2)

WHAT A CATCH! Mitch Marsh nails a slog sweep off Yadav but doesn’t count on Axar patel leaping like a tickled salmon, timing his jump to perfection and hauling in the catch with two hands on the boundary edge. This isn’t hyperbole – I reckon that is catch of the tournament. Huge moment too as Marsh has to depart.

Share

19.17 CEST

8th over: Australia 83-1 (Marsh 35, Head 40) Hardik is given another. I think I might have gone for some Zampa but WhaddIknow? Nuthin’. Well – maybe a little – Head pulverizes a slower ball down the ground baseball style and follows up with a hack across the line to a back of a length ball that gets it Donovan* on and soars over the sponge for SIX.

Fourteen off the over. 123 needed from 72 balls.

That one’s for you, if you are reading, ma.

7th over: Australia 69-1 (Marsh 34, Head 27) Kuldeep Yadav coming on to open his box of tricks. Crucial period in the game incoming – the difficult second album tricky middle overs. Well bowled, Yadav holds his nerve against these two muscular Aussie’s and limits them to just four runs off his first over. A quieter over (anything less than eight runs…) really brings the pressure back on to Australia.

Share
24 Jun 2024
19.04 CEST

6th over: Australia 65-1 (Marsh 31, Head 26) Hardik Pandya replaces Bumrah. He’s been very effective for India with the ball in this tournament. Head smears him over long on for SIX third ball. Hardik does well for the next three balls – following Head as he moves around the crease trying to create room to free his arms. Nailed that one though, Head stands still and plonks a straight ball down the ground for a towering SIX.

Australia are up with the rate in St Lucia. Game on!

5th over: Australia 48-1 (Marsh 28 , Head 13) Axar Patel is given the nod by Rohit. Left-arm darts incoming. Two dots to Marsh. Something’s gotta give – sure enough – Marsh gets under a length pall and paddles it for SIX down to fine leg. An imposing sweep brings Marsh four more and he collects a brace with a controlled swipe to leg. 158 needed from 90 balls.

4th over: Australia 36-1 (Marsh 16, Head 13) Counter-punch from Australia. Head spanks Bumrah for three fours, stepping away to leg and flaying through the off side. Jasprit looking for some swing that isn’t there and serving up a full toss for the third boundary. Another decent over from Australia – Fourteen off it.

18.52 CEST

3rd over: Australia 22-1 (Marsh 15, Head 0) Marsh steers Arshdeep away for a couple of boundaries off the third over – he needs to deliver the ultimate captain’s knock here. That’ll help – Marsh rocks back and deposits a shorter ball into the crowd for Australia’s first SIX of the innings. Fourteen runs off the over.

Meanwhile – M’esteemed colleague TdL has been communing with the numbers:

Strange but true. #Rohit Sharma and Jos #Buttler have both faced 120 balls in this #WorldCup – a whole T20 innings. And they've both made 191 runs – a big T20 score. In the list of fastest scorers (min 50 runs) they are 8th=. Four other Englishmen in the top 10, no other Indians

2nd over: Australia 8-1 (Marsh 1, Head 0) Here comes Jasprit Bumrah. Not what you need with a big chase round your neck and a world cup semi-final slipping out of reach. A short ball nearly sees the end of Marsh who flaps at it somewhat but Pant can’t get round to the looping catch before it drops onto the turf. Just two runs off the over. All India at the moment.

1st over: Australia 6-1 (Marsh 0, Head 0) Travis Head joins Marsh in the middle, strife for the Aussies early on.

WICKET! Warner c Yadav b Arshdeep Singh 6 (Australia 6-1)

Arshdeep gets Warner caught at slip off his sixth delivery! Not the start Australia wanted at all. Safe hands at slip by Suryakumar Yadav who had to pull out the dive. Textbook away swinger to the left hander, Warner fenced and then hung his head. He hung his head.

That didn’t exactly go to plan for Mitch Marsh’s side after the Aussie skipper won the toss and asked India to have a bat. A big task coming up for their batting line up against Bumrah et al.

If Australia chase this in 17.4 overs or fewer, they will qualify for the T20 World Cup semi-finals

India set Australia 206 runs to win.

Pat Cummins strays into Jadeja’s swinging arc and is clobbered over midwicket for a SIX that brings up the TWO HUNDRED for India. In the end Cummins does well to keep it to ten runs off the final over.

18th over: India 181-4 (Dube 28, Pandya 12) Pat Cummins returns for his third over. Australia could do with another hat-trick from him right about now. Hardik and Dube deal in singles, before a short ball is overhead smashed away Sampras style by Hardik Pandya. Remarkable shot and breaks the shackles a little for India. Ten off the over in total – twelve balls to come in the innings.

17th over: India 171-4 (Dube 24, Pandya 6) DROP! What has happened to Australia’s catching in this tournament?! Mitch Marsh shells Pandya at backward point and it’s an epic goob. Another decent over from Australia in the back end, just five runs added to the India total. The last three overs have only gone for sixteen. Tide turning with three overs to go?

16th over: India 166-4 (Dube 21, Pandya 4) Josh Hazlewood deserves a big tip of the hat. He finishes with 1-14 off his four overs which feels like a remarkable triumph in the circumstances. Just four singles off his final over as he mixes up his pace and length very effectively.

14th over: India 155-3 (Yadav 27, Dube 18) Suryakumar launches a length ball from Stoinis back down the ground for SIX. Singles worked effortlessly and boundaries found with ease. Dube crunches a full one through mid on for four. 13 runs off the over – India going at over eleven runs an over and still have six overs left. That sound is the nervous clacking of a collection of Aussie fans as they type in ‘what is the highest ever T20I total ever?’.
