Lucknow Super Giants vs Delhi Capitals | LSG vs DC Live Score Updates, IPL Cricket 2024: KL Rahul Reflects on Lucknow's Performance
01 Jan, 2025 | 09:21 PM (IST)
Delhi Capitals' bowling unit is all set to face a tough challenge against an in-form Lucknow Super Giants in the upcoming IPL match at the Ekana Stadium.

After losing the first game, the host team, LSG, has won three straight games to take the lead in the points table. Meanwhile, DC has only won once in their last five games this season, leaving them at the bottom of the standings.

During their three meetings over the previous two seasons, LSG has an undefeated record against DC.

The Capitals are struggling with consistency, evident from their recent losses. Their Indian pace attack lacks depth and effectiveness, relying heavily on Khaleel Ahmed and Ishant Sharma. The return of Mukesh Kumar is awaited, hoping for an impact performance. Sumit Kumar and Rasikh Dar might face a tough challenge against LSG's strong batting lineup.

Anrich Nortje's form is a worry for DC, leaking runs post-injury. Rishabh Pant and Tristan Stubb stand out amidst the team's overall struggles. The team's over-reliance on overseas players is evident, with a lack of Indian talent depth on the bench hindering their performance.

Prithvi Shaw's contributions have been notable, but more consistency is needed. The performance of uncapped Indian players, except Abhishek Porel, has fallen short, adding pressure on the overseas recruits. DC's campaign in 2024 has been underwhelming, raising concerns about their overall team strength.

Lucknow Super Giants, on the other hand, appear well-prepared despite missing Mayank Yadav due to injury. In Yadav's absence, Yash Thakur shone with a five-wicket haul in the previous match. Alongside Thakur, Naveen-ul-Haq, Krunal Pandya, and Ravi Bishnoi will be key for LSG.

The team's opening pair, Quinton de Kock and KL Rahul, show promise, with Nicholas Pooran adding firepower in the late overs. However, Devdutt Padikkal's struggles are a cause for concern.

In conclusion, LSG's depth and form give them an edge, while DC's reliance on key players poses a challenge. The match promises an exciting contest between two contrasting teams striving for success in the IPL.

Squads:

Lucknow Super Giants: Quinton de Kock, KL Rahul(w/c), Devdutt Padikkal, Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, Yash Thakur, Naveen-ul-Haq, Mayank Yadav, Manimaran Siddharth, Deepak Hooda, Amit Mishra, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Arshad Khan, Kyle Mayers, Ashton Turner, Krishnappa Gowtham, Matt Henry, Prerak Mankad, Mohsin Khan, Shamar Joseph, Arshin Kulkarni

Delhi Capitals: Prithvi Shaw, David Warner, Abishek Porel, Rishabh Pant(w/c), Tristan Stubbs, Axar Patel, Lalit Yadav, Jhye Richardson, Anrich Nortje, Ishant Sharma, Khaleel Ahmed, Kumar Kushagra, Yash Dhull, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Sumit Kumar, Praveen Dubey, Mitchell Marsh, Kuldeep Yadav, Lizaad Williams, Ricky Bhui, Shai Hope, Mukesh Kumar, Rasikh Dar Salam, Vicky Ostwal, Swastik Chikara
