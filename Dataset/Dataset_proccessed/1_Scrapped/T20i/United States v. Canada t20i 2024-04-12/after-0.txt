ALL-ROUND SHOW BY HARMEET WINS SERIES FOR USA
By USA Cricket MediaApril 12, 2024

Houston, TX, April 12, 2024: A splendid all-round show by man of the match Harmeet Singh Baddhan, helped the USA men’s cricket team win the fourth T20 International (T20I) against Canada here at the Praire View ground by 14 runs. It also meant that USA have won the five-match bilateral series 3-0, with one more game left to play on Saturday. The third game of the series was washed out earlier.

After Canada won the toss and put USA in, Harmeet first blasted a 17-ball 34 coming in with USA in a spot of bother at 111-6, having just lost the set Corey Anderson for 28 (29) in the 16th over of the innings. He added a crucial unbeaten 48 with Shadley van Schalkwyk to lift the score to a more than respectable 159.

It turned out to be too much for the Canadians, who despite an enterprising 52 off 41 by opener Dilpreet Bajwa and a rear-guard 29 off 18 by skipper Saad Bin Zafar, fell to guile of Harmeet, who this time with his left-arm orthodox returned magical figures of 4/18 off his four overs.

In between a 75-run third wicket partnership between Bajwa and the talented Nicholas Kirton (28 off 33), had raised some hopes of a Canadian fightback, but the experienced Steven Taylor got Kirton to mistime a slash, to dash any such hopes.

 

USA-Canada T20I Bilateral series are being broadcast LIVE on the official USA Cricket YouTube Channel and Willow TV. The last T20I of the series will be held on Saturday, 13th April from 10am CST onwards.
