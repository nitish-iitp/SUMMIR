Scotland reach T20 World Cup Super 12 with historic win over Oman

The win takes Scotland past the opening round of any International Cricket Council global event for the first time.

Published Oct 21, 2021

Scotland sealed their spot in the next stage of the T20 World Cup on a momentous night for Kyle Coetzer’s side as they thrashed tournament co-hosts Oman by eight wickets to finish top of the group.

Despite prevailing in their opening two matches, Scotland knew at the outset they had to avoid defeat on Thursday following Bangladesh’s win over Papua New Guinea, owing to the Tigers and Oman having superior net run-rates.

But Coetzer fittingly returned to form after scores of nought and six in recent days with a fine 41 from 28 balls as Scotland negotiated a potentially tricky chase of 123 on a sluggish surface with 18 balls to spare.

Coetzer’s dismissal meant the responsibility of getting Scotland over the line fell to Matt Cross (26 not out) and Richie Berrington (31no), who ended matters with a swipe over midwicket for six.

Three wins take Scotland past the opening round of any International Cricket Council global event for the first time and they can now look forward to contests against heavyweight sides such as India, New Zealand and Pakistan.

Had Oman won this fixture, they would have finished level on four points alongside Bangladesh and Scotland. That would have dashed Scotland’s hopes of reaching the Super 12 stage, but they were collectively excellent in Muscat.

Oman were restricted to 122 all out after winning the toss, with Aqib Ilyas top-scoring with 37 from 35 balls, having earlier contributed to opening partner Jatinder Singh’s run-out.

But Josh Davey took three for 25 in which all of his wickets came in the last over, while Safyaan Sharif and Michael Leask took two scalps apiece.

Coetzer, though, was into his stride and clattered each of Zeeshan Maqsood, Fayyaz Butt and Mohammad Nadeem for six to ultimately take Scotland well ahead of the game before being bowled off his pads by leg-spinner Khawar Ali.

The downfall of the Scotland captain right on halfway left them needing only 48, ensuring Cross and Berrington could eschew risk, which they did as they settled for some hard running over the next three overs.

Berrington, who struck 70 off 49 balls in Tuesday’s win over Papua New Guinea, cast off the shackles with a couple of sixes in Khawar’s final over, taking Scotland past 100 and ensuring there would ultimately be no late twist.

Later in the over, Aqib flicked Brad Wheal for six and continued to favour the leg-side as he made up the bulk of the scoring in the first half of the innings before departing after an injudicious hack to spinner Leask.

Nadeem’s third ball went the distance after Wheal was brought back, but the Omani batter perished for 25 attempting to take down slow left-armer Mark Watt for a second successive six and from 79 for four the co-hosts struggled.

Zeeshan contributed a useful 34 from 30 deliveries to ensure Oman cleared 100, but the skipper was the first of the final three wickets to fall in four balls in a chaotic last over which saw Davey buttress his figures.
