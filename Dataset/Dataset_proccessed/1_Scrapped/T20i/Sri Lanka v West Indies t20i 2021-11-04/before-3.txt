Australian television legend Bert Newton has passed away in Melbourne aged 83.

Newton’s death comes after he had part of his leg amputated in May as the result of a toe infection which became a serious medical issue. Newton underwent a life-saving operation to give himself an extra six precious months with his beloved wife Patti and their six grandchildren.

Bert needed surgery after his toe became infected before Christmas and he was hospitalised in March before his surgery in May.

The infection was 'linked to his diabetes' and was threatening his life with Doctor's telling Mr Newton the surgery was a 'life or death decision'.  

Doctors reportedly told Bert that if he kept the leg then he would have just 'months to live' rather than years if he chose to amputate.

He consented to the amputation in May after spending six weeks at Melbourne's Epworth Hospital for a toe infection that had been steadily worsening. 

Bert with his Grand Children

Bert, a Logie Hall of Fame inductee, quadruple Gold Logie-winning entertainer and a radio, theatre and television personality, is survived by his wife, Patti, two children and multiple grandchildren.

Newton was known for his collaborations opposite Graham Kennedy and Don Lane on their respective variety shows, and appearances with wife, singer Patti Newton. Their two children were actor Matthew Newton and TV personality Lauren Newton.

Newton started his career in radio broadcasting, primarily as an announcer before becoming a star and fixture of Australian television since its inception in 1956, and was considered both an industry pioneer, icon and one of the longest-serving television performers in the world.

Newton was known for his association with both the Nine Network and Ten Network, in numerous shows including: In Melbourne Tonight, New Faces, Good Morning Australia, 20 to 1 and Bert's Family Feud.
