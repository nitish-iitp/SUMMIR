BOWLED HIM!

Hasaranga ends his spell with a wicket as he cleans up a rushing Bravo (2). The batter tries to go for the slog over long-on but the wrong 'un deceives him and the spinner gets his 16th wicket of the tournament. Record. WI: 131/8 (17 overs)

22:56 (IST)
04 NOV 2021
WI slump further

Another one bites the dust! Shanaka dismisses Holder (8) off a catch by Karunaratne. WI: 117/7 (15.2 overs)

22:48 (IST)
04 NOV 2021
WICKET! FOUR! FOUR! FOUR! BOWLED!

After Karunratne bagged his second of the night, removing Russell (2), Hetmyer (36*) assumes responsibility of the chase. He hits three fours to provide a surge but in the next over, Hasaranga bowls Pollard (0) out. WI: 107/6 (14.1 overs)

22:30 (IST)
04 NOV 2021
CAUGHT OUT!

A big wicket! The well-settled Pooran (46) tries to up the ante but fails miserably. He takes on Chameera and spoons it high and towards long-off where substitute fielder Dananjaya takes the catch. Next up, Russell. WI: 77/4 (11.1 overs)

22:22 (IST)
04 NOV 2021
Pooran provides some respite

Finally, West Indies are back amongst the boundaries. Pooran (44*) provides a surge as he manages to get the boundary he was desperately seeking. Hetmyer's on 7*. Nine runs off Theekshana's final over of the match. WI: 72/3 (10 overs)

22:13 (IST)

21:58 (IST)
04 NOV 2021
WICKET!

After Pooran's whirlwind of a start, hitting boundaries at will in order to stabilise the innings, Windies bounce back for a bit. But Karunaratne foils the comeback plans as he removes Chase (9) off a catch by Rajapaksa. WI: 47/3 (5.3 overs)

21:39 (IST)
04 NOV 2021
WI lose two wickets early on

A nightmarish start from West Indies! After scoring just a single run in Theekshana's opening over, the defending champions crumble in Fernando's over. First, the bowler sends Gayle (1) back off a catch by Hasaranga and then he doubles the pain on the last ball by cleaning up Lewis on 8. A huge wicket in terms of the contest. WI: 10/2 (2 overs)

21:20 (IST)
04 NOV 2021
SL end on 189/3, WI need 190 to win

After Russell sent Asalanka back to the pavilion on 68, Shanaka (25*) and Karunaratne (3*) guide their team to the fourth-highest total of the ongoing tournament so far. Nine runs off the last over, bowled by Rampaul. SL: 189/3 (20 overs)

21:08 (IST)
04 NOV 2021
SIX! FOUR! SIX! FOUR!

Some fine batting from Sri Lanka! Shanaka (16*) comes on in place of Nissanka and he absolutely skins Holder for a six and a four. Then, Asalanka (64*) punishes Bravo in the same fashion after reaching his fifty. SL: 170/2 (18 overs)

20:55 (IST)
04 NOV 2021
WICKET!

Bravo finally breaks the 91-run stand! He dismisses Nissanka (51) off a catch by Hetmyer at cow corner. The batter picks the slower one and delays his shot, picks it up and straight it goes into the hands of the fielder. SL: 137/2 (16 overs)

20:48 (IST)
04 NOV 2021
Nissanka brings up third T20I fifty!

With his fifth boundary of the innings, Nissanka (51*) brings up his fifty! Facing Rampaul, he swat-flicks one to backward square leg for a four. Asalanka (47*) joins the party with a brilliant pull shot, his sixth four so far. SL: 132/1 (15 overs)

20:33 (IST)
04 NOV 2021
SL cross 100-run mark

Asalanka and Nissanka continue to hit periodical fours. West Indies still searching for a wicket. SL: 101/1 (12 overs)

20:19 (IST)
04 NOV 2021
SL on the frontfoot

At the halfway mark, Sri Lanka are in a comfortable position. After hitting Bravo for a four through extra cover, Asalanka (24*) calms down and deals in singles in Holder's over. On the other end, Nissanka is on 26*. SL: 82/1 (10 overs)

20:09 (IST)
04 NOV 2021
Asalanka, Nissanka rally on

Asalanka (15*) comes in at number three and he wastes no time to find his groove in the middle! He smacks Russell and Hossein for two fours in tow consecutive overs and starts off a nice partnership with Nissanka (21*). SL: 67/1 (8 overs)

19:57 (IST)
04 NOV 2021
CAUGHT & BOWLED!

Perera's reign of terror is over! After hitting Rampaul for a six earlier, Perera tries to up the ante again but he gets a leading edge and Russell dives to his right for a caught & bowled! The batter departs on 29. SL: 42/1 (5.2 overs)

19:50 (IST)
04 NOV 2021
SL off to a decent start

West Indies try to put some pressure on the batters as Rampaul and Holder stop the flow of boundaries. But after a tight start to his over, Holder concedes a four to Nissanka (7*) on the last delivery. Perera's on 20*. SL: 29/0 (4 overs)

19:36 (IST)
04 NOV 2021
Perera, Nissanka open for SL

Kusal Perera and Pathum Nissanka open together in the first innings as Roston Chase starts the proceedings with the ball. After a single by Nissanka, Perera sends the ball wide of Gayle at slip for the first boundary. SL: 6/0 (1 over)

19:10 (IST)
04 NOV 2021
What are the respective playing XIs?

Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Perera(w), Charith Asalanka, Avishka Fernando, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Dasun Shanaka(c), Wanindu Hasaranga, Chamika Karunaratne, Dushmantha Chameera, Maheesh Theekshana, Binura Fernando

WI opt to bowl first!

West Indies have won the toss and have opted to field. "Expect a bit of dew here. For us, it's important to win a match. As a team, hopefully we can bowl well. I had a couple of days off, worked with the physio," said Kieron Pollard.

18:45 (IST)

Who are the key players?

Evin Lewis, West Indies: The West Indies bat so deep that if they can get off to a good start then there’s little issue taking risks in the second half of their innings. It could be that one of Dwayne Bravo and Jason Holder comes in as low as nine, so a big start from the in-form and fast-scoring Lewis would set the West Indies up for a massive score that they desperately need. Lose early wickets and suddenly the pressure is on the middle and lower order to rebuild.

Wanindu Hasaranga, Sri Lanka: Top level spin bowling is West Indies’ Achilles heel, and Sri Lanka have one of the very best in the tournament in the shape of Hasaranga. If Sri Lanka’s main man with the ball can weave his way through the West Indies top order then that will be a big step towards winning the game.

Who said what

Mickey Arthur, Sri Lanka head coach: "I sit here really comfortable with our bowling structure. Maybe one seamer can be a left-arm quick, but Dushmantha Chameera is world-class at the moment. I love our two mystery spinners - they give us that little kind of mystique if you like - I think our fifth and sixth bowlers are adequate, so I'm comfortable with that. Our batting is getting better and better all the time, and I guess for me it's just striving to get that batting working as a well-oiled machine. We fielded well at times, and one of our goals and ethos as a team is to become the best fielding side in the world.”

Kieron Pollard, West Indies captain: "It's not only us that have struggled on these wickets, but other players - world-class players - have struggled as well. They've just been able find a rhythm, and we haven't been able to cross that 143-run barrier. The teams that have done well have assessed conditions well."
