Scott Robertson Makes One Change To The XV As All Blacks Put History On The Line Against England
Scott Robertson makes one change to the XV as All Blacks put history on the line against England

All Blacks boss Scott Robertson, who has named his team for the second England Test, alongside Finlay Christie.

Scott Robertson has kept faith with the All Blacks side that scraped a victory in their first Test of the 2024 international season.

In their opening match under the Crusaders legend, they earned a narrow 16-15 victory over the Red Rose thanks to a pair of Damian McKenzie penalties in the second period.

McKenzie unsurprisingly retains his place in the XV but he has a new half-back partner following the injury to TJ Perenara last weekend.

Perenara was forced off at half-time after his captain Scott Barrett landed on his leg following a cleanout by England’s George Martin.

Impact off the bench

Finlay Christie therefore comes into the team after impressing off the bench, with his kicking game managing to dictate proceedings in the final quarter.

Youngster Cortez Ratima takes Christie’s former slot among the All Blacks’ replacements in the only alterations to the squad to face England in the second Test.

That means Beauden Barrett is forced to start on the bench once more as Stephen Perofeta retains his place alongside Sevu Reece and Mark Tele’a in the back three.

Jordie Barrett and Rieko Ioane continue at centre while up front Ardie Savea, Dalton Papali’i and Samipeni Finau are the loose trio.

The front five also remains the same, with Patrick Tuipulotu partnering captain Scott Barrett at lock and Tyrel Lomax, Codie Taylor and Ethan de Groot in the front-row.

Sir John Kirwan calls for World Rugby to ‘change rules’ as current laws ‘don’t help All Blacks DNA’

“Finlay has worked hard and earned his place in the starting side and it will be a proud day for Cortez and his whānau. He’s a talented young man who is ready for Test footy,” Robertson said.

New Zealand will look to maintain their unbeaten run at Eden Park which stretches back 30 years to 1994. They have gone 48 games without tasting defeat in Auckland, which includes 46 victories and two draws.

“We can feel New Zealand’s support here in Auckland and we will hear it at a sold-out Eden Park. It’s a very special venue to the All Blacks, and we’re going there on Saturday to win the series against England,” the head coach added.

All Blacks team to face England

New Zealand: 15 Stephen Perofeta, 14 Sevu Reece, 13 Rieko Ioane, 12 Jordie Barrett, 11 Mark Tele’a, 10 Damian McKenzie, 9 Finlay Christie, 8 Ardie Savea, 7 Dalton Papali’i, 6 Samipeni Finau, 5 Patrick Tuipulotu, 4 Scott Barrett (c), 3 Tyrel Lomax, 2 Codie Taylor, 1 Ethan de Groot
Replacements: 16 Asafo Aumua, 17 Ofa Tu’ungafasi, 18 Fletcher Newell, 19 Tupou Vaa’i, 20 Luke Jacobson, 21 Cortez Ratima, 22 Anton Lienert-Brown, 23 Beauden Barrett
