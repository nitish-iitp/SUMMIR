Samoa vs Fiji Prediction

Samoa vs Fiji will be the 2nd fixture in the ICC Mens T20 World Cup Sub-Regional EAP Qualifier A. The fixture is scheduled to take place on Saturday at Faleata Oval No 2, Apia.

Samoa played their first T20 international Papua New Guinea during the 2019 Pacific Games. They are currently ranked 82nd in the ICC T20 Team rankings.

Fiji finished 4th in the 2018-19 EAP Qualifier A but in the previous season, Fiji came out in the 2nd spot and hence they are expected to do well in the current tournament.

In the last 4 fixtures, Peni Dakainivanua has picked up 6 wickets at an economy of 7.93.

The betting tip is...

Peni Dakainivanua will be the top bowler.

Fiji Team News

Samoa is coming back in action after 4 months of break and they faced Fiji in their previous fixture during the playoffs of one-off the tournament. It was a good start from the bowling unit but the batters failed to complete the chase. Skipper Sitanisilao Toutai and Afapene IIaoa picked up 2 wickets each at an economy of 9 and 9.33 respectively. Darren Roache scalped a single wicket at an economy of 5.

On the batting front, the top order gave the team a balanced start but the middle order failed to continue the momentum.

Uala Kaisala (26 off 27). Darren Roache (20 off 21), and Paul Rarotoga (22 off 10) were off to a solid start but once the trio were back to the pavilion, the rest of the batting unit was unable to perform. Timezeen Rapi scored 28 off 19 balls from the lower order but it was too late to win the match.

Fiji vs Samoa Betting Tips

The two teams have been rivals when it comes to East Asia Pacific rivalries. They have met thrice in the past and Fiji has come out as the winners on two occasions. 

Fiji is a much more balanced team. They have an experienced lineup of batters with their top-class bowling attack. Samoa has a major void in their batting unit. We predict a win for Fiji on Saturday.

In the last 4 fixtures, Peni Dakainivanua has picked up 6 wickets at an economy of 7.93.

The betting tip is...

Peni Dakainivanua will be the top bowler.
