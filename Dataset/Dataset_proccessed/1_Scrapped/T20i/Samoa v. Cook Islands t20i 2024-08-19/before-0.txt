Vanuatu Team News

Vanuatu is coming back into action after a break of 4 months from international cricket. They last faced Kuwait in the month of March and witnessed an embarrassing defeat. A slow start from the top order led to unwanted pressure on the middle order and hence the team was unable to reach a winnable number.

 Patrick Matuataava scored 28 off 30 balls at a strike rate of 93.33. Nalin Nipiko scored 24 off 34 balls at a strike rate of 70.59.

Since it was a low score, the bowling unit was under pressure as well and it was visible on the ground. They were unable to break partnerships at the right time and trouble the opposition. Patrick Matuataava contributed with a single wicket and Joshua Rasu picked up 2 wickets at an economy of 5.75.
