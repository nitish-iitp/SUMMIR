ASIAN GAMES HANGZHOU
Match 3: Mongolia vs Hong Kong | Squads | Players to watch | Fantasy Playing XI | Live streaming
September 20, 2023  Harsh Chaudhary

For Match No. 3 in the ongoing 19th Asian Games, women’s cricket event, Mongolia and Hong Kong are scheduled to compete at ZJUT Cricket Field, Hangzhou, on the 20th of September, 2023, at 6:30 AM Indian Standard Time (IST).

Match 3: Mongolia vs Hong Kong | Squads | Players to watch | Fantasy Playing XI | Live streaming

Both Mongolia and Hong Kong suffered defeats in their opening matches against Indonesia and Malaysia. As a result, while the winners have progressed to the Quarter-Finals, Mongolia and Hong Kong will compete in a Qualifier for a spot in the Quarter-Final. The winner of this Qualifier match will secure the final available slot in the Quater-Final.

Squads:

Mongolia – Tsendsuren Ariuntsetseg (C), Bat-amgalan Bulganchimeg, Batjargal Ichinkhorloo, Battsetseg Namuunzul, Battsogt Narangerel, Enkhbold Khaliunaa, Ganbat Namuunsuren, Ganbold Urjindulam, Gansukh Anujin, Jargalsaikhan Erdenesuvd, Mendbayar Enkhzul

Hong Kong – Kary Chan (C), Natasha Miles (VC), Maryam Bibi, Betty Chan, Charlotte Chan, Dorothea Chan, Amanda Cheung, Lemon Cheung, Cindy Ho, Emma Lai, Heiley Lui, Bella Poon, Alison Siu, Yee Shan To, Akash Yousaf

Players to watch out:
Batjargal Ichinkhorloo

In her maiden international outing, the 19-year-old batter made a brief appearance, being dismissed cheaply for a score of 5, courtesy of a run-out. Mongolia, who were bowled out for 15, will be hopeful that the opening batter continues to contribute in their remaining knockout games.

Mendbayar Enkhzul

The 20-year-old pacer was a standout for the side in their maiden international outing. In the curtain-raiser of the tournament against Indonesia, she had the best bowling figures of 1/26 (4). For it to come in a game where Indonesia posted 187 for the loss of just 4 wickets, is very promising.

Bella Poon

The 25-year-old opening batter, in her 19 T20I appearances, has scored 113 runs. In the competition opener, she set a new career best with a score of 14. Despite Hong Kong falling short by 22 runs in a chase of 104, Bella’s start was promising, as were the brief stays of Natasha Miles and Maryam Bibi.

Betty Chan

The 34-year-old all-rounder, in 54 T20I appearances, has picked up 70 wickets while maintaining an economy rate of 4.03. Her best bowling figures stand at 4/13. Betty Chan, who consistently bowled economically during the Asia qualifier but didn’t take many wickets, has now returned to her wicket-taking form. In the competition opener, Betty recorded brilliant figures of 3/12.

Pitch:

The 22-yard strip at the ZJUT Cricket Field, Hangzhou, remains on the slower side, benefiting the bowlers, particularly the spinners. The struggle for batters is evident, as indicated by the average score being in the 100s.

Weather:

Thunderstorms on the radar pose no threat to the game as showers are forecasted to stay away during match hours. The temperature is expected to hover around 32°C, with light winds and humidity at 75%.

Fantasy playing XI:

Emma Lai, Natasha Miles, Yee Shan To, Bella Poon, Kary Chan, Tsendsuren Ariuntsetseg, Maryam Bibi, Jargalsaikhan Erdenesuvd, Betty Chan, Mendbayar Enkhzul, Alison Siu

Match details:

Date – September 20, 2023
