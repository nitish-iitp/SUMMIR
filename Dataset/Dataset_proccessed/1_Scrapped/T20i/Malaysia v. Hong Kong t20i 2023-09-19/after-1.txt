Indonesia faced Mongolia in the first game as far as women’s cricket is concerned. Indonesia sealed a massive 172-run victory over Mongolia courtesy of a clinical performance to kickstart their Asian Games campaign on a high note. Hong Kong faced Malaysia in the second game of the tournament.

Hong Kong skipper Chan Ka Ying won the toss and opted to field first. Malaysia got off to a disappointing start after being inserted to bat first, as they lost the wicket of their opening batter Ainna Hamizah Binti Hashim for a duck, just on the third ball of the innings.
