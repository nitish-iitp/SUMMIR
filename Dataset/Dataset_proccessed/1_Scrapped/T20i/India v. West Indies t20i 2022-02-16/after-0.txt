Fresh from securing a landmark deal at the mega auction of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), West Indies batter Nicholas Pooran played a sublime knock in the 1st T20I of the three-match series against Rohit Sharma-led Team India on Wednesday. Deemed surplus to requirements at Punjab Kings (PBKS), the West Indies southpaw signed a bumper deal with former IPL champions Sunrisers Hyderabad at the mega auction. 

Showcasing his batting exploits in the series opener at the Eden Gardens on Wednesday, Pooran staged an impressive fightback for the visitors by smashing a quick-fire half-century. The Windies star batter lifted the Kieron Pollard-led side to a challenging total in the 20-over contest. Pooran, who has joined forces with Kane Williamson at SRH, was hailed by fans and followers of the game on social media. While some users lauded SRH's latest recruit, others triggered a meme fest on the internet.
