KOLKATA: India received injury blows to their pacer Deepak Chahar and allrounder Venkatesh Iyer in their opening T20I against West Indies at Eden Gardens.
Chahar, who was bought back by Chennai Super Kings for a massive Rs 14 crore in the IPL mega auction 2022, sustained a blow to his right hand while trying to stop a powerful pull shot from opposition skipper Kieron Pollard in the square leg region.

The incident happened in the penultimate over of the match when the Windies skipper looked to fire in all cylinders as Chahar was sent back to the dressing room and could not finish his full quota as Harshal Patel had to bowl the final over.
Chahar finished with figures of 3-0-28-1.

India's pace bowling allrounder Venkatesh Iyer, who bowled a solitary over, also sustained a blow to his right hand after the ball slipped through his hand from a Pollard shot in the 17th over.
The duo will have their scans done and it remains to be seen if they will be available for the remainder of the series.

Gaikwad should be given chance to open. Ishan Kishan struggled as an opener. We have enough bench strength to replace Chahar. Venkatesh Iyer recovered as he batted well and gave India a winning 6

Great win. Surya is an amazingly talented player. However, his body language always send signal that his head weight it bigger than the size of his head. If he stays grounded, he will become one of the greatest find in recent times for team India. Love Bishnoi's bowling action. Reminders me of Abdul Qadir and Imram Tahir of recent times. Its hard to play spinners with a runner up like that. Hope he's given more opportunities to build his confidence.
