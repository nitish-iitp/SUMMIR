Ravi Bishnoi wins the Man of the Match award for his exceptional spell with the ball on debut. He says, his nerves have settled in by now. Mentions, he is really happy to represent India in the T20I format. Adds, he was just aiming to bowl stump to stump but he erred in lines several times and would hope to improve the same in the next game. Adds, he hasn't played a game with dew on the ball. Adds it is a dream come true to win the Player of the Match on debut.

Rohit Sharma, the Indian captain says that they should have finished it off sooner but trying to do things a bit different didn't work out well. He adds that the bowlers were brilliant to restrict such a good batting side to a modest total and admits that they were not clinical enough with the bat. He mentions that Ravi Bishnoi is a real talent and that is why he has been drafted into the side and can bowl anywhere, this also helps to rotate the bowlers. He also mentions that someone like Shreyas Iyer is sitting out which is a bit hard on him but Venkatesh Iyer just gives them the extra option with the ball at the moment. He also mentions that all the guys are great professionals and they understand that they need to remain patient for their opportunities and the coaching staff is clear enough to tell them that the ones who are in form will get a run of games in order to maintain that momentum. About Kishan, he says that it's their job to make sure that they do not put too much pressure on his shoulders.

West Indies skipper, Kieron Pollard says, it was a good game of cricket. To take the game down to the 19th over that feels good. Adds, they were like 20 to 30 runs short and were hurt majorly in the Powerplay. Adds, they need to play well as they progress. Adds, they will continue to work on the errors. Says, he wants his bowlers to be fresh and hopefully have a good impact on the next game.

Time for the Presentation...

Suryakumar Yadav is up for a quick chat. He says looking at the dew, he had a chat with Pant in the dugout and noticed the ball is running faster when hit squarer of the wicket. Adds, he asked Iyer to play good shots and have intent and is really happy with the way he played. Says he thinks the opposition spinners bowled really well but later due to the dew they were unable to get grip off the surface.

West Indies seemed to be 20 runs or so short to begin with and with the dew coming into play, it was always going to be a tough ask for their bowlers. This was true, at least for the Powerplay as the pacers were hammered all around the park by Rohit Sharma. The first over of spin from Akeal Hosein too proved to be expensive but then Roston Chase came on and he picked up the Indian skipper. After that, both spinners bowled in tandem and kept on stemming the flow of runs. Kishan and Kohli too fell to the spinners and the Windies started to believe. This belief was shattered as Suryakumar Yadav hit the boundaries at the right times for the opposition and ended Windies hopes. They will now look to put on a better batting performance in the next match and will look to better their death bowling as well.

After that early blitz from Rohit Sharma, India looked to be chasing the target down with overs to spare. It was not the case though as after Sharma fell, things got slowed down. Ishan Kishan did make 35 runs but they came at a struggle and he failed to build on it. Kohli was dismissed shortly after Kishan and suddenly the required rate was rising up. Suryakumar Yadav though remained fairly calm and along with the inexperienced Venkatesh Iyer, made sure that the scoreboard kept ticking over and the bad balls were sent to the fence. This 48-run stand was the difference and India won the contest with 7 balls to spare.

India looked to be in a bit of jeopardy but have managed to get over the line in the end and go 1-0 up in the three-match series thanks to a brilliant partnership between Suryakumar Yadav and Venkatesh Iyer. A top effort from the West Indies bowlers but in the end, they go home empty-handed yet again.
