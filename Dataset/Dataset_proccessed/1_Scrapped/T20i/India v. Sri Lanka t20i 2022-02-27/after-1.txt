India vs Sri Lanka 2022 3rd T20I Ind vs SL T20I Highlights​: Shreyas Iyer remained unbeaten on 73 not out off 45 balls to help India register a six-wicket victory and sweep the T20I series 3-0 in Dharamsala on Sunday. The win helped India extend their winning streak in the format to 12 wins out of 12. The chase started off poorly for the home side as they lost captain and opener Rohit Sharma to Dushmantha Chameera while Sanju Samson soon edged one to the keeper to depart for 18 runs himself off Chamika Karunaratne's bowling. However, Shreyas Iyer and Deepak Hooda batted superbly to help India reach 86/2 in 10 overs before the latter departed for 21 runs. Shreyas continued to put on a good show and took the team past the finishing line with a crucial partnership with Ravindra Jadeja in the end. (SCORECARD)

Batting first, Sri Lankan captain Dasun Shanaka's explosive batting later in their innings propelled his team to a formidable total of 146/5 in 20 overs after opting to bat in the third T20I in Dharamsala on Sunday. Earlier, Pacers as well as spinners continued to apply the pressure as Team India dominated play with the only fight coming from opposition skipper Dasun Shanaka, who scored a brilliant fifty. The duo of Mohammed Siraj and Avesh Khan claimed three early wickets followed by Ravi Bishnoi and Harshal Patel, who pitched in with one wicket each early in the innings. Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Yuzvendra Chahal are all rested as they made way for Ravi Bishnoi, Kuldeep Yadav, Avesh Khan and Mohammed Siraj. Sri Lanka made two changes, bringing in Janith Liyanage and Jeffrey Vandersay in place of Praveen Jayawickrama and Kamil Mishara.

India (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma(c), Sanju Samson(w), Shreyas Iyer, Ravindra Jadeja, Venkatesh Iyer, Deepak Hooda, Harshal Patel, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohammed Siraj, Kuldeep Yadav, Avesh Khan

Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Pathum Nissanka, Danushka Gunathilaka, Charith Asalanka, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Janith Liyanage, Dasun Shanaka(c), Chamika Karunaratne, Dushmantha Chameera, Jeffrey Vandersay, Binura Fernando, Lahiru Kumara
