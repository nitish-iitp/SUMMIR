SL skipper Dasun Shanaka congratulates Indian team

"Want to congratulate India for a wonderful performance. Need some stitches on the hand. Been tough without our senior bowlers. Didn't capitalise on the first six overs today again with the bat.

This is international cricket, we have to adapt, can't complain about conditions," says Shanaka on his team's performance.
