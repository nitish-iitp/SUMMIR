Right then, that is all we have from this game. The caravan now moves to Dharamsala for the second T20I. That game will start at 7 pm IST (1.30 pm GMT) on Saturday, 26th February. As you know, our coverage will start well in advance. So do join us for the same. Till then, goodbye and cheers!

Ishan Kishan is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH. He says that he learned a lot from the last three T20Is against West Indies and his intent was not right there. He mentions that pull shot is his favourite shot and he was just waiting to play that shot. He mentions that it is positive thing to play in this big ground as they will get big grounds in Australia. He says that he was just trying to middle the ball during his innings.

Rohit Sharma, the skipper of India, says that there are bound to happen failures in the sport and says that he knows Ishan Kishan's ability and mindset. He adds that Ishan constructed his innings well and that is more important. He mentions that they want more from Jadeja and he would like him to bat up the order. He says that Jadeja has been batting quite well and they want to utilise his potential. He adds that the ground in Lucknow is quite big and on these kinds of grounds, the batters are tested, so it is good. He mentions that the fielding has been poor and they need to be better in that aspect of the game.

Dasun Shanaka, the skipper of Sri Lanka, says that they were really poor in all departments and credit should be given to India for the way they played. He adds that they were without Theekshana and Hasaranga and he hopes that Asalanka carries his form into the next game. He says that Chameera is their main bowler and he says that he tries to use him at start as well at death.

Stay tuned for the presentation.

Shreyas Iyer is down for the chat. He says that his start was slow and his job was to give Ishan Kishan strike in the middle. He adds that when he got his eye in, he decided to play his shots and luckily it came off. Tells that he was talking to Ishan about just timing the ball. He says that this ground is big and he tried to stay in the present during his innings. He mentions that he wanted to bowl but did not get the chance tonight.

For India, the bowling was good yet again, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Bumrah did well in the Powerplay. Chahal too had a decent outing. Iyer went for runs but got two wickets. Rohit tried as many as 7 bowlers and all did decently.

A thumping win for the Indians and they have taken a 1-0 lead in the series. To be honest, this victory was set up by the innings at the start from Kishan and then at the end by Iyer. 200 was always going to be tough and when you lose 4 before the 10th with not a lot of runs on the board, it gets tougher. Except for Asalanka amongst the top order and Chameera down the order, there was nothing from the rest and that is not enough while chasing a mammoth score.

19.6 overs (2 Runs)
So couple of runs to end the game! India have put together another dominating performance! A very full delivery outside off. Dushmantha Chameera lifts this towards deep extra-cover and gets a couple as the fielder at long off cuts it off. India win by 62 runs!
