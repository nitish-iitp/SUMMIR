<image:caption>The Stockton and Darlington line in the North East of England is hailed as 'the first public railway in the world' - a line that kickstarted the global railway revolution. However, it turns out that the idea of the line as a 'revolution' was actually created for cash in 1875 by a local newspaper journalist on a tight book deadline working to a biased brief from a railway company. Pictured - costumed men and women in 1925 commemorating the 100th anniversary of the line</image:caption>
