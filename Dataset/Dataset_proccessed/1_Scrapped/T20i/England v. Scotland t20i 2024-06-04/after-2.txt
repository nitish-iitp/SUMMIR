England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: And it's over

The inevitable has finally come true. The two captains shake hands after a discussion with the match officials and the game has been called off.

Shame, given the fact that Scotland haven't put a foot wrong so far in this game. Would've been a pretty fun chase/defence to watch....*sighs all over*. 

00:12 (IST)
05 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rain, AGAIN!

Oh dear. It's started to 'pour' again. 'We're doomed,' suggests Nasser Hussain on the comms in Barbados. With not much time left to finish the play, the two teams sharing points seems like a very real possibility from here.

05 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: News from Dallas

While Nepal had been dismissed for 109 in their Group D opener against Netherlands, the Dutch have anything but cakewalk in front of them. 46/2 after nine overs. Remember, we've already had a super over in this tournament after a target of 110 was set. 

23:59 (IST)
04 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: End of innings

Adil Rashid to close the innings. His previous one had gone for 18 but this has been a good comeback from the leggie. Concedes just the one boundary and eight overall runs as Scotland finish with 90/0 from their 10 overs. 

Munsey (41 off 31) and Jones (45 off 30) will feel they gave their best, especially for the fact that they batted for more than half of those 10 overs thinking this was to be a 20-overs contest. England though, favorites to take all the points from here. That is if the weather gods are gracious. 91 to win and begin their title defence. 

23:55 (IST)
04 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Jordan concedes a six but largely effective

Chris Jordan to bowl the penultimate over. His first one hadn't been particularly impressive but bowling in the death is his speciality. The first ball is bang on - full and outside off for a dot. Next up though, Jordan goes length and Munsey picks him over deep square leg for a SIX!

A good comeback from Jordan thereafter. Four runs off the subsequent four deliveries and it could've been only three had Michael Jones been punished for what was a clumsy piece of running off a double. Making his way to the non-striker's end for a second run, Jones bat stuck on the wicket as he walked casually - not anticipating a direct hit. He was eventually safe. 82/0 after nine overs.

23:47 (IST)
04 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: BIG OVER for the Scots!

Adil Rashid to bowl his first over. Michael Jones takes him to the cleaners off the very first delivery. Front foot out and a clean whack down the sightscreen for SIX. 

LBW appeal against Munsey. The umpires have gone upstairs but the ball is pitching outside leg stump. Next up, Rashid slips in a full toss and Munsey goes right handed to dispatch it through mid wicket for four. The next ball isn't a full toss but Munsey's made up his mind to go for the reverse slog-sweep and connects it for a SIX. Good over for the Scottish - 18 runs come off it. 72/0 after 8 overs.

23:43 (IST)
04 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: SCO to feel hard done by

So Scotland resume at 51/0 after 6.2 overs. They are sure to feel hard done by. The start had been a pretty solid one for a 20-overs game, which has now been reduced to half. 

Munsey has a go but skies one behind the wicket for a single. More of those surely in the brewing with 18 balls left to play and all 10 wickets intact. Five runs from the over. Scotland are 54/0 after seven overs.

23:38 (IST)
04 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Game set to resume

So, at long last, we have the covers off and the players are set to walk back in to resume the match. But as expected, the overs have been deducted and it's now a 10 overs per side contest.

England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rohit on Dravid's departure as head coach

On the eve of their first game at the 2024 T20 World Cup, India captain Rohit Sharma opened up on the departure of head coach Rahul Dravid. 

A day after Dravid confirmed that the ongoing World Cup will be his last assignment with the national team, Rohit conceded that he had attempted to convince Dravid to stay. (MORE HERE)

England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Scenes in Barbados

Meanwhile, the defending champions had only been 38 deliveries into their defence when the game was halted owing to rain. It's stopped pouring but the amount of water over the covers and in the outfield - coupled with the dark skies above - don't bode well for the game. A pity, given the start Scotland were off to. 

22:31 (IST)
04 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Nepal in deep waters

Nepal's qualification for the T20 World Cup this year was a moment of euphoria celebrated across the nation. Their first outing at the competition though, has given little to celebrate. After 12 overs the scorecard reads 56/5. Netherlands surely the favorites in this Group D encounter in Dallas.

22:11 (IST)
04 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Elsewhere at the WC

The Netherlands and Nepal have kickstarted their campaign against each other. 21-year-old Tim Pringle has struck twice off his two overs and Nepal are 41/3 after eight overs.

21:57 (IST)
04 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Covers back on

This is getting frustrating now. Should definitley be for Scotland, who were off to such a fine start against the defending champions. The restart was supposed to be 12:20 PM local time (9:50 PM IST) but with a huge dark cloud resting over the venue, the delay is likely to be a big one.

England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rain stops, play to resume

So the covers are off and the sky is back to it's sunny best. The umpires have had a look at the wicket and we should be in for a restart any moment now.

21:29 (IST)
04 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rain halts play

What a fine start for Scotland but it's forced to a halt as it starts drizzling again in Barbados. The covers are back on as the score reads 51/0 after 6.2 overs. And it looks like we might have to wait a while as it has started to pour.

21:28 (IST)
04 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: End of powerplay

Chris Jordan to bowl the final over of the powerplay. And it's a big one for Scotland as Michael Jones takes the attack to the England pacer. A pull shot carved for six followed by back-to-back fours. Fifty up for Scotland as the powerplay comes to an end.

21:19 (IST)
04 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Wicket...no-ball!

You could feel that England were knocking on the door after that Archer over. Mark Wood - in his second - had furthermore used the change of the pace to deceive the Scottish openers and put a halt on the boundaries. And it almost materialised into a wicket. A quicker length delivery and Munsey went across the line only to sky it. Buttler tracks back to take the catch but the celebrations are cut short as the siren for the no-ball rings around the venue. The pressure though, keeps building. Scotland are 34/0 after five overs.

21:14 (IST)
04 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Archer mixes it up to cut on boundaries

Archer continues from the other end. He's taken the pace off after being dispatched for an early boundary, and it seems to be the wiser thing to do with the Scottish openers having found a decent tempo early in this powerplay. The variations are the key and Archer is mixing it up nicely. Just when Jones feels he's read the slower one, out comes the quick short one. Just the two runs off the fourth over. 28/0 after four overs.

21:09 (IST)
04 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Munsey sweeps for more 4s!

Spin introduced early by Jos Buttler as Moeen Ali replaces Mark Wood. Munsey makes room outside the off stump and sweeps the offie down the fine leg fence for a second boundary - third for Scotland in three overs so far. There's another one, a replica of the shot earlier in the over, only hit more squarer this time. Deep square leg is very square to intercept it in time. It seems to be the go-to shot for Munsey early in this innings. Went for the slog-sweep off the last delivery but couldn't connect. 26/0 after three overs.

21:04 (IST)
04 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Archer's WC return!

And now, a bit of feel good moment for England and Jofra Archer fans, one of the faces of the 2019 World Cup returns to the big stage in his birthplace. You can read a little bit more about the significance of it HERE.

On field though, Archer concedes a poor first boundary. Length ball, outside the off stump the right hander, and Michael Jones punches it in the vacant region in front of square for FOUR. Makes a good comeback though. Brings one back into the right hander with a bit of late movement and pitches it forward as a sign of courage. Jones edges the next one and it's gone miles up in the air but lands safe. 16/0 after two overs.

21:00 (IST)
04 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: First boundary, early movement on offer.

Wood to left-hander Munsey - over the wicket - bangs in a yorker with a little bit of movement on offer. Blocked to avoid a catastrophe. Goes a little bit wider later in the over and keeps the length closer to good - slotted through the mid wicket region for the first boundary by Munsey. 6/0 after the first over.

20:54 (IST)
04 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Off we go!

Despite the rain, it's been a decent turnout at Bridgetown for this one. The national anthems have been sung. Jos Buttler leads his troops to the field as the Scottish openers - George Munsey and Michael Jones - walk into the middle. Mark Wood has the new ball. All in readiness for ball one.

20:47 (IST)
04 JUN 2024
England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Game set to begin

Right then. The rain and the dark clouds have disappeared off the scene. The wet patch has been dealt with. The game will begin at 11:25 AM local time (8:55 PM IST).

England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: On Archer's road to homecoming

It was perhaps written in the stars for one of England's leading protagonist of the 2019 World Cup triumph to make his comeback on the grand stage at his hometown, Barbados. 

The first sign of Archer cranking up the pace during the comeback trail was spotted by his mentor at Wildey Cricket Club in Barbados, home where Archer's heart lies. To break the monotony during rehabilitation in England, Archer made to and fro trips.

England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Captains on the mic

Richie Berrington, Scotland: We are going to bat first, wicket looks dry. The wickets can change. It's going to be important to adapt and need to put a good score. It's an early game, could be different. Need to quickly adapt. Really excited to get this opportunity. Looking forward to this tournament. Focus is on today's game, as a team we are looking forward to the challenge. A lot of this group was a part of that game.

Jos Buttler, England: Would have bowled first. It's a great ground, everyone is excited. Delighted to have Archer back, he has been bowling well. We have high hopes from him. We are going for Wood and Jordan today, we have gone in with the extra pacer.

England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Dravid's final assignment as India head coach

India head coach Rahul Dravid on Monday confirmed that the ongoing T20 World Cup is his last dance with the national team, furthermore expressing his doubts over re-applying for the job owing to the schedule of the national team.

“It is going to be the last one that I am in-charge of,” Dravid said ahead of India’s first game against Ireland in New York. “Yeah, just considering, unfortunately, the kind of schedules and where I find myself at this stage in my life, I don’t think I’ll be able to re-apply. So yeah, obviously it’ll be my last one.”

In April, the BCCI had invited applications for the head coach job following the T20 World Cup. Back then, the BCCI Secretary Jay Shah had stated that Dravid can re-apply for the role but the latter on Monday deemed it unlikely. (READ MORE)

England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Cricket not financially rewarding in Scotland

Speaking to The Indian Express in 2022, former Scotland captain Kyle Coetzer had opened up on the struggles of even the top-tier cricketers in the country. 

“To be a professional cricketer in Scotland, financially, the rewards are not there,” Coetzer said. With players not able to feature at the international or A-team level on a consistent basis, the inevitable glance at the franchise leagues follows. Even if necessary, it isn’t a straightforward path for an aspiring, talented cricketer in Scotland to land offers in the cash-rich T20 leagues of the world. (READ MORE)

England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: India face a tricky challenge vs Ireland

The Ireland game has the guise of a feeler, a glorified warm-up fixture, an uneven contest, in scale and stature, to excite the neutral cricket tragic. The chasm between the two are wide—India are ranked the number one in the world, whereas Ireland occupy the eleventh spot; Ireland have lost all seven of their T20I games against the more vaunted foes, who have reached at least the semifinals of the tournament on four instances, a team in red-hot form, having lost only two of their last 14 games in this format, as opposed to an erratic team that has lost eight of their last 14.

England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: England don't bottle

When it comes to T20 cricket, the England team is not only respected for its bowling innovations and big-hitting accelerations, but are also reasonably well-behaved and a non-cribbing side. That is why, unlike in the game’s older formats, no one quite grudges their big wins. They also don’t bottle up in this format.

The T20 format routinely subverts stereotypes that followers of this sport have historically lumped upon national teams. The game and the teams need a fresh look as the T20 World Cup moves out of conventional cricketing boundaries. With the USA playing and hosting cricket, not baseball, change is in the air. A disclaimer before the June 2-29 event: When it comes to describing a team, the usual adjectives just don’t apply. (READ MORE)

Richie Berrington, Scotland captain: "I think it's just great for the game - we've got more teams at the start of the tournament, 20 teams. It's a great opportunity for everyone. So, yeah, definitely one we're all looking forward to. And I'm sure we're going to see some great games throughout the tournament."

England vs Scotland Live Score, T20 World Cup: Hello!

Make way, T20 World Cup, your champions have arrived. Time for England to kickstart what is not just a title defence but also a campagn that has a lot to prove. Last year in India, the defending champions were humbled and humiliated, with doubts looming if they would be able to replicate the kind of white-ball success they had in the lead up to becoming the undisputed champions of white ball cricket. 

Jos Buttler and Co however, arrive into the tournament on the back of a comprehensive bashing of Pakistan in a four-match T20I series. Slotted alongside Australia, Namibia, Oman and their opposition for Tuesday - Scotland - the 2022 winners are among the favorites to make it to the semifinals. Can the Richie Berrington-led side pose a stern challenge? With the wickets at this World Cup proving to be anything but the belters we've gotten used to over the years for T20, it'd be interesting to see how the ultra-aggressive batting unit of England go about their business. Buckle up as we take you through the evening.

T20 World Cup rewrite: India unpredictable, Pakistan not unpredictable, England likeable, Kiwis chokers

From unpredictable India to not unpredictable Pakistan, the T20 format throws quite some adjectives into fray for its protagonists. (Reuters)
