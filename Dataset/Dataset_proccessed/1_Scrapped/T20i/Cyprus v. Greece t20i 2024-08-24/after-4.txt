SCORING AT WILL—Kaliati
SHARE

Mighty Mukuru Wanderers reduced the gap between them and TNM Super League leaders Silver Strikers to five points after beating Civil Service United 1-0 at Civo Stadium Friday.

However, Silver have a chance to restore the eight points gap if they beat Mighty Tigers at Silver Stadium this afternoon.

Wanderers have 35 points from 18 matches whereas Silver have 40 points after playing 16 matches.

Isaac Kaliati, who had a grand game, scored the only goal of the match in the 33rd minute from close range.

But Festus Duwe’s attempt was ruled out for offside with two minutes before the break.

In the second half, Civil came with a purpose looking for an equaliser but failed to break Wanderers defence led by captain Lawrence Chaziya and Peter Cholopi.

Both teams made some changes in the second half. Wanderers brought in Balikinho Mwakanyongo and Ahmed Kung’unde for Kaliati and Gaddie Chirwa.

On the other hand, Civil introduced Chifundo Ngapemba for Chikaiko Batison.

But Wanderers held on to the slender victory.

This means Wanderers have collected six points over Civil after beating them 3-0 in the first round.

Friday’s result was a perfect revenge for Wanderers having lost by the same margin as Civil escaped relegation last season.

Meck Mwase

Wanderers Coach Meck Mwase admitted that Civil gave them a good run for their money.

“It was a hard fought victory as it was a tough game. We wanted all the points which is good for us,” Mwase said.

On his part, Civil Coach Abasi Makawa said despite the loss, his troops had a grand game.

“My boys put up a gallant fight and did everything but the referee denied us a clear goal. This is not the result we wanted but we accept it,” Makawa said.

In other matches today, Moyale Barracks will host Karonga United at Mzuzu Stadium whereas Chitipa United will face Mafco at Karonga Stadium.

Action will continue this afternoon with Silver hosting Mighty Tigers at Silver Stadium while Moyale Barracks will date Karonga United at Mzuzu Stadium.

Chitipa United will entertain Mafco at Karonga Stadium.
