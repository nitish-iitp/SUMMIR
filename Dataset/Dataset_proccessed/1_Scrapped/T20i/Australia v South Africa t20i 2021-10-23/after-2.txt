Australia vs South Africa T20 World Cup Highlights: Australia beat South Africa by five wickets in their opening Super 12 Group 1 match of the T20 World Cup in Abu Dhabi on Saturday. Australia chased down the target of 119 in 19.4 overs with Steve Smith scoring 34-ball 35. For South Africa, Anrich Nortje took two wickets while Kagiso Rabada, Keshav Maharaj and Tabraiz Shamsi got one each. Earlier, electing to bowl, Australia restricted South Africa to a meagre 118 for nine. Aiden Markram scored 40 for the Proteas after their top-order crumbled. Kagiso Rabada was the next best batter for them with an unbeaten 19-run knock at number eight. Fast bowlers Josh Hazlewood (2/19) and Mithcell Starc (2/31) took two wickets apiece while spinner Adam Zampa (2/21) also accounted for two batters.

Emotional Rollercoaster

One didn't really have to look at the action in middle to understand which way the match was swinging. As Australia dug a hole for themselves, a glimpse at the Australian dugout told the match story. Captain Aaron Finch and coach Justin Langer sat in the dugout looking calm, with wide grins as Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell pulled Australia closer to South Africa's modest total. Not for nothing are the two batsmen a captain and coach's delight. After a wobbly start, the duo steadied the Australian ship and Australia's captain-coach had little to worry about. But the smiles disappeared from their faces immediately after Smith walked back thanks to Markram's stunning catch in the outfield. And once Maxwell was dismissed soon after, they looked genuinely worried, and Finch was already wiggling around. Within minutes, the cheerful mood in the dugout turned gloomy. It stayed that way until the last over and the smiles and fist pumps were back only after Stoinis helped Australia cross the finish line.

AUSTRALIA WIN BY FIVE WICKETS

Australia kickstart their campaign with a win. They beat South Africa by five wickets. The Proteas showed plenty of fight in the field and took the game to the final over but it was not to be as Australia claimed victory. Smith in the middle, Stoinis at the death take Australia home in a tight chase. The action now moves to England vs West Indies in the second match of the day.

Markram on the mark

Aiden Markram’s remarkable catch had shades of Dean Jones and Roshan Mahanama. We have the first great catch of the world cup which might prove pretty difficult to overshadow in the rest of the tournament as far as boundary catches go. Steve Smith had smashed a pull off Anrich Nortje and might well have been thinking of a six when he was given the shock of his life by Markram. From his position at long-on, Markram charged to his right and dived full length and to his right even as he twisted his body to pouch it. It’s one thing to dive forward or to the side in the slips, but to do a side-ward plunge near the boundary and cover the angle is quite something else. No doubt, Smith was seen shaking his head and puffing out deep breaths in the dugout.

Couple of overs later, in the 17th, he had another shot at what would not only have been a great catch but possibly match-clinching one. Australia needed 33 runs from 21 balls at that stage when Mathew Wade drove Rabada uppishly to right of mid-on where Markram sidestepped to his right before realising the ball was dipping rapidly. He threw in a dive but couldn't get to the ball. On his knees, wearing a sullen look, he punched the ground.

18 needed in 12

South Africa will be looking to keep their length back in this final over, balls pitching shorter than 6 metres have gone at just 4.77 rpo in today's match. 18 needed in 12. Nortje to bowl.

18:47 (IST)

Australia holding strong

Two boundaries to end the over for Matthew Wade and Australia see their way back on top of the contest! 25 are needed from the final 18 balls.

18:40 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
Two in two

South Africa are fighting hard to stay in the game. Shamsi bowls Maxwell for 18 and South Africa have two wickets in two overs.
14.5 -- Smith c Markram b Nortje35(34)
15.2 -- Maxwell b Shamsi 18(21)

An impressive comeback from South Africa, but their tactic of frontloading their bowlers leaves Dwaine Pretorius with two overs at the death, a phase in which he’s bowled just 8 overs since the start of 2018. Could this be something Australia look to target?

Shamsi strikes!

Momentum with Aussies

After 14 overs, momentum is with the Aussies! Australia needs 44 runs off 36 balls with 7 wickets in hand; Smith and Maxwell lead the charge.

Glenn Maxwell has now scored 108 runs with reverse sweeps and switch hits in 2021, the most for any batter in a calendar year after passing Colin Munro’s record of 103 runs in 2014.

36 - balls remaining
44 - runs required for victory

AUS need 59runs from 48 balls

A bit more power in the strokes in that Pretorius over, but Klaasen is kept busy on the cover fence and the over goes, again, for only 5 singles. AUS are 60/3 after 12 overs, need 59 from 48 balls.

18:15 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
AUS are 51/3 after 10 overs

Halfway down the mark, Australia are 51/3, with South Africa fighting hard to not let the game slip away from their hands.

South Africa have managed to keep the pressure on Australia and find themselves with a 30% chance of winning this game according to WinViz, this is the highest it has been for South Africa since David Miller’s dismissal in the first innings.

18:06 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
What a catch!

A brilliant catch from Rassie van der Dussen at deep mid-wicket sees Mitchell Marsh fall to Keshav Maharaj. Marsh attempted a flick against Maharaj but picks out the man in the deep! He is gone for 11. AUS are 39/3 after 8 overs.

Powerplays compared

Maharaj doing his job, bowling an over that went for 5 in about 90 seconds, and somehow Australia lose the Powerplay battle. 28/2 plays 29/3, not much of a battle really - Tabraiz Shamsi into the attack. AUS are 28/2 after six overs.

17:52 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
Warner removed

A good start for South Africa as they manage to remove both Australian openers. Rabada dismisses Warner for 14 runs. Warner had looked in decent touch but falls for 14 as Klaasen takes fine catch at backward point. AUS are 23/2 after five overs.

The wicket of David Warner has helped boost South Africa's win percentage up to 20% with WinViz, there's still hope for them yet if they can consistently pick up wickets.

The Bull is out. David Warner gets a leading edge after looking good for 14.

Finch OUT, early breakthrough for SA

Early relief for South Africa as Australian skipper Aaron Finch departs in the second over for a duck. Anrich Nortje grabs the first as Finch slash flies to Kagiso Rabada on the 3rd man boundary. SA skipper Bavuma had also departed in the second over of their innings. AUS are 4/1 after 2 overs.

Aaron Finch has an Average Batting Impact of -3.2 in T20s in 2021, his lowest figure since 2015.

Emotional Rollercoaster: Turning down free agent proves costly

And to think they couldn't find a place for Faf du Plessis. It was a shambles of a batting performance after two sweetly times fours by the skipper Temba Bavuma. From then on it was an inexorable slide to mediocrity. "When you are working with free agents, you have to come together. You have to find a balance that works for both the team and the free agents. With Faf in particular, we struggled to find that balance," said former captain Graeme Smith, who is the director of Cricket South Africa. Without that free agent Faf, the imbalance and lack of quality in the team was hard to hide. Watching in the stands was Smith himself, with a grim stare at the proceedings.

Careful start by AUS

Australia begin their innings with Warner and Finch at the crease. Rabada opens the attack. AUS are 2/0 after 1 over.

Emotional Rollercoaster: Hair today. Gone tomorrow?

The Aussies welcomed the T20 World Cup with new hairstyles. Glenn Maxwell, who dismissed South African skipper Temba Bavuma in the second over of the innings, sported a novel hairdo: fade on the sides and a top knot. When Maxwell removed Bavuma, his teammates came rushing to pat his head, bringing all the focus onto Maxwell’s hair. The look has proven to be decisive on social media, with compliments mixed with comments such as 'Maxwell's mid-life crisis'. Asked by Mark Nicholas during the break if it was his lucky hair-do, the 33-year-old replied: "It's because it's going in my eyes and there's no hairdresser on tour."

Adam Zampa, who picked up two wickets in an over, too took the field with a new haircut. The leggie, who sported a shaved head earlier this year, turned up with short-medium hair. Earlier this year, ahead of the West Indies series, Zampa had told cricket.com.au: “The thinking is that I have never actually seen the shape of my head. I shaved once when I was eight. I dyed my hair blonde, put some red dye in it. I loved Funky Miller.” Who knows, if Australia win their first T20 World Cup, perhaps an Aussie cricketer would draw inspiration from former Indian captain MS Dhoni, who went bald after India’s 2011 World Cup win.

I can only assume that Glenn Maxwell was a very happy man when he found out that barbers are open in Melbourne again. pic.twitter.com/SJwxTLXaid

Australia need 119 to win

Anrich Nortje (2) looks to go over cover but doesn't get the elevation and is caught. South Africa struggled for momentum in their innings with Aiden Markram top-scoring with 40. Markram (40 off 36) the only South Africa batter to pass 19 as the Australia bowlers impress in Abu Dhabi.

South Africa’s score of 118-9 today is their lowest batting first in a 20 over game at a T20 World Cup. Their previous lowest was 122/8 against West Indies in Nagpur during the 2016 edition.

South Africa finally reach 100

Full delivery bowled on the pads from around the wicket is flicked uppishly by the Markram but hit straight to the deep mid-wicket fielder. With this over, South Africa manage to fiinally cross the 100 run mark. They're 8 down and there's only 2 overs left. SA are 101/8 after 18 overs.

Keshav Maharaj gone in a terrible RUN-OUT

South Africa are crumbling apart. Zampa's two wickets is followed by a terrible mix-up leads to the run out of Keshav Maharaj. That run out of Keshav Maharaj sums up this innings of South Africa. Very dismal performance. Keshav Maharaj sets off for a run, is sent back, slips and comes up short. SA are 83/7 after 15 overs.

This is getting shambolic! After a mix-up in the middle, Keshav Maharaj slips beside the pitch and is run out comfortably

?? 83/7 (14.4)

Two in one for Zampa

Two wickets in 1 over for Zampa - Miller lbw and Pretorius caught behind

Miller attempts a big slog-sweep but Zampa hits him on the pads as replays show the ball crashing into the stumps. He is gone for 16. Then, Dwaine Pretorius (1) looks to cut one down to the 3rd man but can only edge it to the keeper. Wade holds onto the catch as Pretorius attempted the cut. SA are reeling at 82/6 after 14 overs.

2 back to back wickets for the great Zampa in one over. He took the wkt of David Miller. Can it get any better?? #SaF is already out of the match. Don't think they gonna cross even 100. #Australia at its best! #AUSvSA #T20WorldCup pic.twitter.com/36ZSvy3VXq

Emotional Rollercoaster; Falling into lap

At the first sighting of the lap shot decade or so ago, many feared that the batters would tap the ball on to the stumps. However it seldom happened. Especially for someone as good as Quinton de Kock, who it seemed could play it in sleep... until this World Cup. What a time for the shock to set in for him. He shuffled across to Josh Hazlewood and tried the lap. The ball richocheted off the bat onto his arm and lobbed, but by this time de Kock had moved a bit far from the stumps. And watched with horror as the ball lobbed on to the stumps. The dove-eyes of de Kock mirrored his sadness. In the stands, a young South African boy buried his head down, which stayed there for a while.

16:30 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
FOUR

FOUR! A Markram sends this delivery from G Maxwell to deep backward point. SA are 71/4 after 12 overs.

Drinks are on the field now. It's been Australia all the way so far - asked South Africa to bat first and then ripped through the top-order. No real demons on this pitch, the ball is coming on nicely, a hint of swing with the new ball and not much spin either.

16:23 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
Halfway mark: SA are 59/4 after 10 overs

Australia right on top at the halfway mark. Australia have managed to restrict them to less than a run a ball so far. SA are 59/4 after 10 overs. Markram the key batter now on 19* (20).

16:13 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
Klaasen caught

Caught! Heinrich Klaasen (13) looks to fend one but it comes off the leading edge and is caught at point. SA are in deep trouble now and desperately need to build on a partnership. SA are 46/4 after 8 overs.

Wickets so far --
13-1 (Temba Bavuma, 1.3)
16-2 (Rassie van der Dussen, 2.1)
23-3 (Quinton de Kock, 4.1)
46-4 (Heinrich Klaasen, 7.6)

16:06 (IST)
23 OCT 2021
End of powerplay

It's been an intense powerplay. This is the 7th time South Africa have lost 3 wickets inside the Powerplay when batting first since the last T20 World Cup, they've gone on to win 3 of those games. SA are 29/3 after six overs.

Very disappointing Power Play for #SouthAfrica . Long way back in this game from here.

Josh Hazlewood is on fire. He concedes just one run in his opening two overs. Josh Hazlewood's two Overs in this match and in powerplay:-
W,1,0,0,0,0
W,0,0,0,0,0
2 Overs, 1 Maiden, 1 Runs, 2 Wickets.

He didn’t play any T20 international cricket between March 2016 and September 2020. SA are 23/3 after 5 overs.

De Kock's bizarre dismissal

Getting a motivated boundary for the South African side, Quinton de Kock is soon dismissed for 7 runs. De Kock is out bowled, after the ball ricocheted off his thigh. The ball comes off his bat, strikes his thighpad and knocks over the bails. Since the last T20 World Cup, Quinton de Kock averaged 66 with a 153 strike rate inside the Powerplay, an impressive display from Australia to not only restrict de Kock’s scoring but also, rather fortunately, pick up his wicket. SA are 23/2 after 4 overs.

South Africa XI:

Temba Bavuma: "It's been a privilege to lead the team in the tournament, big responsibility and looking forward to it. Two spinners, KG, Nortje, an all-rounder and an extra batsman in Klassen at 6. Our preparations have been good, have played a lot together. We are coming off with some real momentum, not worried about any favourites tag, but we have to stay true to expectations - we have confidence in our team and we'll look to do well."

Tough selection choices, but Ashton Agar, Kane Richardson, Josh Inglis and Mitch Swepson miss out."

South African bowler Tabraiz Shamsi: Amateur magician; professional tweaker-trickster

Harry Potter fans would know this as the Room of Requirement; muggle cricketers dub it backend operations. Tabraiz Shamsi is an amateur magician. He is also a professional worrier of why some googlies don’t turn as much as he’d want, in cricket. For the Proteas chinaman bowler, the room of requirement from where he could pull out any game data, used to be the dependable ‘P Dawgg’, former South Africa analyst Prasanna Agoram combining his ken and nous and fast processing laptop. Prasanna enviably would be privy to the trial (and error) runs of Magician Shamsi’s classical Tourniquet coin-drops with the cricket ball. Which was the unglamorous, quirk-in-progress of his left-arm leg spin. (READ MORE)

Australiaâ€” No aura, no fear

Australia’s batting mainstay either can’t buy a run of late (David Warner), can’t get into the playing XI of their IPL side (Steve Smith) or are coming back from injury (skipper Aaron Finch). Marcus Stoinis was a first-choice player for Delhi Capitals when the league resumed in the UAE, but the all-rounder got injured and couldn’t get back in even after regaining fitness. Dan Christian did feature frequently for RCB in the latter half of the competition, but can be termed as an honest trier, a T20 journeyman, rather than a match-winner in his own right at the highest level.

AUS v SA LIVE

Helllo and welcome to our live coverage of the ICC T20 World Cup. The tournament starts with what is expected to be a thrilling clash between cricket giants Australia and South Africa. Stay tuned for the live score, updates and standout moments from the clash. The match starts at 3.30pm IST.

T20 World Cup 2021: Unpredictable Windies look to recreate old magic

Spectacular one day, chaotic the next. Like yesteryear Pakistan, West Indies veer between the extremes. The T20 champions of the world, trailblazers, trendsetters, they could crash out in the first round, or blast through to the title and fill the humid Emirates air with a re-rendition of the Champions track. Twice they have been champions, but twice they have exited in the preliminary stages of the six-edition-old tournament as well. Two-time champions they might be, but they have lost more T20 games than they have won (win percentage 47.03). Only Ireland, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, among Test-playing nations, have a worse win percentage. In World Cups, though, they tend to fare better, their win percentage of 58 the third-best after India and Sri Lanka.

Suffice is to call them the unpredictables of the T20 galaxy, where their stars sparkle the brightest. Few teams could imagine, let alone, boast of the vaunted T20 firepower than that at the disposal of the West Indies. As if the format was designed with Chris Gayles, Kieron Pollards and Dwayne Bravos in mind. In them, they have the top two run-getters in this format; the top three six-hitters, and the most prolific wicket-taker too. The second-highest wicket-taker too is a West Indian – Sunil Narine, who is bizarrely not in the team. Even mega-utilitarian Jason Holder, who most teams would have installed in their playing eleven without second thoughts, can’t find a spot in the squad.

T20 World Cup 2021: Australia— No aura, no fear

It says a lot about Australia’s prospects and aspirations for the T20 World Cup that the players in the squad most talked up are Mitchell Marsh and, after his stellar stint with Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League, Glenn Maxwell. They are ranked seventh in the ICC T20I charts, below Bangladesh, and come into the tournament having lost their last five bilateral T20 series. But even if one disregards recent track record, it’s the complete lack of fear factor and aura that defines the Aussies who will take the field in the Arabian desert. Not since Allan Border brought a little-known bunch of cricketers keen to make their name to the 1987 World Cup in the subcontinent has a team from Down Under been so unheralded going into an ICC showpiece event. The likes of David Boon, Geoff Marsh, Steve Waugh, Dean Jones, Tom Moody and Craig McDermott were yet to become household names, while the likes of Simon O’Donnell and Mike Veletta played key cameos in the campaign.
