India will begin their title defense at the Hero Men’s Asian Champions Trophy 2024, starting with a match against hosts China on 8th September.

The stage is set for the Men’s Asian Champions Trophy, starting on 8th September at the stunning Moqi Hockey Training Base, overlooking the Nierji Dam in Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia, China. Paris Olympic bronze medallists India enter the tournament as favourites, aiming to defend their title. Other nations that will be participating in the tournament are China, Japan, Pakistan, Korea, and Malaysia.

India eyes defending the title

Last year, in the 7th edition of ACT, India secured the championship on home soil, becoming the only team to win the title four times in the tournament’s history. Team captain Harmanpreet Singh is determined to maintain India’s dominance in the Asian Champions Trophy.

Building momentum for the future

Harmanpreet highlighted the significance of this tournament. He said, “The Asian Champions Trophy last year gave us the momentum heading into the Asian Games and eventually the Olympic podium finish. This year, we aim to kick off the new Olympic cycle by winning this tournament.”.

India will rely on a mix of experienced players and young talents. Harmanpreet emphasised the team’s attacking prowess and penalty corners as key strengths, while the structured defence, particularly against Japan, Malaysia, and Pakistan, will be crucial. He also noted the importance of the tournament for earning world-ranking points.
