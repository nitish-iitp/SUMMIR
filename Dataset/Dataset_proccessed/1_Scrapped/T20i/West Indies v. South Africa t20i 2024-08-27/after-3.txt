SHEPPY ON HIS GAME: West Indies all-rounder Romario Shepherd, left, celebrates with teammates Sherfane Rutherford, centre, and Nicholas Pooran during the second T20 International against South Africa, at the Brian Lara Cricket Academy in Tarouba, on Sunday. Shepherd was Man-of-the-Match in that game, and repeated the feat yesterday in the third match as West Indies won by eight wickets to sweep the series 3-0.

Stand-in skipper Roston Chase wanted his players to give him a win as captain, and they obliged as West Indies comfortably won a T20 International reduced to a T13 affair by eight wickets, via the Duckworth-Stern-Lewis method yesterday.

Another one of Nicholas Pooran’s blistering specials, Shai Hope’s classy unbeaten 42 (24 balls) and Shimron Hetmyer’s rapid 31 off 13 in partnership with Hope sealed the contest for the Windies at 116 for two and completed a second straight 3-0 series sweep against the South Africans, at the Brian Lara Cricket Academy in Tarouba.

Announcing himself with a meaty pull over the ropes first ball, Pooran went on to crash 35 from 13 balls which included three more sixes and two fours, which made up for the first over dismissal of Alick Athanaze.

Put at a disadvantage by the rain interruption that came 4.3 overs into their innings, South Africa were hard-pressed to stop the Windies power-hitters after the visitors had made 108 for four.

It mattered little that seven runs were added to the West Indies target because of DLS. Player-of-the-Series Hope ended the match two balls into the tenth over with a square-driven six off Ottneil Baartman.

It was a celebratory way to end the match and series for both the home team and their fans who braved the weather to witness the final game.

The conditions made both batting and bowling a challenge for different reasons. And asked to take first strike on a pitch that Chase—deputising for Rovman Powell—reckoned would be “slow and sticky” to start off, South Africa’s task became more complicated those four-and-a-half overs into the innings when a heavy shower in Tarouba drove the players off at 23 without loss.

With an hour already lost before the match had begun, the contest was then reduced to 13 overs per side. Knowing what was a good target to set became more difficult, and the added moisture caused by the conditions seemed to make things even more challenging for the batters.

Third ball upon resumption, South Africa lost Reeza Hendricks, who fell to a good diving, well-judged catch by the ever-reliable Fabian Allen at deep midwicket. And it took South Africa 11 balls before they could even get a run. Then Ryan Rickleton cleared the boundary at wide long-on off against Gudakesh Motie. By then, the left-hander had already been dropped by Hosein as he popped a catch to cover off Chase. It was one of two chances he got in his knock of 27 and one of three the West Indies put down overall.

South Africa skipper Aiden Markram (20 off 12 balls) also got a life, but he was the next to go in the tenth over (61 for two), a first-ball victim of Romario Shepherd as he edged a swing to wicketkeeper Pooran. And Rickleton followed in the same over as he skied Shepherd to mid-on.

Bowling “into the pitch” to take the pace off worked for Shepherd, still riding high from his Man-of-the-Match performance in the second match on Sunday.

However, left-armer Obed McCoy, getting his first game of the series, could not keep to the same standard and conceded 17 in his solitary over as Tristan Stubbs punished deliveries that were there to be hit, crashing a four and two sixes in the over, the last “maximum” a massive pull shot that put an exclamation mark on a chastening over for the bowler.

Stubbs, one of those game-changing stroke-makers, eventually fell for a punishing 40 off 15 balls in the last over of the innings.

Seven runs were added to South Africa’s 108. But it could have been 17. The result likely would not have changed for the motoring Windies.

Summarised scores:

South Africa 108-4, 13 overs (Tristan Stubbs 40, Ryan Rickleton 27; Romario Shepherd 2/14)

vs West Indies 116-2, 9.2 overs (Shai Hope 42 n.o., Nicholas Pooran 35, Shimron Hetmyer 31 n.o.)

--West Indies won by eight wickets.

Man-of-the-Match: Romario Shepherd

Man-of-the-Series: Shai Hope
