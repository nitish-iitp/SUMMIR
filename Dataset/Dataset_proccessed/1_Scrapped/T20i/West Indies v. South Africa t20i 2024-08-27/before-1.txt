Spain, on Sunday (August 25), broke the record for most consecutive wins in T20Is. They created the world record after beating Greece by 7 wickets in the ongoing Europe T20 World Cup Sub Regional Qualifier C at Guernsey.

The win over Greece was Spain's 14th consecutive victory in Men's T20Is. The record was previously held by Malaysia who had won 13 games in a row in 2022. Bermuda have also won 13 T20Is in a row.

Malaysia and Bermuda are followed by India, Afghanistan, and Romania who have won 12 T20Is in a row each. The overall record is held by Thailand women’s team who recorded 17 victories on the trot in T20Is.

Spanish national cricket team's last defeat in T20Is came almost two years ago when they lost to Italy. Since then, they have won 15 games in series against the Isle of Man, Jersey, and Croatia before winning more at the current T20 qualifier.

The run was interrupted last year when rain abandoned their game against the Isle of Man. During that series, they had famously bowled out the Manx for just 10 runs before chasing down the target in 2 deliveries.

"A proud record to be notified about today, we obviously don't play for records but this does feel special for the group. It has been a transformative few years in Spain, and a lot of credit goes to players who sacrifice a lot of their time to play for Espana, the management and my coaching staff. Couldn't be prouder of all involved," Spanish national cricket team head coach Corey Rutgers told Cricbuzz.

Spain beat Greece:

Talking about the game between the Spanish national cricket team and Greece, the former won the contest by 7 wickets. Batting first, Greece finished their innings on a modest total of 96 for 9. Sajid Afridi top-scored for Greece, scoring 27 runs off 22 balls including a four and two sixes. He was the only Greek batter to reach the 20-run mark.

For the Spanish national cricket team, Yasir Ali impressed with the ball, taking 3 wickets for 12 runs while Mohammad Atif and Charlie Rumistrzewicz picked up 2 wickets each. In reply, Spanish national cricket team chased down the total in 13 overs by losing 3 wickets. Hamza Saleem Dar top-scored for his side, scoring an unbeaten 32.
