Rohit Sharma, Rinku Singh, Virat Kohli (PC: X)

The 26-year-old India National Cricket Team left-handed batter Rinku Singh, in a recent interview, revealed his favorite captain, bowler, and batter. He picked only one name for his favorite bowler but went on to pick multiple names when asked to pick his favorite captain and batter.

Rinku Singh was regarded as the next big thing in Indian cricket, especially in the T20I cricket. Following his heroics with KKR, he got his India call-up and he replicated his IPL brilliance at the international stage as well and played some sensational innings for the team.

However, his stocks have recently gone down as he has not looked at his very best. He didn't have a great IPL 2024, which led to the BCCI selectors picking Shivam Dube over Rinku Singh in the T20 World Cup 2024 squad.

Although India won the tournament, there were calls made by fans throughout the competition to include Rinku in the main 15-member team. Also, he was not included in any of the Duleep Trophy 2024 squads for the first round.

Meanwhile, in a recent interaction on News24 Sports, Rinku Singh was asked to pick his favorite captain and he named Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. He first named Rohit, saying that he likes the India skipper's captaincy a lot. After that, he also spoke about Kohli, saying that he likes the former India captain's aggressive style. Rinku said:

"I like Rohit bhaiya. I like Virat Bhaiya as well because aggression is important for a captain. So I like both the players' captaincy."

Also, the 26-year-old said that the right-arm pacer Jasprit Bumrah is his favorite bowler at the moment. Notably, Bumrah played a key role in India's T20 World Cup win and he is currently on an extended break.

I enjoyed batting a lot with Rohit bhaiya - Rinku Singh

The left-handed batsman further named Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, and Suryakumar Yadav as his favorite batters in the world. Rinku Singh said that he absolutely loves batting with the India National Cricket Team captain as he is very chill all the time.

"I enjoyed batting a lot with Rohit bhaiya - he is very chill & great person, was having fun during the batting."

However, Rinku unfortunately hasn't got the opportunity so far to bat along with Virat Kohli and the batter dreams that will happen soon. Rinku said:

"I have never batted with Virat Kohli bhaiya. But It's my dream to bat alongside Virat bhaiya in the match."

The most recent international appearance of Rinku Singh was in the away T20I series against the Zimbabwe National Cricket Team and Sri Lanka National Cricket Team. He got the opportunity to bat in six out of eight matches and he failed to perform well.

He registered scores of 0, 48*, 1*, 11, 1, and 1 in six innings. However, he did win a game for India with the ball against Sri Lanka as he bowled the 19th over and claimed two wickets to change the momentum of the match.

Overall, Rinku has played 23 T20Is for India National Cricket Team and has scored 418 runs at an amazing average of 59.71 and a great strike rate of 174.16.
