After Bangladesh’s first-ever Test against Pakistan, former cricketer Fawad Alam has sparked intense discussions, voicing his concerns about the team's dismal performance.

Fawad Alam questions Pakistan Cricket's future after shocking loss to Bangladesh

The embarrassing defeat against Bangladesh has not only shattered Pakistan's confidence but also prompted cricket experts and former cricketers like Fawad to question whether the team is truly progressing or regressing.

The once-proud cricketing nation, known for its rich history and fierce competitiveness, is now going downward, which has left many disappointed.

Fawad said that Bangladesh's resounding victory was well-deserved, but he was left wondering if Pakistan is moving forward or slipping backward in its quest for success.

This crushing defeat raised doubts about whether the path they were on was one of progression or decline and growing uncertainty about the future of the team's development.

After the PAK vs. BAN first Test match, the actor congratulated Bangladesh for their historic win, saying the tourists played really well and deserved to win their first game against Pakistan in the traditional format of the game. Fawad also questioned whether it is progress that Pakistan is making.

Speaking about the match, Bangladesh bowlers delivered a remarkable performance on the fifth day, building on the momentum created by Mushfiqur Rahim's incredible 191 in the first innings.

Their efforts led to Pakistan being bowled out for just 146, thanks to Shakib Al Hasan and Mehidy Hasan Miraz, who have shared seven wickets together.

This defeat marked Pakistan's fifth loss in a string of nine home Tests without a win, extending their struggles on home soil since their last Test victory against South Africa in February 2021.

For Bangladesh, this triumph was historic, securing their first-ever Test win against Pakistan and doing so in emphatic fashion.

It was also a rare achievement for the Tigers, as they had only managed two Test victories away from home in the past seven years before the Rawalpindi game.

Players are not at fault, PCB is at fault: Ahmed Shehzad

Earlier, Ahmed Shehzad slammed the Pakistan team’s performance by saying that it would not be easy for them to recover from their humiliating loss to Bangladesh. He also blamed the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for the team’s shocking defeat against the Tigers at home.

Shehzad posted on X: “It will be very tough for them to recover from this defeat. Players are not at fault. PCB is at fault because players never asked to be picked forcefully. It’s you who are making them play constantly. It’s you who are not letting domestic cricketers come along. You admit that there are not enough players in domestic cricket. If this is the case, what have you made?”

پاکستان ٹیم کا تاریخی زوال شروع ہو چکا ہے۔ قوم کے ساتھ بار بار جھوٹ بولا گیا اور آج بنگلہ دیش سے تاریخی ذلّت آمیز شکست کے بعد پھر سے گھناؤنا مذاق کیا گیا۔ قوم اب کس سے جواب طلب کرے اور کس کا گلا پکڑے؟ ان سب حالات کا اصل ذمےدار کون؟؟#PAKvBAN pic.twitter.com/AdXZhy3z7n
