West Indies vs South Africa 3rd T20I: After beating South Africa by 7 wickets and 30 runs in the first two T20Is played at the Brian Lara Stadium in Tarouba last week, the hosts would like to maintain the red-hot form and get the better of Aiden Markram & Co. in the third T20I as well, which is scheduled to take place today at the same venue again.

While the Windies will be desperate to win the third match in a row and whitewash the Proteas, the 2024 T20 World Cup losing finalists would like to redeem pride by winning the third T20I and finish the tour with a win.

We are back with West Indies’ reply! The two umpires make their way out to the middle while Aiden Markram has the Proteas in a close-knit huddle alongside the ropes. The fielders now spread out to take their positions.

… THE RUN CHASE …

Right then, with 116 runs to chase, West Indies certainly have the firepower to get the job done. However, South Africa have the momentum and will be eager to carry it into their bowling. An exciting second half is on the horizon. Stick around!

Akeal Hosein is in for a chat. He says that today was about bowling fuller and faster. Further says that he tried to spin the ball as well. Mentions that it is challenging to grip a wet ball but is glad that he did not have to bowl with the wet ball much in this game. Shares that it is a tricky wicket with something in it for the seamers and spinners.

When the match resumed, and with field restrictions relaxed, Akeal Hosein continued his over with tight bowling, eventually dismissing Reeza Hendricks, who had struggled throughout his innings. Aiden Markram then stepped in, adopting an aggressive approach to increase the scoring rate, but Romario Shepherd made an immediate impact, removing Markram on his very first delivery and quickly dismissing Ryan Rickelton, who, despite being handed two lifelines by the West Indies fielders, couldn’t capitalize. The in-form Tristan Stubbs came out firing for the Proteas, unleashing a blistering 40 off just 15 balls to propel South Africa to a total of 108 runs, something that seemed unlikely before he took charge.

After winning the toss and opting to bowl first, Akeal Hosein set the tone with pinpoint accuracy for the West Indies, well-supported by Matthew Forde, who kept the openers in check. Despite the cautious start, with just 7 runs on the board after 3 overs, Ryan Rickelton managed to relieve some pressure by hitting a couple of boundaries. However, just as the Proteas seemed to be finding their footing, rain interrupted play.

Wow, despite the rain delay and a shortened game, we’ve been treated to some thrilling cricket. It’s been a tale of two halves, West Indies dominated the first, but South Africa roared back in the second, closing their innings at 108 runs in the allotted 13 overs. With the DLS method in play, the revised target for West Indies is now 116 runs.

12.6 – A single to end the innings! Another off-pace delivery by Forde but the length is pulled back this time, on off, Jason Smith waits on it and slaps it to long off for just a single. 14 runs off the first 3 balls but a wicket and 2 runs off the next 3 balls as South Africa end up with 108 on the board!
