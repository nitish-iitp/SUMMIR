RESULTS: Scotland Vs West Indies. (Image: Facebook @Cricket Ki Dunya Official)


Twice winners West Indies crashed to a shocking 42-run defeat by Scotland in their T20 World Cup opener in Hobart today (October 17), the second major upset inside two days at the global showpiece tournament.

The Caribbean side, who won the event in 2012 and 2016, were bundled out for 118 chasing 161 to beat the Scots a day after former champions Sri Lanka lost their Group A opener to Namibia.

Left-arm spinner Mark Watt, who took 3-12, and off-spinner Michael Leask, with figures of 2-15, sealed victory for the associate team, who earlier rode opener George Munsey’s unbeaten 66 to post 160-5 in the Group B match.

Scotland’s George Munsey celebrates his 50 against West Indies in the 2022 T20 Cricket World Cup.

Jason Holder, who picked up two wickets with the ball, waged a lone battle for West Indies with a knock of 38 but it was not enough.

Scotland, who defeated another test-playing nation in Bangladesh in the last T20 World Cup in 2021, outplayed West Indies in all departments.

“Obviously, it is a special win for us,” their captain Richard Berrington said. “There’s a lot of hard work that has gone into to get to this point over the last 12 months.”
