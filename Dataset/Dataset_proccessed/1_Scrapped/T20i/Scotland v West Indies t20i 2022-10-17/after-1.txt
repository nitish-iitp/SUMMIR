That is it from this game then! Another game follows and that is a clash between Zimbabwe and Ireland! Stay tuned for that one as it will begin shortly. Until next time, take care and goodbye!

!

Richie Berrington says it was hard work and it is a special win for them. Adds they wanted a few more runs but they knew they had a competitive score on the board. Credits the way the bowlers bowled and he is very pleased.

!

Nicholas Pooran says it is a tough loss for them. Reckons, 160 was a par score but the middle order was quite poor. Admits they need to play better in the coming games which are must-win. States they are looking forward for the next games.

!

George Munsey. MAN OF THE MATCH SAYS, the injury is not that okay and they will see what they have to do in the coming days. Adds they gave it their all in the field and Mark Watt was brilliant. Reckons it got trickier to bat as the ball went old but he enjoyed it at the start.

!

... TIME FOR THE PRESENTATION ...

!

Earlier in the day, after being inserted, Scotland posted a decent total of 160 thanks to a really good effort by Munsey. However, that score seemed under par at first but a brilliant effort by the ball and some poor batting meant, it was Scotland who finished on top.

!

West Indies will be very disappointed with their performace! They were extremely poor with the bat. They were off to a good start but post the 6th over, they lost wickets in heaps. After the top three, just the one batter crossed the 10-run mark and that was Holder. The game just came all down to his performance but it was too much of an ask from him. In the end, they have fallen short by a big margin.

!

YET ANOTHER UPSET! Windies have been beaten by Scotland and quite convincingly. A brilliant performance with the ball by them. They began brilliantly as they got a wicket early in the Powerplay but it was the overs after the Powerplay that was good. The likes of Watt and Michael Leask really made run-scoring tough and both got crucial wickets. They finished with 5 between them and and only gave away 26 in the 8 overs bowled by them. Those 8 overs really turned the game completely in the favor of Scotland and the pacers backed up the good job and ensured their side came out on top.
