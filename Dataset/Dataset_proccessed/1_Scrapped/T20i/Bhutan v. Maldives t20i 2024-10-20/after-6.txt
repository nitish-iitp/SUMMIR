History
Beginnings

According to the 1877 book, History of Nepal edited by Daniel Wright:

"Attempts have been made at various times by their tutors to get the young men to play cricket and other games, but such amusements are thought degrading".

Over time, cricket came to be considered a gentleman's sport, and involvement was limited mainly to the ruling Rana family and other members of the Nepali elite.

In 1946, the Cricket Association of Nepal was formed to promote cricket amongst the aristocracy. After the introduction of democracy through the Revolution of 1951, cricket began to spread to the rest of the population. In 1961, in an effort to promote cricket to the whole of Nepal, the Cricket Association of Nepal became part of the National Sports Council. Nevertheless, the National games tended to be limited to Kathmandu Valley until the 1980s.

ICC membership

Improvements to communications and transport infrastructure in Nepal allowed the game to expand outside Kathmandu in the 1980s and Nepal became an Affiliate Member of the International Cricket Council in 1988. A major development program was begun in the early 1990s, which saw regional and district tournaments being established and the increased promotion of cricket in schools.

The local population's interest in cricket increased quickly, and the demand to play was such that restrictions had to be placed on the number teams in several tournaments until more facilities could be built in the mid-1990s. Nepal became an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council on February 2, 1996, which was the year the national side played for the first time in the 1996 ACC Trophy in Kuala Lumpur.[citation needed]

By 1998, the facilities in Nepal had improved sufficiently to allow them to host that year's ACC Trophy at grounds in Lalitpur and Kirtipur (at TU Cricket Ground) and Kathmandu.

Currently, the country has one of the best fan followings among ICC Associate Members. It lost for three years its governing body, the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) which was suspended by the International Cricket Council (ICC) due to unnecessary government interference in 2016, but it was reinstated in October 2019.

21st century
2000 – 2009

In 2000, Nepal's youth development policy began to pay off when the Nepal national under-19 cricket team finished eighth in the Under-19 World Cup. The senior side had their best performance to date later in the year when they reached the semi-finals of the 2000 ACC Trophy before losing to Hong Kong at Sharjah. They competed in the ICC Trophy for the first time the following year. In the tournament in Ontario, they beat Germany and Gibraltar, but a loss to eventual runners-up Namibia prevented them from progressing past the first round.

Nepal were runners-up to the UAE in the 2002 ACC Trophy in Singapore and they hosted the ACC Emerging Nations Tournament in 2003, winning easily against Bhutan and the Maldives. They won so comprehensively that they were not invited back to the tournament the next time it was played in 2005. Raju Khadka became the first Nepalese cricketer to score an international century, when he slammed an unbeaten 105 off just 50 balls against Bhutan in the tournament.

Nepal played first-class cricket for the first time in 2004, playing in the ICC Intercontinental Cup against the UAE and Malaysia. They beat Malaysia, but drew with the UAE, failing to reach the semi-final stage. Nepal finished third in the 2004 ACC Fast Track Countries Tournament, which qualified them for the 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup, and finished 5th in the 2004 ACC Trophy, which qualified them for the repêchage tournament of the 2005 ICC Trophy. They finished third in this tournament after beating Qatar in a play-off, meaning that they did not qualify for the 2005 ICC Trophy. Shakti Gauchan scored a century against Italy and stayed unbeaten on 106 off 103 balls in the tournament. They beat the UAE and drew with Hong Kong in the 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup, but missed out on qualification for the semi-finals by half a point. They were runners-up to the UAE in the 2005 ACC Fast Track Countries Tournament.

In March 2006, Nepal played Namibia in Windhoek in a play-off match to decide the final team in the 2006 ICC Intercontinental Cup. Nepal needed to win outright to qualify for the main tournament, but the match was drawn after there was no play on the first day. Later in the year, they toured Pakistan, playing against the Pakistan Cricket Academy before playing in the 2006 ACC Trophy in Kuala Lumpur.

In the 2006 ACC Trophy, Nepal bowled Myanmar out for just runs 10 off 12.1 overs after winning the toss and sending Myanmar in; no batsman scored more than one, the innings included five ducks, and extras top scored with five (three leg byes and two wides). Mehboob Alam and Binod Das picked up seven and three wickets, respectively. In reply, Nepal hit three off the first ball, followed by three wides that went for five, and then hit another three from the second legitimate delivery to win by ten wickets. Some critics called it the greatest mismatch in the history of international cricket and the score of 10 is the lowest in any level of men's international cricket. They finished fourth in the tournament after losing to Afghanistan in a play-off. They won the ACC Premier League in 2006.

They played in the 2007 ACC Twenty20 Cup in Kuwait, where they finished fourth in their first round group.

In May 2008, Nepal traveled to Jersey to play in 2008 ICC World Cricket League Division Five of the World Cricket League. Mehboob Alam set the world record by taking all ten wickets in the match against Mozambique. He got his name in the Guinness World Records for becoming the first bowler to take all 10 wickets in an ICC international cricket match with limited overs. Nepal topped Group A after the group qualifying matches but lost to Afghanistan in the semi-final and finished third overall after defeating the USA in the playoff for third place. With only the top two from this tournament qualifying for 2008 ICC World Cricket League Division Four in Tanzania later in the year, Nepal missed out on the chance to take their 2011 World Cup dream any further. Later, Nepal appeared in the 2008 ACC Trophy Elite and finished fourth after losing to the UAE in the semi-final and to Afghanistan in the playoff for third place.

Nepal finished fifth in the 2009 ACC Twenty20 Cup after beating Singapore by 9 wickets in the playoff for fifth place. In a group match against Kuwait, Nepal needed 7 runs off the last ball to win. Binod Bhandari, making his debut for the national team, hit a last-ball six to tie the match. Eventually Nepal won the match in bowl-out.

2010 – 2014

Nepal won their first major tournament, beating USA in the final of 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Five held at Kathmandu in February 2010. Sharad Vesawkar scored a century and stayed unbeaten on 105 off 134 balls against Fiji in the tournament. Nepal played very well in 2010 ACC Trophy Elite, winning all the matches in group stage and beating Malaysia in the semi-final by 8 runs but lost the final against an ODI team Afghanistan by 95 runs and finished runners-up. Nepal came third in 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Four, thus remaining in Division Four for 2012 ICC World Cricket League Division Four. In November, Nepal appeared in 2010 Asian Games and lost against Sri Lanka in the quarter-final. It was the first match Nepal had played against a Full Member nation.

In December 2011, Nepal hosted the 2011 ACC Twenty20 Cup and finished fourth, thereby qualifying for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier.

Nepal faced Afghanistan in the 3 match T20I series and 5 match ODI series at the start of 2012 but Afghanistan defeated Nepal 3-0 in the T20I series and again defeated Nepal 5-0 in the ODI series.

Nepal finished seventh in the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier after defeating Kenya and Papua New Guinea in play-offs. Shakti Gauchan took the first international hat-trick for Nepal against Denmark in the tournament. In September 2012, Nepal appeared in 2012 ICC World Cricket League Division Four, where Subash Khakurel and Anil Mandal both scored century. Subash Khakurel scored 115 off 142 balls against United States and Anil Mandal scored 113 off 134 balls against Denmark. In a match against Malaysia, Shakti Gauchan set up Nepal's convincing victory with a new record. The left-arm orthodox spinner's figures of 10–8–2–3 is the best economical bowling spell ever in limited over encounters. Nepal won all the six matches of the tournament and progressed to 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three. Nepalese players won man of the match awards in all the six matches Nepal played and Basanta Regmi won the player of the tournament award after taking a total of 21 wickets in the tournament. In October, Nepal competed in 2012 ACC Trophy Elite and had to share the trophy with the UAE after a thrilling tied final in Sharjah Cricket Stadium, UAE on 12 October 2012. UAE posted 241, a target that looked in Nepal's sight after their 94-run opening stand. However, they lost wickets consistently, and eventually needed 12 off the last over with just two wickets in hand. Shakti Gauchan smacked Shadeep Silva's left-arm for a six, but could manage only one run off the last ball, hence ending a splendid final match in a tie. Skipper Paras Khadka scored an unbeaten 106 off just 77 balls against Kuwait, his maiden century for Nepal, in the tournament.

Nepal competed in 2013 ACC Twenty20 Cup held at home grounds in Kirtipur and Lalitpur. Nepal easily marched towards the final of the tournament with high class performance from their captain, Paras Khadka, and the team thrashed the UAE by 6 wickets. Nepal had earlier qualified for 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, reaching the semi-final of the tournament. Nepal had to be satisfied with runners-up status after losing to an ODI team Afghanistan by 7 wickets. The Nepalese team was supported by a huge fan following throughout this tournament with an average turnout of 15,000 – 20,000 (about 25,000 in the semi-final and final) during their matches while hundreds of thousands watched live on television – undoubtedly the largest public support outside the Test-playing nations. Nepal won the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three held in Bermuda and qualified for the 2014 World Cup Qualifier. Nepal also played in 2013 ACC Emerging Teams Cup, where under-23 age level teams of the four Test nations – Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka took part along with the UAE, Afghanistan and the hosts Singapore. Nepal finished third in 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier held in UAE and qualified for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, defeating Hong Kong off the last ball of the thrilling quarter-final.

T20I status and series

On 28 June 2014, the ICC awarded T20I status to Nepal, who took part and performed exceptionally well in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20. Nepal had already played three T20I matches before gaining the status, as the ICC had earlier announced that all matches at the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 would have T20I status.

ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024

In Nepal's debut match of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2024 Group D stage on June 4, 2024, they faced the Netherlands at Dallas. This historic encounter marked the beginning of Nepal's campaign in the tournament, as they sought to make a strong impression in their second World Cup appearance after 10 years. Despite putting up a valiant effort, Nepal fell short against the formidable Dutch side, with the match concluding in a closely contested result. The Netherlands' disciplined bowling attack, spearheaded by left-arm spinner Tim Pringle and Logan van Beek, proved challenging for Nepal's batting lineup, as they were bowled out for 106 runs. However, Nepal fought hard, managing to stretch the game to the 19th over, showcasing their resilience and determination. Reflecting on the match, Nepal's captain Rohit Paudel acknowledged the challenging batting conditions and highlighted the need for stronger partnerships to set a competitive total. While Nepal's bowlers displayed tenacity, missed catching opportunities proved costly, allowing the Netherlands to chase down the target with ease. Max O'Dowd's resilient half-century, supported by Bas de Leede's decisive boundary, sealed the victory for the Netherlands, despite Nepal's spirited performance.

Their second match, against Sri Lanka at the Central Broward Park, was abandoned due to heavy rain, which gave Nepal 1 point.

Their third match, against South Africa at the Arnos Vale Stadium, was historic. Nepal's bowling attack, spearheaded by Kushal Bhurtel, who took 4/19 and Dipendra Singh Airee, who took 3/21 restricted South Africa to only 115/7, with Reeza Hendricks top-scoring with 47 runs. Nepal managed to score 34 runs in the first 7 overs, with Kushal Bhurtel scoring 13 runs off 20 balls. However, the 8th over was disastrous for Nepal. Tabraiz Shamsi bowled out Kushal, and then just 2 balls later, bowled Rohit Paudel for 0 runs. However, Aasif Sheikh and Anil Sah propelled Nepal to 82/2 in 13 overs, needing just 34 runs off 42 balls. However, Aiden Markram managed to get a breakthrough with a great catch from Marco Jansen, seeing off Anil Sah, who made 27 runs off 24 balls. Once more, Aasif Sheikh and Dipendra Singh Airee managed to get on their feet. By the end of the 17th over, Nepal was 98/3, and needed 18 runs off 18 balls. However, Shamsi turned things around, taking 2 wickets in the 18th over, seeing off Airee, who made 6 runs off 11 balls and Aasif, who made 42 runs off 49 balls. However, the target was very much still doable. Nepal needed 16 runs off 12 balls, with Kushal Malla and Gulsan Jha at the crease. However, Anrich Nortje managed to bowl Kushal out, who had made 1 run off 3 balls. Sompal Kami came out and gave his team hope. After 2 consecutive dot balls, he bashed a ball over 100 metres for a maximum, followed by running 2 runs to finish the penultimate over. Nepal needed just 8 runs off 6 balls as the last over started. With Gulsan Jha at strike and Ottneil Baartman balling, the first 2 balls were dots. However, Gulsan turned things around with a cracking boundary for 4. Now, Nepal needed 4 runs off 3 balls. Gulsan managed to get 2 runs, and Nepal needed just 2 runs off 2 balls to make history. Baartman managed to get in a dot ball, and suddenly Nepal needed 2 runs off 1 ball to win and a single for a Super Over. For the last ball, Gulsan couldn't get a hit, and they scrambled for a single. Quinton de Kock threw the ball and it deflected to Klaasen off Gulsan. Gulsan slowed down a bit at the very end, and Heinrich Klaasen managed to run him out, ending in Nepal losing by just 1 run.

This meant that Nepal was out of the World Cup, with just one match remaining, against Bangladesh. Bangladesh won the toss and chose to bat first. Sompal Kami managed to catch and ball out Tanzid Hasan, giving Nepal the advantage from the first ball. The last ball of the over was given out by the empire, but Liton Das reviewed, and a not out was decided. Then, Airee managed to bowl out Najmul Hossain Shanto in the 3rd ball of the second over, ending the over with Bangladesh at just 11/2. Bangladesh managed to stand for another two overs before another wicket. In the final over of the powerplay, Liton Das threw up, and the ball was caught, and by the end of the powerplay, Bangladesh was only 26/3. Just the next over, Paudel managed to get Towhid Hridoy caught out, and Bangladesh ended the over at 31/4. Mahmudullah and Shakib Al Hasan put Bangladesh back on its feat, but at the end of the 8th over, poor running meant Mahmudullah was caught run out, and Bangladesh was a measly 52/5 by the end of the 8th over. By the end of the 10th over, Bangladesh were still only 59/5, but Paudel managed to trap Shakib lbw in the 11th. At the start of the 13th over, Sandeep Lamichhane, who was only playing his second game since his getting suspended on allegations of rape, managed to trap Tanzid lbw, but after an appeal, it appeared the ball would have spun a bit too much, keeping Tanzid on the crease. However, just the next ball, Lamichhane managed to bowl him. By the end of his over, Bangladesh were stranded at 72/7. Lamichhane came to bowl just one over later. He managed to bowl out Jaker Ali, and by the end of his over, Bangladesh were at 75/8, giving Lamichhane his 100th wicket in T20Is. However, Rashid Hossain managed to smash a 6 and a 4 in the next over, which ended in Taskin being nearly caught lbw, but saved by the third umpire. Just the next ball, Airee bowled Rashid out. By the end of their innings, Bangladesh had been restricted to just 106. Nepal started their innings hopeful for a victory, but the powerplay ended with Nepal stranded at 20/3, with Tanzid Hasan Sakib managing to grab a wicket maiden and 3 wickets overall in just the powerplay. The next two overs went similarly, with both Mustafizur Rahman and Tanzim Hasan Sakib grabbing wickets, giving Tanzim 4. As the 6th over ended, Nepal was only 26/5. However, Airee and Kushal Malla managed to give Nepal chances. As the 15th over ended, Nepal had been propelled to 77/5, needing 30 runs off 24 balls. However, just the next over, Mustafizur managed to see off Kushal Malla, and Taskin saw off Gulsan Jha. At the end of the 17th, Nepal were 85/7 and needed 22 runs off 12 balls. Mustafizur, however, had a wicket maiden in the penultimate over, and Nepal were 85/8 and needed 22 runs of f6 balls. In the ultimate over, Shakib managed to get 2 off 2, and Nepal lost, managing only 85 runs due to Taskin's beautiful spell, and Bangladesh were propelled into the Super Eight.
