PAK vs NZ Scorecard
Pakistan vs New Zealand Commentary
6:20 PM IST That’s it from this game. New Zealand have yet again pulled off an upset. Yet another game to go, it is a must win for Pakistan. New Zealand on the other hand, can pull of a series win if they emerge victorious again. That game will be played on 27th of April 2000 IST (1430 GMT). Till then, goodbye and take care!
6:19 PM IST Michael Bracewell says they are learning as the games are passing by and the players did really well today. Shares Pakistan bowlers bowled well in the death, they were hoping for 200 but credits Pakistan again. Mentions it's a huge thing to expose players under pressure, appreciates the way James Neesham played as welll.
6:17 PM IST Babar Azam says they bowled really well, they were expecting around 190 but they restricted New Zealand well but they collapsed with the bat. Adds they planned before the toss, the youngsters did well with the ball though. Reckons they want to test the bench strength and hopefully it works for them.
6:14 PM IST William O'Rourke wins the Player of the Match away. He says they tried to bowl slower balls and it worked out. Adds the new ball was skidding on and they just tried to take the pace of the ball. Reckons they all are learning together and it is working out for them.
6:04 PM IST They got three early courtesy William and Sears. Shadab did not last for long in the middle. However, Zaman and Ahmed put up a really good stand. However, as the game was shifting, as Sears got Zaman and William got Ahmed. Imad fought till the end but it was the Kiwi bowlers who held their nerve and came out on top.
6:00 PM IST It is the Kiwis who have taken an unassailable lead in this series and this is a top effort from their inexperienced bowlers. We felt 178 was slightly under par but their bowlers stepped up to the occasion.
