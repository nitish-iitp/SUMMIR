Shadab Khan Grabs Stunning One-Handed Catch To Dismiss Mark Chapman During PAK vs NZ 4th T20I 2024 Match (Watch Video)
The all-rounder is also an excellent fielder and his athleticism was on show as he plucked a catch out of thin air to dismiss the dangerous Mark Chapman. The left-hander, who had scored 87 runs in the third T20I, was out for just eight runs.

Shadab Khan displayed an example of fine fielding as he took a stunning one-handed catch to dismiss Mark Chapman during the Pakistan vs New Zealand 4th T20I match in Lahore on April 25. Iftikhar Ahmed's ball was cut powerfully by the in-form Chapman and it seemed that the ball was headed to the fence in a flash. But Shadab timed his jump perfectly and plucked out the catch from thin air, resulting in the dismissal. Chapman was dropped in the third T20I and he went on to score 87 off 42 balls. Comedy of Errors! Pakistani Fielders Drop New Zealand Batsman Mark Chapman Thrice During the PAK vs NZ 3rd T20I (Watch Video).
