Dream11 fantasy XI tips and guide for the 2nd T20I of New Zealand vs Pakistan T20I series 2024 between NZ vs PAK to be played in Hamilton.

After a high-scoring game at Eden Park, New Zealand will face Pakistan in the second game of the five-match T20I series on Sunday. This match will be played on January 14 at Seddon Park in Hamilton. New Zealand have a 1-0 lead already. They thrashed Pakistan by 46 runs in the first game.

New Zealand dominated the first game in all departments. On the other hand, Pakistan had a rather poor game. They leaked runs and also couldn’t keep up the rate. So they will have to address some areas to win the next game.
