COMMENTRY
That is it from this match. New Zealand go 2-0 up and could seal the series in the next game where these two meet again on the 17th of this month. Join us at 5.30 am IST (12 am GMT). Join us earlier for the build up. Cheers!
Tim Southee, stand-in skipper for New Zealand says it was a good surface to bat and the openers set it up nicely. Tells Ish Sodhi got two vital wickets and was sensational on the field as well. Ben Sears is young but shows a lot of character. Reckons they lost wickets quickly but the openers did enough to win the game.
Shaheen Afridi says they missed out on making the most of the new ball when swing was on offer. Adds they bowled well after the 10 overs but the start wasn't particularly good.
Finn Allen wins the PLAYER OF THE MATCH AWARD. He says it was important to adapt quickly and have different gears to his game.  Adds he had a chat with Daryl Mitchell and hoped for a score around 200. Tells Kane Williamson is a calm man and they bounce off each other and help each other.
...Presentation next...
New Zealand go 2-0 up in the series. They were definitely nervous while defending. Nothing was going as per their plan but once Adam Milne got the wicket of Zaman, the flood gates opened up for them. They kept it tight after that and even the bowlers came back strongly in the back end. The worrying sign for New Zealand was their fielding. Both Fakhar Zaman and Babar Azam were dropped once and went onto make most of it. On any other day, they could have snatched the result and New Zealand will surely work on the fielding department.
Pakistan have failed to chase down a target twice in a row. This was more gettable though and they were in pole position at one point with Fakhar Zaman and Babar Azam hitting all over the ground. They made most of the lifelines given to them and scored fifties respectively. However, the game took a twist once Fakhar Zaman fell. Yet again the middle order collapsed. Babar Azam was out there but his wicket and Shaheen Afridi's wicket were the final nail in the coffin.

ON A BOUNCE!  Short of a length and outside off. Rauf looks to pull but edges it to the keeper. Devon Conway dives forward and takes it. The third umpire checks and the replay shows it did bounce before going into the mitts.
