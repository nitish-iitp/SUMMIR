Chasing 195, Pakistan lost early wickets but Babar Azam smashed 50 and Fakhar Zaman scored 50 and gave their side some hopes. However, wickets kept on falling and Pakistan got bundled out for 173.

So, Kane Williamson hurt his hamstring and will take no further part in this game. Tim Southee to captain his side. The players are in the middle for the chase. Tim Southee to bowl first..

...THE CHASE...

!

Allen scored a quick fifty but New Zealand lost wickets at regular intervals which hampered their momentum a bit. New Zealand in the last five overs failed to go big and have ended under 200. Pakistan were okay with the ball. They didn't make the most of the swing available at the start and allowed the Kiwi batters to get some easy runs. However, Pakistan will be confident to chase this down. A good start is required for them. Can the openers lay the foundation for others to chase it down? Let's find out.

!

Excellent fightback from Pakistan in the last phase and they have given themselves a real chance to win this game. Anything under 200 and Pakistan were going to be in this game. New Zealand will be disappointed with the score, knowing they were in such a commanding position for a long period. Finn Allen gave a blistering start and he along with Kane Williamson added over 50 runs. The skipper though during the halfway mark got injured out and is still unknown if he will take the field.
