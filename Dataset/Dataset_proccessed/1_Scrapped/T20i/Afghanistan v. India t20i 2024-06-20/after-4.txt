AFG vs IND Scorecard
Afghanistan vs India Commentary
6:27 PM IST Right then, that is it from this one-sided affair. India opens their account in the Super Eights stage while Afghanistan have it all to do in their next two games. However, the action does not stop here as we have a big clash coming up between Australia and Bangladesh on 21st June, Friday. That match will begin at 6 am (12.30 am GMT), but as you know, you can always join us early for all the build-up. Until then, cheers and goodbye!
6:27 PM IST Rohit Sharma, the victorious skipper of India starts by saying that over the last couple of years, they have come to the West Indies and have played a few T20Is and are familiar with the conditions. Adds that 180 was a tremendous effort by the batters and then they knew they had a class bowling lineup. Mentions that it is crucial that the likes of Surya and Hardik come to form and every individual has to do their job and applauds that partnership. On Jasprit Bumrah, says that everyone knows he is class and it is about using him smartly and Bumrah himself takes the responsibility to achieve that. On the extra spinner, he says that nothing is concrete with the playing XI and it also depends on the opposition and if the next venue offers something for the seamers, they will be open to bringing back the extra seamer.
6:25 PM IST Rashid Khan, the captain of Afghanistan says that they knew, they would be chasing in excess of 160 but they could have been smarter with their executions. Adds that his bowling is coming off well and he is hitting the right areas, but the result matters the most. Mentions that they have enjoyed their cricket everywhere but the most important thing is the mindset. Ends by saying that they will play according to the conditions after assessing if it is a batting or bowling track.
6:16 PM IST Suryakumar Yadav is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his breezy half-century. He says that there's a lot of hard work and practice that goes into his play. Adds that he is really happy to get the win and is happy to be the first Indian batter to get the player of the match as well in this tournament. On Rashid Khan, he says that Rashid is very difficult to pick but you have to take him on and he is happy to have had the better of him in this game. Mentions that there is a game plan from the start but he plays according to the game situation and had a chat with Hardik Pandya about keeping their foot on the pedal as it would get hard to hit the ball in the death overs due to the reverse swing and the slower deliveries.
6:15 PM IST Presentation Time...
6:15 PM IST Earlier in the game, India posted a big total on the board courtesy of a fine half-century from SKY along with crucial contributions from Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya, and Axar Patel. Afghanistan were a bit off in this game with the ball and it was their skipper, Rashid Khan who was the pick of the bowler with three wickets. Fazalhaq Farooqi also got three, while Naveen-ul-Haq chipped in with one. While chasing, the Afghans came out with intent, but they kept on losing wickets in clusters that did not help them at all as they faced back-to-back defeats in this World Cup.
