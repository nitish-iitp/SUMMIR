India vs Afghanistan Live Score T20 World Cup 2024, IND vs AFG: 'important for us to use Bumrah smartly,' says Rohit

India vs Afghanistan Live Score T20 World Cup 2024, IND vs AFG:
“The last two years, we have come here (the West Indies) and played some T20 games. We planned a little well. We adapted well to the conditions that were offered. We knew the class of our bowling line up will defend this. Everyone coming in and doing their job. That is something we keep talking about. Surya and Hardik's partnership was a good one in the end. We know what Bumrah can do for us. It is important for us to use him smartly. He is the one who is ready to take the responsibility as well. Whereever he plays, he is always ready to take the responsibility. I got to assess the conditions. Looking at the opposition we are ready to make any changes. We thought three spinners would be good, we went for that. Going forward if needed, I am open to playing three seamers.”

India vs Afghanistan Live Score T20 World Cup 2024, IND vs AFG:
“That was a surface we thought we could chase 170-180. You just go there and how you play. Against bigger teams, we should be thinking we will have to chase such scores. Body is feeling well. I struggled a little in the IPL. I am hitting the areas consistently now. We have enjoyed everywhere we have played. We forget our own skills sometimes. If the conditions are there, we will look to use it.”

India vs Afghanistan Live Score T20 World Cup 2024, IND vs AFG: Suryakumar Yadav is the player of the match

India vs Afghanistan Live Score T20 World Cup 2024, IND vs AFG:
“There's a lot of hardwork, there are a lot of processes and routine involved in it. I am clear in my mind what I want to do. I don't mind giving this Player of the Match to a bowler. First time it's going to a batter (from India in this tournament), I don't mind. I think you just need to know your game plan, and just play accordingly. I still remember when Hardik came in to the bat, I told him let's bat with the same intent. Let's keep pressing the pedal and keep pushing, in the end very happy with a score of 180.”
