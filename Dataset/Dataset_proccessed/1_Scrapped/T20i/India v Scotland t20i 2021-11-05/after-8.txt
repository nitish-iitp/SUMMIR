After India's rampaging win against Scotland which took their net run rate above New Zealand and Afghanistan, here's a look at the records Virat Kohli and Co. shattered during the clash.

India on Friday showed the world what they are truly capable of. The ruthlessness with which the bowlers skittled Scotland for 85 in their T20 World Cup 2021 Super 12 match and the ruthlessness with which the batters chased down the target in 6.3 overs to take their net run rate above New Zealand and Afghanistan reiterated why they entered the tournaments as favourites. Even though the script hasn't quite played out according to plan, they still continue to shatter new records.

And the story was no different during the Scotland encounter in Dubai. For starters, After losing 6 tosses in T20Is, the third-highest streak for an Indian captain, Virat Kohli finally won the toss and elected to bowl first. Courtest of a three-wicket haul each by Mohammed Shami Ravindra Jadeja, Scotland were skittled for 85. In response, Rohit Sharma (30 off 16 balls) and KL Rahul (50 off 19 balls) powered the side over the line with 8 wickets and 13.3 overs to spare.
