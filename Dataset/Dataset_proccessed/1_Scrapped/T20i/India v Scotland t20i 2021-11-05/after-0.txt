India vs Scotland Score T20 World Cup 2021 Match Highlights: Bowlers Shine As India Thrash Scotland By 8 Wickets
T20 World Cup 2021 Highlights, IND vs SCO: Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul bossed their way through the run-chase as India completed Scotland's thrashing in just 6.3 overs and eight wickets remaining in the Super 12 game of the T20 WC 2021 in Dubai.

Indian openers KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma provided India with a solid platform at the start of the run-chase to help the team register a thumping 8-wicket victory with 13.3 overs to spare. Rahul scored a magnificent half-century in only 18 balls while Suryakumar Yadav ended the match with a six. This win has helped India better their net run-rate significantly but is still dependent on the results of New Zealand and Afghanistan. Bowling first, Mohammed Shami and Ravindra Jadeja bowled devastating spells while Jasprit Bumrah also pitched in with two wickets as India bundled out Scotland for 85 runs in 17.4 overs. Ravichandran Ashwin claimed one wicket during his tight four overs as India struck in quick succession from early-on in the game after captain Virat Kohli won the toss and opted to bowl versus Scotland in their fourth match in the Super 12 game of the T20 World Cup 2021 at the Dubai International Stadium in Dubai. Earlier, India made one change as they brought back Varun Chakaravarthy in place of Shardul Thakur, while Scotland went in unchanged. After enduring two back-to-back defeats in the first two matches vs Pakistan and New Zealand, India bounced back to hammer Afghanistan by 66 runs and open their account. However, their challenge will be to register another convincing victory against the Scottish side in order to better their net run-rate going ahead into the tournament. (SCORECARD)

Virat Kohli said during Toss, "We are going to bowl first. Dew is going to be a big factor. Try and restrict them and chase it down. Winning my first toss on my birthday, probably we should have played the first game on my birthday (smiles). The intensity from ball one is important. For us, it's just about keeping that intensity on for 20 overs. That's something we expect from people. Shardul makes way for Varun - third spinner."

India Need To Show Positive Intent !


Former India cricketer Virender Sehwag praised Team India for showing "positive intent" during their dominant victory vs Afghanistan in the ongoing T20 WC in Abu Dhabi


Sehwag said:


"I think when things fall your way, the body language automatically changes... Today, we were playing against a team where we could have picked ourselves up had the body language been down. There was positive intent in both batting and bowling. Fielding was really good and our team took really good catches."
