Japan Complete Perfect Tour With Indonesia Win
2024-10-05 Important news News & Articles National Team (Men)

Japan finished the eight match tour of Korea with a 100% winning record after a huge victory over Indonesia.

On a day where everything went right for Japan, Captain Kendel Kadowaki-Fleming won the toss and chose to bat and proceeded to bat the whole innings.

More circumspect than normal, Kadowaki-Fleming waited until the 19th over to free his arms and eventually ended 85 not out from 64 balls.

He was ably supported by Lachlan Yamamoto-Lake (26), Ben Ito-Davis (29) and Sabaorish Ravichandran (26*) as Japan finished 173 for two from 20 overs.

The Japanese bowlers then did their part, dismantling the Indonesia batting line up. Piyush Kumbhare grabbed three cheap wickets while two run outs also showed the Japanese fire in the field.

Japan wrapped up victory in the 11th over bowling Indonesia all out for just 29 runs to secure a 144-run victory.

In the most match ceremonies Kadowaki-Fleming was named Best Batter and Tournament Most Valuable Player, while Sabaorish Ravichandran was also acknowledged for his contributions.

The team now awaits news on when and where the Asia/EAP Regional Final will be hosted, where they will take on Kuwait, Malaysia, Nepal, Oman, Papuan New Guinea and Samoa and two teams still to be determined from the Asia Region.
