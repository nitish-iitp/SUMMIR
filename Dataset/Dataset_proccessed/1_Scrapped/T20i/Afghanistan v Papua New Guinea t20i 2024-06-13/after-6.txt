Afghanistan 101 for 3 (Naib 49*, Kamea 1-16) beat Papua New Guinea 95 (Doriga 27, Farooqi 3-16, Naveen 2-4) by seven wickets

Afghanistan booked their place in Super Eight, thereby knocking New Zealand out of men's T20 World Cup 2024, after a seven-wicket win over PNG in Tarouba.

Their win was set up by new-ball spells from fast bowlers Fazalhaq Farooqi and Naveen-ul-Haq that saw PNG lose five wickets inside the powerplay. A total of four run-outs did not help PNG's cause either as they were dismissed for 95.

Afghanistan romped home with 29 balls to spare with Gulbadin Naib staying unbeaten on 49. The result meant that for the first time since 2014, New Zealand bowed out before the semi-final stage of a men's World Cup - ODI or T20.

With six points and a net run rate of 4.230, Afghanistan lead Group C.

Naib douses a brief spark from PNG

A target of 96 would not have worried Afghanistan. Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran had added century stands for the opening wicket in each of their first two games. Gurbaz had struck fifties in those outings. As a result, the middle order had barely had time in the middle. On Thursday, Afghanistan's worst fears nearly came true.

Semo Kamea, brought in for vice-captain Charles Amini, almost struck first ball when Ibrahim was ruled out lbw. He used the DRS to his benefit but lost his stumps three balls later while trying to attack an inswinger from Kamea. In the next over, fast bowler Alei Neo knocked over Gurbaz, who also charged down to heave one across the line. PNG could have put even more pressure on Afghanistan had wicketkeeper Kiplin Doriga hung on to Naib's outside edge in the fifth over.

PNG were left to rue those chances on a surface with dry grass, which, as Daren Ganga had said in his pitch report, contributed to variable bounce. The proof was in Azmatullah Omarzai's dismissal when a length ball from Norman Vanua barely got up and bowled him.

But Naib, in the company of Mohammad Nabi, countered the conditions to ensure Afghanistan faced no further hiccups.

Vala run-out triggers collapse

PNG made almost the right start after being sent in. A double through fine leg, a single through point, a cut shot for four - they were ticking along without any risk. But it all went south when captain Assad Vala was run out in the second over. Going for the third run, his bat was in the air at the non-striker's end when Gurbaz nailed a direct hit at the bowler's end. Had Vala slid his bat, he would have been safe.

Farooqi then did what he does best: flummox batters with swing. He had Lega Siaka caught behind by Gurbaz diving full length to his right and then, on the next ball, Sese Bau also nicked one behind.

When Naveen got Hiri Hiri to chop one onto his stumps on the first ball of the fourth over, PNG had lost four wickets in nine balls. Batting first on a used surface that hosted the West Indies-New Zealand clash just 24 hours ago, that was handing over advantage on a platter.

Doriga leads mini-recovery for PNG

When Naveen crashed through Tony Ura for his 50th T20I wicket, PNG were reduced to 30 for 5. PNG needed to bat a few overs safely at that point, and Chad Soper and Doriga did that for 24 balls while scoring 16 runs. But in the tenth over, both were guilty of ball-watching, which resulted in Soper being run out.

Doriga then used the slog sweep and sweep to rotate strike against Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmad. Neo punished the seamers when they bowled on his pads. The pair was effective without being enterprising and added 38 off 34 balls.

Once Doriga was done in by a wrong'un from Noor to be trapped lbw, PNG lost their last three wickets for just seven runs.
