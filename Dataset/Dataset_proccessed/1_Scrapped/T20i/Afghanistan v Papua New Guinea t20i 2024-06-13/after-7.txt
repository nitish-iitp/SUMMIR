Right then, that is it from Match number 29 where Afghanistan convincingly defeated Papua New Guinea by 7 wickets and qualified for the Super 8s, being the table-toppers with a very healthy NRR. Afghanistan now travel to St. Lucia to face the formidable West Indies for their last league game, while PNG will face the Kiwis at this very venue after a couple of moons. Next up in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, 2024, is a very crucial Group A clash between Ireland and the co-hosts USA. Ireland will look forward to getting their first points on the board whereas the USA will be aiming to confirm their berth for the Super 8s with another win. That game will begin on Friday, 14th June, and the first ball will be bowled at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT). But as always, you can surely join us for the pre-match build-up. Till then, cheers, and take care!

!

The captain of Afghanistan, Rashid Khan says that it is a great feeling to qualify for the next round.  Adds that the boys have made things easy for him as they know what to do and how to execute. Feels that it is very important to have someone like Rahmanullah Gurbaz who can tee off from ball one. Adds that having Farooqi in the team is the same with the ball. Shares that openers have given the team good starts and it was a good opportunity for others to spend some time in the middle. Feels that players benefitted by playing in the domestic tournament back home. Further says that due to franchise cricket, a few players have played before in St Lucia and hopes that it will help in getting a fair idea of the surface. Reckons that they have the skill to adapt to any condition and hopes that they can against the West Indies as well.

!

Assad Vala, the skipper of Papua New Guinea says that Afghanistan is a really good team and giving them four crucial wickets through run outs put them under immense pressure. Adds it has been challenging, not only for them but for every team and you have to keep wickets in hand and launch in the end. Reckons that the bowling has been really good and that they bowled tight lines and lengths to keep the oppositions under pressure. Says the execution was very good as they created a couple of opportunities but failed to take them. Ends up by saying getting an exposure of playing against high speed bowlers is a challenge.

!

Fazalhaq Farooqi is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his stellar showing with the ball. Starts by congratulating the people of Afghanistan for the team's progress to the Super 8 stage. Says that he feels happy to contribute to the team. Mentions that he knows how to carry his body and one warm-up game was enough for him to get into rhythm. Adds that he tries to keep it simple and stick to his strengths. Shares that if there is swing on offer, he looks for wickets but if there is no help, he tries to bowl it in the right areas and tries to not give much away. Ends by saying that they always try to give their 100 per cent and will look to do the same in the next game as well.

The presentation ceremony...

!

Earlier in the game, the Afghan bowlers came out all guns blazing, and PNG's top order was blown away early in their innings. Fazalhaq Farooqi was the chief destroyer, striking double blows in his very first over to leave PNG reeling. With wickets tumbling like ninepins, the Papua New Guinea batters found themselves on a sticky wicket at 17/4, as they failed to cope with the fiery Afghan pace attack. Naveen-ul-Haq also joined the party, chipping in with a crucial couple of wickets. To add to PNG's misery, they also suffered four run outs and went down in tatters. Kipling Doriga and Alei Nao stitched a good little partnership that added 38 runs together but couldn't cross the three figures. Into the chase, Afghanistan was challenged early on as both the openers fell within a short span of time but Azmatullah Omarzai and Gulbadin Naib ensured they don't get under pressure and with Mohammad Nabi's crucial contributions, Afghanistan leaped ahead and registered their third win.

!

Papua New Guinea started decently with the ball as Alei Nao and Semo Kamea bowled tight lines and lengths. But they leaked too many extras, a luxury they couldn't afford while defending a paltry total. Semo Kamea struck early, removing Zadran, while Alei Nao joined the wicket-taking party soon after as well. Papua New Guinea could have tasted further success had Kipling Doriga not grassed a straightforward chance off Gulbadin's bat. Norman Vanua then broke the partnership with a peach of a delivery and ignited the hopes back for PNG, well, just for a brief moment. But that was all for them as they failed to maintain the pressure in the middle overs. Truth be told, their modest total on the board meant they were always fighting an uphill battle to make a real contest of it. Nevertheless, their spirited effort provided a valuable learning experience for this Oceanian nation.

!

On the hunt for their third win, Afghanistan started off cautiously with openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran sizing up the conditions. Gurbaz didn't let the loose deliveries go unpunished, finding a boundary and a six, but Zadran fell cheaply for a duck. Gurbaz too departed soon after trying to be extra aggressive, leaving Afghanistan struggling early at 22/2. However, Gulbadin Naib and Azmatullah Omarzai steadied the ship with a crucial partnership, ensuring the required rate never became a burden. Azmatullah Omarzai, after a sedate 13 perished but Gulbadin Naib held his end well staying unbeaten on 49, and with Mohammad Nabi's contribution of 16 runs, they cruised through comfortably in the end.

!

THREE WINS ON THE TROT FOR AFGHANISTAN, AND THEY OFFICIALLY LEAPFROG INTO THE SUPER 8s! A well-deserved one for the men in blue. Humbling Uganda in their first game, and then decimating the Kiwis in their second, and now defeating Papua New Guinea convincingly. Quite a dream run for them but a great learning curve for Papua New Guinea at this platform. And with this, Afghanistan and West Indies are the two teams from Pool C to advance to the next stage, the Super 8s, which means, New Zealand, Uganda, and Papua New Guinea are officially knocked out of this year's T20 World Cup.

SIX! Gulbadin Naib finishes the game off in style! Afghanistan are through to the Super 8 stage! Chad Soper serves it right in the slot, on off, Gulbadin Naib picks up the length early and goes down town. Gets more height than distance but gets enough bat on to clear the long on fielder who ran across to his left. Naib celebrates by flexing his muscles and it is all smiles in the Afghan camp. Afghanistan win by 7 wickets with 4.5 overs to spare!
