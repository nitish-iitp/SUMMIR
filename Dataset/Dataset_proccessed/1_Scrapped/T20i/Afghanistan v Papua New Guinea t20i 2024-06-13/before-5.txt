WI vs NZ Dream 11 Team Prediction Today: Rovman Powell's West Indies will square off against Kane Williamson's New Zealand in the 26th match of the 2024 T20 World Cup at the Brian Lara Cricket Academy in Trinidad. The Windies are coming off a massive 134-run win over Uganda while the Kiwis lost their first match by 84 runs against Afghanistan.
New Zealand find themselves teetering on the edge of premature departure and must orchestrate a remarkable turnaround as they prepare to confront tournament co-hosts West Indies in a pivotal T20 World Cup showdown. The clash, scheduled at the Brian Lara Cricket Academy, follows a startling upset for New Zealand in their inaugural match against Afghanistan.
Since 2015, New Zealand have epitomized consistency in World Cup campaigns, securing semi-final berths in all six editions - spanning the ODI World Cups of 2015, 2019, and 2023, alongside the T20 renditions of 2016, 2021, and 2022. Despite reaching the final thrice, victory has eluded them. Nonetheless, their prospects hang in the balance after a resounding 84-run defeat to Afghanistan, rendering their forthcoming encounter against the West Indies an almost predetermined outcome.
The West Indies stand in a formidable position, poised to clinch a Super Eight spot should they notch their third successive triumph. The home team commenced their journey with a gritty win against Papua New Guinea, followed by a commanding 134-run victory over Uganda, restricting the opposition to a mere 39 runs.
