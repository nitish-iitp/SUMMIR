This is the third match of the tournament and Kenya's first. In the morning, Rwanda won over the Gambia by the walkover method without a ball being bowled.

The Irfan Karim-led Kenya team looks more balanced and hopeful of starting their campaign with a victory. On the other hand, Mozambique will also try its best to keep the results in its favour.
