Live Score Australia vs West Indies T20 World Cup 2021 Match Live Updates (AP Image)

AUS vs WI T20 World Cup 2021 Cricket Updates: Hello and welcome to our coverage of the Australia vs West Indies T20 World Cup match score and updates. David Warner smashed an unbeaten 89 off 56 balls to lead Australia to an eight-wicket win over West Indies in their final Super 12 match of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium here on Saturday. Warner’s knock, laced with nine fours and four sixes, along with Mitchell Marsh’s 53 off 32 balls, was instrumental in Australia chasing down 158 with 22 balls remaining, giving a big boost to their net run rate in Group 1 standings.

Australia have found a lot of form with the bat and ball and when they get going, they have proved to be a difficult team to beat. Mitchell Starc and Adam Zampa will hold the key once again and West Indies batting have their work cut out.

On paper, West Indies look a deflated unit and Australia come into this game as favourites, but for the defending champion, the motivation to spoil the party of Australia should act as a big motivation factor.
