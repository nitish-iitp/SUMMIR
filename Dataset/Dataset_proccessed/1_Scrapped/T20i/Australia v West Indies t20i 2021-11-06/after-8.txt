West Indies’ Chris Gayle interacts with the crowd during the ICC Twenty20 World Cup 2021 match against Australia in Abu Dhabi on November 6, 2021.

Wearing a beaming smile and sunglasses under a helmet, 'Universe Boss' Chris Gayle seems to have played his last World Cup game and the big-hitting Jamaican is hoping to exit the international stage in front of his home fans.

The happenings inside the Sheikh Zayed Stadium during and after the T20 World Cup game against Australia suggested that the swashbuckling Gayle has played his final game as he walked off to a standing ovation from his teammates after scoring a nine-ball 15 on Saturday.
