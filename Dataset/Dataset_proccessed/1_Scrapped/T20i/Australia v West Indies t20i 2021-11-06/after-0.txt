Australia ensure semi-final spot with big win over West Indies

David Warner hit an unbeaten 89 for Australia.

Published Nov 6, 2021

Australia booked their place in the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup following a crushing eight-wicket win over the West Indies in Abu Dhabi.

The victory left South Africa needing an emphatic win over England in their final Super 12s game to deny Australia a last-four spot and, although the Proteas secured victory, Australia’s superior run rate took them through.

David Warner and Mitchell Marsh made half-centuries to spoil the West Indies swansong of Dwayne Bravo and, possibly, the final international appearance of Chris Gayle.

But Warner, who smashed nine fours and four sixes in an unbeaten 56-ball 89, and Marsh made light work of the reply as their 124 partnership saw Australia cross the finishing line with 22 balls to spare.

Marsh fell for 53 in the final knockings as he drove to Jason Holder at mid-on and gave Gayle a wicket and a moment to savour.

The West Indies had already been eliminated from the competition but the stakes remained high for the holders.

The 2016 champions needed to win to maintain their place inside the top eight ranked nations and secure automatic qualification for the next T20 World Cup.

But the departure of Gayle, chopping on to Pat Cummins for 15, sparked a mini-collapse which saw Australia take three wickets in the space of seven balls.

Lewis and Shimron Hetmyer repaired the damage with a partnership of 35 before the former fell to a tumbling Steve Smith catch for Adam Zampa to become the leading Super 12s wicket-taker with 11.

Hazlewood returned to remove Hetmyer and send Bravo on his way for the final time to finish with impressive figures of 4-0-39-4.

At that stage the West Indies were 126 for six with just 15 balls of the innings left, but Pollard and two closing sixes from Andre Russell provided belated momentum.
