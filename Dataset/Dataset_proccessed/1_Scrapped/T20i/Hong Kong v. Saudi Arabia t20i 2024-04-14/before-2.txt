MI vs CHE (Mumbai Indians vs Chennai Super Kings), 29th T20 Match – Match Information
Match: Mumbai Indians vs Chennai Super Kings, 29th T20 Match

Date: 14th April 2024
Time: 07:30 IST

MI vs CHE (Mumbai Indians vs Chennai Super Kings), 29th T20 Match Preview

The Mumbai Indians team has won their last two matches, so there’s no need to change the lineup. They will likely stick with the same winning team when they play against CSK.

At the Wankhede Stadium, spin bowlers won’t get much assistance so that CSK might replace Maheesh Theekshana with Matheesha Pathirana. They shouldn’t make any other changes unless someone gets injured before the match.

Our prediction favors Mumbai Indians to win.
