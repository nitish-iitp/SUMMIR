KATHMANDU, April 15: The much-anticipated match between Nepal and Hong Kong in the ACC Premier Cup in Oman today faces a delay due to rain.




Scheduled to commence at 11:45 PM at Al Amerat Cricket Ground-1, the match is currently experiencing light rainfall. The pitch has been covered to protect it from the rain, indicating a likely delay in the start of the game and potential reduction of overs.

The timing of the toss will be determined once the rain subsides. Originally scheduled for 11:15 PM, the toss is expected to be delayed.




Both teams' players have arrived at the ground, and once the rain stops, the game is expected to kick off. Despite the challenging weather conditions, both Nepal and Hong Kong are eager to secure a victory. Nepal aims to defeat Hong Kong to solidify their position for the semi-finals. Having won against Malaysia and Qatar in their previous matches, Nepal is in good form. On the other hand, Hong Kong secured a victory against Qatar but faced a defeat against Saudi Arabia.




The Premier Cup champion, among the ten participating teams, will earn a spot in the Asia Cup T20 tournament.
