Explained: Why Zimbabwe are playing Gambia and Seychelles for T20 World Cup qualification

Zimbabwe, an ICC Full Member, are playing against 95th-ranked Gambia and 91st-ranked Seychelles for their 2026 T20 World Cup qualification. Here’s why.

Like the previous edition, 20 teams will be vying for the title in the 2026 T20 World Cup. While 12 teams have secured direct entries, the remaining eight spots will be decided by sub-regional qualifiers, leading to regional finals. Africa, Europe and Asia have two qualification spots, while the Americas and East-Asia Pacific regions have one each.

ICC's 108 members will take part in the qualification process for the tournament to be jointly held in India and Sri Lanka.

Which teams gained direct qualification?

India and Sri Lanka qualified automatically as hosts. The first eight spots have been filled by Super Eight qualifiers of the 2024 T20 World Cup. Two more spots have been allotted for the best-ranked teams which did not qualify for this stage, which has been increased to three as India, who made it to the Super Eights, qualified as a host nation as well.

India, Australia, England, West Indies, Afghanistan, South Africa, Bangladesh and the USA have qualified. Pakistan, New Zealand and Ireland have also made it to the next edition on the back of their rankings.

How USA's rise hurt Zimbabwe's chances

Zimbabwe, a Full Member, have missed out on several World Cups over the years, most recently the 2024 T20 World Cup after Uganda’s shock qualification.

USA, ranked 17th, performed exceedingly well in their maiden World Cup last time, including a historic win against Pakistan that helped them reach the Super Eights stage, gaining direct entry for the next edition.

The USA's progression hurt Zimbabwe as that spot would have otherwise gone to the 12th-ranked team, i.e., Zimbabwe. Ireland, placed 11th at the time of the cut-off date were the last side to qualify based on their rankings.

Failure to secure another direct qualification means Zimbabwe have to work towards the 2026 T20 World Cup via the indirect route. This starts with the Sub-Regional Africa Qualifier B in Kenya, where they have been grouped with Gambia (ranked 95th), Kenya (33rd), Mozambique (64th), Rwanda (63rd), and Seychelles (91st).
