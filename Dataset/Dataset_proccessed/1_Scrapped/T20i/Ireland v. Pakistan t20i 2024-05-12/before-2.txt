Ireland name squad for T20 World Cup in USA and Caribbean

Mark Adair and his brother Ross have been named in the Ireland squad for the T20 Cricket World Cup

Holywood brothers Mark and Ross Adair have been named in the Ireland squad for T20 World Cup in the United States and Caribbean.

The Ireland team will be captained by Belfast native Paul Stirling and includes North West Warriors duo Graham Hume and Craig Young.

Before June’s World Cup, Ireland will play a three-match T20 series against Pakistan in Dublin, before heading to Voorburg to play in the Tri-Series with hosts Netherlands and Scotland. Josh Little won’t play in either the Pakistan series or the Tri-Series due to his IPL duties, but will link up with the squad for the World Cup.

Head Coach Malan said: “We have an intensive block of T20 cricket coming up this month ahead of the T20 World Cup – we have seven games in 15 days as preparation for the tournament. We will not be treating those seven games as warmups, though, we’ll be aiming to win as many of those games as possible.

“The T20 format is fast-paced, think-on-your-feet style of cricket. To find a way to win – given the often frenetic and evolving game going on around you – is a skill you can truly only ever learn and develop on the field of play.

“The squad is one that we have gradually developed and tested out over the last 18 or so months – the skill sets we need to cover are there, albeit we have allowed Josh [Little] to continue in the IPL until his side end their campaign, so he will likely join us ahead of the big tournament.

“We are now entering the final stretch before the T20 World Cup begins, it will be a challenging couple of weeks, but we’re ready to tackle whatever is thrown at us.”

Meanwhile, the Northern Knights will face the North West Warriors at Stormont in the IP20 with 3.30pm on Wednesday. The two teams will clash again in a 50 overs match at the same venue on Thursday.

T20 WORLD CUP SQUAD

Paul Stirling (Capt), Mark Adair, Ross Adair, Andrew Balbirnie, Curtis Campher, Gareth Delany, George Dockrell, Graham Hume, Josh Little, Barry McCarthy, Neil Rock, Harry Tector, Lorcan Tucker, Ben White, Craig Young.
