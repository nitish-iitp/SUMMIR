All Blacks team: Scott Robertson gambles against Japan as Cam Roigard returns, new skipper named and rookie finally in his preferred position

Split with All Blacks Cam Roigard, Patrick Tuipulotu and Wallace Sititi.

Powerhouse second-row Patrick Tuipulotu has been named as captain of the All Blacks for the first time as Scott Robertson’s men face Japan later this week.

The selection also sees the return of scrum-half Cam Roigard to Test rugby for the first time since the Rugby World Cup due to a long-term injury.

He is partnered in half-backs by Damian McKenzie while Billy Proctor gets a chance to add to his sole Test cap in the midfield with Anton Lienert-Brown.

Robertson kept the theme of giving players chances in his back-three with the electric duo of Sevu Reece and Mark Tele’a on the wings while playmaking Stephen Perofeta gets a chance to prove his worth in the 15 shirt.

Sititi at eight

In the pack, Wallace Sititi finally gets an opportunity to start at his preferred number eight position after spectacularly forcing his way into the All Blacks side during the Rugby Championship at blindside. The rookie is joined by the centurion Sam Cane as Samipeni Finau gets another chance in the back-row.

Captain Tuipulotu is joined by Blues teammate and promising rookie Sam Darry in the second-row with props Tamaiti Williams and Pasilio Tosi joined by hooker Asafo Aumua in a powerhouse front-row.

New faces

There are two possible debutants on the bench in the form of the elusive running outside back Ruben Love and rising back-row Peter Lakai who only recently joined the squad due to injuries in his position.

George Bell, Ofa Tu’ungafasi and Fletcher Newell are the front-row options with Josh Lord the last of the forward replacements. Experienced pair TJ Perenara and David Havili round out the matchday squad.

Robertson praised the two new faces and the new skipper as he detailed how the All Blacks are expecting a fast game against Eddie Jones’ Japan.

“We have had a fantastic few days in Tokyo so far and the energy in the group as we kick off this tour is exciting to see. We will bring that energy when we face the Brave Blossoms on Saturday, as we know that Japan will play a fast, attacking game,” he said.

“We are all thrilled for Ruben and Peter who will get their chance to make their mark on the black jersey for the first time, and for Stephen and Cam who have both worked hard to make their return from injury. Congratulations also to Patrick for being named as All Blacks Captain. Pat has great mana, leadership and experience; it’s a proud moment for him and his whānau.

“The welcome and hospitality we have received in Japan has been very humbling, so we look forward to repaying this support with a performance to be proud of on Saturday.”
