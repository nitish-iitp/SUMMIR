AUS vs SL T20 World Cup 2021 Highlights: David Warner showed signs of returning back to form as he scored 65 off 42 balls, guiding Australia to a convincing win against Sri Lanka at the T20 World Cup in Dubai on Thursday evening. Chasing a challenging 155-run target, Warner along with skipper Aaron Finch got off to a brisk start as the pair added 70 runs for the first wicket. Finch was dismissed on 37 off 23 balls and soon after his dismissal Glenn Maxwell too returned to the pavilion. However, a good partnership between Warner and Steve Smith set the tone for Australia's win before the Australian opener was dismissed on 65. Marcus Stoinis and Smith then completed the run-chase with three overs to spare. Meanwhile, after being invited to bat first Sri Lanka managed to post 154/6 in 20 overs. The team started off strong, adding 53/1 in the powerplay. However, some solid bowling by Australia, especially Adam Zampa in the middle overs helped them bounce back in the contest. Sri Lanka lost four wickets in the span of four overs, but a late blitz by Bhanuka Rajapaksa allowed Sri Lanka to post a respective total on the board. With the bat Kusal Perera and Charith Asalanka scored 35 each, while Rajapaksa finished the innings unbeaten on 33 off 26 balls. Among the bowlers, Zampa, Mitchell Starc, and Pat Cummins combined to pick two wickets each.   ...Read More
