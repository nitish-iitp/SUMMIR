T20 World Cup 2021, Australia vs Sri Lanka Highlights:
22:42 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
AUS win by seven wickets!

What Warner and Finch started, Stoinis finishes it off in style again! He takes on Kumara and punishes him with a six over wide long-on and then seals the win with a classy four. Two in two for Australia now! AUS: 155/3 (17 overs)

22:31 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
WICKET!

There's the breakthrough, albeit a bit late! Shanaka introduces himself into the attack and he instantly makes an impact. Warner tries to go big but his lofted shot is caught by Rajapaksa. He departs after a 42-ball 65. AUS: 130/3 (15 overs)

22:26 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
AUS need 31 runs in 35 balls

Australia are in total control now! Warner (64*) clobbers Chameera for two straight boundaries. AUS: 124/2 (14 overs)

22:19 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
Warner brings up his fifty!

Warner hits his eighth four of the innings against Theekshana and then takes a single to reach his fifty... in just 31 balls. On the other end, Smith has settled in well. Sri Lanka need multiple wickets before it's too late. AUS: 108/2 (12 overs)

22:02 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
CAUGHT OUT!

Maxwell's (5) promotion to number three does not work out! Hasaranga gets his second of the night. The batter tries to heave a slower ball over mid-wicket but Fernando catches it near the boundary rope. AUS: 80/2 (8.3 overs)

21:56 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
BOWLED HIM!

Hasaranga comes into the attack and the Sri Lanka fans find their voice! After getting hit for a four on his first ball, the spinner cleans Finch up. He goes back after a 23-ball 37. A wrong 'un does the trick in the end. AUS: 70/1 (7 overs)

21:51 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
Warner, Finch make it to end of powerplay

Dubai is on fire right now! Be it Kumara or Chameera or Theekshana, every single one of Sri Lanka's bowlers are getting punished by the pair of Finch (37*) and Warner (25*). Australia need 92 runs in 84 balls now. AUS: 63/0 (6 overs)

21:38 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
AUS on fire!

After Warner gets in on the act with a four against Theekshana, Finch clobbers his third boundary of the innings against Chameera. He plays it on top of the bounce and it's a crunching on-drive. Australia on a roll now. AUS: 23/0 (3 overs)

21:28 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
Warner, Finch open for AUS

Warner and Finch open the chase for Australia and they are off to a bright start! Karunaratne restarts the proceedings with the ball and he gets punished by the skipper with two boundaries on the off-side. Quality. AUS: 9/0 (1 over)

21:13 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
SL end on 154/6, AUS need 155 to win!

Rajapaksa (33*) and Karunaratne (9*) make it to the end of the innings after scoring 19 runs in the last two overs. Two boundaries and lots of running takes Sri Lanka to a fighting total. Earlier, Asalanka (35) and Perera (35) joint top-scored for their team. Now, everything rests on the spinners against the mighty Australian batting attack. SL: 154/6 (20 overs)

A fighting total!
???? finish on 1??5??4??/6?? ??

CAUGHT OUT!

Gone! Shanaka (12) slices one up in the air and it's taken by Wade. Cummins with the wicket. SL: 135/6 (18 overs)

20:55 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
FOUR! FOUR! SIX!

Rajapaksa (26*) finally finds his groove and it has come at the right time! He takes on Stoinis and smacks him for two fours with two very similar sweeps. Next, he gets one in the slot and it's a huge maximum. SL: 128/5 (17 overs)

20:44 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
Rajapaksa, Shanaka hold fort

After Hasaranga's dismissal by Starc, Rajapaksa (10*) and skipper Shanaka (3*) have been cautious. Losing four wickets in the space of 27 balls is some collapse from the Lankans. Australia are aiming to scalp a few more. SL: 104/5 (15 overs)

20:31 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
WICKET!

Gone! Fernando (4) takes the bait and swipes it across line but the ball is caught by Smith! Zampa gets his second of the evening and suddenly, Sri Lanka are in decline. Hasaranga comes on to partner Rajapaksa (2*). SL: 90/4 (12 overs)

20:25 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
BOWLED HIM!

Just when Perera was starting to open up a bit, Starc strikes! Top, top bowling from the pacer as he cleans the batter up on 35. A perfect yorker and Perera is too slow to react with his bat. On comes Rajapaksa. SL: 86/3 (10.3 overs)

20:16 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
CAUGHT OUT!

There's the breakthrough! Asalanka (35), who was enjoying in the middle, falls to the googly of Zampa! He gets down on one knee to slog-sweep, mistimes it and sends it straight to Smith in the deep. Perera's on 29*. SL: 78/2 (9.4 overs)

A desperately needed strike for Australia ?

Asalanka's entertaining knock of 35 comes to an end with the spin of Adam Zampa doing the trick. #T20WorldCup | #AUSvSL | https://t.co/dkIIjDEJLc pic.twitter.com/Vgx0VsuDJm

STAT ATTACK:

Sri Lanka's Powerplay score of 53-1 is the fourth-highest Powerplay total of the tournament so far. Sri Lanka's WinViz is now up to 43 percent. ( Via Cricviz )

20:03 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
PowerPlay comes to an end!

Kusal Perera gets a top-edge and its over the keeper for a four, the last over of the Powerplay goes for 7. Sri Lanka on top despite losing Nissanka early! And that is mainly due to the counter-attacking game by Asalanka who is on 27 off 18 balls. A few of his shots do remind of the legendary Sanath Jayasuriya!  SL - 53/1 after 6 ovs

19:53 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
Charith Asalanka on the charge

He greets Glenn Maxwell with a massive six over the cow corner. This is followed by a boundary and five wides. He races on to 19 from 7 balls. 16 runs from the over and a positive start for SL, even though they are a wicket down. They'll need 170 to challenge the AUS batting line-up. SL - 41/1 after 4 ovs 

19:48 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
Back to back boundaries

Charith Asalanka starts with couple of crunching shots – two consecutive fours off Mitchell Starc. An eventful over from Pat Cummins comes to an end. 14 runs and a wicket in it. SL - 25/1 after 3 ovs

19:47 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
Four & OUT!

Nissanka plays a lovely pick-up shot on the on-side and then attempts a similar shot on the off-side but this time the timing is not good at all. Warner take it comfortable and SL lose their first wicket! Sri Lanka 15/1 after 2.3 overs. 

19:39 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
Tidy over!

Just six runs from the Starc over! In T20Is in 2021, Kusal Perera has an average of 65.5 and has scored at 129.7 against pacers. Whereas, against spinners, he has averaged 6.2 and strikes at 74.

19:38 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
HERE WE GO!

National anthems are done. For Sri Lanka Nissanka and Kusal Perera are at the crease. Nissanka is on strike. Starc will open the attack for the Aussies. Let's Play!

What's the head-to-head record?

In T20Is, both Australia and Sri Lanka have won eight matches each. But in T20 World Cup history, the Aaron Finch-led side has an upper hand, leading the head-to-head by 2-1, with their last encounter coming in the 2010 T20 World Cup.

19:05 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
What are the respective playing XIs?

Australia (Playing XI): David Warner, Aaron Finch(c), Mitchell Marsh, Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade(w), Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood

Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Kusal Perera(w), Pathum Nissanka, Charith Asalanka, Avishka Fernando, Wanindu Hasaranga, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Dasun Shanaka(c), Chamika Karunaratne, Dushmantha Chameera, Lahiru Kumara, Maheesh Theekshana

19:00 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
AUS opt to bowl first!

Australia have won the toss and elected to bowl first against Sri Lanka. "Looks like a really nice wicket. Try and defend early and chase it down later. Everyone chipped in and it was a good bowling performance earlier," said Aaron Finch.

18:45 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
Who are the key players?

Glenn Maxwell: The glue of Australia's batting line-up, and crucial with the ball in hand, Maxwell's contributions will undoubtedly go a long way to Australian tournament success. Stepping up as Aaron Finch's second spin threat behind Adam Zampa, Maxwell finished with 1/24 (4) against South Africa, claiming opposition captain Temba Bavuma in a spell of 1/11 in the Powerplay. It's with the bat though that Maxwell truly holds the key. Adept at playing spin and in slow conditions, keeping up the pace in the middle overs falls almost solely on his shoulders.

Charith Asalanka: Coming off a destructive 80 not out from 49 balls against Bangladesh, the 24-year-old has made a fine start to his T20I career, averaging 37.50 with the bat, at a strike rate of 120.96. Moved around the batting order to find his best spot, it's perhaps encouraging for Dasun Shanaka that the left-hander enjoys batting in the No.3 and No.4 position, given the struggles of his team's top order troubles. Capable against both quick bowling and the guile of spin, Asalanka's capabilities make him a logical selection as part of Sri Lanka's spine.

18:30 (IST)
28 OCT 2021
Who said what

Matthew Wade, Australian wicket-keeper, on Sri Lanka: "They're a terrific team. They're going to challenge us with a fair bit of spin I would have thought. There could be up to 12 overs of spin I reckon that we'll probably face. They're going to be hard work. We're going to have to be at our best to beat any team in this tournament, Sri Lanka will certainly be no different."

Mickey Arthur, Sri Lanka coach on the pressure being on the opposition: "There was a lot of pressure on us there (the First Round), and now the pressure is reversed because we come into this phase with not much to lose. We're playing good cricket, we're very dangerous, the players are very clear on what their roles are, and we're confident we can beat anyone on our day."
