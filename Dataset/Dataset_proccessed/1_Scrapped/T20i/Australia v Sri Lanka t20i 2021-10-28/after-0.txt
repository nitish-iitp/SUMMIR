World T20: Warner leads dominant Australia win over Sri Lanka

Australia maintained their 100% record in the Men’s T20 World Cup with a dominant seven-wicket win over Sri Lanka.

Chasing 155 to win, opener David Warner led the way with 65 from 42 balls. When he was dismissed in the 15th over, Australia needed just 25 to win.

At the halfway stage, Sri Lanka’s 154-6 looked competitive on a slow pitch but their bowlers struggled for consistency and Warner and Aaron Finch (37) capitalised.

Having been put in to bat, Charith Asalanka (35) and Kusal Perera (35) propelled Sri Lanka to 78-2 with 10 overs left.

But they squandered the opportunity to make the most of that platform as Adam Zampa (2-12) heaped the pressure on the batters, and they staggered to 94-5.

Thanks to a quickfire 33 off 26 balls from Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka gave their bowlers something to defend.

But they failed to build any pressure as wayward bowling allowed Warner and Finch to free their arms.

They reached 63 from the six-over powerplay and Steve Smith (28 not out) and Marcus Stoinis (16 not out) finished the job for Australia with ease. (BBC Sport)
