South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Captains on the mic

Aiden Markram (South Africa): "Pretty happy with the performance as a whole. A couple of overs here and there we need to tidy up. I think you always feel you need more runs. But the wicket definitely changes and gets a bit slower, and they were a lot less sloppy. A couple of lessons to take, but nice for the batters to be in the middle and get some runs, especially for Quinny to really get his flow."

Aaron Jones (USA): "Hard to take a defeat after coming so close. But we did lack discipline in the bowling at times. Once we play good cricket we can beat any team in the world. But we need to be a lot more disciplined."

23:31 (IST)
19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Player of the match

Quinton de Kock (74): "We've had some tricky wickets so it was nice to spend sometime in the middle today. The USA put us under pressure towards the end. It was a great game. We've still got a couple more games to win. Different venue, different surfaces. Never know what you're going to get out there."

23:21 (IST)
19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: SA win

Anrich Nortje to bowl the last one. Andries Gous on strike. Just a single off the first ball. South Africa very much content with it. Jasdeep Brings back Gous on strike with a single off the next. Four sixes needed off the last four balls and Nortje nails a yorker. Dot ball. A boundary off the next one but it doesn't matter now, does it? South Africa kept taking wickets throughout the innings and USA, despite the promise towards the end, are unable to get through to 195. A win by 18 runs for the Proteas to start their Super-8 campaign.

23:16 (IST)
19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Rabada removes Harmeet

Kagiso Rabada to bowl his last over. Dishes in a low full toss, Harmeet Singh goes for a whip but finds the fielder at the fence. Andries Gous looks in dejection towards his parnter. Harmeet clenches his teeth as he walks back. They thought, the USA would've thought, they were the favorites from here. But Rabada's last has only costed only two runs. USA need 26 to win from the last one.

23:12 (IST)
19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Three sixes off Shamsi

BIG over for the USA!

Just what they needed. Tabraiz Shamsi is tonked for three maximums and just like that the equation and the momentum is in the batting team's favor. 

Harmeet Singh slog-sweeps one over long on before Andries Gous hits twin sixes off the spinner to close the over. 22 come from it. 28 needed off the last 12 balls.

23:07 (IST)
19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: USA trailing behind on RR

Kagiso Rabada back into the attack.

Harmeet Singh picks him for a boundary: advances down the track and slices one through the covers for four. But that's that. USA need atleast three fours or a six and a four each over from here but they have got only one boundary from the 17th. 145/5, reads the scoreboard. 50 needed from the last three.

23:04 (IST)
19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: 50 partnership up!

Shamsi into his third over. Harmeet Singh goes low to slog-sweep the first delivery for SIX!

Andries Gous then punches a flatter one to pickpocket four more. 50 partnership up between these two but USA need more from them. 135/5 after 16 overs. 60 needed from the last four overs.

23:02 (IST)
19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Fifty for Gous

Spoke too soon, didn't we?

Gous steps foot on the pedal. Nortje smacked for a four and two sixes in the 15th over. A full toss slaped wide of mid-on for four, a straight six down the ground off another low full toss and a pull over deep square for as many runs. 19 come from the over. 50 up for Gous off 33 deliveries.

USA are 122/5 after 15 overs with just a flicker of hope still left in this chase. 

22:55 (IST)
19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: 100 up for USA

Tabraiz Shamsi from the other end bowls an economical over. Only the five runs come off it. 

100 up for the USA. They've taken 79 balls to get it - 24 more than SA did. USA needed someone to play the kind of innings Quinton de Kock did. Even though opener Andries Gous is still out in the middle, he hasn't got going yet. 103/5 after 14 overs.

22:53 (IST)
19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Maharaj bleeds for the first time today

Keshav Maharaj into his last over, finally concedes a boundary. Harmeet Singh goes big, clubs one over long on for SIX! That was flat but hit well enough to clear the ropes.

After 13 overs, USA are 99/5. 96 required off the last 42 balls.

22:49 (IST)
19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Shamsi strikes on first ball

Tabraiz Shamsi into the attack and on the money straightaway!

A flatter one, turned into S Jahangir, who closed his bat only to miss the line and get trapped LBW. A fifth wicket falls for USA. 

Andries Gous (29) and Harmeet Singh - freshly in - find a boundary each to close the over. 87/5 after 12 overs. Still a whole lot of work to be done for eight overs.

22:44 (IST)
19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Maharaj's superb spell

Keshav Maharaj is racing through this spell. His latest over accounts for only three runs. His three overs so far have only costed only 12 runs and has rewarded the Proteas with a wicket as well. South Africa in firm control of this one. USA, 76/4 after 11 overs.

22:34 (IST)
19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: 10 overs gone!

Maharaj bowls another economical over from the other end. Concedes only five off it. 

Nortje produces a breakthrough from the other. Smacked for a six over deep mid wicket by Corey Anderson off the previous delivery, the pace battery cleans up the USA batter off the next. The southpaw had backed away and exposed his stumps before Nortje released and he pitched it on the money to uproot the leg stump. At the halfway stage, USA are 73/4. 

22:29 (IST)
19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Nortje introduced

And just when we thought South Africa have control of this one, they bring in their key weapon in their arsenal at this T20 World Cup. Anrich Nortje into the attack. He'd been crucial in all of SA's wins in USA, can he prove as effective in the Caribbean conditions?

A fine start, just the three runs off the first over. USA are 60/3 after eight.

19 JUN 2024

22:06 (IST)
19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: More boundaries for USA

Marco Jansen continues from the other end. Strays too far down the leg side and concedes two wides. Taylor with a couple more boundaries: a thump to place a short delivery over mid-off and a yorker length delivery squeezed down fine leg. 28/0 after three overs.

21:57 (IST)
19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Taylor ups the ante

Aidem Markram brings himself into the attack from the other end. South Africa are letting USA off the hook early in this chase.

19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Can SA finish big?

20:58 (IST)
19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: de Kock punishes Anderson

South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Harmeet puts a full stop on boundaries

Harmeet Singh replaces Nosthush Kenjige and brings to halt a streak of boundary laced overs. Just the five runs come from the over.

A good time to replug this: Harmeet, who was once touted as a promising international talent by no less than the Australian legend Ian Chappell, will be playing international cricket, but with a difference. He will be playing against India for his new adopted country USA in the T20 world cup. It has been some journey for the 31-year old left-arm spinner. (Retrace it HERE: from Devendra Pandey)

19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: End of powerplay

The national anthems are sung at North Sound in Antigua. Sun's up in all its glory, good signs as we move close to the first ball of Super-8. Quinton de Kock has taken the strike for South Africa. He hasn't been able to provide South Africa with a strong start, as has been Reeza Hendricks.

Aaron Jones: We going to have a bowl first. It's going to be good wicket so we want the seamers to exploit first. Extra spinner for us today, Kenjige in.

Aiden Markram: Doesn't look too bad. We weren't really sure of what to do for the toss. Probably we were leaning towards bowling but don't mind batting first. Extra spinner today for us. Unfortunately Ottniel Baartman misses out purely on conditions.

Aiden Markram and Aaron Jones are in the middle. No Monank Patel again for USA!

South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Pitch Report

Pitch report from Shaun Pollock and Waqar Younis: '67m and 61m square boundaries and 74m straight down the ground. Wind is coming across the ground so it will assist hitting to the short boundary/ It doesn't give a really good look. Games played here have been low scoring. Pacers have to stay back of a length because you get some extra bounce as well. I think Nortje will have good success. Spinners have to pitch it up and spin the ball. There is some debris in some parts so the ball will spin.'

18:49 (IST)
19 JUN 2024
South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: SA, the best bowling attack so far

South Africa have been the most economical pace bowling unit of the tournament so far, conceding only 4.72 runs per over while bowling 61.1 overs – the second-most behind Pakistan. Meanwhile, the USA seamers have been appreciable with a 7.50 economy but have only picked up nine wickets across three games, striking once every 30.2 balls as South Africa’s pacers scalp one every 18.2 deliveries.

At this T20 World Cup, the ten most economical bowlers are pacers and they have also captured seven spots on the Top 10 wicket-takers list. Once in every four games, a fast bowler has been adjudged the player of the match. But beyond the numbers or their role in setting up games, they have achieved a bigger feat. They have been genuine spectacles, the audience breathlessly awaiting them, the batsmen truthfully fearing them. READ MORE

South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: USA player to watch out for

Saurabh Netravalkar with the new ball has been as threatening as big name fast bowler in the tournament. His ability to swing the new ball both ways has put the top-order batters in all sorts of trouble. Behind the success of the USA along with Aaron Jones with the bat Netravalkar has been key with the ball in setting the tone upfront.

South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: SA Player to watch out for

Quinton De Kock has carried on his poor form from the Indian Premier League to the T20 World Cup. However, while he is out of form the pitches have not helped his cause either. De Kock would be elated at the prospect of playing on Caribbean pitches which are relatively better for batting.

South Africa vs United States Live Score, T20 World Cup: Pitch Report

The pitch in Antigua has been helpful to the fast bowlers in the past. Both teams do have quality fast bowlers in their ranks but South Africa has more pace in theirs. Since it is a day game the team winning the toss might be opting to bat first.

T20 World Cup 2024: Target-setters vs chasers in Antigua, who has the upper hand in South Africa vs United States Super 8 clash?

South Africa have been nervy chasers lately, with eight of their last 10 defeats coming with a score in front of them. On the contrary, US has clocked seven of their last 10 wins (including a Super Over win against Pakistan). (AP/PTI)

On a ground where the average scores linger in the mid 130s, 24 matches were won by batting first while 23 chasing in all T20Is.
