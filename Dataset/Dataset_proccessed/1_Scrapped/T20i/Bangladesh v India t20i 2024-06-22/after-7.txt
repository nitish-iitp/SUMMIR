India vs Bangladesh, T20 World Cup 2024 Highlights:

India vs Bangladesh, T20 World Cup 2024 Highlights: India are all but through to the semi-finals as they beat Bangladesh by 50 runs in Antigua. It is a second comprehensive win in the Super 8 for India after they earlier beat Afghanistan by 47 runs. Hardik Pandya's half-century off just 27 balls led an aggressive batting effort from India and they put up a total of 196/5. While Bangladesh got off to a strong start in the chase, they fizzled out after Pandya got the breakthrough in the form of Litton Das....Read More

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: 'In T20 I don't believe we need to get fifties and hundreds,' says Rohit

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024:
“[on playing aggressively with bat] I have been talking about this for a long time now. It's about going there and putting that into work. Considering everything we played really well, adapted to the conditions. There's a little bit of wind factor here, overall we are very smart, overall we were good with bat and ball. All eight batters need to play their role, whatever it is. We saw one guy get 50 and we got 197, in T20 I don't believe we need to get fifties and hundreds, what matters is the pressure you put on the bowlers. All the batters from the word go played like that and that's how we want to play as well. There is a lot of experience in the squad and we back them. [on Hardik] I mentioned in the last game as well, him batting well puts us in a good stead. We want to finish well after the top 5, 6, Hardik being Hardik we know what he is capable of. He is a very important player for us, if he can keep doing that, it will put us in good positions. Excitement and if we discuss something with the bowler and when it comes off, it's nice. Everyone when it came to our bowling adapted well and we discussed those things and they did well.”

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: 'I try to contribute but need to finish the games,' says Shanto

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024:
“We were thinking about 160-170 when we put them into bat, but they batted well so credit to them. [on the weather and wind] I don't think that is an issue, the players are habituated to that. We did not show as much intent as we needed with the bat, when we are chasing 190, we needed to show more intent especially in the first six. I try to contribute but need to finish the games. Tanzim Sakib in this tournament has done a great job and happy for Rishad too, we have been looking for a good legspinner for a long time now.”

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Hardik Pandya is the player of the match

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024:
"We have played really good cricket. More than anything we have stuck together and executed our plans. I did realise the batters wanted to use the breeze, I made sure I did not give them a chance where the wind was blowing, it was about being one step ahead as a batter. We as a group can get better in a lot of places, losing wickets in bunches is something we can rectify and get better at, apart from that, we are looking good. I have been fortunate to play for the country, it was a freak injury I had, I wanted to come back but God had other plans. Luck comes to people who work hard and that has stuck with me for a long time."

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: India beat Bangladesh by 50 runs

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: India are almost through to the semi-finals, Bangladesh are almost out of the tournament. Arshdeep dismissed Mahmadullah off the fifth ball of the last over and so Bangladesh finish on 146/8 in 20 overs.

June 22, 2024 11:12 PM IST
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: A boundary off Bumrah!

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: And finally, that ensures that Bumrah won't go a second match in a row having conceded less than 10 runs. Mahedi Hasan lets this short delivery come to him and just touches it fine past deep third. It means that Bumrah has finished with figures of 3/16. 18 off the 24 deliveries he has bowled today were dots. Freak of nature.IND vs BAN Live Score: Bangladesh 142/7 in 19 overs

June 22, 2024 11:11 PM IST
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: OUT! Bumrah ends Rishad's cameo

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Rishad has hit three sixes and a four but he cannot get Bumrah away. Hard length, that unforgiving angle into off stump, Rishad tries pulling it, miscues it to Rohit at extra-cover.

Rishad Hossain c Rohit b Bumrah 24 (10)

IND vs BAN Live Score: Bangladesh 138/7 in 18.3 overs

June 22, 2024 11:07 PM IST
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: GONE! A wicket for Arshdeep now

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Slow delivery to start the 17th over by Arshdeep, Jaker early on his shot and hits it to deep midwicket. No power at all and Kohli has probably taken few catches as easy as this one.

IND vs BAN Live Score: Bangladesh 110/6 in 16.1 overs

June 22, 2024 11:00 PM IST
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: OUT! Bumrah gets one, good catch by Arshdeep

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: And that is it for Shanto. Length ball from Bumrah for the third of the 16th, slanting across. Extra bounce and Shanto top edges the pull to Arshdeep who moves to his right and takes a sharp catch at deep third.

Shanto c Arshdeep Singh b Bumrah 40 (32)

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: 8 runs in the 15th over, Bangladesh down and out

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Najmul Hossain Shanto has scored 40 in 31 balls but seen his team crumble at the other end. How useful his innings is can be debatable as well considering the target Bangladesh are chasing. Mahmudullah is with him and he gets a four off the fourth ball of the 15th bowled by Pandya. Now Bumrah returns for his third over in the 16th. Shanto hit on the back of the helmet by the last ball of the 15th and the physio comes and takes a look at him. Bangladesh need 89 to win from 30.

IND vd BAN live Score: Bangladesh 108/4 in 15 overs

June 22, 2024 10:49 PM IST
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: OUT! Shakib falls to Kuldeep, Bangladesh crumbling

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Well you can't really blame Shakib for that. Bangladesh's required rate has climbed past 15. He got a six off the second ball of that over, goes for another biggie but mishits it to extra cover where Rohit takes the catch.

Shakib c Rohit b Kuldeep 11 (7)

IND vd BAN Live Score: Bangladesh 91/4 in 13.3 overs
