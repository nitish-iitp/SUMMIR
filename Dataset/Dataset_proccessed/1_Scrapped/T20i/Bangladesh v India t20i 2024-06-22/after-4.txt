The Indian cricket team beat Bangladesh by 50 runs in their second Super 8 match of the T20 World Cup 2024 at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua on Saturday.

Hardik Pandya top-scored in the contest with an unbeaten 50 off just 27 balls to power India to a massive 196/5. The all-rounder hit three sixes and four boundaries during his knock as Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant chipped in with 37 and 36, respectively. For Bangladesh, Tanzim Hasan Sakib picked up 2/32 in four overs.

Kuldeep Yadav bamboozled Bangladesh with his guile finishing with impressive figures of 3/19 to restrict them to 146/8. Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh picked up two wickets each as the Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto scored 40 off 32 balls.

Batting first, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma smashed a six and a four in the fourth over, before miscuing a big hit to short cover. Virat looked in good nick too hitting two sixes and a four as India raced to 53/1 after six overs.

Though India lost two quick wickets, Pant remained aggressive, hitting two maximums and four boundaries, as India crossed the 100-run mark in the 12th over. Once Pant departed, Shivam Dube and Hardik added 53 off just 34 balls for the fifth wicket to quickly rebuild the innings.

Player of the Match Hardik flourished towards the end, completing his half-century off the last ball of the innings, as India ended four short of 200. Tanzim and Rishad Hossain finished with two wickets apiece.

In reply, the Bangladesh cricket team reached 42 at the end of the powerplay losing opener Litton Das. Kuldeep picked up a wicket in each of his last three overs to leave Bangladesh stranded at 98/4.

With an uphill task of chasing 97 in the last six overs, Bangladesh surrendered meekly, losing their second match in succession. Bumrah finished with 2/13 in four overs as Arshdeep had figures of 2/30.

India are currently on top of Group 1 in the Super 8 with four points from two matches. The Men in Blue are up against Australia in their last Super 8 match of the T20 World Cup at St Lucia on Monday.
