NEW DELHI: Under the captaincy of 31-year-old wicket-keeper batter Monank Patel, the USA team comprises a blend of experienced players and talents from their recent successful T20I series against Canada, where they secured a 4-0 victory.
Corey Anderson, a former player for New Zealand and finalist in the 2015 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup, has been selected to join USA's squad for the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024.

The team receives a significant boost with the return of Ali Khan, a rapid fast bowler, who has recovered from a hamstring injury that side lined him during the Canada series. Ali Khan, aged 33, boasts experience from various domestic leagues worldwide and can even be seen in the promotional video for the official T20 World Cup anthem.



The squad also includes other familiar faces such as Saurabh Netravalkar, the most capped player for USA, along with Aaron Jones and opener Steven Taylor, who holds the record for the highest run-scoring in international cricket for the team.
Adding to their bowling options is off-spinner Milind Kumar, who made his debut during the series against Canada and has now earned a spot in the T20 World Cup squad.
USA squad for T20 World Cup 2024:
Monank Patel (captain), Aaron Jones (vice-Captain), Andries Gous, Corey Anderson, Ali Khan, Harmeet Singh, Jessy Singh, Milind Kumar, Nisarg Patel, Nitish Kumar, Nosthush Kenjige, Saurabh Nethravalkar, Shadley Van Schalkwyk, Steven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir.
Reserve Players: Gajanand Singh, Juanoy Drysdale, Yasir Mohammad.
