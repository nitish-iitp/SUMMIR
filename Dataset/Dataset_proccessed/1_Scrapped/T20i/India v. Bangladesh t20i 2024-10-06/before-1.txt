India vs Bangladesh 2nd Test Day 5 Highlights:

India vs Bangladesh 2nd Test Day 5 Highlights: India fought Bangladesh and time to wrestle a victory in the second Test by seven wickets. They have thus won the series 2-0 and all but sealed a spot in the World Test Championship final for the third consecutive time. The bowlers followed up on the utterly ridiculous work done by the Indian batters on Day 4 by dismissing Bangladesh for a score of 146 in their second innings in the first session. ...Read More

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: That's it from Kanpur!

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: Wow, this ground was sleeping for much of the first three days of this match. Then it saw some of the most high octane action one would ever get to see in Test cricket and that is solely driven by India's ruthless desire for a win and their absolute confidence in their abilities at home. They are already considered invincible at home but this win reinforces that tag and how. One can only dream of batting the way they did in video games and even thinking of doing something like that would've been considered mind-numbing stupidity not too long ago. They seem to have cracked the Test cricket code. It is not about the batters, but about how many overs you get to bowl at the opposition in both innings. New Zealand are up next for them before that blockbuster five-match tour of Australia. But before that, Suryakumar Yadav takes charge as India play Bangladesh in a three-match T20I series. Join us for that and stick around for more stuff from this match and series. Goodbye!

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: It was about the overs we wanted to bowl and not our runs, says Rohit

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: Winning captain Rohit Sharma said that the main intention behind India's explosive first innings was just the fact that they wanted to make sure they get as many overs to bowl at Bangladesh as possible. Attacking cricket at its finest. Here is what he said in his interview in the presentation ceremony:

“In life, we all keep moving on and at some stage, you work with different personnel. When Rahul bhai said he was done, it was a fantastic time we had together. Then life moves on and as a team we had to move on. With Gautam Gambhir...I've played with him and what sort of mindset he has. Early days still but very fruitful. To be honest we had to think a lot to keep the game moving forward. When we came on day four, we wanted to get them out as early as possible and see what we can do with the bat. It was not about the runs we get but the overs we wanted to bowl at them. The pitch didn't have much for bowlers but to get a game out of that pitch was a great effort from the bowlers. The batters were willing to take the risk and we were ready to give ourselves a chance at a result. Look, Akash has been good and he's played a lot domestic cricket. There's enough overs in the legs and the guy can do the job the team is expecting him to do. He can bowl long spells and we want to create a bunch of bowlers who are ready to play Test cricket at any given point. If someone is injured, you should be able to replace them.”

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: Ravichandran Ashwin is the player of the series

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: A total of 114 runs in this series and 11 wickets. A century (113) that turned the first Test on its head followed by figures of 6/88 in the second Bangladesh innings. Then figures of 2/45 and 3/50 in the second Test.

"Honestly, I'm glad to turn up performances for the team. A massive win for us in the context of where the WTC points table stands. I mean, I think with regards to this game, when he bowled them out after lunch, Rohit gave that talk we wanted to go for it. He stepped out and hit the first ball for six and he set that tone. How Jassi bowled, how Siraj and Akash bowled, you don't have to say much about Jaddu. Proud to be part of this attack. We expect a team with such experience to make those adjustments. I don't use the carrom ball as much as I do in white-ball cricket and it's about building a spell and getting into the rhythm," he says

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: 'Rohit bhai and Gauti sir told me to play the way I want to,' says Jaiswal

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: Jaiswal says that he had come with a fresh slate in his mind, that bumper England series completely forgotten. He says he was just doing what was important for the team. "Rohit bhai and Gauti sir told me to play the way I want to," he said about his approach in the first innings.

Oct 1, 2024 2:28 PM IST
India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: Yashasvi Jaiswal is the player of the match

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: 72 off 51 in the first innings, 51 off 45 in the second. Yashasvi Jaiswal had a job to do in the first innings and he did that with aplomb. In the second, he just continued where he left off. As stated earlier, we are probably seeing the early days of an potential all-time great.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: 'Akash Deep has a lot of heart,' says Bumrah

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: Jasprit Bumrah talks to the broadcasters. Murali Karthik calls him a magician and he, in typical Bumrah style, ducks that complement well enough. “I don't think about adjectives,” he says.

“It's just good to get the win after we lost two days. Really special win today. So, in this you use your experience. Yes, it's easier said and done. This was different to what it was in Chennai. We try to communicate and solve the problem in front of you. As I said, we've played a lot of cricket in India and understand the nature of the wicket. You find options and discuss with senior players. I'm also in a role now where I help other bowlers. He comes up to me quite a lot and asks me 'what you think I should do?' He's got a lot of heart and whenever he bowls, he gives his best. Yeah, after the World Cup, we got a break and were prepping for the Test series and you understand the number of overs you bowl. We have a long Test series [in Australia] and that's why he had that break.”

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: India beat Bangladesh by 7 wickets, win series 2-0

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: Rishabh Pant hits the second ball of the 18th down the ground for a four and that is that. India stay on top of the WTC table and are almost through to the final. A straightforward run to victory in the end for India but that has come thanks to some utterly miraculous batting in their first innings. Make no mistake, this has to go down in history as one of India's greatest ever wins. They were against Bangladesh and time and they have ended beating both, winning this match more than a session and a half to spare despite two and a half days of this match being washed off.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: OUT! Jaiswal falls going for the big finish

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: Well sports don't always have Bollywood-style finishes. India need three runs to win, Jaiswal goes for the big slog sweep but miscues it. The ball goes high, hiiiigh in the air and Shakib Al Hasan makes no mistake with the catch. Anti-climactic end to yet another Test match for Yashasvi Jaiswal in which he has been absolutely brilliant. Kohli can't help but laugh at that.

Jaiswal c Shakib Al Hasan b Taijul Islam 51 (45)

India 92/3, need 3 to win

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: Fifty for Yashasvi Jaiswal

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, 2nd Test Day 5: His second fifty of the game and he has got there with a calm single down the ground off the first ball of the 16th. India now need just six runs to win. Yashasvi Jaiswal is having the time of his life. We are seeing the start of the career of a player who is surely on his way to becoming an all-time great.

India 89/2
