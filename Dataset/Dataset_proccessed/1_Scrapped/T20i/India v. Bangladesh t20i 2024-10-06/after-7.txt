India vs Bangladesh 1st T20I Highlights:

India vs Bangladesh 1st T20I Highlights: Hardik Pandya put on a show to blast India to victory in the 12th over of their innings after Bangladesh have were blown away for 127 runs. It was a ruthless performance from India, with the batters going for big hits and looking to get to the target as quickly as possible and Pandya ended up finishing it off in fitting fashion. He hit back-to-back fours and a six to hit the winning runs. The first of those came after he ramped Taskin Ahmed almost nonchalantly and then never looked back even once to look at the ball going to the boundary. He finished unbeaten on 39 off 16 balls while debutant Nitish Kumar Reddy was on 16 off 15. The partnership between the two all-rounders was unbeaten on 52 off 24 balls. ...Read More

India vs Bangladesh 1st T20I Live Score: Pandya goes for 4, 4, 6! India beat Bangladesh by seven wickets

India vs Bangladesh 1st T20I Live Score: Pandya just added a few tons of swagger into this Indian chase with that finish. Utterly mesmerising stuff from the all-rounder. He finishes unbeaten on 39 off 16. Taskin bowling the 12th and last over of this innings, Nitish takes a single off the second ball after a leg bye first ball. Then Pandya sends the third ball, which is short and angling into him, over the keeper with a no-look ramp. He just keeps his eyes on the bowler and keeps looking as the ball flies behind him to the boundary, almost as if he in fact left the ball in a club match. Then Pandya swings hard towards the leg side, the ball is sliced through point and short third and the bat infact goes in the direction that the batter intended to hit. It goes for four anyway. And then Pandya smashes the fifth ball over midwicket for a six to finish it all off in style.

India vs Bangladesh 1st T20I Live Score: OUT! That's it for Samson

India vs Bangladesh 1st T20I Live Score: Samson takes a hoick, the first real ugly heave from him today. It goes off the inside half of the bat and Samson holes out at deep midwicket.

India vs Bangladesh 1st T20I Live Score: SKY's Supla is in the house!

India vs Bangladesh 1st T20I Live Score: 14 runs off the fifth over by Taskin, all of those coming from boundaries by Suryakumar Yadav. He has raced to 23 off 12, Samson on 18 off 11. India need 70 to win from 90. They are going at 11.60 runs per over, their RRR is 4.66.

All three of those boundaries came from different iterations of his now-iconic Supla shot. SKY moves accross the stumps and plays that pickup-flick off the third ball for a four. Taskin tries a yorker next ball, SKY flicks it again through deep square leg for a four. He then works the next ball to midwicket, dot ball. And then, the full-fledged Supla, full outside off and SKY sends it behind square for a six.

India vs Bangladesh 1st T20I Live Score: Suryakumar Yadav getting into the act

India vs Bangladesh 1st T20I Live Score: The hosts are positive cruising at the moment and it will take a rather miraculous collapse from them now for Bangladesh to win this match. Mustafizur bowls for the first time in the fourth over, SKY greets him by swinging him over midwicket for his first six of the match the very first ball! Off strike third ball and then Samson drives the fourth down the ground for another four in that manner. The Fizz sends the fifth ball wide outside off and that is called a wide as well by the umpire. Dots to finish the over after that. Samson on 18 off 11, SKY on nine off six.

India 44/1 in 4 overs
