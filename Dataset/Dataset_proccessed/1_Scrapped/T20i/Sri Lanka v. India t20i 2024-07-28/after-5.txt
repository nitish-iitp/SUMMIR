India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 2nd T20I: India beat Sri Lanka by 7 wickets (DLS)

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 2nd T20I: Pandya finishes it off two fours. India have just sauntered to their first series win under head coach Gautam Gambhir and new T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav. A 43-run win and a seven-wicket win. As comprehensive as they come. The dead-rubber third T20I will now be played on Tuesday at the same ground and then we move to the three-match ODI series in Colombo. Good

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 2nd T20I: 18 runs off the 6th!

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 2nd T20I: Well that wicket of Jaiswal simply doesn't matter at the end of it all for Sri Lanka. Pandya smashes the last ball of that over above cow corner for a six. India need six to win off 12 balls. This has been a walk in the park for them.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 2nd T20I: GONE! Jaiswal falls but he has done his job

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 2nd T20I: Hasaranga was tonked for a four off the first ball of the sixth over by Pandya and a six off the third by Jaiswal. Then Jaiswal holes out on the boundary line as he tried to hit the fourth ball over cow corner.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 2nd T20I: OUT! SKY barrage ends but at what cost

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 2nd T20I: SKY welcomed Pathirana with a truly spectacular shot off a low full toss on leg. SKY moved across and exposed his leg stump, then clipped it over fine leg for a six. Pathirana then comes back strong as SKY mistimes his next swing. Long on takes a simple catch. India need just 26 to win off 23 though, it is a real uphill struggle for Sri Lanka.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 2nd T20I: Hat-trick of fours, India cruising

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 2nd T20I: Theekshana bowling the fourth over, the first ball is full around off, SKY sweeps it mightily behind square. That almost went for six. The next ball is a full toss and SKY sweeps it again past deep square leg for four. The third is full around off, SKY tries to sweep again but he top edges it. It lands out of reach of the deep midwicket fielder and the ball spins sharply on bouncing, thus deceiving the fielder and going for a four again. Three runs off the last three balls, SKY on 20 off 10, Jaiswal on 24 off 13.

IND vs SL Live Score: India 45/1, need 33 to win from 24

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 2nd T20I: 16 runs in the 3rd! SKY and Jaiswal putting the ball in the sky

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 2nd T20I: Jaiswal slog sweeps the first ball of the third by Hasaranga and it goes flat over deep square leg for a six. Then he brings out the reverse sweep and hits the second ball past point for a four. A single and then SKY latches on to one floated up outside off, sweeps it hard to the boundary for a four. A single off the next ball and then a big appeal for LBW by Hasaranga against Jaiswal. The umpire shakes his head and Asalanka takes the review. It pitched outside leg.

IND vs SL Live Score: India 30/1 in 3 overs

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 2nd T20I: THE REVISED PLAYING CONDITIONS

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 2nd T20I: At long last, we have some proper details. India's target has been reduced 78 in 8 overs. The match is set for an imminent restart. Jaiswal is already all kitted up, his opening partner Samson also has his pads on and the pair are having a relaxed chat with SKY. India had scored 74 in the first six overs yesterday, this is pretty much their game to lose now./
