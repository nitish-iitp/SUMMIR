In Short
Suryakumar Yadav scored 58 runs off 26 balls against Sri Lanka
Suryakumar won the Player of the Match award
India beat Sri Lanka by 43 runs on Saturday

Suryakumar Yadav equaled Virat Kohli’s record for the most Player of the Match award in T20Is. He achieved the landmark during India’s opening T20I against Sri Lanka on Saturday, July 28 at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, Pallekele. The 33-year-old Suryakumar reached the milestone after the visitors beat Charith Asalanka’s men by 43 runs.

Along with Suryakumar and Virat, the others in the list of most POTM awards are Zimbabwe’s Sikandar Raza, Afghanistan’s Mohammad Nabi, India’s Rohit Sharma and Malaysia’s Virandeep Singh. Virat and Rohit won’t add to their tally since they already retired from T20Is following the T20 World Cup in the West Indies and the United States.
