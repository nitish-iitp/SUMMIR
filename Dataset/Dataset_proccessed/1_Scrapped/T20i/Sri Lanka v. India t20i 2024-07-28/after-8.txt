India all-rounder Axar Patel was asked about the choice of shuffling the batting-order in the post match press conference. The World Cup winner explained that India had a total of 4 left-handed options in their line-up and it only made sense to continue a right-left combination in the crease which traditionally makes life difficult for the bowlers.

"Our team has four lefties and four righties. If there is a left-right combination (in the middle), it becomes very hard for the bowlers to maintain the line and lengths consistently especially with rotations with singles. Now if there are four lefties, how can you use them? If you have that chance (to ensure) that there are no two lefties or two righties (in the middle) at the same time," Axar Patel said in the press conference.

"If you have that chance, if you have those players in batting, then why not use them? You also have to keep changing the batting order as per the bowling options that the opposition has got," he further added.

The all-rounder revealed the message of the new support staff for the Sri Lanka seris. He said the message from India's new staff under head coach Gautam Gambhir has been that the team will not experience a major overhaul in the way it operated. While fielding coach T Dilip has continued in his role, Abhishek Nayar, Sairaj Bahutule and Dutchman Ryan ten Doeschate are now a part of Gambhir's support staff for this tour of Sri Lanka as positions will be finalised after the tour ends.

"I have been playing for 10 years. I have played with different coaches and captains. I don't think a lot will change in the team. When we were talking in the team meeting, they also said the same thing that the coach and captain keep changing but the team remains the same and the 11 or 15 players who stay, they have to do it. They have told us that we will play the way we have been playing. Obviously, the coach and his input can be different. The thinking can be different, they keep telling you here and there. But there is not much change in the team's atmosphere," he added.
