India vs Sri Lanka, 2nd T20I, Highlights: Chasing a target of 78 runs in 8 overs as per DLS, following rains hindered the target of 162 runs, India won the match in the seventh over itself by 7 wickets as they scored 81 runs in 6.3 overs. With this, India won the three T20I series by 2-0 against Sri Lanka at the in the 2nd T20I match at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium on 28 July.

For India, Jaiswal scored 30 off 15 balls, while Suryakumar Yadav scored 26 runs and Hardik Pandya smashed 22 runs. Player of the match was Ravi Bishnoi for picking up three wickets. 

For Sri Lanka, Maheesh Theekshana, Wanindu Hasaranga and Matheesha Pathirana picked one wicket each.

After losing the toss against India, Charith Asalanka-led Sri Lanka posted a target of 162 runs to chase in the 2nd T20I match at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium on 28 July.

Batting first, Sri Lanka scored 161/9 of 20 overs, where Kusal Perera hit 54 off 34 runs, while Pathum Nissanka (32) and Kamindu Mendis (26) contibuted with their bat.

For India, Ravi Bishnoi took three wickets, while Arshdeep Singh, Axar Patel, and Hardik Pandya picked two wickets each.

The third T20I match will be played on the same venue on 30 July. 

After winning the first T20I by 43 runs against Sri Lanka at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium on 27 July, Suryakumar Yadav's India will take on the Charith Asalanka-led side for the second T20I at the same venue on Sunday. 

Though rains have delayed the match, the match will begin at 7.45 pm. India's Suryakumar Yadav has won the toss and decided to bowl first against Charith Asalanka-led side at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium. Shubman Gill ruled out of second T20I match against Sri Lanka due to neck spasm and Sanju Samson replaces him. 

After securing a win in the first T20I, Surya would be looking for his maiden T20 win as skipper of Team India. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, will be looking to keep the series alive with a strong performance in the second T20.

There were many positives for India in the first T20I, including the form of skipper Surya, Rishabh Pant, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill. Also, the impressive bowling performance of Riyan Parag would have given the team management a lot of comfort. However, Team India would like to see better contributions from their lower middle-order batsmen like Hardik Pandya, Riyan Parag and Rinku Singh, all of whom failed to make an impact on Saturday.

For Sri Lanka, the hosts will need to build on their impressive performance against the world champions. Other Sri Lankan bowlers will be looking to replicate the form displayed by Wanindu Hasaranga and Matheesha Pathirana on Saturday. Lankan fielding will also need to improve if they are to have any chance of staying alive in this series. Dropped catches and sloppy fielding can be costly against a formidable side like India.

Playing XIs:

India: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Suryakumar Yadav(c), Rishabh Pant(w), Hardik Pandya, Riyan Parag, Rinku Singh, Axar Patel, Arshdeep Singh, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohammed Siraj

Sri Lanka: Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis(w), Kusal Perera, Kamindu Mendis, Charith Asalanka(c), Dasun Shanaka, Wanindu Hasaranga, Ramesh Mendis, Maheesh Theekshana, Matheesha Pathirana, Asitha Fernando

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: Scott Styris reacts to Hardik Pandya's removal as India T20 captain

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score: In an interaction with News 18, Styris said, “I wouldn’t have personally made Hardik Pandya my captain either. I think that’s a smart choice solely for one reason, and that is as an allrounder. And skills wise he is India’s best allrounder. He is phenomenal. But you want him to be consistently fit,"

“At the moment, how he’s in and out with his injuries, you know, bowling is really hard. It takes a lot out of you and your body. So sometimes, adding all the responsibility of captaincy is not necessarily a good thing because there’s just too much to do. I’d love to see Hardik Pandya just concentrate on getting those skills right, batting and bowling. And then you can look at captaincy a little bit later." Styris added

I don't think a lot will change in the team…When we were talking in the team meeting, they also said the same thing that the coach and captain keep changing but the team remains the same and the 11 or 15 players who stay, they have to do it," 

“They have told us that we will play the way we have been playing. Obviously, the coach and his input can be different. The thinking can be different, they keep telling you here and there. But there is not much change in the team's atmosphere," Axar added
