Sony Sports Network to broadcast India Tour of Sri Lanka, starting July 27
By NewsDesk -
July 24, 2024
After a resounding win over Zimbabwe in their own backyard, Team India is set for another litmus test as they travel down south to face Sri Lanka for a limited-over series.

The two sides will face each other across three T20Is in Pallekele, followed by three ODIs in Colombo. The series, starting Saturday, 27th July 2024, will be broadcast LIVE on Sony Sports Network from 7:00 PM IST onwards.

World Champions India picked up where they left off in the recently concluded T20 World Cup to defeat Zimbabwe 4-1 in a T20I series. A new-look India travelled to Harare to prove their caliber as the country ushers in a new era of cricket, following the retirement of legendary players Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravindra Jadeja from T20I cricket. Rohit Sharma & Virat Kohli, however, will feature in the ODIs against the Lankans.

On the other hand, Sri Lanka will be looking to bank on their young talent to deliver on their home turf as they aim to restore the glory days of the past. Focus will be on key players including Matheesha Pathirana along with Pathum Nissanka and Wanindu Hasaranga who feature in the top 10 men’s ODI Batting and T20I all-rounder ICC rankings.




Interestingly, the two sides will also have new head coaches at the helm when they face each other with Gautam Gambhir leading India for the first time and Sanath Jayasuriya taking the charge for Sri Lanka.

The age-old rivalry between the Men in Blue & the Lankan Lions has seen many twists & turns from the times of cricket greats like Rahul Dravid & Sachin Tendulkar for India & Kumar Sangakkara & Mahela Jayawardena for Sri Lanka. It is time for the next generation of players including Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Maheesh Theekshana & Matheesh Pathirana, to take the baton forward and write a new chapter in this rivalry.

As cricket gains pace on Sony Sports Network, with the broadcast of India Tour of Zimbabwe, Major League Cricket (MLC), West Indies Tour of England & Vitality T20 Blast, their flagship studio show Extraaa Innings returns with an exciting roster of English commentators including Robin Uthappa, Scott Styris, Saba Karim and Abhinav Mukund supported by Sri Lankan commentators Roshan Abeysinghe and Russell Arnold.

The Hindi roster comprises Ashish Nehra, Ajay Jadeja, Pragyan Ojha, Vivek Razdan and Aakash Chopra while the Tamil & Telugu panel will have Vidyut Sivaramakrishnan, R. Sridhar, Anirudha Srikkantha, TR Arasu, Venkatapathy Raju, Ashish Reddy and Akshath Reddy respectively.

The broadcast of Sri Lanka vs India will be in prime time for Indian fans as they can enjoy watching their favorite cricketers in action live on Sony Sports Ten 1, Sony Sports Ten 5 (English), Sony Sports Ten 3 (Hindi) & Sony Sports Ten 4 (Tamil & Telugu) channels.
