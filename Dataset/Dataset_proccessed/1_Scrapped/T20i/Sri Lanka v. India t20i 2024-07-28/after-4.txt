India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: IND beat SL by 7 wickets on DLS method in Pallekele

That's it Hardik finishes the game off in style for India they take the 2-0 and win the series. Given how the way second innings has gone it must be said it was an excellent decision from Suryakumar Yadav to bowl first. As per Sri Lanka in the second innings, there was nothing much they could do with India having 10 wickets. All in all Suryakumar Yadav Gautham Gambhir era begins with a winning start.

28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 6 overs IND 72/3

Well, how things can turn around in a matter of 24 hours. Hasaranga was Sri Lanka's best bowler yesterday alongside Pathirana. However, the leg-spinner today has been pummeled all over the ground. Though he picked Jaiswal the game is almost done and dusted.

23:09 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 5.1 overs IND 58/2

Pathirana has come into the attack and he has picked the wicket of Suryakumar Yadav. The Indian skipper chipped the ball down the ground however, he timed it too well to carry it towards the long-on fielder. This is turning into a humdinger here in Pallekele.

23:04 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 4.1 overs IND 51/1

Another productive over for India as Suryakumar Yadav climbed onto Theekshana with every sweep the batter made Asalanka kept changing the fielder's position at fine-leg however, Surya'a mastery on shot meant he would find the gap irrespective of where the fielder was put or moved.

22:59 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 3.1 overs IND 34/1

Jaiswal has decided to counter the spinners and take the extra chance against Hasranaga. Every time the ball rolls on the ground the ball will become wet which will make it difficult to grip for the spinners that is the only way India can counter the moisture in the wicket.

22:54 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 2.2 overs IND 24/1

The pitch seems to have got damper which is enabling the ball to turn and that's what outdid Samson. Surya too of the first ball saw the ball turn square it will dry down however, with only being an eight-over game is it enough time for the ball to stop turning.

22:49 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 1.1 overs IND 12/1

Shanka resumed the bowling for Sri Lanka and gave away another six runs. One thing against Sri Lanka is according to Russell Arnold tells us the outfield is wet which might make it difficult for Sri Lankan spinners to grip the ball. As we update Theekshana cleans Samson.

22:43 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: Welcome back!

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: Leadership brought the best out of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma and it will do the same for Shubman Gill: Vikram Rathour

It’s Shubman Gill’s body language that assured the former India batting coach Vikram Rathour that he would make a good leader and that the BCCI has made the right decision in appointing him as the vice-captain of India’s T20 and ODI teams.

“Whatever I have seen him, be it for the Gujarat Titans or in Zimbabwe (when Gill led in a T20 series), he did a good job. He has shown terrific body language, which is a must if you are leading a side. Now with the vice-captaincy, the BCCI has given him extra responsibility and I am sure he will thrive in this role, ” Rathour tells The Indian Express. (Read more from Pratyush Raj)

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: Numbers say Jaiswal-Abhishek better than Jaiswal-Gill in T20s

India’s T20I team is primed to welcome a fresh dimension in the upcoming week as Suryakumar Yadav takes charge as captain in Sri Lanka. The Men in Blue have also affirmed their opening slots with Shubman Gill claiming the vice-captain’s role before pairing up with Yashasvi Jaiswal.

Even as India have made their first move clear, all might not be lost for Abhishek Sharma and Ruturaj Gaikwad as they got dropped shortly after impressive performances in Zimbabwe. In Gill, Jaiswal, Abhishek and Gaikwad, India are hosting enviable riches for their future opening slots across formats. Each of them made their T20I debut over the last year and has ticked off a century already. (Read more from Lalith Kalidas)

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: How do ageing Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli match up with Tendulkar, Richards, Hussey in the post-30 phase?

An anticipated subject since Gautam Gambhir’s appointment as India’s head coach has been the likely equation the two-time World Cup winner would share with his former teammates, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.

Gambhir offered some thoughts during his first press conference in his new role. “They have shown what they can deliver on the big stage. Whether it is the T20 World Cup or the ODI World Cup. Both of them have a lot more cricket left in them. We’ve got the Champions Trophy, a tour of Australia, so they will be motivated. If they keep their fitness then even the 2027 World Cup. To answer how much cricket is left in them is difficult. Any team that has players of their class would love to have them for as long as possible,” the 42-year-old told reporters in Mumbai last week.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: Ravi Shastri on Gautam Gambhir’s appointment as Team India’s head coach: ‘It’s refreshing’

Former India captain and coach Ravi Shastri feels Gautam Gambhir will flourish in his new role as head coach, and calls his appointment “refreshing.”

“He’s (Gambhir) contemporary, he just had a great season in the IPL. I think he’s the right age where he’s young, he’ll come with fresh ideas. He knows most of the players, especially in the white-ball format, having been part of teams in the IPL. So I think it’s refreshing,” Shastri said on the recent episode of The ICC Review.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: New captain Suryakumar shines as India thrash Sri Lanka despite Nissanka threat

Synopsis: Sri Lanka had two bowlers on song – the clever leg spinner Wanindu Hasaranga and the composed slinger Matheesha Pathirana. But what about the other 12 overs? India plundered 145 runs from those 72 balls to post 213, a total that proved beyond the reach of Sri Lanka. (Read the first match report from Sriram Veera)

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: Rain stopped play, IND 6/0 (162 to win) vs SL in Pallekele

Shanka took the new ball and created an opportunity however, Pathirana missed a chance of Jaiswal and the opener did manage to get a boundary the following ball, and rain started to pour down which stopped the game. The groundsmen are getting the covers on and is raining quite heavily we will give an update as soon as the rain stops. Do stay with us for all updates.

21:29 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 20 overs SL 161/9

Sri Lanka has managed to a competitive total however, they would be disappointed the way those final overs have panned out. As per India once again credit must be given to the bowlers the way they have comeback today. We will be right back with the chase shortly.

21:20 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 19.2 overs SL 154/8

Arshdeep Singh comes back and picks the wicket of Asalanka.  Once again no fight shown from the Sri Lanka lower and late middle-order. This is a competitive total however, Sri Lanka needs to pick a few wickets early so that they put some pressure on Indian batters.

21:14 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 18.1 overs SL 149/6

This is exceptional captaincy from Surya seeing the amount of help Bishnoi has got he threw the ball to Axar Patel in the death overs. It was a brave move but Sri Lanka seems to have completely lost the momentum of their innings looks like they won't end up getting more than 170-mark hence it worked well for Indian skipper.

21:10 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 17.1 overs SL 143/6

Well, it is deja vu for Sri Lanka once again they have crumbled after an excellent start. It is Bishnoi who has come in and picked up both Shanaka and Hasaranga in the space of two balls completely derailing the Sri Lanka innings. 

21:04 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 16.2 overs SL 140/4

First, it was Kamindu Mendis who Hardik picked on the first ball and then on the last ball he picked the wicket of Kusal Perera two set batters were dismissed in a single over just like yesterday. This is where the Sri Lankan middle and lower order need to apply themselves and take Sri Lanka to a good total.

20:56 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 15 overs SL 130/2

Kamindu Mendis and Perera have now put on 50-run stand for Sri Lanka. The hosts are looking good to get 180-190 from here on which will be a massive total for India to choose. India needs an exceptional effort in the death overs. As we update Hardik picks Kamindu Mendis.

20:53 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 14.1 overs SL 125/2

Hardik was introduced by Surya here and it was a scratchy over from the bowler the idea to bowl slower bouncers was right but the execution was not there. As per Sri Lanka, Kushal Perera has gone past his 50 and is looking solid.

20:45 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 13 overs SL 108/2

Riyan Parag is getting plenty of turn from the surface however, he also giving away runs without picking wickets. Sri Lankan batters are finding to easy to deal with him. Surya might have just missed a trick by not using Hardik for a couple of overs. 

20:42 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 12.1 overs SL 103/2

Whatever the score Sri Lanka is targeting to get. The bulk of the scoring has to be done from Kushal Perera who is looking in fabulous touch. Despite the spinners getting turned he is looking unscathed and picking his bowlers and spots nicely.

20:38 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 11,1 overs SL 89/2

It will be interesting to see how many Sri Lanka want to get here in the end after those probing overs from spinners. With having an extra spinner in the side anything around 150-160 mark will be a testing total for India to chase. 

20:35 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 10.3 overs SL 81/2

Ravi Bishnoi picks up Nissanka. Bishnoi delivered the ball and the batter dabbed it however, one of the fielders appealed and Bishnoi did it half-heartedly, and surprisingly umpire lifted his finger. Nissanka reviewed and it was pad first and then bat and apart from impact which was the umpire's call pitching and wickets hitting were red.

20:30 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 9.1 overs SL 79/1

India has brought in Riyan Parag into attack and he did manage to get turn bowling it slow. The bowling changes used today by India have been reminiscent of how Shubman Gill used his bowlers in Zimbabwe. Wonder if this is how India wants to operate going forward.

20:26 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 8.2 overs SL 76/1

One noticeable thing is that Indian spinners are bowling quicker through the air and firing it in instead of trying to toss the ball and look for a turn if it is available. Sri Lankan spinner especially Hasaranga who did toss it up yesterday might do the same today which might be ideal way to bowl on this one for spinners.

20:22 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 7.1 overs SL 65/1

Kushal Perera is playing well here. Anything loose he is pouncing on to it and punishing the bowlers. This is turning out to be a good partnership. Nissanka who played yesterday also has got himself into a start. India needs a breakthrough to claw themselves into the game.

20:18 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 6.1 overs SL 55/1

India has exhausted their first review here. Nissanka tried to sweep the ball and missed it and Axar convinced Surya to take a review however, on ball tracking it showed the ball was missing the leg-stump. There is also a drizzle in the air and the groundsmen are getting ready.

20:13 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 5.2 overs SL 53/1

Interesting move here from Surya to give a third over to Siraj. He did try to hit hard lengths however, Kushal Perera got the measure of the bowler and took him down extracting 14 runs out of the over. As we update Axar Patel has been brought into the attack.

20:08 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 4 overs SL 31/1

Arshdeep Singh picks Kushal Mendis. It was once again hard length delivery which was bowled slowly and Mendis tried to clear mid-on but was unsuccessful and was caught at the 30-yeard-circle. Kushal Perera walks into the middle for Sri Lanka at number three.

20:02 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 3.1 overs SL 25/0

It was a much better second over from Siraj. He kept hitting the stumps every ball and clearly, the Sri Lankan openers struggled to get the ball away. It will be interesting to see how long Suryakumar Yadav will wait to bring spinners into the game. 

19:57 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 2 overs SL 18/0

Arsdheep Singh has taken the second over for India and there is no swing on offer like yesterday. The wicket too is yet to show its true colours. Yesterday once the ball was old it became harder to hit today it might be even tougher. 

19:51 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: After 1 overs SL 10/0

Mohammed Siraj took the opening over for India. It has been a mixed start for him. He beat the batters a couple of times but strayed on the pads and down the leg side a few times, making it easier for both Nissanka and Mendis first up.

19:43 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: Let's go!

We are minutes away from action. The stadium is full again and the wicket looks drier than yesterday. It is a good decision from Sri Lankan skipper Asalanka to go with an extra spinner. It might be a game where 140-150 is good enough.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: Charith Asalanka at toss

We are good to bat first. We have one change, Ramesh Mendis comes in for Dilshan Madhushanka. The first three batters really well and the only concern is the line of the bowlers. It is a used pitch and hopefully spin will come into play in the later part.

19:19 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: Suryakumar Yadav at toss

We will look to bowl first. There is a bit of weather around and the wicket played better in the second innings. There are always areas to improve even when you win a game, you keep learning and you keep improving. Gill misses out as he woke up with a back spasm, Samson comes in.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: Focus shifts to coach Gautam Gambhir’s approach as he begins partnership with captain Suryakumar Yadav

As the whole attention is now firmly on Paris Olympics, in the hilly terrains of Kandy, a new era is on the horizon for Indian cricket in a sport that will be at the Games in four years.

Almost a month after winning the T20 World Cup, and having already done and dusted a victorious tour of Zimbabwe, beginning with the first T20I on Saturday, India will take baby steps under a new captain and head coach. (Read more from Venkata Krishna B)

Jasprit Bumrah is universally acknowledged as one of the smartest fast bowlers around, but if one asks the Indian pace spearhead, it’s not just with the ball that his mind is at its sharpest.

Bumrah believes that bowlers can make excellent captains, and it is unfair that so few of them get leadership assignments. (Read more)

Rahul Dravid, whose tenure as India’s head coach ended after he guided the team to the T20 World Cup triumph in West Indies, shared his insights to Gambhir and while wishing him the best for the role, he asked his former teammate to “crack a smile,” as well. (Read more)

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: Pant breaks free

Pant was dropped in the 13th over when Asitha Fernando missed a regulation catch at backward square-leg boundary, but he would finally break free in the 16th over off Asitha Fernando. He was on 20 from 23 balls when he unfurled a helicopter-swirl to dispatch a full toss over cow corner and sliced another full toss to point boundary. He would also later slap Patheerana through point and had his bat flying off his hands during an attempted whip-swat to the on-side but had the ball flying to fine-leg boundary. With contributions from others, that included a last-ball straight six from Axar Patel off Asitha, India finished on 213 but were given a scare by Nissanka, the left-handed opener.

18:05 (IST)
28 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 2nd T20: Surya trills on captaincy debut

Suryakumar had got going with his trademark onside swats, as he targeted the left-handed seamer Madhushanka in the 8th over with his shimmies to the off-side and wristy swats that fetched him a six and couple of fours, though a boundary came dangerously close to being caught at fine-leg. He then crashed Hasaranga to a couple of swept boundaries before swat-pulling Patheerana for a six in the 12th over. The bowler though would have the final say with a screaming full skidder that flashed past the intended on-side whip to trap Suryakumar lbw, but by then the platform was set. The only question was if Pant could affect a jailbreak.

Suryakumar had the toughest batting assignment of the day of an Indian as not only the openers Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal, who had smashed 74 runs in just 6 overs, had fallen off successive deliveries. Captain Suryakumar Yadav will again be in the focus on Sunday.

"What happens is when you continuously play cricket for India, you have some surety and when you do well in some pressure situations, you get some confidence. And each time you get confidence, you always learn from it. It's not that you'll always do well in pressure situations and you might fail as well. But, those situations teach you that I could have done things differently and that has taught me a lot in the last one year especially."
