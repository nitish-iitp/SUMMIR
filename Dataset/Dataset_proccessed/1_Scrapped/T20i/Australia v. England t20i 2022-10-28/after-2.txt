ENG vs AUS Dream11 Prediction Team & Fantasy Tips

The 26th match of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022 will see England (ENG) take on Australia (AUS) at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in Melbourne on Friday, October 28. Ahead of the match, here's everything you need to know about the ENG vs AUS Dream11 prediction.

Both England and Australia have two points each after two games. While England come into the game on the back of a disappointing loss at the hands of Ireland, Australia found their groove against Sri Lanka. The previous series between the two sides saw England win both completed games, with Australia struggling to cope with their arch-rivals' explosive batting unit.

Although both teams are equally matched on paper, Australia might hold the edge owing to home conditions and momentum. With this being a must-win game for both teams, a cracker of a contest beckons at the iconic MCG.

ENG vs AUS pitch report for ICC T20 World Cup 2022, Match 26

A competitive track beckons at the MCG with the average score being 158. As many as nine wickets have fallen in the powerplay across four innings at the venue in this tournament. While the pacers will hold the key, the dimensions of the ground will play into the hands of the spinners as well. Inclement weather is expected, which may lure teams to prefer chasing with DLS likely to come into play.
