India vs Pakistan, T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights: It was vintage Virat Kohli at the MCG as he compiled a masterful 82 off 53 balls to lead India to an unlikely win. 
IND vs PAK T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights: Kohli played an innings of a lifetime

India vs Pakistan T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights: A classic Virat Kohli innings led India to a sensational win over Pakistan. Kohli almost single-handedly led India to victory despite them losing their top four within the first seven overs. The former India captain was unbeaten on 82 off 53 balls but at the non-striker's end for the last ball, off which India needed one run to win. It was R Ashwin who hit the ball over the in-field, sparking wild celebrations as the Indian players swamped Kohli.

IND vs PAK Live Score: Babar Azam's thoughts

Toss is not in our hands. We'll try to post around 160-170. We have prepared well, and we are ready for this big game. We won a series back home, we played a tri-series in New Zealand, so we are prepared. We have three fast bowlers and two spinners.

India vs Pakistan Live Score: What Rohit Sharma said

“We are going to field first. Looks like a good pitch, it's always nice with overcast conditions. Think the ball will swing around a bit. Preparations have been good. We played a couple of practice games in Brisbane. Time to come out and enjoy ourselves. We were expecting nothing less than this, hopefully we'll entertain them. We have seven batters, three seamers and two spinners.”

India vs Pakistan Live Score: Ticking down

Well The Rock is giving a preview of the match as Star Sports role their video for it, and it ends with his trademark eyebrow raise. Now that is not something fans of the WWE's Attitude Era in India or Pakistan would have dreamed of seeing back when Sourav Ganguly and Inzamam-ul-Haq were leading these two teams in big Test matches.

India vs Pakistan T20 World Cup 2022 Live Score: Virat Kohli, the Big Show

Dropping Virat Kohli was a ludicrous thing to even think about for much of the last 10 odd years but that is exactly what everyone was talking about before the Asia Cup. The former India skipper's strike rate had fallen to an alarming extent and the likes of Deepak Hooda were banging on the door with a century. However, Kohli seems to have got back to his best and somehow, it is with him at the other end that Suryakumar Yadav seems to be at his ballistic best. India have got a formidable batting lineup at the moment to say the least.

IND vs PAK Live Score: The pitch report

The incomparable Ian Smith and former Aussie captain Michael Clarke are doing the pitch report today. Shorted boundary on the offside itself is 71m long. “Win the toss, I wanna bat first,” says Michael Clarke. He did win a World Cup here so he might know what he is talking about.

India vs Pakistan Live Score: How can SKY fall?

Surya, Suryakumar, Suryakumar Yadav, SKY… he goes by loads of names and nowadays, he has also been bestowed the tag of ‘best player in the world’ by many former players. Babar Azam, however, was careful not let anyone think that Pakistan were too worried about SKY. “We have plans for each player, not just Surya. We have a plan and hopefully, we can execute them properly,” Babar said on the eve of the match.

India vs Pakistan T20 World Cup 2022 Live Score: Rohit Sharma, the newbie

It is strange to think of Rohit Sharma as a newbie to anything but that is technically what he is here. Rohit maybe the most successful IPL captain of all time and has also led India to the Asia Cup title once but this is the first time he is skipper of the team in a World Cup tournament. For now, he doesn't seem too enthused by how the pitch looks.
