IND vs NED Highlights T20 World Cup 2022 Updates: India produced an all-round display against Netherlands at the Sydney Cricket Ground to storm to a 56-run win – their second of the tournament. Chasing 180, Netherlands never looked in control of their innings as India kept denting their chase with regular strikes. Tim Pringle was their only batter to touch 20 as a combined bowling display that saw Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ravichandran Ashwin, Axar Patel and Arshdeep Singh taking a couple of wickets each saw India keeping Netherlands to just 123/9.

Earlier, half-centuries from Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav powered India to 179/2 in 20 Overs against Netherlands on Thursday. Kohli top-scored with 62* off 44 while Surya was at his attacking best, belting an unbeaten 51 off 25 as the pair stitched an unbeaten 95 run partnership for the third wicket. Earlier, Rohit made 53 off 39 to get some run under his belt as well with Netherlands putting up a disciplined effort with the ball to not give India batters easy runs.

T20 World Cup 2022: The Top-run Getters here

India captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and opted to bat first against Netherlands in their second match of the tournament. Rohit admitted the confidence of the players is on another level after a thrilling win on Sunday but says they have to remain calm. Netherlands captain Scott Edwards would have batted first as well but is hopeful of his bowlers doing the job at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Both the teams are unchanged.

Match Preview

Hello and welcome to our live coverage of India vs Netherlands T20 World Cup match updates from Sydney Cricket Ground. After registering a sensational win over Pakistan in a nail-biting thriller, Rohit Sharma and Co are riding high on confidence and their next opponents in the tournament are the Netherlands. Looking at India’s current form, the Netherlands clash should be a cakewalk for them but in T20 cricket anything can happen on a given day as we witnessed Ireland beating England on Wednesday which shocked the cricketing world.

India might rest Hardik Pandya on Thursday to manage his workload and keep him fresh for the upcoming matches. The flamboyant all-rounder struggled a bit while running against Pakistan as he is expected to have a slight niggle. Virat Kohli, who played one of the best innings of his life on Sunday, will look to continue his glorious form with the bat. But all eyes will be on Indian openers KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma who had forgettable outings against Pakistan.

Meanwhile, in the current Netherlands squad for the T20 World Cup, there are three South Asian players like opener Vikramjit Singh, leg-spinner Shariz Ahmed and off-spin all-rounder Teja Nidamanuru. Netherlands will look to put up a show on Thursday to get more recognition on the world stage.

A clinical performance from India as they defeated Netherlands by 56 runs in their second match of the Super 12 stage of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2022 at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday. India captain Rohit Sharma opted to bat first and scored a much needed half-century that would have helped him regain some confidence. KL Rahul though fell cheaply after being trapped lbw though had he reviewed, the decision would have been reversed. Virat Kohli continued his sublime form as he peeled off another half-century and Suryakumar Yadav was his breezy self, hitting a quickfire half-century of his own. India posted a challenging 179/2 in 20 overs.

In reply, Netherlands lost both their openers inside five overs with Max O’Dowd starting well before being cleaned up by Axar Patel.

With four points and a net run-rate of 1.425, they have taken the top spot in Group 2 ahead of South Africa who have three points but a superior NRR of 5.2.
