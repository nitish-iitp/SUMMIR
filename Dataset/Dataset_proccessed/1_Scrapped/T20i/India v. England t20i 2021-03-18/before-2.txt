HOMESPORTSCRICKETIND VS ENG T20: ‘HE IS JUST GOING THROUGH A LEAN PATCH’; HARSHA BHOGALE DEFENDS KL RAHUL AFTER BEING CALLED ‘OVER-RATED’
IND Vs ENG T20: ‘He Is Just Going Through A Lean Patch’; Harsha Bhogale Defends KL Rahul After Being Called ‘Over-rated’
Harsha Bhogale came to KL Rahul’s rescue on social media when a fan called him ‘the most over rated T20 batsman’

India vs England 3rd T20 ended on a high for England. The visitors defeated India comfortably by eight wickets. Even after India scored a flurry of runs towards the back-end of the innings, it wasn’t enough to restrict England. The top order of India was a complete failure in the third T20I. KL Rahul’s poor show with the bat continued as he got out for a duck second time in three matches. His scores are 1, 0 and 0 in this T20 series so far.

Experts from around the world are criticizing Rahul for his dismal batting performance in the T20 series. Indian fans are usually very expressive when it comes to cricket. But commentator and cricket expert, Harsha Bhogale has come in support of the batsman.

Harsha said: “What!! He is an outstanding, genuinely world class player. He is just going through a lean patch like everyone does at some point” in a tweet.

KL Rahul averages 40.61 in T20Is and 45.93 in ODIs. He has a good record which also prompted Kohli to defend the batsman after his bad performances. Kohli said, “He is a champion player and he'll continue to be one of our main batters along with Rohit." The captain backing the batsman would do some good for the morale KL Rahul. It's being speculated that he might get dropped from the team in the fourth T20I. 

In the 1st T20 against England, KL Rahul did an outstanding diving effort to save a certain six:

The 4th T20I between India and England will be played on 18 March 2021, 7 pm IST at the Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad.
