Live Commentary: Denmark 1-1 England - as it happened
By Ben Knapton, Senior Reporter

Last updated: June 23 2024 | 13:41

A lacklustre England missed the chance to wrap up qualification for the Euro 2024 knockout stages with a game to spare owing to a 1-1 draw with Denmark in Group C at the Deutsche Bank Park.

Four days on from their unconvincing 1-0 win over Serbia, Gareth Southgate's men again struck early through Harry Kane, but in an all-too familiar tale, they immediately dropped off after taking the lead.

The Three Lions were punished for their abysmal play when Morten Hjulmand rifled in a stunning 25-yard strike off the post and in, and despite a couple of bright moments - including a Phil Foden strike which hit the post - England were pitiful.

Southgate's men are still top of the section on four points - two clear of Denmark and Slovenia and three clear of Serbia, whom they cannot be caught by - but the fight for a top-two finish will go down to the final day.

4.00pm
Good afternoon/evening! Thank you very much for tuning in to Sports Mole's live text coverage of the game that could seal England's spot in the knockout stages of Euro 2024, as Denmark await for the Three Lions in Frankfurt.

Gareth Southgate's men assumed their rightful position at the summit by beating Serbia 1-0 on Monday - even if their success was not all that inspiring - and will be guaranteed a first-placed finish if they win tonight.

Meanwhile, Denmark were forced to accept a point in a 1-1 stalemate versus Slovenia in their opening battle and have been bumped down to third by their recent opponents' draw with Serbia earlier today.

Ahead of the reunion of the Euro 2020 semi-final foes, time for a look at the team news...



4.02pm
DENMARK XI: Schmeichel; Andersen, Christensen, Vestergaard; Maehle, Hojbjerg, Norgaard, Eriksen, Kristiansen; Wind, Hojlund

SUBS: Ronnow, Hermansen, Zanka, Kjaer, Kristensen, Dreyer, Bah, Norgaard, Jensen, Skov Olsen, Dolberg, Poulsen, Bruun Larsen, Damsgaard



4.04pm
ENGLAND XI: Pickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier; Rice, Alexander-Arnold; Saka, Bellingham, Foden; Kane

SUBS: Ramsdale, Henderson, Konsa, Gomez, Dunk, Wharton, Mainoo, Palmer, Eze, Gallagher, Bowen, Toney, Gordon, Watkins



4.06pm
As expected, England boss Gareth Southgate sticks with a winning formula for Thursday's tie, naming the same XI from their victory over Serbia.

Still no Luke Shaw, though - he has been restricted to individual training in recent days. No England appearance in over a year for him!



4.08pm
With Shaw still in the treatment room, Kieran Trippier wins his 50th senior cap at left-back, although the jury is certainly still out on him in that position.

There should be no question marks over Marc Guehi, though - what a monstrous display from him against Serbia.




4.10pm
Guehi will be one of the four defensive rocks tasked with protecting Jordan Pickford, whose shut-out against Serbia moved him onto 10 major tournament clean sheets for England.

Only Peter Shilton can boast as many for the Three Lions, meaning that Pickford will break the record with another shut-out here.

So many feats being matched or surpassed at the Euros!



4.12pm

Wishful thinking here, but if England win the tournament and Pickford plays every game without conceding a goal, he will leapfrog Gordon Banks in the all-time clean sheet charts.

Of course, England boasted a perfect defensive record at Euro 2020 before facing... Denmark.



4.14pm
Speaking of the Scandinavians, Kasper Hjulmand makes just the one change to their starting lineup, bringing in Joakim Maehle at right wing-back over Alexander Bah.

Christian Eriksen - for now - moves level with Simon Kjaer on a record 132 appearances for Denmark, although the latter will make his 133rd if he comes off the bench.

Some battle hotting up there!



4.16pm
Thomas Delaney is the only significant absentee for the Danes tonight - he is ill.

A few eyes should still be drawn to the Scandinavians' midfield, more specifically Morten Hjulmand, who has apparently earned some Premier League admirers with his displays for Sporting Lisbon.

He will miss Denmark's final group game against Serbia if he is booked tonight, though.



4.18pm
Back to Pickford very briefly, as I have just been alerted to this statistic...

A landmark match for @JPickford1 🧤

He's set to become the record English appearance maker at major tournaments, passing @Peter_Shilton's tally of 20! 👏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 pic.twitter.com/kuAQS8GmbO — England (@England) June 20, 2024

Could be two pages of history written by the Everton man tonight!



4.20pm
Now, onto what the result of tonight's game could mean for the knockout placements!

England remain top thanks to Serbia snatching a dramatic last-gasp point against Slovenia just now, and a win for the Three Lions will send them through to the last 16 as group winners.



4.22pm
If Kasper Hjulmand's side prevail, they will rise to the summit, but nothing can be confirmed for them tonight.

Even if they win tonight, Serbia could still overtake them on the final matchday, as would England or Slovenia if there were to be a victor in that battle.

I think this is what they call hotting up.



4.24pm
The Denmark faithful should have celebrated Luka Jovic's late leveller just as hard as the Serbia fans; they would have been out of top-two contention had they lost tonight and Slovenia held on for a precious three points.


4.26pm
Denmark themselves could not cling on for all the spoils against Slovenia, though, despite Jonas Wind's chef's kiss assist for Christian Eriksen's opening goal, which came exactly 1,100 days after his distressing cardiac arrest at Euro 2020.

Hjulmand was critical of his side's "passive" play afterwards; think some England fans can empathise there.



4.28pm
It was by no means absorbing, but England got the job done in their opening tie with Serbia, as Jude Bellingham did what Jude Bellingham does, heading in from Bukayo Saka's deflected cross.

The Three Lions let Serbia back into the game in the second half but certainly had the best chance to score again, only for Predrag Rajkovic to magnificently tip Harry Kane's header onto the bar.



4.30pm
As a plethora of famous faces said after the game, though, it does not matter how you win tournament matches. Just win them.

And England have now won each of their last four opening games at major tournaments. But how many times have they won their opening two matches at a Euros?

Zero.



4.32pm
© Reuters

Seems scarcely believable, does it not?

If England are to finally break that barren streak tonight, defensive discipline will no doubt be key, as they have recorded five successive group-stage clean sheets at the European Championships.

Any guesses on the last man to breach England's goal before the knockout rounds?



4.34pm
No shame in not knowing - had to look this one up myself too.

The answer is... Gareth Bale. Scored for Wales at Euro 2016 thanks to Joe Hart's help before Jamie Vardy and Daniel Sturridge hit back.

Now, to never mention that tournament again.



4.36pm
What I am far more happy to mention is England's 12-match unbeaten run in Euros group-stage games, winning eight and drawing four since going down to France 20 years ago.

Meanwhile, only one of Denmark's last six Euros group matches has ended in victory - their 4-1 thrashing of Russia three years ago - but the Scandinavians hold the edge when it comes to recent form...



4.38pm
Indeed, England's triumph over Serbia was just their second win from their last six matches, while Denmark are unbeaten in five and have lost just one of their last 13.

That defeat was a surprise one - a 2-0 reverse to Northern Ireland in qualifying - although that was inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.



4.40pm
Vengeance should also be on the minds of Hjulmand's troops, who suffered that agonising 2-1 loss to England in the Euro 2020 semi-finals, their most recent contest competitive or non-competitive.

Still, that Mikkel Damsgaard free kick...



4.42pm
England now have 13 victories to show from their 22 previous meetings with Denmark, who only have four to their name, although one of them was in the 2020-21 Nations League...


4.44pm
Those praying for a goal-fest may see their pleas fall on deaf ears too, as there have been just five goals scored in the last four clashes between the two nations.

As England have already shown though, one strike is all it takes. Little ode to the unofficial Liverpool anthem.



4.46pm
The two nations have a handful of major tournament matches in their annals, including a goalless group-stage draw in 1992 before Denmark famously conquered the continent.

I suspect that may be mentioned just once or twice tonight.



4.48pm
England and Denmark also locked horns in the 2002 World Cup last 16, where Emile Heskey and Michael Owen were on target in a comfortable 3-0 win to send the Three Lions through to the quarter-finals.

Out of respect for David Seaman - one of my goalkeeping heroes - that is all I will say on that tournament too.



4.50pm
The preamble is nearly over - only 10 minutes to go until the second game of the day gets underway.

Just seen a shot of the closed roof here in Frankfurt - not sure I will ever get used to that. Wonder if some of the players feel the same?



4.52pm
At the risk of tempting England's Euro 2024 fate, how's about some score predictions?

For me, this one will be as tight as the most recent meetings have been, and probably not very eventful in the final third, but England's attacking X-factor certainly outweighs that of Denmark.

One-nil to the Three Lions.



4.54pm
Whether sparks will fly in this game remains to be seen, but a battle of the behemoths awaits after this one, as Spain and reigning champions Italy square off at 8pm.

Neither of those nations can face England in the last 16, though - win the group tonight and the Three Lions will take on the third-placed team from groups D, E or F.



4.56pm
The pre-game pitch displays are underway, the mascots are looking starstruck in the tunnel, and kickoff is fast approaching!

Leading the teams out is referee Artur Soares Dias, who also took charge of the 2023-24 Europa Conference League final.



4.58pm
Declan Rice booming out the national anthem there. Prince William - in attendance in Frankfurt - gives his approval.


5.02pm
Before we start, a pre-match tribute for the late Gerhard Aigner.


1 min
KICKOFF:  And we are off!

England get us started at the Deutsche Bank Park.



1 min
SHOT!  Pickford called into action immediately, but Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's shot is tame.

The clean sheet record is still on!



3 min
England build up nicely down the right and Trippier delivers, but he loses his footing, and Jannik Vestergaard can clear easily.


4 min
Kane had just two touches in the first half against Serbia, but he has already come deep to increase that tally in this one.

Will the playmaker come out to play?



5 min
First booming header from Guehi there to stop Joachim Andersen's cross in its tracks.

But Denmark come again.



6 min
Never mind, Guehi just stepped in brilliantly on Jonas Wind.

He just looks so at home in the England defence.



8 min
Neither side have truly kicked into gear just yet. Possession is proving hard to retain.

Fair to say Denmark have just shaded it, though.



8 min
Hojbjerg finds Maehle out on the byline with a wonderful switch, but Trippier nips in and wins England a free kick.

But Kyle Walker is down...



9 min
Oof - he went over on his ankle as he delivered a cross a few moments ago. That's going to hurt.

He seems OK, though.



10 min
A quick change of boots and Walker seems ready to go again.

No Kylian Mbappe substitution yellow-card farces though please.



12 min
Now Bellingham gestures after a seemingly fair tackle from Hojbjerg... nothing more than a knock for the Real Madrid man though.

Sighs of relief all round.



13 min
CHANCE!  FODEN SHOULD DO BETTER!

England huff and puff and the Manchester City man turns Hojbjerg inside and out before creating the angle for a shot, but he opens up his body too much and sends his strike high and wide.



15 min
No doubt the best chance of the game so far, although Foden is looking effervescent, enjoying the freedom of the final third.

He certainly has some critics to answer tonight.



17 min
SHOT!  Kane lets fly for the first time tonight after Rice's successful pressure on Hjulmand, but his strike flies straight into a red shirt.


18 min
GOAL!  DENMARK 0-1 ENGLAND (KANE)


18 min
GOAL!  He does not miss this time!

Walker burns a daydreaming Victor Kristiansen for pace on the right-hand side, and the Manchester City man has so much time to deliver the ball.

His cross takes a nick off two pairs of Danish legs before falling at Kane's feet, and he cannot miss from a few yards out!



20 min
As things stand, England are winning Group C with a game to spare.

Brilliant work from Walker to chase a seemingly lost cause, but Kristiansen was caught completely unawares.



22 min
Do Denmark have a response in them?

They were probing around the England box just now, but the offside flag halts their progress.



23 min
Just before that attack broke down, Hojbjerg and Rice clattered into each other - North London rivalry still burns bright at the Euros.

To be fair to the Tottenham Hotspur man, he looked to have slipped on the pitch, which has already had lumps of turf ripped up.



24 min
Analysis from Sports Mole football editor Matt Law:

"I was not surprised by the start to this match; Denmark are a strong outfit, and they look comfortable in possession.

"The pitch will be a concern to both sides, though, with Walker already seeing his foot give way. Hojlund's pace and movement has the potential to cause England problems, but Southgate's side have worked their way into the contest, and Kane was never going to miss from there.

"It is the start that England wanted, but they did not really kick on against Serbia, and Denmark have more than enough quality to hit back here."



25 min
A deep cross to the back post is met by Wind, who just about manages to out-muscle John Stones, but his downward header falls into Pickford's grasp.


26 min
SHOT!  Wind and Eriksen link up nicely - not for the first time this tournament - but who else but Guehi is there to block the latter's strike from the edge of the box.


26 min
YELLOW CARD!  Vestergaard tries to keep up with Saka. No surprise, he cannot.

The Leicester City man drags his Arsenal counterpart down and goes into the box.

Guehi peels away at the back post from the resulting free kick but can only volley the ball into the side netting.



30 min
Slight scare for Pickford just now as Eriksen nearly nips in on his error, but Alexander-Arnold manages to snuff out the danger.


31 min
Pickford manages to get a good fist to Maehle's cross and Walker saves the corner before setting Saka way, but Christensen defends well.


32 min
CLOSE!  Hate to say it, but this match is certainly shades of Serbia.

England have been under the cosh since taking the lead and are not looking totally composed at the back.

This time, Wind has a go on the stretch but Guehi is there to deflect the ball over for a corner...



33 min
Referee dealing with some Walker and Christensen handbags before Eriksen whips it in.

Vestergaard heads over, but the referee spotted a foul in there. England free kick.



34 min
GOAL!  DENMARK 1-1 ENGLAND (HJULMAND)


34 min
GOAL!  Out of nowhere, Denmark are level! And what a strike it was!

We said Hjulmand would be one to watch tonight, and he has just smashed one in from 25 yards off the post.

England caught cold, and you have to say Denmark deserve it.



36 min
Pickford's clean sheet record is gone, but there was nothing he could have done about that.

Wonderful strike from Hjulmand, woeful closing down from England, who have again been pretty lackadaisical since going ahead.



38 min
Closed roof? Humid conditions? Horrendous pitch?

Many an excuse can be highlighted, but this has just not been good enough from England so far.



39 min
SHOT!  Hjulmand in space to shoot from range again?!

This one is blocked behind for a corner, but England need to wake up.



39 min
SHOT!  Eriksen's delivery is deep to the back post, where Andersen is waiting, but his header lands on top of Pickford's net.


41 min
SHOT!  Phil Foden takes matters into his own hands with a brilliant driving run from midfield, but he elects to shoot rather than teeing up Kane.

Poor choice. Schmeichel holds.



42 min
Foden may have made the wrong decision there, but that stellar solo run just shows how devastating he can be centrally.

He's floating in that role now. Trippier all on his own on the left, although Bellingham is now helping him out.



44 min
How many crosses has Maehle been allowed to deliver in this half?

He whips another one in from the right, but Guehi is there again and gets a bang from Hojlund for his troubles.



44 min
SHOT!  Another Denmark shot from range, but Hojbjerg's effort is straight at JP.


45 min
Rice incensed that he did not get a free kick for what looked like a perfectly clean challenge. England frustrations boiling over.

One minute added on.



5.48pm
HALF TIME:  DENMARK 1-1 ENGLAND


5.50pm
From the 20th minute onwards, that was an extremely painful watch for England supporters.

Kane struck in his fourth successive major tournament after Kristiansen went to sleep, but the Three Lions then coincidentally dropped off and allowed Denmark back into the game.

Hjulmand's rocket has the Danes deservedly level, and England's structure has been non-existent. Far too easy for Hjulmand's side to send in crosses, let fly from distance or just win the ball back through a well-organised press.

Improvements. Needed.



5.52pm
Does Southgate turn to his bench right away? Stranger things have happened, but there are certainly some options.

Midfield control? Conor Gallagher, Kobbie Mainoo and Adam Wharton. Or the pizzazz of Eberechi Eze perhaps?

Guehi and Foden - to a degree - have at least done themselves justice.



5.54pm
You think lessons would have been learned from that Serbia game, but it has been total deja vu. Only this time, Southgate's men have been punished.

A few times we have seen the England boys take out their frustrations verbally on one another too.

But credit to Denmark, who have smelled blood and have attacked like a famished shark.



5.56pm

Harry Kane is only the third English player to score in four separate major tournaments after Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 pic.twitter.com/9ZsSNde643 — ITV Football (@itvfootball) June 20, 2024

Another nice little statistic for Kane here, but in reality, that may count for nought if England fail to switch on.



5.57pm

The half-time stats 😬

Not good reading for England fans 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿#Euro2024 | #DENENG pic.twitter.com/wPcGk0atXO — ITV Football (@itvfootball) June 20, 2024

England only topping Denmark on the shots off target metric... and probably the midfielders dropping deep metric too.



6.02pm
Half-time analysis from Sports Mole football editor Matt Law

"Even when England took the lead, I still sensed that Denmark were confident, and that proved to be the case as the first period developed.

"The leveller was a stunning hit, but England had been warned, with the Three Lions failing to push on. England should still have more than enough to make it through the group stage, but there have been some worrying signs.

"Is Alexander-Arnold in midfield working? Is there a way to get Foden into a more central position? Southgate has a lot to ponder ahead of a huge second 45 minutes of football here."



6.03pm
Earlier this week, Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag had a slight dig at Southgate's style of play, and while the pot may be calling the kettle black there, he has been proved right so far.

England now re-emerging for the second half. No changes it seems.



46 min
KICKOFF:  Denmark kick us off again. Massive 45 minutes.


48 min
So far, so nothing, although England are in possession in the final third...


50 min
Bellingham really has not been himself today has he? He loses the ball and spends a good amount of time complaining rather than focusing on Denmark playing around him.

Sums up England's display so far.



51 min
SAVE!  Rice goes for the Hjulmand special with a low drive from range, but a couple of deflections later and Schmeichel gathers with ease.


52 min
CLOSE!  Better!

Alexander-Arnold's ball over the top is on the money for Saka's run in behind, and the Arsenal man holds off Kristiansen before beating Schmeichel with a looping header, which lands just wide.



54 min
ENGLAND SUB

Despite creating that chance just now, Alexander-Arnold is hooked for stamina specialist Gallagher.



56 min
OFF THE POST!  SO CLOSE FROM FODEN!

Some nice link-up between Saka and Foden sets the latter up to hit one from 20 yards, and his low strike whacks the foot of the post!

Saka balloons the follow-up over the top.



57 min
DENMARK SUBS

Wind and Kristiansen - who has struggled all evening - are off. Damsgaard and Bah come on.

Momentum just shifting here.



59 min
Denmark back on the front foot, and England are almost made to pay for falling asleep again, but a Gallagher intervention spares their blushes.


59 min
SHOT!  Saka is all up there on his own and has several red shirts around him.

He has no choice but to go for the spectacular, which Schmeichel sees wide.



61 min
A definite improvement from Southgate's men, but where was this attacking intent for most of the first half?

Denmark now have a free kick out on the left... Eriksen to take.



61 min
It hits Saka square in the noggin, but he stays on his feet despite a slight daze.


62 min
YELLOW CARD!  Gallagher has brought just a bit too much energy to the midfield...

He catches Christensen late and is booked.



64 min
SHOT!  Rice gives the ball away under pressure and Eriksen can hit one from 25 yards - which seems to be the golden distance today - but it sails over.


66 min
Bellingham runs into traffic yet again, but England recycle the ball and get it out wide to Saka.

The Arsenal man goes for the deep delivery, but this one does not come off. Goal kick.

England subs are coming, by the way...



67 min
DENMARK SUB

Rice has just given away a corner and rues the state of the pitch.

Hojlund is off for Denmark, on comes the towering Yussuf Poulsen.



68 min
SAVE!  Damsgaard tries for another spectacular against England on the half-volley, but Pickford is behind it all the way.


69 min
ENGLAND SUBS

A triple threat from the England boss. On come Jarrod Bowen, Eberechi Eze and Ollie Watkins.

Off come Foden, Kane and Saka.

Wow.



70 min
Kane understandable - he has been anonymous barring his goal - but Saka and Foden were two of England's principle threats. The former in particular has been involved in most of his side's attacking plays this half.

Twenty minutes for Southgate's bold changes to pay off.



72 min
SAVE!  WATKINS INVOLVED STRAIGHT AWAY!

Bellingham sends in a stunning through ball to find the run of the Aston Villa man, but Schmeichel closes the angle and forces the ball behind for a corner, which Denmark deal with.



73 min
SHOT!  Hjulmand's men tried to break from that set piece, but England got bodies back quickly.

Hojbjerg still gets one on goal from distance, which Pickford has to get down low to beat away.



74 min
YELLOW CARD!  The amount of long-range efforts in this game has been something else.

Maehle now in the book for bringing down Bowen.



75 min
Another England corner in front of the Danish faithful, but Hojbjerg does his job.

The Tottenham Hotspur lynchpin has done his chances of a big summer move no harm at all tonight. Exceptional display.



77 min
SHOT!  T-minus 15 minutes (added time included) for someone in red or white to make themselves the hero.

Another Hojbjerg shot from distance, another comfortable Pickford stop.



79 min
Southgate's changes have had the desired impact so far, but the coveted second goal still eludes England.

Denmark are certainly not out of this either - when the opportunity to press and break arises, they are taking them.



81 min
Damsgaard is the latest man to come up with a shoddy pass - sending the ball straight out of play on the right for an England throw.


82 min
DENMARK SUBS

Hjulmand's last two throws of the dice. Eriksen and goalscorer Hjulmand take their leave for Christian Norgaard and Andreas Skov Olsen.



83 min
Guehi goes from zero to hero!

The Crystal Palace man loses out to Bah, who goes charging into the box, but Guehi sprints back and deflects the cross behind for a corner.



84 min
CHANCE!  Skov Olsen's delivery finds an unmarked Christensen, but he is off balance and spoons a volley over the bar.


85 min
CLOSE!  DENMARK INCHES AWAY!

Again, England give the ball away in a dangerous area, and Hojbjerg's latest 20-yard strike - a beautiful curler - is agonisingly wide.

Pickford looked beaten!



87 min
YELLOW CARD!  Perhaps the full-time whistle cannot come soon enough for these England fans in Frankfurt.

Southgate urges calm as Norgaard picks up a yellow for bringing Gallagher down.



88 min
Poulsen just did a nice little backwards roll there after fouling Guehi, who is one of the few England players who can be proud of his display.


89 min
Oh dear.

Pickford plays the free kick short to Walker, whose free kick is overhit and sails out for a goal kick.



90 min
We will have three extra minutes here.


90 +1 min
England free kick from a similar position to the last one - Rice and Pickford have a few words with each other before Guehi plays it short.

But one final chance to launch it into the box now...



90 + 2 min
Pickford does so this time, but the Danes clear, and that might be that.


90 + 4 min
FULL TIME:  DENMARK 1-1 ENGLAND


6.54pm
Well, that may have been the most unexciting live commentary I have done so far.

For the second game running, England struck the opening goal through a cross from the right - which Kane eventually turned in - but for whatever reason, they immediately dropped off and invited pressure.

Serbia could not capitalise, but Denmark could through a terrific Hjulmand strike, and neither side did enough to win the match in the second period.

England are still top, but qualification will have to wait.



6.57pm

The points are shared between the #ThreeLions and Denmark in Frankfurt. pic.twitter.com/6H0O8kX7Br — England (@England) June 20, 2024


Time to forget this one and move on? I reckon so.

Slovenia for England in five days time, while Denmark are soon to face Serbia, who are the only team who cannot overtake Southgate's men on the final group matchday.

A huge thank you to everyone who managed to grit their teeth and stay with us for that torturous watch. Our full match report can be found here.

Goodbye all!
