MUSCAT: Namibia delivered a clinical performance, securing a commanding 62-run victory in the fifth and final T20I match against Oman, ultimately winning the series 3-2 at the Oman Cricket Academy ground on Sunday.

Namibia’s triumph capped off an entertaining series, with both teams experimenting with different combinations ahead of their participation in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in West Indies and USA, scheduled to commence on June 1.

On Sunday, Oman failed to chase down the stiff target despite a flying start after the visitors, batting first, put up a formidable 212/3.

Oman’s opening batter Naseem Khushi, who has been in roaring form, along with No.3 batter Aqib Ilyas shared a 83-run stand after the fall of Kashyap Prajapati in the second over.

Khushi’s onslaught saw him hammer 49 off 28 balls in a knock that comprised four sixes and three fours. He was all set for half-century before a mix-up with Ilyas led to his run out in the 10th over.

Oman were much ahead of Namibia (40/0) at the end of powerplay as they scored 66/1.

Ilyas completed his half-century (51 off 29 balls) but his exit soon after Zeeshan Maqsood’s dismissal led to a middle-order collapse as Oman slumped from 99/2 to 116/6.

Ilyas’s inning bore his stamp of aggressiveness as he blasted five boundaries and two sixes before he was caught by Jan Frylinck off Bernard Scholtz.

Ayaan Khan and Rafiullah were back in the hut without any notable contributions as the task of steep run-rate hit the hosts’ batting line-up.

Scholtz nearly wrapped up the game for Namibia in his fourth and team’s 14th over as he picked two wickets off successive balls to be on a hat-trick. He removed Nadeem off the first ball and Fayyaz Butt was clean bowled off the next delivery. Samay Shrivastav avoided the hat-trick but at 118/8 Oman’s chase was as good as derailed. Scholtz’s magical spell ended with figures of 4-0-20-4.

Erasmus then picked his second wicket as Mehran Khan was leg before for 10 and with the tailenders failing to do much, Oman were bowled out for 150 in 18.3 overs

Earlier, a 24-ball half-century blitz by Namibia skipper Gerhard Erasmus and valuable runs by opening pair of JP Kotze and Malan Kruger powered his side to 212/3.

Electing to bat first, Kotze and Kruger, laid the foundation of a solid total as they shared a 76-run stand. Kotze departed for a 37-ball 48 that included five boundaries and three maximums.

Kruger was one of two victims of Aqib Ilyas (2/21) for 45 off just 28 balls that included five sixes.

With Oman bowlers toiling on what looked a good batting wicket, Erasmus and David Wiese sent the host bowlers on a leather chase with a 92-run unbroken fourth wicket stand after the openers exit. After the dismissal of Jan Frylinck (14) in the 14th over with the score 120, it was left for Erasmus and Wiese duo to steer their team to a huge total.

Erasmus stayed unbeaten on 64 off just 29 balls and his inning was studded with six sixes and two boundaries while Wiese was unbeaten on a 17-ball 29, which included two hits to the ropes and two over it.

Eight Oman bowlers were pressed into the attack by skipper Zeeshan Maqsood with only Ilyas and Mehran Khan finding success (1-21).

Namibia batters’ exhibition of strokeplay witnessed a total of 16 maximums and 12 boundaries.

Brief scores: Namibia 212/3 (JP Kotze 48, Malan Kruger 45, Gerhard Erasmus 64*, David Wiese 29*; Aqib Ilyas 2/21) beat Oman 150 in 18.3 overs (Naseem Khushi 49, Ilyas 51; Bernard Scholtz 4/20, Erasmus 2/22).
