IRÉNE-MARI VAN DER WALT

F

ear not, Mercedes fans, Toto Wolff has

got a plan – or so he says in the team’s

statement in the build-up to Sunday’s

Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka.

“The car has shown signs of strong

performance on occasion, but

we’ve struggled to deliver this at

the critical moments across the

first three races,” Wolff said.

It has likely been quite an emotional rollercoaster for supporters of the Silver Arrows thus

far, given the contrast between

their second-place finish on

the constructor’s standings last

year and their best finish of

the season thus far with

George Russel in sixth

at Bahrain.

A double DNF at

the last Grand Prix

certainly wouldn’t

have done much

for anyone’s confidence.

Suzuka, where

Mercedes hopes

will be the light

at the end of the

tunnel for their W15

car, may not provide the most favourable

conditions to make a statement.

“Suzuka, with its famously fast sweeps

mixed with some low-speed content, plus

elevation change, will provide a different

challenge to the circuits we’ve raced at so

far,” Wolff explains.

Expectations of 2021, 2022, and 2023

world champion Max Verstappen out for

vengeance after a first DNF in years likely

won’t help anyone on the grid.

Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz Junior, winner of

the last Grand Prix on 24 March in Australia, seems intent to keep the winning

going through 2025 as he insists it’s time

to “speed things up” with his contract

negotiations.

Sainz could for the most part

take his pick with more than

half of the driver contracts

up in the air for next year.

No doubt he is hot property at the moment. The Spaniard, however, shares that

there is nothing to share at

the moment pertaining to

his future. Fans will have

to wait and see.
