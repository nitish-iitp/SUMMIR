England move to the top of Group Two

It’s early days in the Super Eights stage at this World Cup, but England have started in terrific style.

They move to the top spot in Group Two, edging above South Africa on net run rate.

The USA sit third, with West Indies at the bottom.

‘We left 15-20 runs out there’

West Indies captain Rovman Powell also spoke with Michael Atherton after the match.

“You have to look from a batting perspective. I think we left 15-20 runs out there as a batting group.

“But we could have put on a better display as a bowling group, too,” he said.

He also provided an update on Brandon King, who limped off after going down hurt at the crease.

“It’s just a little bit worrying, but hopefully he can pull through for the next game.”

WI keep moving, WI keep rallyin'.👏🏿

Buttler praises his side

“That was a really good performance, we planned really well, have been practising well, and I thought we executed with both the bat and the ball,” explained the England captain.

“I thought we bowled really well to restrict such a powerful batting line up, it [180] is still a decent score and you have to play well to chase them down.

“I thought we were very smart with the bat. The Bairstow-Salt partnership was just so good.”

He also singled out Adil Rashid for some very high praise.

“We keep saying he is our most important player – he has been for a long time.”

Salt named Player of the Match

Unsurprisingly, England’s Phil Salt is awarded for his excellent performance with the bat.

“I’m not looking too far ahead, but I’m glad I could contribute to a good team win,” he says rather understatedly.

“There was a period where I didn’t face many balls and that is the biggest challenge, hitting boundaries after those periods.

“Jonny [Bairstow] is crucial. Once Jos [Buttler] got out, I had to be the one to bat through. Jonny came in and took the pressure off me, taking all the smart calculated risks that he did.”

A simply MASSIVE over from Phil Salt 🤯

England step on the gas

It was shaping up to be a close chase in Saint Lucia until Bairstow and Salt decided to take all of the drama out of the game and get the job done.

Opener Salt hit 87* from 47 balls with Bairstow ending on 48* from 26.

Brilliant from England. Exactly the performance they would have wanted after a tricky start to the tournament.

WHAT. A. WIN!

England win by eight wickets!

England run two off the first ball of the 18th over. Salt then hits one up in the air, but the ball lands safely and the batsmen take a single.

Bairstow finishes the job, smashing a shot through the leg side.

Terrific from England, a real statement performance.

17 overs. England 177-2

Bairstow can’t hit the winning runs in this over, but it’s almost there for Jos Buttler’s men.

Four needed from 18 balls.

16 overs. England 171-2

Six more for Salt!

He plants another huge shot over long off. But he’s not finished there. Six more for the England opener!

This time he hits over leg side into the wind. It’s a massive shot. West Indies are stunned.

He ends the over with a four. Just the 30 from that one. Incredible.
