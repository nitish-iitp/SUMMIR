Bermuda are right in the thick of it from the off when they face tournament favourites Canada at White Hill Field today.

With overnight dew expected for the 9.30am start, does Delray Rawlins gamble by batting first if winning the toss — or does he fancy a chase, come what may?

Tune in here for all the action.

If you are a late riser, or have rather unpatriotically prioritised Premier League football over your very own stars, scroll down for all the action as it happened. And then we expect to hang around for match two at 2pm between Cayman Islands and Panama.
