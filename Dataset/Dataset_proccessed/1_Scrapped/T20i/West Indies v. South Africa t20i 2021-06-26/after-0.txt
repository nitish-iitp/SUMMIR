THE VIEW FROM EUROPE: Difficult choices for the Caribbean – By David Jessop

By David Jessop

Can the Caribbean avoid being caught up in the accelerating east-west struggle for global influence? Is the region likely to find itself in a bidding war, ‘dancing to the rhythm of dollar diplomacy’, as Jamaica’s former prime minister, Bruce Golding, has suggested?

Reading the communiqué from the recently held G7 summit, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the consensus arrived at by wealthy western nations on relations with China and Russia, the promotion of shared values, and investment in post-pandemic economic recovery, will not be used to attempt to seduce the region.

Although the meeting held in England’s far Southwest touched on multiple issues, it is the future approach agreed towards China and its Belt and Road Initiative, and on corporate taxation which will likely become the most complex future issues that Caribbean governments must now respond to.            Continue reading →

GUYANA: COVID-19: Sputnik V Vaccine second doses delayed – Editorial

By Stabroek News –  June 28, 2021  – EDITORIAL 

It has been more than a month since the Ministry of Health announced that second doses for Russia’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccines have not been available. Since then there has been the tired refrain from the ministry that the vaccines will arrive “soon”. This is not acceptable as the Guyana Government has paid an enormous amount of money for the delivery of the full dosage from Aurugulf Health Investment of the United Arab Emirates.

Among the COVID vaccines available globally, Sputnik V is unique in the sense that its first and second doses are dissimilar. The first dose uses a modified version of an adenovirus to convey the genes for the notorious spike protein of the COVID-19 virus. The second dose of Sputnik V uses a different adenovirus to sharpen immunity against COVID-19.      Continue reading →

GUYANA TOURISM: A Gem in Nascimento’s Kit – by Francis Quamina Farrier
 — By Francis Quamina Farrier 

Hurakabra Tourist Resort

This article is for June 2021, the month of Brides, in which I throw the spotlight on  the well-known married couple, Gem Madhoo and Kit Nascimento.

Both Gem and Kit were approaching their mature years when they met and fell madly in love with each other. To quote Kit from his wedding speech, “…it was because of our mutual love and ability to cook.” One can conclude that the way to both a man’s and a woman’s heart, is through their stomachs.,

Gem Madhoo, like her husband Kit Nascimento, have done much, not only for their own enjoyment and development, but also for their beloved Beautiful Guyana. Kit has worked in high public office in the Guyana Public Service, which included within the country’s Parliament.

Oil price climbing to a point where Guyana can rake in record revenues
By OilNOW – June 25, 2021

An oil 
supply shortfall is coming and with OPEC+ expected to provide just a fraction of the demand, barrels from producers outside of the alliance, such as Guyana, would be needed even more. Already, dated Brent has soared past $75 a barrel – a two year high – as inventories continue to fall and demand picks up.

This scenario has seen analysts predict the return of a $100 a barrel oil price which would be the highest since Guyana began producing crude at the Liza Phase 1 Development in December 2019. This would see the Guyana government raking in around US$100 million per oil lift.        Continue reading →
