Pakistan-born all-rounder Aqib Ilyas, who scored 62 off 53 and then claimed two wickets (2/41) with his off-spin, was adjudged the Player of the Match. But there were other notable performances for the world no. 18 Oman.

India-born opener Kashyap Prajapati (38 off 30) and skipper Zeeshan Maqsood (45 off 25) played crucial knocks while Bilal Khan, Shakeel Ahmed and Fayyaz Butt claimed a brace of wickets each.

Cambodia, the lowest-ranked team in the second edition of the ACC Premier Cup, started their campaign with an eight-wicket defeat at the hands of Kuwait on Saturday. After struggling to post a sub-par score of 141/5, the world no. 42 failed to contain the Kuwaiti top order. The match was wrapped up in quick time, in 31.2 overs.
