WHICH TEAMS ARE THE FAVOURITES TO WIN THE 2024 PSL?

The defending champions Lahore Qalandars are one of the favourites to win the coveted trophy in PSL 9. The team looks settled with captain Shaheen Shah Afridi winning two back-to-back titles with the side in 2022 and 2023. The other team which will be having a closer look at the title will be Peshawar Zalmi which has former Pakistan captain and the highest all-time run scorer in PSL, Babar Azam as their skipper. The Quetta Gladiators bring a lot of experience to the table. They have replaced Sarfraz Ahmed as skipper with South African Rilee Rossouw and have the T20 giants like Mohammad Amir, Jason Roy, Akeal Hosein, Wanindu Hasaranga, Sherfane Rutherford, etc. in the side.

WHICH TEAMS HAVE WON THE PSL BEFORE?

Each team participating in the tournament has won the title at least once. Islamabad United and Lahore Qalandars are the only teams to win the tournament twice with Qalandars achieving the feat in the last two seasons. They are also the only team to successfully defend their crown. Karachi Kings, Multan Sultans, Peshawar Zalmi and Quetta Gladiators have won the trophy once with Zalmi finishing as runners-up on 3 occasions.
