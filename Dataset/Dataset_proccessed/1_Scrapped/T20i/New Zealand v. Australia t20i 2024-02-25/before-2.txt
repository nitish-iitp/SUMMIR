The Nigeria Invitational Women’s Twenty20 International (T20I) Tournament is set for its 4th edition from the 25th of February, 2024, to the 3rd of March, 2024, at Tafawa Balewa Square Cricket Oval, Lagos. Defending champions Nigeria will be joined by Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Tanzania in this edition. From format and broadcasting to squads and schedule, here’s everything you need to know about this competition.
