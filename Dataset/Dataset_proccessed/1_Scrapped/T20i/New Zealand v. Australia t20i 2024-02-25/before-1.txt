February 24, 2024  Team Female Cricket

Otago Sparks and Wellington Blaze will go head-to-head in the Final of the ongoing 2023-24 Hallyburton Johnstone Shield at the University Oval, Dunedin, on the 25th of February 2024, at 3:00 AM Indian Standard Time (IST).

University Oval, Dunedin.
Squads:

Otago Sparks – Suzie Bates, Emma Black, Caitlin Blakely, Eden Carson, Oliva Gain, Polly Inglis, Bella James, Hayley Jensen, Molly Loe, Felicity Robertson (C), Poppy Watkins, Saffron Wilson

Wellington Blaze – Leigh Kasperek (C), Nicole Baird, Rebecca Burns, Kate Chandler, Tash Codyre, Hannah Francis, Xara Jetly, Jess Kerr, Caitlin King, Jess Mcfadyen (WK), Georgia Plimmer, Gemma Sims

Players to watch out:
Felicity Robertson

The 29-year-old all-rounder, from 9 HJS outings this season, has amassed 272 runs, including the highest of 60, while also taking 9 wickets at an economy rate of 4.16. Felicity has returned to form in the 2nd leg HJS fixtures, registering scores of 42, 49*, 1, and 22*, while recording figures of 1/25, 2/30, 1/15, and 0/3. She’ll be counted on for the goods.

Eden Carson

The 22-year-old off-spinner, averaging 15.13 and maintaining an economy rate of 3.56, has scalped 15 wickets from 8 HJS appearances this edition. Eden, in her previous 4 outings, has returned figures of 1/33, 1/49, 1/23, and 2/36, and it’ll be hoped she builds on this form, leading the wickets tally in the final. She can also be handy with the bat, down the order.

Georgia Plimmer

The 20-year-old top-order batter has accumulated 262 runs, including the highest of 147, from 8 HJS outings this summer. Georgia’s scores from her previous 4 outings read 21, 32, 5, and 18, and she’ll be backed to build on her notable form, converting these scores. It’ll be watched if she posts a significant score in the must-win.

Leigh Kasperek

The 32-year-old all-rounder this HJS season, from 10 outings, has bagged 17 wickets and added 277 runs to the tally from 9 outings, with respective bests of 5/16 and 89. While Leigh has managed only one good score of 66 in her previous 4 outings, she continues to be rewarding with the ball and will be relied upon for an all-rounder effort.

Pitch:

The pitch at University Oval offers a relatively balanced playing field as the conditions favor both batters and bowlers. The quicks, in particular, gain an advantage from the conditions, and a score in the 230s is considered to be challenging on this track.

Weather:

Despite cloudy overhead, the chances of rain are minimal, and the forecast promises a complete game of cricket at University Oval, Dunedin. The temperature is forecasted to hover around 14°C, with moderate winds and humidity at 81%.

Fantasy playing XI:

Jess Mcfadyen, Polly Inglis, Caitlin Blakely, Georgia Plimmer, Suzie Bates, Felicity Robertson, Leigh Kasperek, Emma Black, Eden Carson, Xara Jetly, Nicole Baird
