Team Analysis:


South Africa:


South Africa was confident of winning the game against Zimbabwe when rain played a spoilsport and snatched a point from their jaws. Although, South African bowlers leaked too many runs after match was reduced to 9 overs, likes of Lungi Ngidi, Keshav Maharaj, Anrich Nortje and Kagiso Rabada are couple of quality bowlers to consider while forming a fantasy team. 29-year-old Quinton de Kock played significant innings in his short span in the middle as he scored 47 off 18 deliveries. Rilee Rossouw, Aiden Markram, David Miller, and Tristan Stubbs are other key players who will be crucial for the side against Bangladesh.


Bangladesh:


Shakib al Hasan-led side could not perform extremely well with the bat, but their bowlers were instrumental against Netherlands. The 27-year-old Taskin Ahmed picked four wickets in the game, while Hasan Mahmud returned with two wickets. The skipper Shakib Al Hasan and Soumya Sarkar returned with one wicket each. The likes of Taskin Ahmed, Hasan Mahmud and Shakib Al Hasan must be considered while forming fantasy team. Batting all-rounder Afif Hossain played a vital knock of 38 off 27 deliveries, while Mosaddek Hossain added 20 runs off 12 balls.
