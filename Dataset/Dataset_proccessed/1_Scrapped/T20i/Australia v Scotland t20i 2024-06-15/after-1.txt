Australia has given England a Twenty20 World Cup reprieve after surviving a scare in St Lucia to claim a last-over five-wicket win over Scotland.

With its own progression to the Super Eight stage already assured, Australia was well below its best as it chased down Scotland's 5-180 with two balls to spare.

Well that was a fun little game. The stakes were technically pretty low for Australia, but it didn't feel like it as that run chase heated up. There is so much talent and depth in this Aussie team, surely enough to take it a long way in this T20 World Cup.

Thanks for your company today! The blog will be back for Australia's next game as we head into the second phase of this tournament. Until then, have a good one!

Marcus Stoinis is the player of the match

By Dean Bilton

(Getty Images)

A match-winning knock of 59 off 29 balls sees him take the gong ahead of Scotland's Brandon McMullen. When the rest of the world was stressing out, the Stoin stayed remarkably calm and guided his country home.

"I have been fortunate to play consistently for the last 3-4 months starting with the IPL but there's no substitute for confidence. That's the recipe we all try to keep a hold of."

Australia wins by five wickets, Scotland is out and England is through

By Dean Bilton

(Getty Images)

Who says we never do anything for our English buddies? The spirit of cricket is alive and well around here, my friends.

I tell you what though, I thought the Aussies had cooked that at about the 14-over mark. There was absolutely no momentum to the Head-Stoinis partnership, until the precise moment that there suddenly was. That's the thing about these Australian batters, they can turn games so incredibly quickly.

The Scots did themselves proud, but were probably 15 runs short with the bat and just a little loose in the crunch overs with the ball. They will be left to rue the fine margins, but more experienced sides than them have been handed a similar fate by the Aussies.

And good news for England! They scrape on through to the Super 8s thanks to stirring wins over Oman and Namibia, and now owe the Australian cricket team a big favour in return.

20th over - Wheal hopes to pull off a Scottish miracle

By Dean Bilton

Australia needs five runs from six balls.

Make that four from five as David takes a single down the ground.

Wade looks to throw the bat at that one but gets little on it. Still, with the field spread it's an easy single. At some point the Scots are going to have to bring the field in to try to stop these last few runs being ticked off so easily.

DROPPED! David is dropped on the boundary! And they run two! That might have been the game right there. Tim David put that miles up into the night sky and let Chris Sole do his best. He never settled, lost his balance and put it down.

Scores are level.

SIX! Tim David wins it with a six over cow corner! Australia wins by five wicket, Scotland is out and England is through.

19th over - Safyaan Sharif gets one more over

By Dean Bilton

His last one was a bit of a mixed bag. Sharif simply must deliver the goods here or Scotland's hopes will be dashed.

David takes a single from the first ball, well stopped at deep gully.

Great running there from Wade who weighted that shot well into the space on the leg side.

A dot ball then a single for Wade. Australia is ticking them off, rather than blowing them away.

David doesn't cash in fully from the Sharif full toss, but two runs out to deep square leg are handy enough.

A wide now from Sharif. Brutal.

It's hit the umpire! David whacks one down the ground and into the umpire's foot. They take a single, but would it have been more if not for the ricochet? Is the umpire in on the anti-England conspiracy too?!? There are some things we are never meant to know.

Over bowled. Australia needs five to win.

18th over - Brad Wheal to have a crack

By Dean Bilton

Back to some pace, and Wheal's first ball nearly dismisses David. His tentative push nearly comes back to the bowler for a caught and bowled.

FOUR! Poor ball from Wheal, short and straight. David rocks back and pulls it fine where there is no fielder and helps himself to four.

FOUR MORE! Wheal has lost his radar. Four leg byes have been signalled from a full toss that was pretty close to being above David's waist. No ball isn't called, but the boundary is still costly for Scotland.

FOUR AGAIN! David gets inside that one and swats it through point for another boundary. The equation is 14 runs from 14 balls for Australia. What a turnaround.

A single to David after his hat-trick of boundaries.

Matt Wade fails to score from the last ball of the over, so Australia needs 13 runs from the last two overs.

OUT! Marcus Stoinis has been clean bowled by Watt!

By Dean Bilton

The reverse paddle giveth and the reverse paddle taketh away.

Stoinis went for one too many, and that one went straight on with the angle, behind his pads and into middle and leg stump. Clever bowling from Watt to give Scotland a sniff again.

17th over - Mark Watt into the attack

By Dean Bilton

Scotland goes back to spin and has Stoinis on strike to begin with.

The first ball is a dot, but the second is a costly wide.

Stoinis asks the umpire why Watt's third ball isn't called a wide. Certainly looks like he may have gotten away with that one.

FOUR! Stoinis stands and delivers again down the ground, punching Watt back over his head for four.

FOUR MORE! It's the reverse paddle again! That shot might just about win Australia the game. The off side has been vacant for him throughout, and that is the shot he has used to exploit it.

16th over cont - Sharif has two to come

By Dean Bilton

Tim David comes to the middle. Australia needs 41 runs from 26 balls.

David is off the mark with a single first ball.

FOUR RUNS! 50 FOR STOINIS! Stoinis looks like he is barely trying out there, but he has absolutely raced to a half-century which has given his team a chance. Another casual cut over point earns him a boundary to finish the over.

Twenty-four runs from the Sharif over.

OUT! Travis Head is out! Scotland won't go down without a fight!

By Dean Bilton

It was wide of off stump again, but a little bit fuller this time which meant Head couldn't get fully underneath that ball. Instead he picked out Jones on the long off boundary to give the Scots a lifeline.

It is game on here in St Lucia.

16th over - Safyaan Sharif into the attack again

By Dean Bilton

SIX RUNS! That's big from Travis Head! Swings with the angle from around the wicket and belts it behind square leg for a huge six. It's go time for Australia.

SIX MORE! Another beauty from Travis Head! That one was full and wide, but Head used that space to whack Sharif over long on and all the way. This game is changing quickly.

A huge wide now from Sharif. Scotland needs to keep its head here, this is a very long way from over.

SIX AGAIN! Mama mia, Travis Head is absolutely belting them now! Another wide one from Sharif, and Head has hit that an absolute mile over extra cover. He's swinging hard and finding the middle. Electric batting.

15th over - Chris Sole back into the attack

By Dean Bilton

It's now or never for Australia. The Aussies have to put the foot down for the rest of this chase with two runs a ball required.

FOUR! Stoinis didn't get all of that one, but he hit it straight enough to split the converging fielders on the rope down the ground.

EDGED FOR FOUR! Stoinis slashes, edges and cashes in another boundary. Things are happening for Australia now. Look out.

One more for Stoinis, cut out to the deep fielder on the off side.

50 FOR TRAVIS HEAD! He is stalling out a bit currently, but his job is now to support Marcus Stoinis. He takes a single from the final ball of the over to keep the strike.

14th over - It's Leask to bowl his last over

By Dean Bilton

The spinners have shut this game down so well for Scotland. Leask has been very tidy so far.

SIX! A weird little reverse paddle from Stoinis somehow clears the rope. That is pretty darn impressive, and Australia needed it after a slow start to the over.

SIX MORE! That's a biggie! Stoinis goes down the ground and gets plenty of it. A massive six for Stoinis, who is making his move.

FOUR MORE! Another reverse paddle (I don't know else to describe it) over point earns Stoinis four more.

Eighteen runs off that over. That could be a pivotal set.

Australians are getting worried

By Dean Bilton

Australia is playing without fear and are not concerned with the result… are we not playing Bazball? Shouldn’t the English be claiming this performance as inspired by them?

- Chris

Hello Dean. If Australia fail to reach their target, will the English have time for a quick beer with the Aussie team before they leave? Or will they head straight to Lords for a debrief?

- Mike

One of the TV commentators had an interesting point that they don't think Australia's minds are "fully" in this game. Can't blame them to be honest!

- Lewis

As you can tell by these comments, Australians are very concerned by the prospect of losing this game. Not an ounce of schadenfreude to be found.

By Dean Bilton

This is Watt's third over. Australia needs 95 runs from 48 balls.

FOUR! Stoinis is so laconic out there, but maybe he's just waiting for his ball. That one was it, full outside the off stump and driven through the covers well.

Only six from that over too! Alarm bells are ringing loudly now.

Singles from the first three balls. Can't be persisting with this for too much longer.

Four singles from a rapid Greaves over. The required run rate is going the wrong way for Australia.

FOUR! Absolutely crunched through point by Travis Head. Scorching cut shot to the fence.

Only eight from the over though. Both batters still struggling for consistent timing.

Travis Head and Marcus Stoinis were the saviours for Australia, each hitting a half-century and combining for an 80-run stand that changed the match.

Tim David and Matt Wade took the game to the death, before a dropped catch from Chris Sole in the last over allowed Australia to get home.

The result means England will join Australia in progressing out of Group B, thanks to a superior net run-rate than Scotland, whose World Cup has come to an end.

But for long periods of the match it appeared England's tournament could be over.

With Pat Cummins rested and Stoinis not bowling, Australia dropped six catches in the field and looked at risk of their first ever T20 loss to an associate nation.

Brandon McMullen whacked 60 from 34 balls for the Scots, clubbing half-a-dozen sixes in his knock and regularly going inside out over long off.

In reply, Australia struggled to catch fire and sat at 1-36 after six overs and their slowest powerplay of the competition.

When the equation reached 107 needed from the final 10 overs, England would have been considering booking their flights home.

But Head (68 from 49 balls) and Stoinis (59 off 29) were able to bat their side back into the match.

Look back at how the action unfolded in our live blog.
