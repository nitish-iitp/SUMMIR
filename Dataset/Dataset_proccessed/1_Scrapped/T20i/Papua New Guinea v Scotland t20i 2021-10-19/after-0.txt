At 12, Rebecca Downie has done what most of us, and not just other 12-year-olds, would not even dream of. The kit worn by the Scotland men’s cricket team at the ongoing World T20 in the UAE, is designed by Downie. It derives its colours from those of the country’s national emblem, the thistle.

The team chose her design from over 200 entries submitted by schoolchildren across the country. Downie, who hails from Haddington, presented the team with the new kit before they left for the World Cup. The 12-year-old and her family were special guests in the match against Zimbabwe in Edinburgh where she met the players.

“I was so excited when I heard I had won the competition, I couldn’t believe it. I was so happy to see the shirt in real life, it looks brilliant! It was amazing to meet the team and watch them play against Zimbabwe. I will be wearing my shirt and cheering them on in every game in the World Cup,” Downie was quoted as saying by ‘Cricket and More’.

Scottish skipper Kyle Coetzer said the team was “really proud” of the design. “It was great to meet Rebecca and her family recently and see her wearing the new shirt. The team is really proud of the design and we are planning to go out there and do it justice with our performances in the World Cup. We hope that the fans will enjoy the new design and wear them proudly as they support us from back home,” he said.

Cricket Scotland took to Twitter to thank Downie once again for designing the kit.
