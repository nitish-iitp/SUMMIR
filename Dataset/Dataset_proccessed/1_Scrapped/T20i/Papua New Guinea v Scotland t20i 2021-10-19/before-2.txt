... TIME FOR THE PRESENTATION ... 

22:42 (IST) Oct 18

Namibia started brilliantly as they scalped 3 wickets inside the Powerplay. Wickets were a must in a low-chasing game and they did very well early on but eventually, failed to capitalize on it. They restricted Sri Lanka from scoring freely but also deteriorated in taking wickets. Still, they showed a good fight till the end but came second best in the contest. Gerhard Erasmus used 8 bowlers and tried his best to find a wicket but failed to do so. 

22:40 (IST) Oct 18

The saying 'All is well that ends well' did really apply during the Lankan innings as they were 26 for 3 at one stage. None of their top order gave them a good start and they did look nervy at one stage but all thanks to Avishka Fernando and Bhanuka Rajapaksa, who stitched a partnership of 74 and helped their team to cross the finish line. 

22:39 (IST) Oct 18

Earlier Sri Lanka looked in a spot of bother but ultimately they chased it down pretty comfortably. Sri Lanka have started the qualifications round on a winning note and also gained a heavy net run rate success with it.
