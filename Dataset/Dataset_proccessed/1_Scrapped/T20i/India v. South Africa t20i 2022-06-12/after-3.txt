India vs South Africa, 2nd T20I Highlights: Heinrich Klaasen's magnificent knock of 81 off 46 powered South Africa to a four-wicket win over India in the second T20I as the visitors took a 2-0 lead in the 5-match series. Chasing 149, South Africa lost three early wickets thanks to Bhuvneshwar Kumar's brilliant opening spell. However, Klaasen and Temba Bavuma (35) steadied South Africa. When Bavuma fell to Yuzvendra Chahal, Klaasen upped the ante and went on to register his highest score in T20Is. Klaasen smashed 7 boundaries and five sixes as he took a special liking to the Indian spinners. He was eventually dismissed by Harshal Patel, and then Wayne Parnell fell to Bhuvneshwar Kumar -- who returned excellent figures of 4/13 -- but by then, South Africa had the match in the bag. David Miller, who was so crucial in their win in the 1st T20I, hit the winning runs with more than an over left. Earlier, some brilliant bowling helped the Proteas restrict India to 148/6. Shreyas Iyer top-scored for India with 40, while Ishan Kishan scored a 21-ball 34. India were set for an even lower score, but Dinesh Karthik's flourish at the death saw them add some respectability to the scorecard. The veteran batter finished unbeaten on 30 off 21. (SCORECARD)
