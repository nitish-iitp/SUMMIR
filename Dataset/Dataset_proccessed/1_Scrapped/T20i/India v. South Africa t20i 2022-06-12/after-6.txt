IND vs SA Highlights: South African batsmen David Miller and Kagiso Rabada greet each other

India vs South Africa Highlights 2nd T20: Heinrich Klaasen's 81 helped South Africa chase a 149-run target and beat India by four wickets in the second T20I at Cuttack. With the win, the Proteas also gained a 2-0 lead in the five-game T20I series. Bavuma kept the scoreboard ticking with 35 off 30 balls, especially after Bhuvneshwar's triple-strike derailed the Proteas in the powerplay. Put in to bat first, the Indian camp endured regular blows to slump to 98 for five on a tacky surface. Ishan Kishan hit an attacking 34 and Shreyas gathered 40 but both failed to convert their starts into a big score. Axar Patel then perished for 10, leaving India tottering at 112/6. Kagiso Rabada led a disciplined bowling attack as South Africa kept India's scoring rate under control. Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj sent back Pant in his first over and soon Hardik Pandya's wicket off Wayne Parnell made India slip further. In the end, Karthik launched an attack in the final two overs and put on an unbeaten 36-run stand with Harshal Patel, who made 12. Earlier, South Africa captain Temba Bavuma won the toss and opted to bowl versus the hosts. The visitors made two forced changes, with Heinrich Klaasen and Reeza Hendricks replacing Quinton de Kock and Tristan Stubbs respectively. India went with an unchanged XI.

IND vs SA Live Cricket Score: Klaasen on his match-winning innings

Heinrich Klaasen is 'Player of the Match' for his sensational 81.

"Quinny came up to me in the bus and told me that he has injured his wrist. Yesterday morning his hand was a bit stiff, so I got to know that I am playing yesterday. It looked very difficult with the new ball, so I tried to target the spinners. 

“I am glad it happened against India. I am honored to be here, and I am lucky to be here. Lot of staff members backed me, so pretty happy with that support, this one's for them,” says Klaasen.

India vs South Africa 2nd T20 Live: Bavuma says it was a ‘tricky' chase

"It was a tricky chase, Bhuvi bowled well, he made the ball talk upfront. It could have been clinical towards the end, but we will take that. We really needed someone to take it deep. That's the role I play in the game, to close it off," says Temba Bavuma.

"There's a learning I can take from this game, will try better in the next game. We knew it wasn't going to be an easy chase, but we were confident."

India vs South Africa 2nd T20 Live Updates: Rishabh Pant on the defeat

“We were 10-15 runs short. Bhuvi and the fast bowlers bowled well in the first 7-8 overs. But after that we weren't up to the mark. In the second half we needed wickets, but we couldn't get those wickets. They (Klaasen and Bavuma) actually batted really well,” says Pant.

India vs South Africa 2nd T20 Live Score: Miller on his batting spot

"A great win, it was a bit of a tricky wicket. We were in trouble. They bowled well up front. Klassen's knock was phenomenal. It was playing your game on the track, you can't worry about keeping your wicket," says David Miller.

"It was the coach and captain's decision for me to go at 6. They held me back for the final 10 but Klaasen's was a top knock. It is very tough to win in India, but we still have a lot of hard work still to do. We still want to keep going strength to strength. We are on the right track but a lot still to do."
