After Pakistan got a convincing victory in the 2nd ODI, which sealed a series win for them, they and the West Indies are now both on 80 points in the Cricket World Cup Super League. The big difference is that the West Indies have already played 20 matches compared to Pakistan’s 14. 

The only time Pakistan have reached a World Cup semi-final in the 21st century was when south Asia hosted the event in 2011. With the next World Cup to be held in India in 2023, these matches will provide valuable preparation in similar sort of conditions. They may have quality pace bowlers like S. Afridi and H. Rauf, but on some Asian pitches, it’s the batters and spin bowlers who will be expected to come to the fore. The batting form of B. Azam and I. ul Haq has been most encouraging, while the likes of S. Khan and M. Nawaz have performed well on dry, spin-friendly pitches.  

For the West Indies, this series was always going to be a big challenge. They may have lost it, but the performances of A. Joseph and A. Hosein, as well as some of the batters, will ensure they go home with some hope.

Weather Report

Though it will be cooler than during the first two games, the temperature will still be an oppressive 40°C at the start of play. The organizers were forced to push back the start time to 4 PM because of the dangerously high temperatures.

PAK vs WI 3rd ODI Pitch Report

Alhough Multan hadn’t hosted an ODI since April 2008 before this series began, the batters have enjoyed the conditions in both the earlier matches in the series. On the bowling front, the spinners from both sides also thrived in the second game.

Toss

Both teams have batted first on winning the toss, though that worked only for Pakistan. 

Top Fantasy Picks for PAK vs WI 3rd ODI Match
Pakistan
I. ul Haq averages an impressive 54.62 after 51 ODIs at a fine average of 54.22,  including 9 centuries and 13 half-centuries. He has been in good form with the bat, scoring two centuries and four half-centuries in his last 6 matches. Imam made 72 runs off 72 balls in the last game. 
M. Nawaz has played only 18 ODIs till now despite making his debut 6 years ago. But with the next 50-overs World Cup being in Asia, he should certainly get more opportunities. His left-arm spin fetched him career-best figures of 4-19 in the last game.
M. Wasim made his debut against Australia earlier this year and is one of a group of pace bowlers vying for the third seamer’s slot behind S. Afridi and H. Rauf. The 3 wickets he took in the last game won’t have hurt his chances at all. 
West Indies
K. Mayers, though being just eight games into his ODI career, already has one century to his name. Batting against the new ball seems to be the best time to score big runs in this series. As West Indies look set a dismal World Cup record this century, Mayers is part of a new group they have faith in.
S. Brooks might be new in terms of matches played for the West Indies, but experienced in shot making. He has scored a century, 3 half-centuries in just 11 ODIs at a healthy average of 47.2. So far, Brooks has made 112 runs in the 2 matches of this series.
A. Joseph looked the most effective of all the West Indies in the first game. He kept the visitors long in the run chase with the crucial wicket of B. Azam and S. Khan. He has picked up 75 wickets in just 46 ODIs at an excellent economy rate of 5.34. Alzarri took 2 for 33 in his 10 overs in the last game.
