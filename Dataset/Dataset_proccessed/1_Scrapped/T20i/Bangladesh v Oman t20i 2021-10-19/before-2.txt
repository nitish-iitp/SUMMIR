An Informative articale in the World Post on the influence that changes the conduct of Muslims

How Saudi Wahhabism Is the Fountainhead of Islamist Terrorism

A quote from the Post

“It would be troublesome but perhaps acceptable for the House of Saud to promote the intolerant and extremist Wahhabi creed just domestically. But, unfortunately, for decades the Saudis have also lavishly financed its propagation abroad. Exact numbers are not known, but it is thought that more than $100 billion have been spent on exporting fanatical Wahhabism to various much poorer Muslim

Is there a secret to auto insurance that will save money?

I once met a man who drove a modest Toyota Corolla, wore beat-up sneakers, and looked like he’d lived the same way for decades. But what really caught my attention was when he casually mentioned he was retired at 45 with more money than he could ever spend. I couldn’t help but ask, “How did you do it?”

He smiled and said, “The secret to saving money is knowing where to look for the waste—and car insurance is one of the easiest places to start.”

He then walked me through a few strategies that I’d never thought of before. Here’s what I learned:

1. Make insurance companies fight for your business

If it was then they won’t fled from Bengal to Assam. My question is how is this even possible that goons are doing whatever they wanted to and no officials are doing anything about it. If this is possible in WB which is in India so it means it is possible anywhere in India.

What if it starts in my or in your city? Is this possible? Do our system is so weak that any goons can kill people openly, roa

I from Bengal, India. I am a Hindu whose parents were born in East Bengal and had to migrate to West Bengal during the partition in 1947. Don't go by what you hear. Hindus of East Bengal origin are tolerant upto a limit. After that, you will see a different scenerio altogether. Mamata better know it and know it quickly.

Yes, Hindus are absolutely safe here. Have you heard about the naked agression of Bangali Hindus in retaliation to the murders when Direct Action was declared by Surawardi in Bengal in 1947 ?

Mahatma didn't go to fast because Hindus were being killed, he went into fasting when Hi

A lot of violence marked the Rama Navami processions in some pockets of Bengal, especially Howrah, Hooghly and North Dinajpur districts.

The violence triggered a war of words between the ruling Trinamool Congress and the opposition BJP. The latter claimed that Rama Navami processions were attacked by Muslims, including stone-pelters harboured inside mosques.

Muslims also attacked and torched shops and business establishments belonging to Hindus, alleged BJP leaders.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her party, on the other hand, blamed Hindus for the violence. She accused organisers of Rama Nava

What are the stupidest money mistakes most people make?

Where do I start?

I’m a huge financial nerd, and have spent an embarrassing amount of time talking to people about their money habits.

Here are the biggest mistakes people are making and how to fix them:

Not having a separate high interest savings account

Having a separate account allows you to see the results of all your hard work and keep your money separate so you're less tempted to spend it.

Plus with rates above 5.00%, the interest you can earn compared to most banks really adds up.

Here is a list of the top savings accounts available today. Deposit $5 before moving on because this is one of th
