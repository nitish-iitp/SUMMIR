With a superb bowling show from Mustafizur Rahman and Shakib, Bangladesh have defeated Oman in their second match of the T20 World Cup 2021 at Al Amerat Cricket Ground on Tuesday. This was a must-win game for Group B favourites Bangladesh to stay alive in the tournament as Oman and Scotland were at the top-two spots in the group. Jatinder Singh top-scored for Oman with his 40 runs knock but no other batter looked in a good touch vs Bangladesh bowlers. Earlier while batting first Bangladesh were bundled out for 153 runs in 20 overs as Oman's Bilal Khan returned with the figures of 3/18. Fayyaz Butt also took 3 wickets. Mohammad Naim (64) top-scored for Bangladesh and added 80 runs with Shakib Al Hasan (42) for the third wicket. Bangladesh (2 points) are still at the third spot in the Group B points table while Scotland lead with 4 points. (SCORECARD)

They came in this tournament with three consecutive T20I series wins vs Australia, New Zealand, and Zimbabwe but they didn't start well in this tournament.
