The Canada T20I Tri-Series 2024 will start on Saturday, September 28 2024, and will end on Thursday, October 3 2024. Maple Leaf North-West Ground(A), King City in Ontario will be the host venue for the upcoming tri-series.

A total of three teams will be participating in the tri-nations series including Oman, Nepal and Canada. The team that finishes at the top of the points table after the conclusion of six matches, will be declared as the winner.
