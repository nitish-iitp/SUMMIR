Jayden Seales {PC:X}

West Indies National Cricket Team players Jason Holder and Jayden Seales have been rewarded for their performances in the Test series against South Africa. The two teams clashed with each other in the two-match Test series, which saw Proteas winning by the margin of 1-0.

Even though West Indies lost the series, there were a lot of positives for them. One among them was young pacer Jayden Seales. The fast bowler was the shining light for his team in the two-match Test series against the South Africa National Cricket Team as he bowled his heart out in two games.

Jayden Seales' best came in the second game which took place at the Providence Stadium in Guyana. The fast bowler Jayden Seales picked 9 wickets in the match including a six-wicket haul in the second innings. He returned with his best Test figures of 6/61 and gained 13 places on the Test rankings to bag the career-best ranking of 13th place.

Apart from Jayden Seales, West Indies pacers Jomel Warrican (up two spots to 52nd) and Shamar Joseph (up 11 rungs to 54th) also made substantial gains in the ICC Test rankings for bowlers. South Africa pacer Wiaan Mulder, who picked 6 wickets, also climbed 27 spots to bag 65th place in the rankings.

On the other hand, Jason Holder was also at his best in the series with both bat and ball. The all-rounder slammed a solid half-century in the second innings of the second Test which saw him moving up to fifth behind India duo Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin on the latest rankings for Test all-rounders

South Africa all-rounder Aiden Markram also moved up two places to the 21st spot in the ICC Test rankings for the batters. Proteas wicket-keeper batter Kyle Verreynne also moved up in the rankings after his decent contributions with the bat in the series against West Indies. He climbed up spots to equal the 46th spot in the rankings.

There was also a change in the rankings of ODI for players. This comes from the recent performances of the players of the Netherlands National Cricket Team and the United States of America in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup League 2.

Netherlands National Cricket Team skipper Scott Edwards moved up 6 places in the list for ODI batters. He is now the No.26th ranked batter in the ICC rankings, thanks to the valiant half-century that he hit in the game against Canada. USA's Aaron Jones moved up 11 places to equal 56th.

Netherlands opener Vikramjit Singh also was among the players who gained some places in the ICC rankings for ODI batters. After his handy contribution with the bat in the game against the Canada National Cricket Team, he moved up 9 places to the 79th spot in the rankings.

In terms of ICC rankings for the bowlers in the ODIs, Netherlands spinner Aryan Dutt moved up 5 places and bagged the 33rd spot in the rankings. On the other hand, his Dutch teammate Paul van Meekeren moved up 18 spots to 72nd place in the ICC ODI rankings for bowlers.
