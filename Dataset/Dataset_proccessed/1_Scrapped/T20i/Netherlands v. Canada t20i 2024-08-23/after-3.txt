It has a core solid team with a mix of different experienced players spearheaded by Michael Levitt, Max O'Dowd. Dutch have the record of quick-scoring batsmanship, whereas the bowling attack is represented by Saqib Zulfiqar and Kyle Klein, who can turn out to be a real menace against any rival.

Led by Nicholas Kirton, Canada will look to bounce back after the disappointing loss against the Netherlands in the opening game of the Tri-Series. Nicholas Kirton has been the top scorer for Canada in this series with 69 runs to his name.
