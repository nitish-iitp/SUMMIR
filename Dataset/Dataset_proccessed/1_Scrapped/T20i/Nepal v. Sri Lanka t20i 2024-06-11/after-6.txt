Lauderhill washout makes life difficult for Sri Lanka and Nepal in World T20

At a rain-soaked Central Broward Regional Park, organisers have made the decision nobody wanted to hear.

Sri Lanka’s must-win game with Nepal was officially abandoned on Tuesday evening.

Tournament officials made the decision following heavy rain and flood warnings in Lauderhill, Florida, which was slated to host their first match at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.

It comes as optimism grew that teams might get on for a reduced overs fixture. Ground staff worked desperately to recover the rain-soaked Central Broward Regional Park.

The wet weather didn’t deter passionate Nepalese fans, who made their presence felt at the Florida venue.

It all but ends Sri Lanka’s hopes of progressing to the second round of the T20 World Cup and also increases the difficulty for Nepal in Group D. Both sides are still searching for their first tournament victories.

Locals will be hoping there’s more luck with the weather this weekend, with the Lauderhill ground set to host USA and Ireland on June 15.

Nepal turns their attention to South Africa, in what’s now a must-win fixture for the Asian outfit. The Proteas have already booked their ticket to the next round of the T20 World Cup.
