Sri Lanka will be up against Nepal in match number 23 of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground, Lauderhill, Florida on Wednesday, June 12. The Group D match will begin at 5:00 AM IST and 7:30 PM local time.

The Lankans are languishing in the last position in the points table in their group, with two losses from two matches. They need to win against Nepal to keep their Super 8 hopes alive. Sri Lanka have had two very poor games. They went down to South Africa by four wickets in New York and suffered a two-wicket defeat against Bangladesh. In both matches, their batting let them down pretty badly.

Nepal began their 2024 T20 World Cup campaign with a six-wicket loss to Netherlands at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas. Batting first, they were bowled out for 106. Netherlands chased down the target in 18.4 overs.
