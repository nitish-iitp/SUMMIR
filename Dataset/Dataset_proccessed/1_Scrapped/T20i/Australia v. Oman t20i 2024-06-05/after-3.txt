AUS vs OMN, T20 World Cup 2024 Highlights: An all-round performance from Marcus Stoinis helped Australia defeat Oman by 39 runs in their first match of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 in Barbados. After being put in to bat first, half-centuries from Stoinis (67*) and David Warner (56) helped Australia to 164/5 in 20 overs.

Stoinis then sparkled with the ball too, taking 3/19 as Oman were kept to 125/9. Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa and Nathan Ellis chipped in with a couple of wickets each.

Preview

Australia’s treble-charge is set to begin with their opening game in the T20 showpiece event. They might not have had an ideal outcome during the warm-up match against the West Indies but with the big guns coming back into the squad, they will surely be a top contender for the big prize.

Oman on the other hand will be looking to bounce back after the super-over loss against Namibia. Their bowling attack has been in form but it is their batting which has let them down in the previous game and they would have to rise to the challenge of going up against one of the best bowling units.

Australia (AUS) Playing XI Team

David Warner, Travis Head, Mitchell Marsh(C), Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Tim David, Matthew Wade(WK), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Ellis, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood

AUS vs OMA Live Score T20 World Cup 2024: Australia Post 164/5 v Oman

Marcus Stoinis and David Warner smashed fifties as Australia post 164/5 from their 20 overs against Oman at the Kensington Oval in Barbados.

After being put in to bat first, Australia started well with Travis Head looking to be the aggressor. The ball wasn’t coming nicely onto the bat and Travis Head departed in the third over with the score at 19. Skipper Mitchell Marsh and David Warner did try to take the game deep with some sensible strokeplay but a double strike from Mehran Khan in the 9th over came as a handy blow to the Aussies. David Warner along with Marcus Stoinis knitted a much-needed and timely partnership of 102 runs in just 64 deliveries for the 4th wicket and helped the side post a good total on board. Marcus Stoinis in particular was brilliant with the bat as he took on the bowlers and hit 6 maximums scoring and scored 67 of just 36 deliveries. Marcus Stoinis took down Mehran Khan for 4 maximums in an over and that changed the momentum completely in the favor of Aussies. David Warner too played a good hand of 56 runs. Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh struggled to get going while Glenn Maxwell departed for a golden duck. Tim David got away a couple of handy boundaries to close the innings well as the mighty Aussies post 164 runs on board.

OUT! David Warner falls to Kaleemullah as Shoaib Khan takes the catch. The bowler steams in from over the stumps and bowls a heavy short ball, dug in quite short and around off stump. The batter is rushed as he looks to thrash it away on the off side and gets it high on the bat. The ball flies down to wide long off where Shoaib Khan gets across and reverse-cups it nicely.

JUN 06, 2024
13:04 IST
AUS vs OMA Live Score T20 World Cup 2024: Stoinis Smashes Kaleemullah, AUS 149/3 (18.2)

FOUR and SIX! Marcus Stoinis smashes Kaleemullah! The first one is full and wide outside off but too wide as the batter throws his hands at it. The ball flies off the outside edge and goes over short third for a boundary. Then, the bowler bowls it full and bowls it on the off stump as Stoinis stays deep in the crease, covers the line and just lifts it dead straight. That brings up 1000 T20I runs for Stoinis as well.

JUN 06, 2024
12:59 IST
AUS vs OMA Live Score T20 World Cup 2024: Warner Reaches FIFTY, AUS 137/3 (17.2)

SIX! David Warner smashes Shakeel Ahmed for a maximum to get to his FIFTY! The bowler bowled it quick and wide of the off stump as the batter skips down the track, gets beaten in flight a bit but manages to reach for it and lift it over wide long on.

AUS vs OMA Live Score T20 World Cup 2024: Stoinis Reaches FIFTY, AUS 129/3 (16.5)

SIX! Marcus Stoinis gets to his FIFTY, in 22 deliveries, with a maximum off Bilal Khan. A poor delivery really as the bowler ends up sending down a high full toss outside the off stump. The batter stays put and just goes across the off stump before whacking the ball over deep mid-wicket. And would you believ it? The ball has smashed into one of the solar panels in the stands and has broken it as well.
