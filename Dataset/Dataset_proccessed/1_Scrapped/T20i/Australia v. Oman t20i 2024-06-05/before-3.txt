The Indian Premier League just wrapped up with a nail-biting finale, and now it’s time to turn our attention to the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup which is set to start on June 1, 2024. If you’ve opted to cut the cord and turn to online streaming options, you’ll need this T20 World Cup live streaming online free guide to know where to go. 

In addition to picking the best streaming service for you, geoblocks are another issue to take into account. By this, we mean that each streaming service hosting the T20 is restricted to a specific location. For example, Disney+ Hotstar is restricted to India only. If you’re abroad, this means you can’t access your favorite cricket streaming platform — unless you use a VPN. 

A reliable VPN like NordVPN lets you change your digital location on your mobile device, PC or streaming device and watch content securely from anywhere. Without further ado, let’s get into the streaming services and how a VPN can help you.

Where to Watch the ICC T20 Cricket World Cup

Because there are various streaming services hosting the ICC T20 Cricket World Cup, we’ve put everything together in this handy table. Scroll down to learn which ones are free. 

If you’d like to learn more about streaming Willow TV on Sling TV, check out our dedicated guide. The guide also includes a workaround for those without a U.S. payment method.

Sling TV (via Willow HD)	🇺🇸 U.S.

Where to Watch the T20 World Cup Final Live Stream

Luckily, there’s nothing to suggest that there will be any streaming platform changes for the T20 World Cup final livestream. You can just continue using your preferred T20 streaming platform (see the table above) to catch the final on June 29, 2024. The final will be held at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. 

Where to Live Stream the T20 Cricket World Cup for Free

In India, Star Sports is the official broadcaster for the T20. However, there’s great news for cable cutters: Disney+ Hotstar, an Indian streaming service, has decided to open its doors to anyone who wants to partake. Those in India with a smartphone can download the Disney+ Hotstar app to stream the T20 free of charge. 

There are a few caveats, though. First of all, this option is only available to those in India. If you’re not currently in India, you can connect to an Indian server on a VPN on your smartphone to stream the T20. 

Secondly, you can only download the Disney+ Hotstar app if your App Store (iOS) or Google Play store (Android) location is set to India. You can change your store region, but bear in mind that there may be a limit on the number of times you can do this. For example, the Google Play country change information states that you can only change your Google Play region once per year.

For this reason, it’s easiest to use an extra Apple ID or Google Play account with no subscriptions or balance if you only want to change to the Indian app store temporarily. Let’s go into why that’s the case.  

Apple ID & Google Play Store Regional Changes: Considerations

If you’ve loaded funds to your App Store or Google Play account or have paid subscriptions, changing your store region may affect your remaining balance and access to current subscriptions, and you may be asked to cancel some subscriptions. You can read the full details on the App store information and Google Play store information pages.

In addition, you’ll need to insert an Indian address and an Indian phone number to change your region. However, we noticed in the App Store that there is no SMS verification for the phone number at present. You also don’t have to add a payment method. You can simply select “none” if you don’t have or want to add an Indian payment method. 

Other free options for streaming the T20 World Cup include getting a 30-day free trial with Amazon Prime Video (Australia) or a seven-day free trial with NOW (U.K.). 

ICC T20 World Cup Live Streaming Guide

Those outside India can access Disney+ Hotstar by connecting to a virtual Indian server on a VPN and watch the the ICC T20 Cricket World Cup for free. Likewise, if you’re outside the U.S., U.K. or Australia, you can access your Sling TV, NOW or Amazon Prime Video account by connecting to a server in one of these countries. 

Subscribe to a VPN

Find your way to NordVPN’s website and sign up for one of its plans. The two-year plan is cheapest and it comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee.

Download the VPN

Download and install the VPN on your device. If you’re planning to use Disney+ Hotstar, make sure to download the VPN app on your smartphone via the App Store or Google Play store. Open the app and log in when the download is complete.

Connect to an Indian server

Connect to a server in India. If you’re using a different streaming service instead of Disney+ Hotstar, connect to a server in a country where that streaming service is available.

NordVPN started offering virtual servers in 2024, including in India.
Change Your App Store or Google Play Store Location

You’ll need to be in the Indian App Store or Google Play store for the next step. Go to your account settings and change your location to India.

Download Disney+ Hotstar

Go to the App Store or Google Play Store and download the Disney+ Hotstar app.

Start Streaming

Open the Disney+ Hotstar app (or your streaming service of choice) and start streaming the T20 Cricket World Cup.

The Best VPNs to Watch Cricket Games Online

To stream cricket securely and free of geoblocks, you need a reliable VPN service with an excellent track record for unblocking streaming services. We recommend the following services for streaming the T20 World Cup. 

India’s VPN law requires providers to log user data if they have a physical server in the country. Because of that, most providers, including our picks below, removed their physical Indian servers and now have virtual ones instead. This means you can still get an Indian IP address, but your data remains protected.

NordVPN — Based on our daily tests, NordVPN is the fastest VPN for streaming. It’s also strong in the security and privacy departments and has a virtual server in Mumbai. Our NordVPN review goes over all the pros and cons of this service. 
Surfshark — An affordable alternative to NordVPN with similar performance and features, as well as unlimited simultaneous connections. Read our Surfshark review to learn more.
ExpressVPN — ExpressVPN is a service with watertight security — ideal for those who are traveling and using public WiFi during the T20 — and a large library of server locations, including two virtual servers in India via London and Singapore. Check out our full ExpressVPN review to learn more. 
PrivadoVPN — A decent free VPN that offers 10GB of data per month. PrivadoVPN has a virtual server in Mumbai and works well with streaming services. Learn more about this VPN’s streaming capability in our PrivadoVPN review.
