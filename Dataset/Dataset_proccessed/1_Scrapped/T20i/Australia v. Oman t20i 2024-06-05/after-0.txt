Australia vs Oman Highlights, T20 World Cup 2024 Match Today: Marcus Stoinis produced a fine all-round show as Australia got off to a winning start by 39 runs defeating Oman on Thursday in Barbados in a Group B clash.

Asked to bat first, Australia were in a spot of bother at 50/3. Stoinis rescued Australia by smashing a superb 36-ball 67 to power them to 164/5 in their 20 overs. Stoinis and David Warner then stitched together a century stand with both of them crossing half centuries.

The run-chase never really got going for Oman as a collective bowling effort, led by a 3-wicket-haul by Stoinis, was enough for Mitchell Marsh’s men on the night.

Australia will be aiming for a third major trophy in one year and become the first team to hold the World Test Championships, the 50-over World Cup and the T20 World Cup simultaneously.

Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS win by 39 runs

Marcus Stoinis, player of the match: Nice start, some cobwebs for us, but good to get the win. We were just looking to try and hit the ball along the ground hard at the start. Spin was harder to face, was keeping low but the new ball was tough as well. 

09:50 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: OMA 125/9 (20 ov) - AUS win by 39 runs

Two for Starc, three for Stoinis, two for Zampa, two for Ellis. Hazlewood and Maxwell tidy as well. Proper collective effort as Australia win comfortably in the end. But credit to Oman for not making it all too easy, the Aussies were made to sweat it out on a humid night. 

09:48 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: OMA 125/9 (20 ov) - AUS win by 39 runs

For about 1/3rd of that match, Oman had Australia under pressure. The bowlers did a brilliant job, there was Aqib's absolute stunner of a catch... they'd be wondering what if that Stoinis catch was taken at long off. Because after that dropped catch, he took off big time! Including 3 more sixes in that very over. His 67 was the difference in the end on a night where most batters struggled. Came in and picked up three wickets too for good measure. 

09:45 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 123/9 after 19.3 overs (Target 165)

It's been a proper collective bowling effort, Ellis too joins in the 2+ wicket club. 

Shakeel Ahmed c David Warner b Nathan Ellis 11 (10 balls)

09:42 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 121/8 after 19 overs (Target 165)

Stoini finishes with 3/19, to go with his blistering 67 earlier in the night. 

09:41 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 117/8 after 18.4 overs (Target 165)

Stoinis has his third wicket: An all-rounder masterclass, this. A night where Stoinis has been superb with both bat and ball. Mehran's entertaining innings comes to a close. A nice juggling catch running back towards the boundary line. Really well judged. 

Mehran Khan c Tim David b Marcus Stoinis 27 (16 balls)

09:35 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 109/7 after 18 overs (Target 165)

Confirmation from the broadcast: Starc's issue tonight is cramps, nothing worse. 

09:34 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 109/7 after 18 overs (Target 165)

Mehran Khan has played some lovely shots alright. There was that straight six earlier... now a good-looking pickup shot over deep square leg off Nathan Ellis. He has had a really good all-round night too, behind only Stoinis. 

09:30 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 96/7 after 17 overs (Target 165)

Mehran with another good-looking shot, time time a four off a Hazlewood short ball. Misses another one later in the over though, gets one smack on the front of his helmet. Typical protocols done and we carry on. 

09:23 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 89/7 after 16 overs (Target 165)

Zampa finishes his spell with 2/24, an absolute ripper of a last ball that was too good for the new batter Shakeel to get any bat on. 

09:23 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 89/7 after 15.5 overs (Target 165)

Couple of sixes and out: Two slog sweeps by the lefthanded Ayaan Khan. First, Maxwell is too far in at deep midwicket and that should have been a catch. But the second, so sweetly hit. 91m six! But then Ayan mistimes another, this one top edged to Hazlewood at short fine. 

Ayaan Khan c Josh Hazlewood b Adam Zampa 36 (30 balls)

09:19 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 75/6 after 15 overs (Target 165)

This match is now likely going to meander to a finish. It's humid out there evidently, and the Aussies are sweating it out, so unlikely they will go all out to get Oman all out. Oman not really looking for any big hits. 

09:14 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 69/6 after 14 overs (Target 165)

Cameron Green is on the field and Starc is off the field, rightly so. Would have been senseless to risk it here. Maxwell will get that over. 

09:13 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 69/6 after 14 overs (Target 165)

Oooh, some concerns for Australia. Starc delivers a wide, then hobbles in his follow-through. Replays suggest it is probably a cramp, he is getting attended to. Surely not worth continuing? 

09:10 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 68/6 after 14 overs (Target 165)

Oh wow, a 11-run Hazlewood over out of nowhere. Mehran Khan with another contender for shot of the night. Solid base, lovely swing of the arms, picks up a fullish ball from Hazlewood and sends it straight down the ground for six. 

09:05 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 57/6 after 13 overs (Target 165)

Zampa won't be denied. That's a yorker any pacer would be proud of. Fired into the blackhole... and that is Zampa's 300th T20 wicket. Super achievement. 

Shoaib Khan b Adam Zampa 0 (4 balls)

09:03 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 57/5 after 12 .4 overs (Target 165)

Joel Wilson has had a bit of a shocker tonight. Gets convinced by an Aussie appeal for caught behind and eventually Wilson gives it out. But it is reviewed and overturned. 

09:01 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 56/5 after 12 overs (Target 165)

Starc thinks he has two in two as Shoaib is given out first ball LBW. But this too did not look out in real time. Starc from around the wicket and the angle was just too much. Batter saved by the review. 

08:59 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 56/5 after 11.5 overs (Target 165)

STARC STRIKES: Kail wanted to free his arms and go hard at this one outside off, but ends up slicing to Maxwell at deep point. Starc strikes on his return to the attack. 

Khalid Kail c Maxwell b Starc 8 (12 balls)

08:55 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 54/4 after 11 overs (Target 165)

At the mid-way point, ICC show magic moments and this time around it was Brett Lee's hattrick against Bangladesh in 2007, one of the standout moments of the inaugural edition. Six singles from Zampa's over. 

08:48 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 48/4 after 10 overs (Target 165)

Ayaan Khan with one of the shots of the night. Good length ball from Ellis, driven beautifully past mid off for four. 

08:40 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 38/4 after 9 overs (Target 165)

Adam Zampa time. One of Australia's X-factors in these conditions. A proper wicket-taking option. Starts off with a nice over, varying his release nicely to keep the Oman batters on their toes. 

08:36 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 34/4 after 7.4 overs (Target 165)

STOINIS HAS HIS 2ND: He can do wrong today, rinse and repeat. Hard length delivery outside off to Zeeshan, who just couldn't get going today. The left-hander throws his bat at it and his caught behind. 

Zeeshan Maqsood c Matthew Wade b Marcus Stoinis 1 (7 balls)

08:33 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 34/3 after 7 overs (Target 165)

In these conditions, Maxwell becomes a proper all-rounder for Australia. Might have been out for a first-ball duck but with turn and dryness on offer, he will be handy with his offspin. A good first over from him, just one four from him, Kail plays a lovely late cut. 

08:29 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 29/3 after 6 overs (Target 165)

STOINIS STRIKES: Stoinis can't do no wrong today. Aqib hits a lovely shot for six but a cross-seam delivery, fuller, gets the outside edge and Wade makes no mistake. 

Aqib Ilyas c Matthew Wade b Marcus Stoinis 18 (18 balls)

08:25 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 23/2 after 5 overs (Target 165)

After a lovely boundary to start their run-chase, it's been all Australia in the powerplay. Stoinis will get an over to finish the powerplay.

08:23 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 23/2 after 4.5 overs (Target 165)

ELLIS STRIKES: In his first over, after landing a few cutters, Elliis fires one in that evades Prajapathi's defence and traps him on the pads. He reviews it, but it is Umpire's Call on impact. 

Kashyap Prajapati lbw b Nathan Ellis 7 (16 balls)

08:19 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 22/1 after 4 overs (Target 165)

Another 2-run over from miserly Hazlewood. It will be Nathan Ellis from the other end. 

08:16 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 20/1 after 3 overs (Target 165)

Massive mixup in the middle and Oman should have lost their 2nd wicket. But Head with a hesitant lobbed throw that evades the stumps as well as an onrushing Wade. Maxwell gathers the throw on the other end gets the bails off but by then Aqib has made it in.

UGANDA WIN: The ICC Men's T20 World Cup debutants register their first win as they beat Papua New Guinea in a low-scoring thriller by 3 wickets. 

Full scorecard here.

08:08 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 14/1 after 2 overs (Target 165)

Typically brilliant from Hazlewood as he starts with a signature first over with four dot balls and just a couple of singles. 

08:03 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 12/1 after 1 overs (Target 165)

EVENTFUL OVER: A couple of lovely shots through the offside either side of the wicket for four. Starc thinks he has his 2nd, as Joel Wilson raises his finger, but that's got to be one of the worst on-field decisions ever. Not even close to hitting the stumps, pitching outside leg too. 

07:58 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 6/1 after 0.3 overs (Target 165)

STARC STRIKES: That a Mitch Starc classic. The ball moving into the right hander and late, it is not quite a yorker but it is a low full toss that is too good for Athavale. Not given out because there were two noises. But Australia review and it is pad first, and plumb in front. 

Pratik Athavale lbw b Mitch Starc 0 (1 ball)

07:56 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 164/5 after 20 overs

Mitch Starc will come steaming in as Oman look to chase down an unlikely 165. 

07:43 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 164/5 after 20 overs

Another life for Stoinis in that over and for all their good fielding otherwise tonight, Oman have given the big man couple of reprieves and has essentially been the difference between a manageable target and a target that looks way out of reach now. David hits another four in that over but is run out last ball as Bilal delivers a decent 20th. 

07:39 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 156/4 after 19 overs

Expensive 19th over as Tim David hits a first ball four. For all his overflowing passion on display today, Kaleemullah's over goes for 17 and he finishes with 3-0-30-1. 

07:38 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 152/4 after 18.5 overs

WARNER OUT: Kaleemullah is a passionate man alright. Some very extravagant celebrations as he gets Warner out caught off a short ball, but not before some serious damage was already done in that over by Stoinis (4 and 6 off the first 2 balls). 

David Warner c Shoaib Khan b Kaleemullah 56 (51 balls)

07:31 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 139/3 after 18 overs

A luckless Shakeel finishes his spell 0/28. A good comeback in that over after getting hit for a six early. More frustration for Warner despite the half century as he misses out on a couple of sweeps. 

07:30 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 137/3 after 17.2 overs

HALF CENTURY: It's not been the easiest of innings for Warner as timing hasn't been there but he has fought it out there. Here gets to his fifty with a six over long on off Shakeel. Just over 100 SR, but it's also been that sort of a pitch. 

07:26 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 129/3 after 16.5 overs

HALF CENTURY: He took his time, he got a life, but since then he has been ON THE CHARGE. Stoinis gets to his half century off just 27 balls. A four and six off couple of full tosses in that Bilal over. The six is off a no ball and the ball itself has gone out of the ground. Break in play to change the ball.  

07:20 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 114/3 after 16 overs

Over in Guyana, Uganda have stumbled to 27/5 in their run-chase of 78 against PNG. 

07:19 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 114/3 after 16 overs

Given the onslaught of the previous over, that was good from Shakeel. He continues to fire it in with his left-arm spin and both Stoinis and Warner struggled to put them away. Desptie a free hit off a no ball in that over, just 8 runs conceded. 

07:14 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 106/3 after 15 overs

MASSIVE OVER: HULK, SMASH. Stoinis should have been out in that Mehran over, Ayaan Khan should have taken the high catch as long off, he does actually but then falls over the boundary cushions. Bad mistake, bad bad mistake. Stoinis then smashes THREE more sixes in that over, including one that hit the roof of the stadium. 

07:10 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 80/3 after 14 overs

Chance! But a tough one perhaps. Aqib gets the outside edge off Stoinis but the deflection is too strong and the ball bounces off the gloves before Athavale knew what quite happened. 4-0-18-0 for Aqib, much better spell than those figures suggest.

Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 75/3 after 13 overs

Exactly FIVE overs since the last boundary now. The runs have dried up for Australia big time... but just then Warner comes up with the boundary that they really needed. And one brings too. Just a clever use of angles by Warner, first nudging one past short fine and then drives one through cover. Zeeshan with an expensive first over. 

07:00 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 63/3 after 12 overs

A lovely splitscreen in that over as the broadcast shows us what makes Aqib Ilyas difficult to put away. He has lovely control over both offspin and legspin, and he varies it based on the batter on strike. Perfectly on cue, a superb leg spinner to beat Stoinis outside off. And guess what, he has a googly too apart from the offspinner. What a top over! 

06:57 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 60/3 after 11 overs

Australia still have firepower to come, so Warner and Stoinis can take a little bit of time to steady the ship. Another really good over from Mehran in the meantime. 

06:56 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 56/3 after 10 overs

Oh, there was a wasted review in that previous over by the way. Warner went for a reverse, Oman wanted to check LBW, but the Aussie opener got hit on the glove. 

06:50 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 56/3 after 10 overs

Aqib doing a fine job with the ball in hand too. A tidy over and Australia are in a spot of bother midway through their innings. Warner has been joined in the middle by Stoinis. 

06:47 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 52/3 after 9 overs

Every camera angle that the broadcasters have provided have made for stunning images. Aqib, take a bow. That was absolutely remarkable. Maxi, as Haydos says on air, can't buy a run at the moment. 

06:44 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 50/3 after 8.3 overs

WOW WOW WOW! STUNNER: That is perhaps the catch of the tournament done and dusted already. Oman captain Aqib Ilyas pulls off an ABSOLUTE BLINDER at cover as Maxwell falls for a first-ball duck. Maxi timed it superbly, sweet spot of the ball but Aqib dives fulls length to his left and pulls it off. Two in two for Mehran! 

Glenn Maxwell c Aqib Ilyas b Mehran Khan 0 (1 balls)

06:42 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 50/2 after 8.2 overs

MARSH FALLS: It's a HUGE wicket for Oman as the Aussie captain falls. It was a struggle for Marsh to find the timing, kept finding the edge often even when he tried to go big. This time it's the toe-end of the bat as he hits one straight to long on. Mehran has his first of the night. 

Mitchell Marsh c Shoaib Khan b Mehran Khan 14 (21 balls) 

06:39 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 50/1 after 8 overs

Captain Aqib into the attack and a four for Marsh as he looks to get a move on.

Lovely moment on air as Warner goes past Finch to be the leading runscorer for Australia in men's T20Is. Finch is at the venue, applauds from the commentary tribune, Warner acknowledges it with a smile. And the Nasser Hussain quips on air that Finch was probably wanting Warner to be out stumped those minutes earlier. Laughs! 

06:34 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 43/1 after 7 overs

Oh dear a no ball from Mehran in his first over and the free hit is punished over point for four by Warner. But two sensational stops in that over in the field to prevent a few runs by Oman. A nervy moment for Warner off the last ball as Athavale does superbly to whip the bails off, standing up to the stumps but Warner has his backfoot grounded despite losing balance. JUST ABOUT. 

06:31 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 37/1 after 6 overs

Mehran Khan next with his medium pace, had a great outing against Namibia with 3/7. 

Meanwhile, PNG are 77 all out in the 20th over against Uganda. 

06:29 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 37/1 after 6 overs

Once again, Oman keep it to just one boundary in that over. Mitch Marsh wasn't too comfortable too as he poked at one that stopped on him from Shakeel but it was in the gap. Top over otherwise from the left-arm spinner and Oman can be quite pleased with that powerplay. 

06:25 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 32/1 after 5 overs

Was shaping into a really nice over from Kaleemullah but Warner finds the boundary off the last ball to keep the run-scoring just over 6 RPO. This is a really nice start still by Oman as they keep Australia under check on a dry surface. 

06:24 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
Australia vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: AUS 25/1 after 4 overs

Meanwhile in Guyana, Frank Nsubuga, 43 years old, with stunning figures of 4-2-4-2 for Uganda against PNG.

A week after 19-year-old Agar was pub-hopping with his Australia team-mates, he walked into his first Test with the team tottering at 117 for 9. Off the sixth ball he faced, he swivelled into a pull but the ball just about lobbed over the bowler. England seamers thought the short ball was the way to go. (ICC/X)

How psychologists, pain-scientists patched back Australia’s T20 specialist Ashton Agar to feeling OK, while cricket anchored his life

“What’s happening, mate? Am I the enemy now? I am just trying to help. You are always fighting me,” when Justin Langer, Western Australia’s coach, asked him one day in 2014, Ashton Agar broke down. “I don’t know. I have no idea. I don’t know.”

A game against Tasmania in Hobart. Agar bowled two balls, two good deliveries, but a “deep sadness” welled up in him. After another delivery, he felt a tear breaking out from his eye. He threw away the ball, got his hat from the umpire, walked out of the ground, and started to sob.

A few months prior, in 2013, not long after he stunned the cricketing world with a free-flowing 98 in the Ashes on debut as the No.11 batsman batting with his hero Phil Hughes whose poster was on his bedroom wall, before being dropped after the next Test, Agar’s life began to turn blue.
