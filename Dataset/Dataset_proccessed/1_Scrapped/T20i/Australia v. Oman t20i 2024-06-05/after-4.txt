Australia is looking to reclaim its place as the world's top T20 cricketing nation in the ninth edition of the Cricket World Cup, which is being jointly hosted by Barbados and the USA.

The Australian team will be captained by big-hitting all-rounder Mitch Marsh as part of a squad of 15 that includes Test captain Pat Cummins, opener David Warner and the two-pronged pace-attack of Josh Hazlewood and Mitch Starc.

Test stars Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne are not part of the line-up, which includes young star Jake Fraser-McGurk as the travelling reserve alongside Matthew Short.

A victory would see Australia claim the elusive triple crown of World Test Champions, ODI World Champions, and T20 Champions.

Australia's first match is against Oman on Thursday, June 6, at 10.30am (AEST).

Who's playing?

The World Cup is being co-hosted by the United States and the West Indies in Barbados.

A total of 20 nations will take part in a pool play-off system, with the likes of Australia, India and defending champions England up against minnow nations such as Uganda, Papua New Guinea and Nepal.

Every team plays one match against each opponent in their pool, meaning teams play at least four matches.

After that, the two top teams in each pool head to a "Super Eight". You can read more about the pools here.

When and where is Australia playing?

Australia's first match, against Oman, is this Thursday in Barbados.

After that, the Aussie schedule runs as follows:

June 9: Australia vs England, Kensington Oval, Barbados, 3am AEST
June 12: Australia vs Namibia, Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua and Barbuda, 10:30am AEST
June 16: Australia vs Scotland, Daren Sammy Cricket Ground/Beausejour Cricket Ground, Saint Lucia, 10:30am AEST

How do I watch it?

Every match of the series is being broadcast on subscription service Amazon Prime this year.

It's part of a new four-year deal between the ICC and the broadcaster signed last year.

"It'll be interesting to see how it grips the Australian public, with no free-to-air coverage of the tournament," former Australian cricketer Sarah Elliott said.

"I really hope that it does get great viewership and great attendance … for those US games in particular, that would be a sign of a successful tournament if it could capture more Americans."

You can listen to live coverage on ABC Radio via the ABC Listen app. ABC Sport will also be live blogging matches on the ABC News website.

What chance are the Aussies?

Australia is one of the top chances to win the World Cup, despite not making it past the pool stage in 2022 as hosts.

The Aussies are ranked second in the world when it comes to T20I rankings, just behind India, and boast top-ranked bowlers Josh Hazlewood and spinner Adam Zampa.

"Australia has every base covered," former Australian test spinner Bryce McGain said.

"Yes they didn't get out of the pool stage last year, but they learned a valuable lesson that's about run rates early in the tournament.

"Their lower order didn't realise that losing narrow is as good as getting a win in those situations … so I'm very positive about Australia's chances."

Marsh and Marcus Stoinis are two of the world's top-ranked all-rounders, and Starc comes into the series in scintillating form from the Indian Premier League.

Australia famously won its maiden T20 World Cup title in 2021 and is clearly out for redemption after a disappointing result on home soil.

Who are the nations to beat?

India hasn't won a World Cup since the inaugural edition in 2007 but will always be one of the key teams to beat.

It's the clear leader in the Mens T20I team rankings and boasts the world's top-rated batter, Suryakumar Yadav, as well as two of the five highest-rated T20 bowlers in Axar Patel and Ravi Bishnoi.

McGain said India's depth was scary.

"With everyone in their squad and even their backup players, you could just about say they could be player of the tournament," he said.

Defending champs England are again expected to display an aggressive attack, with Joffra Archer returning to a line-up that includes Phil Salt and the world's best-ranked T20 bowler, Adil Rashid.

But McGain isn't sold on the Jos Buttler-led side.

"Their form lines at the moment aren't quite where I'd like to see them in the way they're going about it," he said.

The West Indies were given a scare in their opening match against Papua New Guinea but remain one of the other highly-favoured outfits in their co-hosted series.

What if I want to support the little guy?

You want to go for the underdog, or just follow along perhaps? More power to you.

Canada is considered the rank outsider of those that qualified, with a world ranking of 23, having won its way into the pool by winning the Americas qualifier.

But it's enjoyed an inauspicious start to the tournament, going down to the USA in the opening match of the series by seven wickets.

US batter Aaron Jones is one to keep an eye on. In his opening match against Canada he whacked an explosive 94 from 40 balls including 10 sixes.

Sarah Elliott thinks the luck of the Irish could spell an upset this year.

"I always like to look at Ireland or the Netherlands," Elliott said.

McGain agrees — even going one step further.

"The Netherlands will keep continue to keep poking down big teams, they'll take down two scalps in this tournament. No question," he said.

And if you want an eye on the future, it's hard to go past the heart-breaking reason former Test opener Joe Burns will be pulling on an Italian shirt this year.
