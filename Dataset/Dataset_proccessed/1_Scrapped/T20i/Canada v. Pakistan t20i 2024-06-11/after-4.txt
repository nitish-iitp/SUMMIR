In Short
Pakistan play Canada in their next fixture
It is a do-or-die match for Pakistan in the T20 World Cup
Canada play Pakistan in New York

Babar Azam's Pakistan are on the verge of getting knocked out from the T20 World Cup 2024. After losing matches to co-hosts USA and arch-rivals India, Pakistan's campaign is in the doldrums. The team look lost for ideas with the bat, and it is only their bowling line-up that is keeping them competitive in the tournament.

Keeping that in mind, Pakistan will face Canada in their third fixture of Group A in the tournament. Pakistan not only need to win their next two matches, but need to win them by a big margin. Babar Azam and Co. will hope to shake off their terrible defeat and the calls for sacking the entire cricket team and put on a good show. Pakistan have been known to produce their best when pushed into a corner and don't be surprised if that happens once again.

Having said that, Canada are no pushovers. It has been the beauty of this World Cup, one with 20 sides that small teams, who do not play top flight international cricket throughout the year, have been able to cause major upsets. Canada are coming off a win against Ireland and who knows, they might just cause another upset on a tricky New York pitch?

PAKISTAN vs CANADA: HEAD-TO-HEAD in T20Is

Pakistan and Canada have had one match before, way back in the early days of the format. In the match, Salman Butt guided Pakistan to a 35-run win against Canada back in 2008. Shoaib Malik captained Pakistan in that game.

PAKISTAN vs CANADA: TEAM NEWS - T20 WORLD CUP 2024

No one knows what Pakistan are going to do after their embarrassing loss in the T20 World Cup 2024 vs India. It is possible that Pakistan bench Shadab Khan and Imad Wasim, who were not exactly brilliant vs India. Pakistan might bring in Saim Ayub/ Azam Khan for the fixture.

Canada, on the other hand, are unlikely to make any changes to their playing XI, having beaten Ireland in their previous match.

PAKISTAN vs CANADA: NEW YORK PITCH REPORT

The pitch in New York has been a bowlers' paradise. In India vs Pakistan, it was the first time that the New York pitch felt like a fairer competition between the bat and ball. In the first innings, the strip showed inconsistent bounce under the clouds, and after the sun came out, the pitch really slowed down, making hitting through the line extremely difficult.

Something similar can be expected on Tuesday, 11 June as well.

PAKISTAN vs CANADA: PREDICTED PLAYING XI

Pakistan Predicted XI

Babar Azam (c), Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Saim Ayub, Fakhar Zaman, Shadab Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed, Azam Khan/Abrar Ahmed, Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Amir.

Canada Predicted XI

Aaron Johnson, Navneet Dhaliwal, Pargat Singh, Dilpreet Bajwa, Nicholas Kirton, Shreyas Movva (wk), Dillon Heyliger, Saad Bin Zafar (c), Kaleem Sana, Junaid Siddiqui, Jeremy Gordon.

PAKISTAN vs CANADA: WHO WILL WIN?

It is expected that Pakistan will be heavy favourites for the match. But Canada are expected to be no pushovers either. Pakistan need to win the match by a big margin and would hope to play with some courage in their upcoming game.
