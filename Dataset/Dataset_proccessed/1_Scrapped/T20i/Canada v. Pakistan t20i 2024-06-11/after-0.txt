TOSS: Pakistan won the toss and opt to field

Babar Azam: We will have a bowl first. It is an early morning match and want to utilize the first six overs. We have one change - Saim Ayub is in. We have had a discussion and are focussed on today's game. We have a quick turnaround, we have no other option but to win this game. I have played against some of their bowlers.

Saad Bin Zafar: I would have bowled first as well. But we have seen teams have found it difficult chasing, so hopefully we can put the runs on the board. We have one change. We have been playing some good cricket and want to continue that consistency. We understand it is a must-win game for them and they are under pressure, put some runs on the board and put pressure on them.

Babar Azam and Saad Bin Zafar are in the middle.

Wasim Akram and Ebony Rainford-Brent: "Glorious day. It is going to be warm with the highest being 33 degrees. We have 70 meters on the right, 66 on the left and 73 down the ground. We are on a fresh pitch today. There is a lot of moisture in the pitch and the grass is nicely rolled in. As a team and as a bowler you would want to bowl first if you win the toss. It won't be easy and 130-135 will be a good total. You don't have to do much as a bowler and just have to bowl in the right areas. This is not the pitch to bowl slower balls, seam-up and get that lateral movement."

Pakistan vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Reactions after PAK loss to India

“They have been playing cricket for 10 years, and I can’t teach them. Rizwan has no game awareness… Iftikhar Ahmed knows one shot on the leg side. He has been a part of the team for years but doesn’t know how to bat… I can’t go and tell about the game awareness to Fakhar Zaman. Pakistani players think that if they don’t perform well, the coaches will be sacked, and nothing will happen to them. It is time to keep the coaches and change the entire team.

"There are players who don’t want to talk to each other. This is international cricket, and you play for your country. Make these players sit at home.” - Wasim Akram on Star Sports

“There is no substance in this team. Two openers, they play well. Then it is hit and miss. You can’t win big games with pseudo all-rounders,” he said on the show ‘Caught Behind.’ “In pressure situation you need specialists. We need people with big heart. The middle order of ours, have they ever won us a tournament with the bat? They have not even won matches for their franchise in Pakistan Super League (PSL). Then we were expecting them against Bumrah, that they will stand up, we are living far from the reality," - Mudassar Nazar.

Pakistan vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Shoaib Malik wants Babar Azam to quit Pakistan’s captaincy

Post Pakistans's harrowing defeat to India, former skipper Shoaib Malik has slammed captain Babar Azam and wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan. “I have been saying for a long time, please leave captaincy. You are a class player, and you will only be able to show your class when you do not have additional responsibilities on you. If Babar stays away from captaincy, it will be good for him,” Shoaib Malik said on Ten Sports.

Malik also questioned the timid approach by Babar and Rizwan at the top. “People keep talking about Babar and Rizwan’s strike rates, so you brought in Saim Ayub. Yesterday, it was a 120 chase, why were you trying to improve your strike rate yesterday? The platform was set in every manner. If as a leader and a batter, your brain does kick-in, in these sorts of situations, when will it? I am forced to say today that the core of this team, in the T20I format, I think we have to stop backing them,” Shoaib added.

Pakistan vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Welcome

Go high or go home. Pakistan are back in all too familiar waters yet again. They have broken out of jail before in spectacular fashion but this time something seems to be missing within the side. Babar Azam's uninspiring leadership has come under the scanner and the batting returns against India may haunt them for quite a while. But such is the T20 World Cup that you have little room for turnarounds. Canada are perhaps the weakest side of Group A but Pakistan cannot afford any slip-ups this time. 

Pakistan thought it was playing USA, turned out to be Team India H-1B

Pakistan's loss against the USA was not like they had lost India B. It was Pakistan losing to India H1-B. That was the popular take on Friday at Dallas where USA shocked one-time world champions Pakistan in a nail-biting Super Over finish in a group game of the World T20. With as many as six cricketers of Indian descent, most of them on temporary H1-B visas that allow companies to hire overseas employees, featuring in the historic win, the joke would be a hit in the immigrant community.

They went on to lose against their arch-rivals as well. After bowling India out for 119 in 19 overs, Pakistan was restricted to 113-7 in 20 overs in the low-scoring thriller. India’s six-run win put Pakistan, the 2022 runners-up, on the brink of a group-stage exit. (READ MORE)
