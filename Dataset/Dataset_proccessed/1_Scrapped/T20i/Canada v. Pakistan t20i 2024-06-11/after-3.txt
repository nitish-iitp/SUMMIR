T20 World Cup 2024 PAK vs CAN Highlights: Pakistan finally notched their first win of the T20 World Cup 2024 as they got the better of Canada by seven wickets in New York on Tuesday. Pakistan bowlers proved their mettle to restrict Canada to 106/7 in 20 overs. Haris Rauf and Mohammad Amir (2 wickets each), Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf (one wicket each) struck for Pakistan. Pakistan chased down the target in 17.3 overs in the T20 World Cup Group A match in New York on Tuesday. Having lost two games against USA and then against arch-rivals India, the Babar Azam-led side needed to beat Canada to have a chance to enter Super 8 phase. Even now, Pakistan would need other teams' result to go their way in order to advance. (Scorecard | T20 World Cup Points Table)

Right then, Pakistan are finally up and running in the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup but have they left it a bit too late? Only time will tell. Next up, the action continues in the tournament with a couple of exciting matches. First up, it will be Sri Lanka taking on Nepal in Florida and that contest will begin on Wednesday, 12 June at 5 am IST (11.30 pm GMT) and then Australia will take on Namibia in Antigua beginning at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT). You can join us a lot sooner though for the build-up of both those games. Till then, take care and goodbye!

!

The Pakistan skipper, Babar Azam says it's a good win and credits the boys. Says they bowled well in the Powerplay and adds once you get a good start with the ball, you can always capitalise on it further. Says that the NRR was in their mind and they aimed to finish it before 14 overs but the pitch made it a bit difficult as it was a two-paced wicket. Further adds that they will go with the same mindset for their last game and adds the pitch conditions are much improved in the Caribbean as compared to these tracks.

!

Saad Bin Zafar, the captain of Canada says that the result is a bit disappointing and they wanted to play a positive brand of cricket but it was a difficult wicket to bat early on and reckons they were 25 runs short. Mentions that the opposition bowlers bowled well and they need early wickets to penetrate the middle order which didn't happen. Adds that facing high-quality sides is a learning curve for them and applauds Aaron Johnson for his innings and reckons that the run out of Nicholas Kirton was crucial as well.

!

Mohammad Amir is the Player of the Match. He says he is really pleased with the performance and says as a bowler you need to adapt according to the conditions and got the success. Says he hit the right areas and got the desired success. Adds as a professional, you need to be ready for any situations. Says the plan was clear to set them up, and bring the ball back in which he succeeded. Ends up by saying it was an important win and another one just might help them for Super 8.

The Presentation ceremony...

!

Earlier in the game, Babar Azam won the toss and opted to field first even after seeing a total being defended in the previous two games here but it was a fresh pitch and Pakistan wanted to make the best use of it. Shaheen Afridi was far from his best yet again and it was Mohammad Amir who starred in the early stages of the innings with the ball after which a wayward Haris Rauf put together a few top deliveries and got a couple of quick wickets. The big moment was the run out of in-form Nicholas Kirton and Canada couldn't kick on. The big man, Aaron Johnson though played some delightful shots and powered the ball over the fence multiple times to notch up a fifty and propel Canada over 100 runs. Both teams will now have their eyes on the India vs USA clash as that could decide the fate of this group.

!

Canada are now in the same boat as Pakistan with just one win from 3 and with a game left to play. Their bowlers though were pretty solid throughout but simply could take enough wickets at the start of the chase. Jeremy Gordon bowled a lovely spell upfront whereas Kaleem Sana was a bit off-color and it was Dilon Heyliger who used his height well and got that uneven bounce going and picked up a couple of wickets. The spinners didn't do much damage and were dealt with quite easily by Pakistan and in the end, Canada were about 15 runs or so short on this demanding pitch.

!

A win alas for Pakistan and a pretty comfortable one at that as well. However, there were still signs of nervousness given how the previous two games panned out and Pakistan will feel they could have won the game quicker and improved that net run rate which might be crucial when the time comes. Needing 107 for the win, Pakistan started decently with a new opening duo and Saim Ayub tried to play a few positive strokes. However, he soon fell and Pakistan had a sluggish Powerplay overall. The two stalwarts, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan stitched together a vital stand and there were glimpses of some aggression from the skipper but it just didn't come off as he would have wanted. Babar got out with 24 runs still required but Rizwan stayed on and brought up a half-century. Fakhar Zaman came in and walked back with just 3 runs required after which Usman Khan came in and hit the winning runs.

JEREMY GORDON TO USMAN KHAN

DONE AND DUSTED! PAKISTAN WIN BY 7 WICKETS AND FINALLY GET THOSE TWO CRUCIAL POINTS ON THE BOARD. Angles it into the pads, on a fuller length, Usman Khan flicks it through widish mid-wicket for a brace and finishes off things positively for Pakistan. Also, quite interestingly, this is the highest run chase at this venue. Pakistan with this win have just saved themselves from a huge embarrassment and also their hopes that were swinging on a knife's edge.

Jeremy Gordon bowls it outside off on a shade fuller length, Fakhar Zaman goes for a big slash over covers but slices it up in the air.
