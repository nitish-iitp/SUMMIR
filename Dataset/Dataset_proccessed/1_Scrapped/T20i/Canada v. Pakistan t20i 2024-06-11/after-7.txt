Pakistan's Saim Ayub, right, and batting partner Mohammad Rizwan run between the wickets

Leading the pace attack of the Green Army in the must-win game against Canada, Pakistan's Shaheen Afridi leaked 11 runs in his first over at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium. However, Afridi made amends with a wicket in the final over of the powerplay as Aaron Johnson top-scored for Canada to help his side reach 30-2 in the first six overs. Veteran pacer Mohammad Amir opened the account with the new ball by removing opener Navneet Dhaliwal in his first over.

Pakistan vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: PAK vs CAN - Salim Malik castigates Imad Wasim

Pakistan vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: PAK vs CAN - Former Pakistan skipper Salim Malik claimed that Imad Wasim deliberately wasted balls against India in the T20 World Cup showdown. Pakistani batters consumed 59 dot balls as Babar and Co. were restricted to 113 for 7 by India. "You look at his (Wasim) innings and it appears as if he was wasting balls not scoring runs and making things difficult in the run-chase," Malik told 24 News channel.

T20 World Cup: Do you want Pakistan to join India in Super 8 from Group A?
Yes

Pakistan vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: PAK vs CAN - After defeating Pakistan in the blockbuster clash, Rohit Sharma’s Team India will meet USA and Canada in their remaining games of the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 co-hosted by the USA and the West Indies. Rohit and Co. are expected to top Group A. India’s arch-rivals Pakistan have lost back-to-back matches. However, Pakistan can finish second even after back-to-back defeats. To remain in the hunt for the Super 8 stage, Babar’s Pakistan will have to beat Canada and Ireland. Interestingly, Pakistan can still bridge the Net-Run-Rate gap with massive wins. The former champions would also require the USA to register losses in the remaining games. If Pakistan win the last two games and USA suffer back-to-back defeats with a total of 18 runs, Pakistan can join India from Group A for the Super Eight stage.

Pakistan vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: PAK vs CAN - Time for Pakistan to make notable changes? Afridi thinks so!

Pakistan vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: PAK vs CAN - Former Pakistan skipper Afridi feels it's high time that the crestfallen side should come up with a formula at the T20 World Cup. Afridi batted for Salman Ali Agha's return in the lineup for the Canada clash. "I think now is the time for Gary Kirsten and Babar Azam to make some changes. I would like to see Salman Ali Agha come into the side in place of Usman Khan and Abrar Ahmed to come in for Shadab Khan," Afridi told ICC. He also feels Babar should make way for Fakhar at the top.

Pakistan vs Canada Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: PAK vs CAN - Legendary Pakistani pacer Shoaib Akhtar showed no mercy on Babar's Pakistan side after India outplayed the Green Army in the epic low-scoring encounter of the T20 World Cup. “I think I should have a template text ‘disappointed and hurt’ automatically set to be posted,” Akhtar said. “We should give credit to Pakistan, they tried their best to lose this game, I could not think any other way,” Akhtar added. The Rawalpindi Express asserted that he already predicted the downfall of the Green Army against India. “It was run-a-ball, nobody asked you to hit and do anything stupid. Shocking, surprised, disappointed, but that was expected.”
