Sri Lanka and Afghanistan are all set to lock horns against each other in the first T20I of the three-match series in Afghanistan tour to Australia 2024. The riveting battle is poised to take place at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium.

The Lankans outclassed the Afghans in the only Test and the ODI series and will also be eager to establish firm domination by winning the T20I series. On the flip hand, Afghans will be eager to get the first win of their ongoing tour.

Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium Pitch Report:

The cricket track at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in Dambulla predominantly favours batters, providing them with favourable conditions. The pitch offers significant turn and bounce, making it particularly conducive to spinners expected to be more effective in exploiting these conditions. Teams winning the toss at this venue often opt to bowl first, as the nature of the pitch suggests that bowlers might find advantageous opportunities to restrict the opposing team’s batting performance.
