After the poor performance of the Pakistan national team in the World Cup 2023, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) took drastic measures by sacking the entire coaching staff.

Babar Azam was forced to resign from his captaincy position, and Shaheen Afridi and Shan Masood were given the responsibility to lead the team.

Mohammad Hafeez, who was signed as the director for four years, also faced the axe from the PCB after the Pakistan team failed in Australia and New Zealand.

Additionally.Haris Rauf, the fast bowler who refused to play a Test match in Australia, has been removed from the central contract and is banned from participating in foreign leagues until June.

Prior to these changes, Ramiz Raja was removed from the chairmanship, followed by Najam Sethi and Zaka Ashraf.The PCB is currently embroiled in arguments with players regarding their participation in franchise leagues.

The tumultuous state of Pakistani cricket has led to significant restructuring within the organization as they strive to improve their performance on the international stage, but the results have not met the PCB’s expectations.
