According to Sri Lanka’s T20I captain, Wanindu Hasaranga, the team stands as a formidable force among the global bowling elite. Hasaranga made this assertion ahead of the inaugural T20I encounter in a three-match series against Afghanistan.

Both teams are scheduled to participate in six T20Is each prior to the T20 World Cup slated for June this year, with this ongoing series being a pivotal element, comprising three of these crucial encounters. The T20 series is poised to kick off on Saturday, February 17th, marking a significant milestone in the team’s preparations for the prestigious global tournament.

In Hasaranga’s words, “If you look at world cricket, we’re one of the best teams in terms of bowling outfits. If you look at the rankings, myself and Maheesh [Theekshana] are in the top 10. Dushmantha Chameera was unlucky with his injury, otherwise he’d also be here. But in his place, we have Binura [Fernando] who has come in, and there’s also Matheesha [Pathirana] and Nuwan Thushara. We know how good those two are. Dilshan Madushanka is also there.”
