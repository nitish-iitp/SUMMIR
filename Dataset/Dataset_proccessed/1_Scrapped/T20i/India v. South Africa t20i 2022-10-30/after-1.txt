IND lose their 1st Match at The T20 World Cup 2022

Well, it wasn't India's day today. They missed quite a few chances on the field and weren't good with the bat either. Say whatever you want, the batting collapses are a reality and they have to find a way to tackle it.

South Africa, on the other hand, put up a great show. They were great with the ball and reasonable with the bat in hand. Looks like one of the most complete teams of the tournament so far.

The team will next face Bangladesh on November 2. Until then, this is Kartik Mehindru, signing off.

The Final Over
Dot ball to start. Bhuvi strikes Parnell on the pads and he had no clue where the ball went after that.
A single. Just a wee bit short and Parnell just nudges it to steal a quick single.
Four. Short ball and it flies over the keeper. The luck hasn't been on India's side today.
Another 4 and South Africa win by 5 wickets.

Ashwin's 18th over
Bowls full and Miller sends the ball flying back for a maximum. 
Bowls wide, Miller stands his ground and launches it over long-on for a six.
Bowls one with much more pace and Miller gets a single.
OUT! Ashwin strikes Stubbs on the pads and SA lose half their side. Is it too late now?
Dot Ball. Ashwin pulls his length back a bit and the batter cannot connect. 
Bowls one faster through the air, and strikes Parnell on the pads.

Equation: 32 runs | 24 balls

Well, Arshdeep is here to bowl his last over. The equation is pretty simple for South Africa and an easy one too. IND will have to bowl out of their skin to defend this. But this is exactly what this World Cup has stood up for. Absolute magic. Can India churn one up today?

Pandya Strikes; Markram departts

Hardik Pandya is the man. He gets the much-needed breakthrough and India can still believe. They can, right?

SA Well On Course

South Africa are way ahead now. If India doesn't get quick wickets, this could be over pretty quickly.

Dinesh Karthik walks out; Pant replaces him

Looks like Dinesh Karthik is suffering from a cramp and is out the ground. Rishabh Pant replaces him.

Big Over For SA!

Ashwin goes for plenty on the 14th over - 17 runs. The match is slowly shifting in SA's favour. India need quick wickets now. Both Miller and Markram have started to tee off now. 

Can they stage a turnaround?

Poor Fielding From India

At least 3 run-out chances and a catch - This is what India have missed in the field today. Poor fielding today, and that might cost them the game in the end.

Virat Kohli drops Markram

Mad scenes in Perth. Virat Kohli has just dropped a sitter, and Markram gets a lifeline. Ashwin was the bowler and he can't believe what he has just seen. The crowd cannot believe it. Will this be the game-changing moment?

Bad Over For India

Hardik gives away 16 runs in the 11th over, and that might get the SA batters going. Poor over, and it also came at the wrong time. A couple of tight overs from here on would have choked the SA line-up.

OCT 30, 2022

SA: 40/3 (10)

South Africa are in no way close to what they would have liked at the halfway mark. India have bowled brilliantly well and the SA batters have had no answers, to be honest. They would want to attack now though. Will they be able to pull this off?

IND Lose Review

It looked plumb in real-time. Shami struck Miller on the pads. The umpire said no. Rohit Sharma reviewed but turns out Miller edged it first.

SA: 24/3 (6 Overs)

South Africa are off to a poor start. A poor powerplay for them and it is exactly what India needed. It is going to be an interesting contest going ahead. Who will come out on top? Stay tuned!

Another One Bites The Dust!

Mohammed Shami comes into the attack and sends back the South African captain. The Porteas are in deep trouble now.

IND off to strong start

What a start it has been for the Men in Blue. They have absolutely nailed their plans and SA batters are having a tough time out there. 3 overs are done, they are two down with just 9 runs on board. Dream start for India.

OCT 30, 2022

Arshdeep, You Beauty!

What a player. What a man. Arshdeep Singh has sent back two of the most prolific SA batters. QDK and Rossouw are back in the hut and SA are hurting. They are hurting bad. 

OCT 30, 2022
6:25 PM (IST)

QDK Departs!

Here he is. Arshdeep it is. Look at him go. Look at the entire team go. India are off to a banger. The dangerous QDK is back in the hut.

South Africa come out to bat

The South African pair of Temba Bavuma and Quinton de Kock have walked out to bat. It will be Bhuvneshwar Kumar to start the proceedings for India. The men in blue need early wickets to defend this.

IND finish with 133

Well, Sky fell just before the last over and that meant India finished 10-15 runs less than what they would have liked. It's still a fighting total though. SA will need to bat well to get it. 

Can India defend 133? Be back in a while. Stay Tuned!

Sky falls; Can IND reach 140?

Suryakumar Yadav is back in the hut. Up to Shami and Bhuvi now to add another 10-15 runs to India's kitty. Can they?

OCT 30, 2022

Ashwin falls - 11 Balls To Go...

The key here would be to allow Suryakumar to bat for as many balls as possible. India still need 20-25 runs to consider themselves safe.

OCT 30, 2022

3 Overs To Go

18 more balls to go. How much more can India get? To be honest, it all depends on how Sky performs. Indian fans would be keeping their fingers crossed.

Karthik Departs

Another wicket for South Africa. Just when it looked like India were gaining control, Parnell comes back to get SA back in the game. Well, were they even ever out?

SKY on the go!

Well...well..well... Suryakumar Yadav says, 'Mein Hoon Na'.

What an innings. Team in pressure. Big match, big stage and he delivers and how? Still, a lot to do though. Can he keep up the good work?

Suryakumar Yadav - Can He Be The Game Changer?

Well, Sky is looking good in Perth. He has raced away to 40 off just 26 and if he can keep up the momentum, IND will find themselves in safe waters at the halfway mark.

Can IND fightback?

India now have 70-odd runs on the board. Can Sky and Dinesh Karthik continue the good work and take India to a total where the bowlers can have something to defend? 

Interesting passage of play coming ahead.

IND: 60/5 (10)

Well, South Africa are in total control. No two ways about it. India have lost half their side in 10 overs and it is upto Suryakumar Yadav to get them to a big total. Dinesh Karthik too needs to up his game. Can they?

IND lose half their side

Hardik Pandya bites the dust. India have no clue what has hit them and South Africa are on an absolute roll. What a day they are having. India need at least 130-140 on board to pose any kind of threat. Can they get there?

Deepak Hooda Gone!

Another one bites the dust. Hooda follows Kohli and India are in trouble now. South Africa stirring up a storm in Perth.

Virat Kohli out caught!

Big wicket for India. Virat Kohli is a goner. Lungi Ngidi is bowling a dream spell here. India in trouble. Another wicket off a short ball. Kohli tries to take it on but mistimes it, the ball takes the top edge and flies over to fine leg where Rabada takes a good catch.

Rahul Fails Again!

KL Rahul departs. Another failure for the Indian Vice Captain. Things are starting to get a little shaky for him now. Fans won't be happy. A certain Rishabh Pant is waiting in the wings.

Rohit Departs

Well, there it is. SA draw first blood. Ngidi goes short, Rohit takes him on, mistimes it, makes a meal out of it, and Lungi grabs a sitter. 

Kohli walks in.

IND off to sedate start

Well, India are off to a sedate start. It was expected though. The pitch has aided seamers. 4 overs are done for and India will be pretty happy that they haven't lost a single wicket. South Africa, on the other hand, would have liked at least a scalp to show off for their great bowling.

9 dot balls and a 6

Well, the heading explains it. 

SA bowled 9 straight dot balls, and then Rohit Sharm took on Rabada's short ball to send it sailing over long leg for a maximum. Quite a contrasting start this from India.

WHAT. AN. OVER.

Win The Toss, Win The Match?

Well, the toss at Perth will be important, but it won't really dictate the end result. Seamers of both sides are expected to get help throughout and especially in the first 6 overs. It will all come down to which side bats better. 

No side, however, would want to chase more than 140 or 150 on this pitch.
