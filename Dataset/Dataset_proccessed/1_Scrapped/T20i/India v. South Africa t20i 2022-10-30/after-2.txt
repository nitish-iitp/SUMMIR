Temba Bavuma, the captain of South Africa says they wanted them to bat with intent after the break and that was the talk and things did go their way and it changed the momentum. Adds except for him, everyone is in good form. Adds they have seen games here and had decided what to bowl here and they backed their execution and it came off for them. Ends by saying it is important to keep improving and that is exactly what they are doing.

Rohit Sharma, the skipper of India says 130 was not going to be an easy target but David Miller and Aiden Markram played really well. Admits they were not at their best in the field. Mentions they thrive on their fielding but it was not at their best, they now need to keep their heads high and learn from this game. End by saying Miller was brilliant.

Lungi Ngidi, MAN OF THE MATCH, says it's nerve-wrecking when the game goes so close but happy with the win. Adds it is a dream to help his country and tells he will cherish this moment. Reckons he watched a lot of matches here and he figured out how to bowl then. Tells that after the halfway mark, the game shifted their way.

... PRESENTATION TIME ...

Earlier in the day, after electing to bat, India were in all sorts of trouble as they were five down in no time. Suryakumar Yadav played a brilliant knock to take his side to a decent total on a wicket which was not easy to bat on. South Africa too found it difficult against the new ball. Markram and Miller took their time, conditions eased off and as the game went ahead, they cashed in and took their side over the line.

India were brilliant with the new ball! The likes of Arshdeep, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammad Shami bowled brilliantly first up. They had pushed South Africa completely on the back foot but the likes of Ravichandran Ashwin and Hardik Pandya were not upto the mark. They leaked far too many runs. More than the bowling, it was the Indian fielding which was very disappointing. They missed a lot of chances which they should have taken and in the end, the chances which were not taken cost them.

That is a strong, strong, win for South Africa! They move to the top of the table. A brilliant knock from David Miller, he has taken his side home in the very last over. An outstanding effort from him. South Africa were in deep trouble after the first half of this innings. They lost three in no time earlier on. Miller and Markram then steadied the ship but the task was still a stiff one. They needed over 9 per over heading into the last 10 and after the break, they stepped on the gas. Markram took the attack to the bowlers and Miller was happy to play second fiddle. They managed to find boundaries and the partnership between the two flourished. They added over 70 in no time and took their side to the brink of victory. It came a lot closer than they would have liked as they lost Markram and Stubbs in quick succession but Miller kept his cool and took his side over the line.

19.4 overs (4 Runs)
A huge roar from Miller as he hits the winning runs. Length ball, outside off. Miller knocks it through point for a boundary. SOUTH AFRICA WIN BY 5 WICKETS.

19.3 overs (4 Runs)
FOUR! SCORES LEVEL! Short and down leg. Miller looks to pull but gloves it over the keeper and into the fence.

19.2 overs (1 Run)
On a length and outside off. Wayne Parnell punches through covers for a single. Miller on strike.

19.1 overs (0 Run)
Dot ball to start! Length ball on the pads. Wayne Parnell tries to flick with soft hands, looking to give the strike to Miller but it rolls straight to point.

18.6 overs (0 Run)
Goes short now, outside off. Miller misses his pull and is livid with himself. 6 runs needed in 6 balls.

18.5 overs (1 Run)
Just a single! on a length and outside off. Wayne Parnell cuts it late to third man for one.

18.4 overs (1 Run)
Yorker way outside off. Miller squeezes it out to point for one. Wayne Parnell has to swing his bat here.

18.3 overs (0 Run)
Bluff ball from Shami! Goes for the yorker, on leg. Miller gets an inside edge as he looks to flick. No run.

18.2 overs (0 Run)
This is on a length and outside off. Miller misses his cut this time.

18.1 overs (4 Runs)
FOUR! INTO THE FENCE! 8 needed now! A bit of width, outside off and Millers cuts it hard through backward point for a boundary. Fifty up for Miller but another 8 runs could help him celebrate with much more relieve.

17.6 overs (0 Run)
Angling on the pads. Wayne Parnell misses his flick. It rolls to square leg but David Miller wants to keep the strike. 13 runs off the over. 12 needed of 12.

17.5 overs (0 Run)
Flatter, quicker, outside off and this one skids through. Wayne Parnell looks to cut but misses.

17.4 overs (0 Run)
OUT! LBW! TWO REDS! Tristan Stubbs is given out LBW and he reviews it straightaway. This is full and on middle, carrom ball. Stubbs looks to reverse sweep but misses and gets hit on the pads. Ultra Edge shows no bat. Ball Tracking shows umpire's call. The on-field decision stays. Stubbs has to go. He could have hit down the ground but played all over it.

17.3 overs (1 Run)
Quicker, shorter and on middle. Miller works it to point for a single.

17.2 overs (6 Runs)
SIX! Yup, clearly not working! Two in two! Ashwin against Miller! The game ain't working. Fuller and outside off. Miller launches it high over long off for a biggie.

17.1 overs (6 Runs)
SIX! Already the move isn't working for India! Six to start the over. Tossed up on middle. Miller stays back and thumps it straight down for a biggie. 19 runs needed in 17 balls.

16.6 overs (0 Run)
Outside off, length. Stubbs hits it straight to point. Ravichandran Ashwin still has an over left but looks like it will be the final over. No, a gamble from Rohit Sharma as he gives the ball to Ashwin. Interesting!

16.5 overs (1 Run)
On a length and outside off. Miller punches it to sweeper cover for a single.

16.4 overs (1 Run)
Outside off, guided to third man for a single.

16.3 overs (4 Runs)
FOUR! This is what Stubbs is known for! Just be aggressive! Short and on middle. Stubbs gets on top of the bounce and pulls it to deep mid-wicket. KL Rahul runs from long on and dives but in vain.

16.2 overs (0 Run)
On a length and on middle. Stubbs punches it to point.

16.1 overs (1 Run)
A slower length ball on middle. Miller nudges it to square leg for one more.

15.6 overs (1 Run)
On middle, this is hit to deep mid-wicket for one.

15.5 overs (1 Run)
Length and on middle. Stubbs tucks it to mid on for a single.

15.4 overs (0 Run)
OUT! TAKEN! Markram goes after a well-made fifty! A much needed wicket for India! Is that a chance for them to get back in the game? Short of a length and on middle. Markram is cramped for room as he pulls, not off the middle and only gets elevation on it. Suryakumar Yadav at deep square leg settles under it and takes it.

15.3 overs (2 Runs)
TWO MORE! On a length and around off. Markram pulls it wide of deep mid-wicket for a brace. 100 up! 34 needed in 27 balls.

15.2 overs (1 Run)
Keeps it short and on middle. Miller plays it late to short third man for one.

15.1 overs (2 Runs)
Short in length, outside off. Miller dabs it to third man for a couple of runs. Good running.
