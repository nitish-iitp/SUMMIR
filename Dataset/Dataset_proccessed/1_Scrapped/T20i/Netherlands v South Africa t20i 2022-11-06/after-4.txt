South Africa lost to Netherlands by 13 runs on Sunday
South Africa looked like on the most complete teams in the T20 World Cup
Bavuma summed up their poor outing against Netherlands in his final T20 World Cup 2022 appearance

A shell-shocked Temba Bavuma could not believe South Africa's fate in the T20 World Cup after they were knocked out in the Super-12 stage of the tournament, courtesy of a loss to Netherlands on Sunday, 6 November. Chasing 159 in their final match of the Super-12 stage, SA lost by 13 runs, causing one of the biggest upsets of the tournament. Primed to reach the semi-finals after dominating the group, South Africa failed to win their final 2 matches of the Super-12 resulting in their knockout.

South Africa vs Netherlands: Report

Speaking after the defeat, Bavuma said that it was a tough pill to swallow and rued getting knocked out despite putting in strong performances in the tournament.

"This is a tough pill to swallow. I mean we had a great team and performance. We had the belief to get into the playoffs, but we couldn't. We can look at all the performances and winning the toss and bowling first in hindsight was wrong. We tried our best with the ball. The batting let us down and as a whole, we are just shell-shocked at the moment. Credit to the Netherlands, they used the conditions and the bigger boundaries better than we did. We will seriously have a look at ourselves and see where we can improve. Just shocked."


South Africa were looking primed for a top of the table finish in Group 2, but things went out of their hands in the final two matches of the tournament after they lost to Pakistan and now the Netherlands in back to back matches. Proteas were in high spirits after they sealed an incredible win against India but non-performances from a few individuals in their team led to their downfall.
