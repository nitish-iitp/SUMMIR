Chris Dehring is at it Again



So Scotland and Ireland flogged the West Indies and kicked us to the curb. Cue the outrage and the bay for the blood of the Cricket West IndieWith Chris Dehrings president, board members, executives, selectors, coach and players. As if governance, management, selections or batting application are the root causes of the latest episode of an ever-downward, spiralling saga of indignity.

We saw it coming years ago. We tried to stop it but were ineffective and helpless. So we will swap out the personnel and try again with the promise of a new beginning. And they too will falter. If I have said it once, I have said it a thousand times. West Indies cricket, that glorious institution we rightly adore, is a beautiful idea whose time has passed. I shake my head at the tattered remains to which I gave a dozen years of my life, those stadiums standing as testimony to wasted, useless, pitiful efforts. Like any product whose useful life is over, it is time to be reinvented or shelved.

There is, to state the obvious, no nation called "the West Indies". No national team can compete in the modern paradigm of professional sports without a national production line, structure and most importantly, resources. But Caribbean governments can't justify investing in this institution without obvious national or political benefit to be derived. Neither is there a proper professional cricket infrastructure. We have a semblance of one, but there is no managed production line from kindergarten to the pros. Every other country playing international cricket has one or the other, or both. They are able and have invested greater resources than us over the past 30 years and it is paying off.

The resource gap is mammoth and only growing larger. We scoff at Ireland beating us because of ignorance. Ireland has the second-highest gross domestic product (GDP) in Europe and is a full Test playing member of the ICC, not the "associate" that they, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh once were. They have centrally contracted professional cricketers and a first-class league. They have beaten Pakistan, England and us before, and will cause one or two more jitters in this tournament for sure. They are ranked 12th and West Indies seventh. To give a football comparison, would we be so shocked if 12th-ranked Croatia beat seventh ranked Spain in the Football World Cup. Don't underestimate the rise of the sport in other countries through their investment, even as our own lack thereof sends us sliding. No one argues that Manchester City, Real Madrid or indeed, Ireland, have that clear resource advantage in football. Perhaps the aberration of WI cricket dominance in the past and the occasional flicker of hope, blinds us to reality.

The time is up for the West Indies experiment.

It is an affront to tell a cricketer who has done all the hard work and struggled to make it to the top to represent their country of birth that that is not enough, that that is not the pinnacle, that they still can't compete internationally.

The professional era of cricket, the late 1970s was responsible for turning the WI into battle hardened professionals, men who recognized what it took to dominate international sport. Case in pint, I remember reading Fire in Babylon and Andy Roberts said that they couldn't figure out how to dismiss Greg Cappell at all. During WSC, roberts noticed how susceptible chappell was to the short ball early in his innings, and used that template to make his remaining encounters with the WI extremely uncomfortable, i think with just a century to show for it. The professional era also set parameters on how long the WI could remain relevant.

The WI, being poor of resources(mostly) and economically, had to remain winning in order to continue attracting the sponsorships and TV deals that would make the product sustainable. We know we could not win forever but the terminal decline in quality teams has been a distinctly west indian phenomenon. It was up to the WICB to understand that their sole currency in international cricket was performance. They never put in place any system to ensure that quality players kept on being produced so the WI could remain relevant. When they finally attempted something of an academy, WI had already been in freefall with only ambrose, walsh and lara holding a rickety ship together. And that academy was widely panned for being substandard and totally unfit for purpose. While the WI were winning, they were more concerned with trying to make their favorites captain and generally being a less than useful body that somehow always complained about money despite Sky and TWI broadcasting series from the region while we were still the best team in the world, the best cricketing product.

So while we can complain about having depressed economies and limited resources, the WI situation wasn't in fact totally dependent on the whims and trends of the global economy. Its one of my biggest problems with the West Indian psyche. We focus so much on our obstacles that we don't see what we can do to help our situation. And this problem is not limited to cricket. Its a problem with the West Indian society

I am a bit puzzled and maybe I am reading Dehring wrong.

This ultra nationalism sounds very Trumpish. In the past west indians from whichever island celebrated Hasley Crawford, Ottey all the way down to Bolt, Shelly and Elaine. They also Celebrated Sobers, Worrell, lloyd, Richards Lara down to Gayle. The scenes of all the British west indians at the Oval in 1976 didn't care who was from which island

Fantom 2022-11-05 23:43:36 

Dehring understands the problem but his solution is quite simplistic and just plain wrong.

I believe the poster openning has the germ of a solution which is simply - the national boards must must perform development work within their territories to produce competent cricketers. Governments can help with that for their own social cohesion and territorial development. Simply put, that is not a CWI role. Their role should be focused on maximizing the profit potential of the sport in the region for all stakeholders.

CWI must be reformed. There is no need to abolish the West Indies cricket team. One possible part of a comprehensive solution is to capitalize a properly organized entity with professional management and governance through an initial public offering (IPO). The national boards could have one or maybe two representatives on a properly constituted governing board with no veto power.

A lot of work, including the development of a strategic plan would have to be done. Some of that work, I believe, has been done through Patterson and Wehby and other reports.

yeah....i mean look at the situation with Desmond Haynes. Dessie was the last of the Packer West Indians after Viv, ,Maco, Greenidge and Dujon retired in the year 1991.Dessie was an established WI legend and at the time, the holder of the most centuries in odi cricket. Richardson was the best batsman on the team after viv, i accept. But he barely had any captaincy experience, little or no reference for any adjudicator to say that, yes, this would be a good successor to viv. In addition, to having the respect of every West Indian, Dessie was the best tactician in international cricket at the time, rivaling even Viv.

But somehow, the WI decided(because i think Dessie was his own man and because he was a packer player, thus someone who could not be pressured or bullied) to pick Richardson. Richardson didn't have the personality to get the best out of his players. We won because ambrose and walsh were peaking, lara and adams were young and hungry, and dessie and richardson were desperate to keep the unbeaten run going. But i can guarantee you, if Haynes had been captain, carl hooper would not be averaging in the 30s. Dessie would have made sure that he understood that his performances weren't good enough. I remember watching a 1989 documentary about David Gower about three years ago. Its still on youtube btw. He sad when he was playing for Leicester as a young turk, Ray Illingworth was his captain and hhe said that that Illingworth was the captain responsible for purging him of the most damaging amateur instincts and tendencies. Reason i mention gower is because, in terms of effortless talent, he and hooper are contemporaries. Anyways, Hooper never struck me as aloof and arrogant(unlike de icon), and i say this as an outsider looking in, but I always thought he was someone who could be molded. I am positive Haynes could have mentored hooper to be a more consistent player. Not having Haynes as captain created a leadership vacuum where other boards tried to exploited. As early as 1994, you had some crazies in Trinidad crickert saying Lara should be captain. And that is because while Richardson could be called the captain of the cricket team, he wasn't the undisputed leader like how clive and viv were, as his appointment had come from left field and had surprised even his own countrymen.

VoopsandOut 2022-11-06 00:45:49 

if Dehring is proposing that JA should go along, it may very well be that he believes that the JA brand is stronger than the WI brand and so likely to be more profitable for those who will be marketing the team. it is really sad that the British have been able to divide up these islands that have a common history, economies and culture and that the legacy of this division is able to continue more than 50 years after the Brits substantially departed from the region after the Federation. The distance between two points in most states of America is longer than that between Guyana and Jamaica yet we dont get the accentuations of the differences as much as we do here. There are other archipelagic states in the world that have poorer economies than ours and greater distances between them, yet there is report of that frequent emphasis on what divides rather than what unites. West Indies cricket is one of our gifts to the world. if there are those among us that want to stop that, so be it. It will probably be their loss because if cricket is turned into a purely profitable enterprise, rather than a cultural expression, it becomes open to takeover by those whose pockets are deeper. Jamaica is well aware of this from the takeover by Trinidadians of many of its indigenous financial services and other companies in the recent past. It may well turn out that Jamaica cricket is Jamaican in name only but run for the profit of others. I would not want that for Jamaica or for any of us.

Hmmmm!!! Chris Dehring has got here an excellent problem identification here.

I am not enamored by his solution...

My perspective is this: The satellites of CWI have got to undertake the responsibility of all cricket development (micro level) with consistent monitoring and evaluation done by the parent body. CWI needs to develop and implement severe disincentives to ensure compliance by these satellites.

It is also imperative that the governing structure of CWI needs to change to reflect an organisation that is geared towards achieving positive results with greater agility and efficiency.

A role has also got to be found for CARICOM in the grand scheme of things.

Has the private entity found solutions to our cricket problems? You cannot ignore one of your big stakeholders who are acutely aware of the importance of the game to the region.

No wonder "Jamaica wants to go it alone"...and from a position of intransigence by CWI I'll support them. Jamaica has no other choice in the face of not finding cricketing solutions.

There is a social and general societal breakdown in the region and this is spilling over into every area of the Caribbean

So even though a limitation of resources is an obvious concern we have to remember that the leaders and players we elect and

Chris, as he has always done, saw the issue solely through dollars and cents. I am not saying that that isn't a factor, it is undoubtedly.

Jamaica has not begun to realize its full potential in many venues of life..
REASON: lack of leadership from those in charge..Politicians foremost among them.
The country has become a basket case of violence and wickedness ,corruption and
general criminality is at the forefront.

There is too much unnecessary suffering even where there is progress and prosperity
and developments. The lower ranked Jamaicans are left out as progress is now geared
to the upper class more abundantly and toe foreign interests, both corporate and private
but the majority of the population are not benefitting as they should and after 60 years
of self rule it is a stark indictment of all in leadership in ll spheres.

Yet a good foundation was set in the mid50s when the PNP under NW Manley embarked on
a social /educational and agricultural /industrial revolution in preparation for Self Rule.
Sadly it was the other party which never spout or fully support the Self Rule path set in
1938, that had the grip on power to lead the lead the first 10 years of Independence.

They fumbled the ball and Jamaica has never recaptured the vision of a great future.
In fact it was only yesterday that I read that the current PM admitted that one of the Foundational planks
was NWM's ...only now after they did everything to destroy,change and shackle the solid foundations.
Only a few JLP leaders did good and significant things..Lightbourne,Allen in education were such; and
only a few others such as 'man a Yard embraced practical and good vision to the people's benefit.
But none was Prime Minister.
It is still fremarkable that with all the violence and wwide spread negative behaviour ,that Jaamaica enjoys such a healthy
tourism product although the benefits are not as substantial to the people's development or advance.
Crime does pay. But for whom ?

Perhaps I am too harsh but when so many of the nation's talent have and are seeking to leave...teachers,doctors and other professionals
then the country is on the brink of being a failure. There are nearly 3 million of us Abroad
almost the same as those on the Land .
Ironically it is us same 'same foreign citizens' who are propping up significant developments with remittances which are probably now No2 in
foreign exchange earnings.
Yes Jamaica can and should have been doing much better. But despite all the problems ,the indomitable spirit of fortitude and ambition has seen
significant contributions from those who embark in sports and the arts,music included on the international scene.

Pity we have no politician that can rise to any stature,internationally...


The value systems that older generations grew up with and strived, no longer exists.
Same can be said to a lesser extent of our Eastern Caribbean brothers too.
So when the head of the stream is murky, the rest of it will flow the same.

I could go on but I better stop at this point except to say that a country cannot be developed unless the people are first developed
and take of the development rather than reliance on foreign interests.That is the main rub missing in Jamaica.
Develop the people,individually and collectively and that will certainly reduce if not eradicate most of the negatives in the land.

Sports..track and field ,soccer has shown what can be achieved globally if the people,starting from the young are channelled to achieve
in positive ways.

Any people who do not know of or have snow who can reach the Olympics in bob sledding ice sports and achieve fame, can achieve anything.Just tell a Jamaican
he can't do something..and he will do it. Special people who lack top notch leadership but CAN achieve on their own because they have the will
to do so.
Cricket ? They can do it on the international scene too with time ;just tell us we can't

representing the West Indies doesn't produce in one's soul national pride. a major factor when up against it when facing stronger opposition. Holland beating South Africa, fine example. the dutch played quite a few internationals and gelled. Taking their regular beatings but the common goal was in vision because of national pride. Jamaica would eventually get there if the program is set but the JCA aint build for that kinda thing.

Something though, is very wrong with WI cricket, I went to see one of the recently played 20/20 games at Bina against NZ


i went to two of the games. Complete apathy. Empty stands. George Headley stand had this massive tarpaulin and was not used. As a kid in the 80s, Sabina was packed on a Saturday or Sunday.

I think the younger folks really dont care. they dont SEE the West Indies dominating cricket. they dont see greenidge making a double century and us scoring 340 in less than a day to beat England. The dont see WI making 186 in the last session to beat india. Jamaica dominates at track, and they like Raheem Sterling, so thats what they gravitate to. If you are a politician, why invest in infrastructure?

Yagga 2022-11-08 00:27:20 

In reply to Walco

I am not simply suggesting Jamaica to “go it alone” or the “break-up of WI cricket” as an objective. I believe the core problem WI cricket faces, a lack of resources, is so massive and fundamental that a total rethink is needed on this institution we all love called WI cricket in order to have a chance of saving it. The downward spiral over the past 30 years despite a few glimmers of hope from time to time is self-evident and it will continue unless addressed.

So we need to start with what the core problem is, a comparative lack of resources. What are our options?

We simply don’t have the financial market to compete with the better resourced countries with their lucrative TV markets. One key area is an absence of a coordinated national programme, funded by national resources and infrastructure from elementary through to high school and pros. That intrinsic problem exists because there is no “nation” called the West Indies. It prevents any Caribbean government from investing in WI cricket from top to bottom, or a WICB or CWI from coordinating a “national” programme. The Caribbean governments once pledged to financially support WI cricket with an annual stipend. I recall only Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago paid the first tranche, and that was the end of that.

One possible solution might be if the individual countries competed at the international level in T20 where they can be competitive, and give the political mileage and impetus for Governments to invest in their national cricket infrastructure. Jamaica is used only as an example as I have written before on Barbados, Antigua & Barbuda, etc. able to raise national resources when they competed internationally individually. Those national resources would benefit WI cricket in ODIs and Test where we would continue to compete as WI. It might also be inevitable if cricket becomes an Olympic sport in the near future, where countries compete as individual countries. It irks me to see countries like the Netherlands and Oman on the world stage in the world T20s and not our own countries who have contributed so much to world cricket.

The most significant point, is that the paradigm of professional sports has so dramatically changed globally because of the vast financial and national resources available that WI simply have not had. But most people seem to believe that we can produce professional cricketers in 2022 the same way we produced them back in 1982, and still become world beaters. I don’t believe so, and whoever comes along as President or change the governance structure, management, etc. the core problem remains.

I didn't claim anything to be novel, but I don't recall individual countries of the West Indies playing in the world T20s before. Remind me when that happened. But the suggestion is being misconstrued as simplistically a suggestion to break up the WI... rather than a possible way to generate national resources badly needed. Imagine the re-energized domestic tournament.. e.g. a St. Lucia vs Barbados or Jamaica vs Guyana World T20 qualifiers...


But the most important point is that the resource gap is now enormous...at every level in the world of pro sports. No one seems to talk about it when looking at what ails WI cricket... but apply the resource gap over 30 years... and we are where we are.

how are individual territories going to go about competing in the international T20 tournaments, (and by that, i take you mean the present tournament and not the international club tournament) and not seek some type of permission from the ICC?

such permission will rightly be viewed as a separation if not stipulated properly.

in any case, it is a slippery slope and can be viewed as a precursor to total and eventual separation

i believe you know this

Totally agree it is a slippery slope... but so is T20 becoming an Olympic sport. The ICC has England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Island all competing individually. Why not WI at t20 as an effort to grow the game in the Caribbean. What do you think is going to happen if or when cricket becomes an Olympic sport? Imagine when Barbados beats England in a qtr final in the Olympics...which can happen in t20!

The more dangerous slippery slope is the continued decline of WI cricket
Hardly anybody is playing or watching cricket in Jamaica anymore...50% of the WI... forget the messenger... how does that translate for the future for any professional sport.

There is already a special dispensation which allows the WI to be represented at the ICC even though it is not abnation state which is required under the ICC constitution... this would simply be an amendment.

has always been the ethos of the insecure, self conscious West Indian cricket administrator. In the 50s, 60s, 70s and part of the 80s, when the administrators were primarily of the planter class, it was something different. The new boys of the post independent caribbean society are insecure, imf battered morons who feel intimidated by any kind of star quality and power. We saw it with how the handled Viv's retirement, we saw it in how the constantly fought Brian Lara, the first millionaire in WI cricket.

Olympics is an individual country participative event as is the commonwealth games, so i have no issues with that.

ICC sanctioned tournaments are confined to cricketing territories operating under the aegis of the ICC.

however, as i have discussed above, if given permission by the ICC and it is stipulated that it is for this one off only, fine.

a more equitable way of solving the issue is recognising that there are small market teams that will never be able to generate revenue from their markets to make them as competitive monetarily as other teams and to institute some type of revenue sharing like the American NFL

In talking with Jamaican people here, it's pretty much T&F and football, nothing else. Cricket is an afterthought.

That said, I still don't see WI being able to have its cake and eat it to with regard to competing as an ICC member. Stay together or break up, this whole "keep WI as a Test nation, but compete individually in T20Is" won't work.

CWI got somewhere above 120m the last cycle for distribution however it saw fit. I'm not sure exactly how much an individual nation under the Associate Member receives, but I think it's safe to suggest that the likes of Bermuda, Cayman, Bahamas, Belize and Suriname receive the equivalent of pocket change and an 'independent' Grenada or Dominica cricket board wouldn't receive anything significantly greater should they compete as Associates.

The Stanford model was fun and gave a ton of players exposure, but its format, a straight knockout tournament, wasn't going to work as far as development. You'd need some league-play in there. Heck you could have had four regions (West, North-East, Central and South). But you'd still need an influx of cash to support it (at least in its infancy).

Yes...that remodeling of the global cricket revenues is what has been proposed ad nauseum and rejected by the countries who simply want to keep all of their revenues. Both cricket revenues and national resources are needed... not one or the other. We have no control over one... getting some of other country's revenues. But one we have much more of a say...and precedent.

Imagine if 3 spots were reserved for 3 teams from the Caribbean to go to those playoff for the 2 spots at the world t20s. The cpl is a domestic t20 tournament among franchises. Totally different.

Inter-territory rivalry is an important fuel that drove WI cricket. But the stakes matter. A Jamaica vs Trinidad football world cup qualifier is miles apart from a Caribbean Cup game. One gets mass crowd support, sponsorship and even TV revenues and all the top players get leave from their pro clubs to come back and play. The other barely gets a mention in the papers and the teams are usually local based players that nobody wants to see.

Extrapolate that over the last 20 years, that's one country having4 billion investing in its cricket.. versus zero. I know most people think in cricket resources don't impact the outcome... but I respectfully disagree. When the resource gap was a few million at the gate, our talent overcame it. But now in the hundreds of million a year... that gap is gargantuan.


India's rise and WI demise both coincided with the explosion in TV rights values starting in the late 90s. It might be a total coincidence... but I believe there is a strong correlation. The IPL is now the 3rd or 4th most valuable league in the world amongst all sports...only NFl, NBA and MLB surpass... those resources are not surmountable by our talent alone on a consistent basis.

We also had the inter territory T20 competition before the advent of CPL. Not exactly the same as teams like Windwards and Leewards were combined territories, so I believe Stanford is more along the lines of what you propose. Which I like and advocate BTW.

I fully agree.
We (CWI) got to find ways to make money through marketing the brand more. There are ways, even teams that rank lower than us I see having shirt sponsor deals, and more.
What they are doing smartly is showing the games on YT. But by doing this they are able to make some money back through advertising because imagine a regional game in the WI can garner on average 4k viewers on YT alone. and that's live that's not cumulative views. The marketing team needs to explore more on how to make the brand more viable because persons are still interested in what happens in our local leagues.

No. Nothing similar. No international platform for any country in Standford. Not like going to the Olympics or a world t20. As I said... a local domestic tournament does not have the same prestige as a global world tournament and is not likely to create the impetus needed for a national programme. If all jamaica's track team qualified for was Carifta Games... does anybody think the same level of resources would be generated compared to the destination being the Olympic games and world Champioships?

I think we’re saying similar things

I get that there doesn’t currently exist a mechanism for individual regional teams to qualify for an Olympics or a World Cup.

I’m thinking that qualification for a World Cup would be a different criteria than an Olympics purely due to the construct of West Indies vs individual nations

West Indies can qualify for a World Cup as an ICC playing member. To the best of my knowledge, Jamaica, or Guyana cannot qualify for a World Cup as they are not ICC playing members. I may be incorrect here.

However, Jamaica sends a team to the Olympics, as does Guyana. So if cricket were to become an Olympic sport, technically, both could be able to field representative teams.

However, the Stanford competition format and construct would be an ideal vehicle for Olympic qualification if the qualifying standard restricts Olympic participation to say 3 from the region.

Would such a qualifying tournament be more prestigious than a regular regional T20 competion? Absolutely!!

94m (~12m pa) Zimbabwe
40m (~5m pa) Afghanistan & Ireland (became full members 2017 so this may be pro-rata from 2017-23)
160m to 93 Associates – this is broken up across two grant systems (tournament & scorecard)^


And as you suggest, this is solely ICC monies. TV$ is a different animal. ECB and BCCI get oodles more because they have bigger audiences and sponsors.

it would be that simple if cricket at a territory level was simply the job of the CWI. Governments invest heavily in sports as a matter of youth development. So 120 mil across nine territories isn't actually that terrible. Barbados invested 1 million dollars in the BCA last year. So CWI is getting help. Trinidad had a specialized cricket program at UTT training cricketers, one in which Gordon Greenidge was once employed. If the CWI does not know HOW to manage its finances properly, for example, in the exiling of players and the termination of coaches prematurely, for nonsensical reasons, such as Simmons wanting to pick a full strength team with bravo and pollard, and having to pay out hefty sums in compensation at a high court's orders, then that is a totally different story.

I think that would have to be one of the first orders of business if cricket becomes an Olympic sport. ICC would have to adjust its constitution to either allow the WI to register its individual nations *only for Olympic participation* or use whatever clauses are in place that let Barbados (or others) compete at Commonwealth Games for women's T20s.

The other major orders of business, oddly enough, are resolving the "Team GB" as I'm sure Scotland may have opinions that differ from ECB's... and would Cricket Ireland need to 'send' any Northern Ireland people to GB.

The other bone of contention that I hope gets blown up would be the qualification method. ICC is obsessed with using deeply flawed rankings systems to determing qualification for global events. It would be impossible to devise rankings for individual WI nations when there's no history of T20I matches against any other teams. You'd need global or regional qualifying tournaments and is there space in a packed cricket calendar for such?
