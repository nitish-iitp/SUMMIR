SA vs NED Live Score, T20 World Cup Super 12, Group 2: The Netherlands sent South Africa crashing out of the Twenty20 World Cup on Sunday with a stunning 13-run victory in Adelaide which also propelled India into the semi-finals.

The latest in a series of shocks at this tournament left Bangladesh and Pakistan fighting it out for the final spot in the last four.

Table-toppers India are on six points and play Zimbabwe in Melbourne in the final match of Sunday’s triple header, the result of which will decide the final Super 12 standings and who faces whom in the semis.

A win will be enough for South Africa to become the first team from Group 2 and third overall to progress to the semifinals of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2022. On Saturday, England joined New Zealand in the last-four stage from Group 1 after beating Sri Lanka and this eliminating holders Australia. The Temba Bavuma-led South Africa are the clear favourites but in the unlikely scenario of their defeat, they will have to pack their bags for home. Netherlands are currently languishing at the bottom of the pile and are already out of the race.

SA v NED Live Score, T20 World Cup 2022: The Story So Far.

South Africa lost the crucial make or break match at the Adelaide Oval to go down to ‘minnows’ Netherlands by 13 runs. A win here would have meant the Proteas are through to the semi-finals, but they choked under pressure which meant they are out. Nonetheless, this also meant India are through to the semis.

Coming back to the match, Proteas had won the toss and bowled first. Barring Anrich Nortje, every other bowler went for runs. Meanwhile the Netherlands batted fiercely with opener Myburgh slamming 37 off 30 balls. After his departure, it was Tom Cooper who gave the innings the needed impetus as he accounted for a quick-fire 35, but it was Ackermann who changed the complexion of the match with 41 off 26.

Chasing 159, South Africa kept on losing timely wickets and at one stage were 39/2. Nonetheless, the Dutch kept attacking with change of pace and kept up the pressure on dangerman David Miller who scored run a ball 17. After his departure, the game turned in Netherlands’ favour. Furthermore, some uninspiring batting from Aiden Markram and Heinrich Klaasen made sure the Proteas were reduced to 113/6. They eventually lost the match by 13 runs.

SA v NED Live Score, T20 World Cup 2022: South Africa Are Going Home.

Last ball was hit for four by Anrich Nortje, but that was not enough. This game was lost when David Miller and Heinrich Klaasen were dismissed. South Africa are going home and this would be demoralising; they were one of the favourites.
