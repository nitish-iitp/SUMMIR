June 7, 2024  Team Female Cricket

The Gahanga International Cricket Stadium (B), Kigali will host match no. 28 of the ongoing 10th edition of the Kwibuka Twenty20 (T20) Tournament, featuring Kenya and Botswana. The game is scheduled for 5:15 PM Indian Standard Time (IST) on the 7th of June 2024.

Match 28 Kenya vs Botswana
Squads:

Kenya – Esther Wachira (C), Venasa Ooko, Veronica Abuga, Ann Wanjira, Jemimah Ndanu, Edith Waithaka, Lavendah Idambo, Flavia Odhiambo, Queentor Abel, Marion Juma, Judith Ogolla, Mercy Sifuna, Charity Muthoni (WK), Kelvia Ogola, Judith Ajiambo

Botswana – Tuelo Shadrack (C), Pako Mapotsane (VC), Wendy Moutswi, Merapelo Phiase, Onneile Keitsemang, Oratile Kgeresi, Entle Mmese, Goabilwe Matome, Amantle Letuba, Shameelah Mosweu, Kesego Inakale, Laura Mophakedi, Amantle Mokgotlhe, Aliya Motorwala

Players to watch out:
Esther Wachira

The 25-year-old all-rounder in T20Is has accumulated 431 runs and scalped 55 wickets from 53 outings, with respective bests being 51 and 4/1. While Esther had a good start with the bat, managing scores of 15, 24, and 20, her subsequent scores read 4, 0, and 3; though she has compensated with the ball, with 10 wickets from 6 innings. She can be relied upon for the goods.

Lavendah Idambo

The 18-year-old pacer, from 58 T20I outings, has scalped 53 wickets, including the best of 4/14, maintaining an economy rate of 4.61, and has also added 120 runs to the tally from 27 innings. Barring an outing, Lavendah has picked up a wicket in each outing, producing figures of 1/16, 0/13, 2/28, 2/13, 1/10, and 1/5. Given her form, she will be counted on to lead the tally, providing breakthroughs.

Laura Mophakedi

The 26-year-old keeper-batter, from 60 T20Is, has amassed 729 runs and rewrote her career-best to 67 in her most recent outing. Laura had a quiet start to this campaign, departing cheaply with scores of 6, 4, and 5, but managed a fine 34 in her subsequent game, and an inning apart notched up a solid 60-ball 67. It is hoped she capitalizes on this return to form, notching up another good score.

Tuelo Shadrack

The 23-year-old all-rounder has bagged 40 wickets from 51 T20I innings and added 288 runs to the tally from 49 innings, with bests being 38* and 3/2. While Tuelo’s contributions with the bat have been limited, her scores read 3, 38*, 1, 3, 3, and 3. However, she has been a standout with the ball, returning figures of 2/30, 3/2, 3/5, 0/16, 2/25, and 3/9. She can be banked upon for all-round efforts.

Pitch:

The 22 yards at the Gahanga International Cricket Stadium (B) pose a challenge for batters with its pace-friendly nature, and the average score of 98 runs reflects the difficulty of scoring freely. Batters will need to demonstrate adaptability to excel on this wicket.

Weather:

With light winds, humidity at 45%, and the temperature forecasted to hover around 28°C, the conditions are pleasant for a game of cricket. The overhead is expected to be partly cloudy, but the chances of rain remain minimal.

Fantasy playing XI:

Laura Mophakedi, Venasa Ooko, Pako Mapotsane, Esther Wachira, Ann Wanjira, Tuelo Shadrack, Queentor Abel, Shameelah Mosweu, Goabilwe Matome, Flavia Odhiambo, Lavendah Idambo
