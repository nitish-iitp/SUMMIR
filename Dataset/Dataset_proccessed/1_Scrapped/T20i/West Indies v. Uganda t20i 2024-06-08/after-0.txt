West Indies vs Uganda t20 World Cup 2024 Highlights: Akeal Hosein starred with the ball, decimating Uganda’s batting line-up in the stiff chase of 174. The Brian Masaba-led side was bundled out for 39 as the Windies won the game by a huge margin of 134 runs. Uganda equalled the Netherlands’ 10-year-old record for the lowest total in T20 World Cups. On the other hand, West Indies are now placed second on the Group C points table with 4 points and +3.574 NRR.

Earlier, Uganda made the West Indies work harder than expected as the tournament co-hosts posted a challenging 173 for five batting first in a Group C match of the T20 World Cup at the Guyana National Stadium on Saturday.

West Indies were poised for a full-fledged assault near the halfway point of the innings with Charles and Pooran at the crease. Uganda captain Brian Masaba earned the two important wickets of Nicholas Pooran and opposite number Rovman Powell with his wrist-spinners, while seamers Cosmas Kyewuta and Juma Miyagi impressed with their pace and accuracy. It was left to Andre Russell with a 17-ball unbeaten 30 (six fours) to give the innings a late surge.

WI vs UGA Live Score, T20 World Cup: West Indies win

West Indies thrashed newcomers Uganda by 134 runs in their T20 World Cup Group C match here with left-arm spinner Akeal Hosein returning a five-wicket haul.

West Indies, making use of the familiarity with the home conditions and vital contributions from their batters, especially Johnson Charles (44) and Andre Russell (30 not out), put up an impressive 173 for five on the board.

Brian Masaba was the most successful Ugandan bowler, taking two wickets for 31 runs.

In reply, Uganda could only make 39 runs in 12 overs, with Akeal making it a completely one-sided contest for the two-time T20 world champions, ripping apart the rival top and middle-order.

This was West Indies’ second successive win in the tournament.

“Back-to-back night games here on the same surface. Fairly pleasant from a playing point of view. Well over 80m down the ground, the late 70s on the leg-side and only 70 on the off-side. Not much bounce on the surface and that could be a cause of concern. It looks very similar to the way it looked last night. There was a lack of bounce, that’s where there’s the uncertainty is really for the batters,” reckons Simon Doull and Samuel Badree.

“We are going to bat first. Looks like a typical Guyana wicket – low and slow. Hopefully, we can put some runs on the board and defend it. It’s still a wicket where you have to play good cricket shots. 110-120 is not defendable. Once we improve in all three departments, we should be good. Last few days we did some training and resting. Same team,” said Windies captain Rovman Powell.
