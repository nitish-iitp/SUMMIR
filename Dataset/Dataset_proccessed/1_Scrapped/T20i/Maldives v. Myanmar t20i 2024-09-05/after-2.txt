Paralympic Diary Day 8 & Preview of Day 9
 

The schedule for Team Ireland on the eight day was light with just one of the 35 athletes in action. Róisin Ní Riain, took to the pool at the La Défense for one last swim of these Games. She faced off tough competition to finish fourth with a time of 1:19:16.

Speaking afterwards the Limerick native said: “I’m disappointed, I’m not going to lie but you have good swims and bad swims. I hope I’ll be able to look back in a bit and be happy with my performances but disappointed with that.

“I probably got a bit too excited, definitely didn’t hit some of the things I needed to but it’s all learning. Two medals is absolutely brilliant. Of course that’s not what I’m thinking about right now but I’ll be able to look back and be happy with that.”

“For vision impaired kids to be able to see people like them is really nice, I definitely would have liked to have had that when I was younger.”

Today is it the second last day of competition and there is loads of action for you to follow. The Para Cyclists take to the road again for nearly a full day of road racing, similar for the Para Equestrian athletes and Aaron Shorten is the only Para Athletics athlete to compete today in the T20 1500 Final.

The momentum is building for everyone at IWA as we look forward to two of our ambassadors competing tomorrow. Mary Fitzgerald, Shot Put Final and Britney Ardense in Para Powerlifting. We will be live at the competition watching them so get your flags ready to cheer them on!
