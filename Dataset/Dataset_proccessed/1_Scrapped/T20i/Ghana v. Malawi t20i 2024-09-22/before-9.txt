The inaugural Africa Qualifier for this event was held in September 2022 in Botswana determined the team that would directly advance to the Under-19 Women’s T20 World Cup. Eight teams competed across two groups: Uganda, Namibia, Botswana, and Sierra Leone in Group 1, and Tanzania, Rwanda, Nigeria, and Malawi in Group 2. Uganda and Tanzania topped their groups, advancing unbeaten to the playoffs. In the semifinals, Tanzania overcame Namibia, while Rwanda stunned Uganda. Rwanda then capped off their remarkable run by defeating the unbeaten Tanzania, securing their place in the 2023 U19 Women’s World Cup.

For the 2024 edition, the International Cricket Council (ICC) expanded the qualification process, increasing team participation from 8 to 14 by introducing a two-stage format. The first stage, Division 2, took place from August 21 to 27, with Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, and Mozambique in Group A, and Eswatini, Ghana, Malawi, and Sierra Leone in Group B. Division 2 finalists Malawi and Kenya secured their spots in Division 1, where they will now compete alongside Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe for a place in the 2025 U19 Women’s World Cup.

Format:

The tournament will follow a round-robin format, with each team playing the others once in the league stage. Based on their rankings, the top four teams will advance to the semifinals, while the bottom four will compete in the 5th and 7th place playoffs. The winners of the semifinals will face off in the Final, while the losers will meet for a 3rd place playoff.
