2.50pm And with that, Rohit accepts the trophy that he first won as a rookie India player way back in 2007! Off go the fireworks and the ticker-tape. An unbeaten campaign, which I think is the first in a World Cup since Australia won the 50-over event on this very ground in 2007. It's been a triumph for the best team in the competition, and what a final with which to win it!

That's a wrap from us. But here's Andrew Fidel Fernando's match report to keep you going, and stay tuned for all the post-match analysis. From Miller, KK, Thilak and the team, good night!

Avinash: "Amazing game by both teams, hope SA wins the next one, but today immensely happy for Rohit, Kohli and Dravid :)"

JOYDEEP GILL: "In this match arshdeep, bumrah and pandya conceded just 58 runs within 10 overs and took 7 wickets this bowlers was the reason India won this match from losing position "

Ravi: "SA played like a true champions through out and can't get s better game of cricket with two quality sides. Thanks cricinfo for outstanding coverage and commentary as usual."

Prasanna S: "What a moment for Dravid to be holding that trophy and celebrating. From the disappointment of 2003 finals to the capitulation in 2007 WC in first round under his captaincy, he would reflect on this day when life comes to a full circle for him."

Here come India for their winners' medals, and here is Rohit Sharma: "Hard to sum up what we've been through in last three-four years. A lot behind the scenes, not what we did today, it's what we did before. A lot of high-pressure games, and we've been on the wrong side of it. Guys understand when the pressure is on what needs to be done, today was perfect example, stuck together with backs to the wall. We wanted this really bad, a lot of mind needs to come together, very proud of the bunch of boys and the management, giving us the liberty to play and that trust. Starts from management, coach, captain, and the players."

"No-one was in doubt about the form of Virat, on top of his game for last 15 years. Come the occasion, big players stand up. Crucial to hold that end, for the others to play around him. Team effort because it wasn't a wicket to bat freely. He did that perfectly, that experience all the years come together, and Axar's batting was crucial.

"Jasprit, I understand you guys trying to put it into words, but I don't know how he does it, it's just masterclass. He backs his skills which is more than enough, and is a confident lad. Class act.

Hardik signals to his captain to shut up and come and lift the trophy!

"Hardik was brilliant, to bowl that last over, proud of the boys. And the fans, from NY to Barbados, and back home. Late in India but they've been waiting a long time. Very proud of what we've achieved today."

Aiden Markram: "Gutted for the time being, it'll take some time to reflect on a really good campaign, hurts quite a bit but incredibly proud. We bowled well, not a lot to work with, it was a chaseable total, batted well, came down to the wire, gutted not to get over the line. It's not over til the last ball is over, we never got comfortable, things happen quickly at the back end, but got into a great position to prove we were worthy finalists. South Africans are competitive, respectful and will go down with a fight. It's still a proud moment for us."

Ashwin: "Ian Bishop quotes Firdose Moonda!" Indeed he did!

2.34pm It's nearly time for the trophy presentations, but a word while we wait for the poor South Africans. 30 from 30... it's extraordinary. But one by one, their fingers were prised off the prize. Klaasen and de Kock were both playing so well, but gave it away to momentary lapses. And as for Miller, what would he have given for a Boult step-on-the-rope moment from Sky...

Here they come, the crestfallen runners-up. They've gone one better than in their previous eight semi-final appearances in World Cups, but that elusive major trophy remains just out of reach

2.25pm It is now hammering down with rain, funnily enough.

Adam: "Stuff of dreams. Kohli failed all matches and brought the best in the final. Pandya went through difficult phase before World Cup and made this his stage. Sharma devastated from loss in ODI World Cup final going on to win the World Cup eventually. Can't hold emotions. "

Prasanth Guna: "The final is another match that exactly depicted how the tournament went... Group Stages were awesome, Super 8's were top notch until the last game in each grp and then the knock outs. What a tournament!!!" It's been compelling, I agree! The USA, Afghanistan, Scotland's feisty challenge, South Africa so good as well until the final 30 balls of the tournament. More of the same in 2026 please!

Pradeep: "You know what!! India has a differential of primes - 2007, 2011, 2013 - ICC champions2024 now differences 17, 13, 11 - sequential primesMultiple of 17, 13, 11 - 2431 (some sequence)" I have no idea what I just read, but fans of numerology, it's time to start believing.

Anjan: "Scenes from Lagaan happening in Providence." It truly is meant to be!

Jj: "Damn bumrah and damn sky for that catch. Why no one's talking about that catch under pressure. You think it's easy??" There will be plenty chat about it in the final analysis. Right now it's all a bit too breathless!

Jasprit Bumrah is Player of the Series: "I tried to keep calm. We play the sport for this, I am really over the moon, my son is here, family is here, we've been working really hard towards this, no better feeling than that. We play sport for the big stages. On the big day, you have to give more, throughout the tournament I felt very clear and calm. At my peak mindset I think of one ball at a time. The emotions can take over, but now the job is done. That over I thought length ball was the option, it was reverse-swinging and I was glad to execute."

Virat Kohli is Player of the Match: "This was my last t20 World Cup, and this is what we wanted to achieve. One day you feel you can't get a run, then things happen. God is great, and I got the job done for the team on the day it mattered. Now or never, last T20 for India, wanted to make the most of it. Wanted to lift the cup, wanted to respect the situation rather than force it. This was an open secret, it's time for the next generation to take over, some amazing players will take the team forward and keep the flag waving high."

Time to carry Virat on the shoulders, a la Tendulkar in 2011. "Rohit has played nine T20 World Cups, this is my sixth. He deserves it. I wasn't confident in the last few games, but grateful and humble right now, and I bow my head. It's been difficult, and the emotions of the game... it's difficult to hold things back. The emotions will come later..."

Crumbs, it's all happening!

2.08pm Jay Shah and Dravid pose for a photo... Here's SIraj: "Game-changer Jasprit Bumrah, I am thinking it's an unbelievable feeling. Last year, I lost the game, but this match, the feeling is unbelievable. I am grateful and blessed!"

Hardik: "It's very emotional, something was not clicking, but this was something the whole nation wanted. Special for me after my six months, I haven't spoken a word, things have been unfair, but I knew there'd be a time I could shine. An opportunity like this makes it all the more special. We always believed, stayed calm, let the pressure come to them. Last over, I knew I had to execute my plans. All of a sudden my run-up speed increases. I have been in this situation, I enjoy the pressure situation."

Dravid's last day as coach ... "I am happy for him, wonderful man, good relationship with him, became friends, excited for him." He signs off with a kiss from his captain!

Axar: "I'm not thinking this is the final, I just play on the merit. Rohit is an amazing man, led India well... gave everything, and we enjoyed it and did our best. I thought I'd be down the order today, but three early wickets and Rahul told me. I didn't think about my batting and that works for me."

2.04pm There is some raw, raw emotion out there right now. Pandya is in tears, Kohli is roaring with triumph, vindicated for his steadfast anchor role. Klaasen looks utterly bereft. That dreaded tag won't be leaving South Africa in a hurry, but who wouldn't blink when Jasprit Bumrah delivers a performance of such insuperable magnificence. Hugs, handshake, between both teams and rightly so. That was simply incredible to behold.

2.02pm What a sensational final. What a sensational comeback from India! South needed 30 runs from 30 balls when Jasprit Bumrah came back into the attack. He simply scattered South Africa's poise with the match at their mercy, but it's Hardik Pandya who closes the game out with huge poise. Remember, his key wicket of Klaasen snapped the chase open too. And as for that catch from SKY... gadzooks

This is the moment

JM: "This is Bumrah's world cup! Player of the match and Player of the series! "

Hardik to Rabada, OUT

Hoisted through the line, but not enough power! Rabada gave it full beans, hitting through the fourth-stump line, but they weren't full enough. SKY can't stay out of the action, and India are moments from the T20 World Cup!

Kagiso Rabada c Yadav b Pandya 4 (3b 1x4 0x6 5m) SR: 133.33

He's got to hang it out wide...

19.5
1w
Hardik to Rabada, 1 wide

Over-cooked outside off... that's too wide, and two fours would be a super over...

Two men behind square on the off side

Bhalchandra : "If Virat played shot of the century, SKY pulled out catch of the T20i world cup history "

19.4
1lb
Hardik to Maharaj, 1 leg bye

Pinpoint from Hardik, right up to the toes, offering nothing for Maharaj to heave up and into. Deflected to square leg, and now it's six or bust...

Maharaj is so deep in his crease

19.3
1b
Hardik to Rabada, 1 bye

Swing and a miss! Full length, outside off, Rabada can't connect with a huge yahoo to leg... but they sprint the bye

Third man goes back... and there's rain in the air folks...

Hardik to Rabada, FOUR runs

Rabada swings for the hills, and a fat edge for four! Crucial boundary for South Africa, they aren't dead yet!

19.1
W
Hardik to Miller, OUT

Wide full toss flogged down the ground for the most sensational catch you can ever imagine! That is a moment for the ages, Miller connected well, but not well enough to take Suryakumar Yadav out of the equation. He hurtled round from wide long-off, clawed down the ball with barely two hands, toppling over the rope as he went, kept his feet inside the rope... and lobbed the ball back into play, and into his own cool-as-cucumber hands!

30 off 30 has become 16 off 6 ... which sounds a familiar ask to that 2019 final... are we in for... nope, I'm not saying it... Hardik has the ball and after his IPL experience... wow, the jeopardy is off the scale!

There is protection wide on the off-side, protecting the shorter boundary down-breeze

Arshdeep Singh to Maharaj, no run

Beautiful wide yorker! Maharaj toe-ends his drive, back out of the length, Arshdeep leaps to gather, and claws down the dot ball!

A shot to nothing for Maharaj now, like Archer in the 2019 final. Boundary or bust...

18.5
1
Arshdeep Singh to Miller, 1 run

Yorker, fired in at the left-hander's toes, inside-edged for the single to backward square

18.4
2
Arshdeep Singh to Miller, 2 runs

Hoisted across the line, out to midwicket! Not perfect contact on a forced pull, not quite short enough to clobber. But crucially he's back for the second

How does Miller play this? A boundary or two would be nice, but getting on strike for the 20th is the priority

18.3
1
Arshdeep Singh to Maharaj, 1 run

Maharaj slides back and across, good contact on the pull up into the leg-side, one bounce to deep midwicket. There is the single

It is now two runs a ball. Miller has to get back on strike somehow

Nishant Pokhrel: "Thriller, Perfect Final for ages. Whoever wins, will win by barest of margins"

18.2
•
Arshdeep Singh to Maharaj, no run

Back of a length, angle across the right-hander, good lift, and Maharaj can't lay bat on ball!

Third man inside the circle

18.1
•
Arshdeep Singh to Maharaj, no run

Over the wicket, tight line and length, Maharaj presses back down the line, and it's another dot! It was a run a ball not so long ago... it's nearer two a ball now!

Back comes Arshdeep, he's been magnificent today. What can he leave for the final over

Tapped into the covers off the full length, takes the single. Bumrah has delivered, ahem, one wicket and two runs, and even better, he's got Miller off strike

17.5
•
Bumrah to Maharaj, no run

So tight and full! Aggressive angled length, demanding a front-foot block

Right. Two balls. Two dots would be just fine for South Africa. In fact, anything but a Miller run-out would do!

17.4
W
Bumrah to Jansen, OUT

Sensational delivery! Jasprit Bumrah is the bowler from the Gods! Pace, angle, length, lift, Jansen plays the perfect defensive block, and is bowled through the gate as the ball flicks the top of his bails! This is too tense to function. Pass me an umbrella to gnaw!

A touch more width this time, just back of a length, Miller flashes a drive out to deep cover and takes the single

•
Bumrah to Miller, no run

Wicket-to-wicket pace, Miller settles for the full-faced block back down the line of off... two dots!

17.1
•
Bumrah to Miller, no run

Snorter to start! Tight line from round the wicket, and that misses both the outside edge and the off stump by a whisker! Miller sliding to leg, then drawn back to the line like a magnet

As expected, it's Bumrah or bust ... six balls, one wicket, two runs would be nice for India!

Slow bouncer, Miller reads it well and settles for a controlled pull to square leg, rolling his wrists on the ball to keep the strike
