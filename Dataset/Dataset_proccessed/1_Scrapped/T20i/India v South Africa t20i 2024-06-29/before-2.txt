NEW DELHI: The T20 World Cup 2024 Final is set with inaugural champions India taking on first-time finalists South Africa at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados, on Saturday, June 29. South Africa secured their first-ever ICC event final berth by defeating Afghanistan by 9 wickets, while India knocked out defending champions England with a 68-run victory in their semifinal match.
South Africa, captained by Aiden Markram, bowled out Afghanistan for the lowest total in a T20 World Cup semifinal - 56 All Out.
Overcoming early challenges, South Africa reached their target in 8.5 overs at the Brian Lara Stadium in Tarouba, Trinidad & Tobago, on Wednesday, June 26.


India, led by Rohit Sharma, set a challenging target of 172 runs in a rain-affected innings. Sharma led the way with a fifty, helping his side overcome the defending champions. Spinners Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav were instrumental in India's success, each claiming three wickets to dismiss England for 103 All Out at the Guyana National Stadium in Providence on Thursday, June 27.

The Caribbean, particularly Barbados, is experiencing significant disruptions due to rain, affecting the T20 World Cup 2024. Both teams and officials faced delays of nearly six hours at the Grantley Adams airport due to rain, according to ESPN Cricinfo. Most matches in the Caribbean and the USA have encountered rain interruptions, leading to some games being washed out entirely or shortened.
The weather remains a concern for the T20 World Cup 2024, with a storm warning issued for the final on Saturday, June 29.

There is a special provision for the final match day, offering an extra advantage to ensure the title clash can proceed despite the weather forecast. Further information on the T20 World Cup 2024 final rain rules will be crucial as the event progresses.
What Will Happen if India vs South Africa is washed out or interrupted by rain?
If rain interrupts play or there is a delay during a match, the game can be completed using an additional 190 minutes. To constitute a match in the knockout stages, a minimum of 10 overs must be bowled to the side batting second, unless a result is achieved earlier.
If both teams do not get a chance to play a minimum of 10 overs each, then the match will be moved to the reserve day, according to the guidelines. This rule comes into play with several conditions applied to its execution.
Is there be a reserve day for the T20 World Cup 2024 final and when is it?
The final match in Barbados on Sunday, June 30, has a reserve day in case of a washout on the scheduled match day. This reserve day setup is similar to the one used for the first semi-final in Trinidad.
There are some rules that will be followed if the reserve day is going to be used due to a wash out on the scheduled match day.
How does the reserve day work and when will it be used?

Match Interruptions: An additional 190 minutes is allocated for completing the match on the scheduled day. A minimum of 10 overs per side is required for a valid result.
Reserve Day: If the match cannot be completed on June 29, it will continue on June 30 from where it left off. Efforts will be made to complete the match with reduced overs if necessary.

What happens if the reserve day for IND vs SA T20 World Cup 2024 final also in washed out?
In accordance with the playing conditions set by the ICC, a Super Over will be utilized to decide the victorious team should the final match end in a tie. However, if the Super Over cannot take place, and no winner is determined on the reserve day, the match will be considered a no result. Furthermore, if weather conditions hinder the completion of the Super Over, or if the match is abandoned or results in a no result, both teams - India and South Africa - will be declared as joint winners and will share the trophy.
What's the weather forecast for Bridgetown, Barbados on June 29 and June 30?
Bridgetown, Barbados Weather Forecast For June 29:
The weather forecast indicates a cloudy, breezy, and humid day with a couple of showers and a thunderstorm expected in the early hours and afternoon. AccuWeather predicts a 20 to 47 percent chance of precipitation during the playing hours, with the weather remaining cloudy. Thunderstorms are anticipated from 3 AM to 5 AM local time and again from 3 PM to 5 PM local time.
As the game is scheduled to be played from 10:30 AM to 2:30 PM local time, there is a possibility of an uninterrupted match on Saturday (June 29) due to the forecast of only cloudy weather during the playing hours. However, if rain does occur, the match will be moved to the reserve day.
Bridgetown, Barbados Weather Forecast For June 30:
The weather forecast indicates that it will be mostly cloudy, humid, and breezy in the morning. However, there is a chance of occasional rain and thunderstorms in the afternoon.
