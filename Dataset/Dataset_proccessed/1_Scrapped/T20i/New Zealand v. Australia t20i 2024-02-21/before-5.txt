New Zealand Squad for Australia Test Series 2024; Daryl Mitchell Returns

FEBRUARY 18, 2024
1 min. read

The New Zealand cricket team announced their Test squad for the upcoming 2-match Test series scheduled to be played between February 29 to March 12, 2024.

During the Australia tour of New Zealand 2024, a total of 3 T20I and 2 Test matches will be played between February 21 to March 12, 2024.

New Zealand’s star batter Kane Williamson and Tim Southee both have been included in the New Zealand test squad for the Australia series. The series will also mark their 100th test appearance.

Notably, Southee will also become only the fourth player after Ross Taylor, Virat Kohli and David Warner to play 100 games in each format.

The selectors did not consider Trent Boult for the Test series ‘due to minimal recent red-ball cricket’ while Michael Bracewell was also not an option for them as he continues to recover from a finger injury.

Daryl Mitchell will return to the Test squad having missed the second Test against South Africa due to a foot injury. He also won’t be part of the T20I series against Australia to allow the injury to heal.

Scott Kuggeleijn also makes it to the squad and replaces Kyle Jamieson who was ruled out of the rest of the home summer due to a back injury. Devon Conway who recently lost his unborn child has also been included in the test squad.

Speaking about Kuggeleijn’s inclusion, selector Sam Wells said: “Scott performed admirably with both bat and ball on the recent New Zealand A tour to Australia. He will bring genuine pace with the ball and adds extra depth with the bat which is always valuable at Test level.

“Everything is tracking well with Daryl. The decision to give him a period of rehabilitation was necessary and will allow him to be at his best for what is an important series for the team.

He’s a key member of the group and has proven, with his performances over the past 12 to 18 months, how much value he adds to the Test team. Daryl will keep focusing on his rehabilitation over the next week and will be fit and ready for the first Test in Wellington,” added Wells, providing an update on Mitchell.
