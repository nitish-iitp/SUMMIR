New Zealand vs Australia 1st T20 Highlights: Nz vs Aus, Australia's skipper Mitchell Marsh and Tim David led their team beat New Zealand by 6 wickets at the Sky Stadium in Wellington, while playing the first T2O International match in 3-T20 match series on 21 February. 

Chasing a target of 216 runs to win, Australian batters tried to play attacking shots and kept losing their wickets.

However Travis Head (24) and David Warner (32) did gave a good start before being dismissed by Adam Milne and Mitchell Santner.

Following this, skipper Mitchell Marsh (72*) remained on the crease and built small partnership with Glenn Maxwell (25) and Josh Inglis (20). But Tim David (31*) stood till the last with him and led the Australian team to defeat New Zealand by 6 wickets.

Australian skipper Mitchell Marsh was announced as the 'Player of the Match' for his 72 unbeaten runs and one wicket taken in the first innings.

For the Kiwis, Mitchell Santner picked two wickets, while Lockie Ferguson and Adam Milne took one each.

Batting first, Kiwis ended the first innings at Wellington on a total of 215/3, their second highest score at this venue. Devon Conway and Finn Allen provided a stellar start to the Kiwi until Allen was dismissed on a score of 36. Conway then stitched together an over 100 run partnership with Rachin Ravindra, placing the Kiwis over the 150 run mark. The final touch to the innings was put by Mark Chapman and Glenn Phillips who helped the Kiwis go past the 200 run mark.

For Australia, Mitchell Marsh, Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins picked one wicket each.

Earlier in the day, Mitchell Santner won the toss and decided to bat first at the Sky Stadium in Wellington. The two teams are set to play 3 T20 encounters, the last for both of them before the start of the T20 World Cup later this year.

The Aussies are also in have been in red-hot form after defeating the West Indies 2-1 for the recently concluded T20 series and will be aiming to replicate this form against their neighbours. Moreover, this young Aussie side would be aiming to give David Warner a warm farewell on his last bilateral T20 series. 

New Zealand, on the other hand, won their last T20I series against Pakistan with a 4-1 margin and will be aiming to dominate their opponents in last T20 matches before the World Cup.

The presence of these big names from both sides means that the first T20 between New Zealand and Australia is likely to be a high-scoring affair. The Sky Stadium pitch, while offering something for the bowlers, is likely to be more in favour of the batsmen, meaning a big score would be the likely outcome.

New Zealand and Australia playing XI: 

New Zealand XI: Finn Allen, Devon Conway (wk), Rachin Ravindra, Glenn Phillips, Mark Chapman, Josh Clarkson, Mitch Santner (c), Adam Milne, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, Lockie Ferguson

Australia XI: Travis Head, David Warner, Mitchell Marsh (c), Glenn Maxwell, Josh Inglis (wk), Tim David, Matt Short, Pat Cummins, Mitch Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood
