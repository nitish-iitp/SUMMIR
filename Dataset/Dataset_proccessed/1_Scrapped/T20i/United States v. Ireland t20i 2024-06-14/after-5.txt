United States vs Ireland Highlights, T20 World Cup 2024: The match between United States and Ireland at Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground, Lauderhill, Florida on Friday was washed out due to rain. The result thus helped USA advance to the Super-Eight round while last-edition runners-up Pakistan got knocked out of the tournament. USA got one point from the abandoned game on Friday to reach to 5 points, a mark Pakistan could not reach even if they win their final league match against Ireland on June 16. Rain in Florida delayed the toss for the USA vs Ireland game on Friday. Wet outfield forced multiple inspections before the rain returned and the umpires were forced to called off the game.

USA vs IRE Live: Match of Pak's interest as well
With India already through to the Super 8 phase from Group A, USA can join them with a win against Ireland. Pakistan, who are also in Group A, will be closely monitoring Friday's game in Fort Lauderhale, rooting for an Irish win. Pakistan also face Ireland on Sunday, but that game will have zero relevance if USA get even one point on Friday. USA have 4 points after playing 3 games while Pakistan have 2 points after 3 matches.
