The International Cricket Council (ICC) grouped teams into four groups of five for Round 1 based on their rankings. These seedings will stay the same for Super 8, so the schedule won't change much even if a team performs poorly.

As per ICC seedings, the top team for Group A is India. As per ranks, the next teams are Pakistan, Ireland, Canada and the US, respectively. Even if India finish second, they will still be considered A1. Even if Pakistan managed to finish on top of the table, they would still be A2.

The US have 4 points after playing 3 matches while Pakistan have 2 points after playing 3 matches. If the US lose their next cricket match and Pakistan win their next, the Net Run Rate (NRR) will decide the second position. Right now, Pakistan’s NRR (+0.191) is better than the US’ (+0.127).

Since India have already qualified for the next round, they will play against Afghanistan (C2) on June 20. They were supposed to play against Sri Lanka (D2) on June 22. However, the second position for Group D is still wide open while South Africa (D1) have already qualified.

While England are B1, they have only 1 point from 2 matches. Scotland have 5 points from 3 matches. If Scotland qualify instead of England, the Scottish team will be considered B1.
