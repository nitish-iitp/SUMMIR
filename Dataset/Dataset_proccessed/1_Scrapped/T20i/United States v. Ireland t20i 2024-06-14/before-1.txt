England vs Oman Highlights, T20 World Cup 2024 Match Today: Jos Buttler powered his side home with 101 balls to spare after Jofra Archer, Mark Wood and Adil Rashid bundled out Oman for just 47 runs at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua.

Defending champions England opted to bowlfirst as they sought a big win to breathe some life into their campaign and the bowlers delivered a masterclass. The win boosted England’s Net Run Rate above Scotland, and into the third place on four points, with a match against Namibia to follow. The Scots are on 5 points and in second place, with a game to come against Australia.

England will now hope to defeat Namibia (while praying for a completed match) and then have to wait to see if Australia can beat Scotland.

England’s XI: Philip Salt, Jos Buttler(w/c), Will Jacks, Jonny Bairstow, Harry Brook, Moeen Ali, Liam Livingstone, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood, Reece Topley

Oman’s XI: Kashyap Prajapati, Pratik Athavale(w), Aqib Ilyas(c), Zeeshan Maqsood, Khalid Kail, Ayaan Khan, Shoaib Khan, Mehran Khan, Fayyaz Butt, Kaleemullah, Bilal Khan

14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: ENG 50/2 after 3.1 overs – win with 101 balls to spare

Player of the match, Adil Rashid, for his superb four-wicket haul. England had a job to do in Antigua and they blew Oman out of the contest to wrestle back the momentum that was lacking in their first two matches.

02:20 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: ENG 50/2 after 3.1 overs – win with 101 balls to spare

So England now improve their NRR beyond Scotland's, so Scotland's only real chance is to beat Australia in the final match in this group. (England will play Namibia before that and weather permitting, they will improve that NRR further). 

02:19 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: England 50/2 after 3.1 overs – win with 101 balls to spare

England's Net Run Rate goes from -1.80 to +3.08. Win by 101 balls, NRR improvement 101.

02:15 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: England 50/2 after 3.1 overs (Target 48)

England win with 101 balls to spare. Bairstow smashes a four to end a double-quick run-chase! Just what the doctor ordered for the defending champions. We will confirm what the NRR boost they got is shortly. It was -1.800 before this match.

02:12 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: England 46/2 after 3 overs (Target 48)

Bilal to Buttler. First ball, charged down the track and hit past mid off for four. Third ball, short on hips and pushed behind square for four. Fourth ball, slower one, send over midwicket for four. Fifth ball, short again, smashes 89m by Buttler for a SIX! The England captain could win it with a six off the last ball but JUST gets four as he slices one over point. A 22-run over and Buttler does what England wanted him to. Smashed off nearly half the chase in on over! 

02:07 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: England 24/2 after 2 overs (Target 48)

And Bairstow too wastes no time, rides the bounce well and cuts one over point for a first-ball four. England on track to chase this in fourth or fifth over. 

02:05 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: England 20/1 after 1.5 overs (Target 48)

JACKS GONE: A four off a no ball by Jacks early in the 2nd over but Kaleemullah fights back well. The free hit is a dot ball and then he gets Jacks to play and miss at a couple of deliveries. Jacks goes for the big square cut again but that extra bounce on the pitch means he can only sky this to point. 

Will Jacks c Prajapati Kashyap b Kaleemullah 5 (7 balls)

02:03 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: England 14/1 after 1 over (Target 48)

The feisty Kaleemullah to bowl the 2nd over. 

02:01 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: England 14/1 after 1 overs (Target 48)

Perhaps a few England fans going "Booo!" at their TV sets as Will Jacks plays a perfect defensive shot first ball. 14 runs from the first over and Buttler will now be on strike.

01:58 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: England 12/1 after 0.3 overs (Target 48)

TWO SIXES, AND OUT: Salt starts off with two sixes in two balls, both over extra cover. Bilal pulls his length back and Salt drags it on to the stumps. Right idea from Salt, didn't get the execution right there. 

01:56 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: England 6/0 after 0.1 overs (Target 48)

And there it is... first ball from Bilal, and Salt is not taking any time. Clears his front foot and smashes one over extra cover for six. 

01:54 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Target for England - 48

Jos Buttler and Phil Salt in the middle. They have to go all guns blazing. Oman's strength is disciplined bowling, but can they do any damage here? Bilal Khan will start. 

01:50 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 47 all out after 13.2 overs

According to ESPNCricinfo, England will pass Scotland's NRR if they chase this in 5.2 overs. Surely they would like to do it quicker? Remember, number of wickets lost plays no part in NRR calculations. England really should look to go hell for leather. 

01:39 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 47 all out after 13.2 overs

Shoaib Khan is the only batter who made it to double figures. Adil Rashid with four wickets, three each for Mark Wood and Jofra Archer. Absolutely clinical from England. "We trained really well last week, showed good resilience, pleased for the whole group. Good bounce, a bit tennis-bally, we just got our lengths right," says Wood at the mid-match chat. 

01:37 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 47/10 after 13.2 overs

OMAN ALL OUT: Oh man, that wasn't good to watch if you are a Oman fan. Archer comes back into the attack, fires in a bouncer and Shoaib Khan (who batted more than 20 balls). The top edge is taken by Buttler. 

Shoaib Khan c Jos Buttler b Jofra Archer 11 (23 balls)

01:34 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 47/9 after 13 overs

No five-for for Rashid as he finishes with 4/11 in 4 overs. Oman just didn't pick him at all. 

01:33 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 47/9 after 12.5 overs

FOUR-FOR RASHID: This is another fabulous googly that would trouble at least a good percentage of proper batters. Kaleemullah stands no chance once he doesn't pick it. Rashid has four wickets, with one ball left in his spell. 

Kaleemullah b Adil Rashid 5 (5 balls)

01:29 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 45/8 after 12 overs

The lowest total in the tournament history is 39 (when bowled out). Oman gets past that ignominious mark in the 12th over. A four for Kaleemullah, the man with all sorts of emotional range. A 9-RUN OVER! Would you believe it? 

01:25 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 36/8 after 10.5 overs

RASHID HAS HIS THIRD: One googly turns too much and bounces too much but Rashid gets it spot on next ball. No ifs and buts there as Fayyaz is bowled. 

Fayyaz Butt b Adil Rashid 2 (7 balls)

01:23 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 35/7 after 10 overs

Will England be tempted to bring in their 5th bowler here? Or stick to the 4 main bowlers and try to wrap this up quickly? For now Adil Rashid continues. 

01:19 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 35/7 after 10 overs

Not sure about the Oman batters, but our fingers need a break! Wicket after wicket in the first 10 overs as players take a drinks break. Oman are in all sorts of trouble. 

01:15 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 33/7 after 8.4 overs

PROCESSION CONTINUES: Rashid gets one to turn sharply again and this time Mooen makes no mistake in first slip. Mehran, who can be handy with the bat, falls for a duck. 

Mehran Khan c Moeen Ali b Adil Rashid 0 (2 balls)

01:11 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 32/6 after 8 overs

WOOD HAS THREE: A change of angle to the left-handed Ayaan Khan and it is once again Mark Wood's pace that does the damage. Ayaan drags one back onto his stumps. 

Ayaan Khan b Mark Wood 1 (5 balls)

01:06 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 30/5 after 7 overs

Shoaib Khan brings some respite to Oman with a square cut behind point for four. 

01:04 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 25/5 after 6.1 overs

STUMPED: Oh dear, not good cricket from Khalid Kail. He's beaten by Adil Rashid's turn, but has dragge his backfoot out, doesn't do enough to get it back in. Buttler actually misses a go at removing the bails but takes it off. 

Khalid Kail st Jos Buttler b Adil Rashid 1 (3 balls)

01:01 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 25/4 after 6 overs

WOOD HAS TWO IN AN OVER: It's a procession in Antigua now. Mark Wood's pace is too much to handle. Banged into the pitch, the opener pulls and caught at midwicket. 

Kashyap Prajapati c Liam Livingstone b Mark Wood 9 (16 balls)

00:55 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 24/3 after 5.1 overs

WOOD STRIKES: First ball wicket for the pacer. Good length ball at pace but it seems to stop on Zeeshan, who checks his shot and lobs a simple catch back to the bowler. 

Zeeshan Maqsood c & b Mark Wood 1 (5 balls)

00:53 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 24/2 after 5 overs

Topley gets a third over in the powerplay. Recall Shane Watson saying once that it is never a great idea irrespective of how well one is bowling. It helps the batters line up the bowler much better. And Prajapati does just that, going over point for a slice six. 

00:49 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 16/2 after 4 overs

DROPPED! Archer should have had his third wicket. It's a fuller ball to the left-handed Zeeshan, gets the outside edge, but Moeen Ali puts down a fairly simple chance at first slip. (No easy slip catches perhaps but that's as easy as they come). Archer goes down on his knees in disbelief. 

00:47 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 16/2 after 3.3 overs

AQIB FALLS: Archer has his 2nd wicket. Short of length outside of off stump again, this time the Oman captain cuts it behind square. Jacks takes a good low catch at gully. Umpires send it upstairs but it is a clean catch. Replay shows extra bounce. 

Aqib Ilyas c Will Jacks b Jofra Archer 8 (10 balls)

00:43 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 14/1 after 3 overs

A couple of swanky shots attempted by the Oman batters in that Topley over, going across the stumps and trying to nullify the angle. But no real connection though. Just 3 singles off that over. 

00:40 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 11/1 after 2 overs

Captain Aqib is the new batter in and gets going with a good-looking punch through the offside. At Archer's pace, if there is width and no movement, it's a safe shot. Topley will continue for the third over. 

00:38 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Oman 6/1 after 1.2 overs

FOUR AND OUT! Archer gets charged down the pitch by Athavale, who drives one past mid off for four. Next ball, though, a soft dismissal. Short ball, Athavale drives on the up to the fielder at cover. No big celebrations from the English. 

Pratik Athavale c Phil Salt b Jofra Archer 5 (3 balls)

00:34 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: OMAN 1/0 after 1 over

Solid start from Topley but not the kind of movement perhaps England would have expected from their lead pacer, with the breeze and all. Just tidy lines and lengths across the line to the two right handers. 

00:32 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Topley starts off

Here we go then in Antigua, the third match of the tournament in this venue. Oman lost heavily against Scotland after batting first, Namibia lost heavily against Austaralia after batting first. Perhaps that is what England are hoping for. 

00:29 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: National anthems done

The players are in the middle. There is a breeze across the ground that Buttler said he hopes will help Topley, who comes into the XI. He will start with the new ball. Athavale and Prajapati are in the middle. 

00:25 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: England's gamble

England could find themselves in trouble if they are unable to take some early Oman wickets. If Oman somehow manage to post a par total, England's job of improving their NRR is going to take a hit. Must say, a strange call that to not bat first. 

00:21 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: England's odd record

England are winless in their four prior men’s T20I matches against associate nations (L2 NR2); the list includes two losses against the Netherlands, and one no result against Ireland (in 2010) and Scotland (in 2024) apiece.

England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: STAT NUGGET

- This will be the first ever international game between England and Oman; England have lost eight of the last 11 times they completed a men’s T20I game against an opponent for the first time (W3), losing their last such game against Ireland by five runs in the 2022 Men’s T20 World Cup.

- England have lost five of their last seven completed men’s T20Is in the Caribbean (W2), with both the wins coming against the West Indies; this will be their first ever men’s T20I game at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua.

14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Plenty of NRR chatter

The pre-match chatter is largely around Net Run Rate and how England need to win big. But Jos Buttler at the toss played it down, saying the first focus is to win 2 points. NRR, if possible, will come into their mind later. 

00:09 (IST)

Oman's captain Aqib Ilyas says he also wanted to bowl first. 

Team news coming up soon: England have brought in Reece Topley it seems. 

00:03 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Toss - ENGLAND TO BOWL

England have won the toss, and they have opted to bowl first! That's interesting. Perhaps they are looking to do what Scotland did in chasing against Oman with plenty of deliveries to spare. 

Very breezy in the middle, says Mike Atherton. Gorgeous day, it seems. 

00:01 (IST)
14 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Toss coming up

England would, we imagine, love to bat first to get as much of a NRR boost as they can. Toss coming up in Antigua.

England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Super 8 scenes

So, with Bangladesh taking a decisive step towards Super 8 (they need to avoid defeat vs Nepal), Super 8 Group 1 is set to look like this: India (Q), Australia (Q), Afghanistan (all but qualified), Bangladesh (all but qualified). Some tasty clashe there! 

23:58 (IST)
13 JUN 2024
England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Elsewhere, Bangladesh set to progress to Super 8

21-year-old spin sensation Rishad Hossain snapped three wickets to inspire a 25-run win for Bangladesh in crucial Group D T20 World Cup match against the Netherlands. Taskin Ahmed was also among the wicket-takers and struck twice on the day. Criticized for his string of poor scores of late, Shakib Al Hasan rose to the occasion in a crucial Group D match for Bangladesh as the former skipper scored an unbeaten 64 to inspire his side to 159/5 in 20 overs against Netherlands. Earlier, Netherlands captain Scott Edwards won the toss and elected to field first against Bangladesh during their Group D T20 World Cup game at St Vincent in Kingstown on Thursday.

England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Will Australia yield to temptation vs Scotland to eliminate England?

After chasing down the paltry target of 73 runs posted by Namibia inside the first six overs on Wednesday, the Australian cricket team could possibly yield to temptation and take it easy against Scotland in their next group game. The reason? It could make life difficult for the England cricket team, who are currently in a scramble to make the cut for the Super 8 at the ongoing T20 World Cup.

At least that’s what Australia’s Josh Hazlewood has implied in a press conference on Wednesday. However, he stopped short of saying that Australia would actually try to beat Scotland in a slower-than-needed fashion.

However, if Australia are found to be making an attempt to “game the system”, it could be costly for the side in the Super 8 stages. (READ MORE)

England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: How England can reach the Super 8s

England will need to win their last two games. But they also have to hope that Scotland lose their final group game to Australia on Saturday. Scotland have a superior run rate than England at the moment. Their win over Oman with 41 balls to spare propped up Scotland’s NRR to 2.164, and made England’s job that much harder.

Even if Scotland lose to Australia, England will have to win their last two games against Oman and Namibia by certain margins so that their NRR is boosted.

England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Matthew Mott, England coach on the challenge of facing Oman

"I think it’s a very different opposition. It's a good question. I think it's a very different opposition to the last game. So, we have to adapt. We've got a meeting after this in our skill groups to just fine tune. And we also haven't really properly reviewed the other day. We've let it settle for a bit. We've trained well. But I think that some of the lessons that we learned, particularly we didn't go in blindly, but we probably didn't execute with the sides of the field with the ball that we wanted to get hit. I think that's somewhere we can tidy up and just being a little bit more proactive with the bat in enforcing the bowlers where we want to hit them. So those are the couple of areas we took out. And looking at this, it's a very similar set up. The wind is quite strong. And seeing the way Scotland exploited that the other day was something that we'd like to take in as well. So, it sets up well for our team."

England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: Matthew Mott, England coach, responds to Hazlewood

Q: You've got plenty to focus on yourselves, but I wonder if you'd seen Josh Hazelwood's comments about doing whatever they could to make sure you guys don't get through regardless?

Matthew Mott: To be honest, I was informed of that this morning. Look to me, that's things out of our control and I think I know Josh pretty well and I know his integrity. I don't think that's a thing. He has got a very good sense of humour and hopefully that's what he was doing.

Q: Are you happy to take that as a joke and focus on your game ahead?

That's all we can do. I think regardless of any outside noise about qualification, run rates, all that sort of stuff, essentially, we've got to win this game and we've spoken a lot about that. I know Jos spoke really well yesterday about we need to earn the right to push hard in this game as well and I think that's what teams do. Nice, cool, calculated response. It's going to be a good wicket out here by the looks of it. We're going with a lot of confidence, I think. We've played good T20 cricket for a while now. It didn't quite come off against Australia last game but I think we've got our structure in place, we're really confident. Those who saw us train yesterday, you can see a buoyant group up and about that's ready for the challenge ahead.

Aqib Ilyas story: A cancer survivor, who almost lost his leg, missed cricket for 18 months and is now Oman’s captain

Oman’s men’s cricket captain Aqib Ilyas takes a deep breath and says “Mujhe laga zindagi aur cricket dono khatam (I thought life and cricket are over for me).” The top order batsman and leg break bowler, is grateful he even made it.

The 31-year-old who takes over national captaincy for the first time, still remembers when a doctor holding his X-rays and CAT scan reports broke the news to him that the acute pain he was suffering on his left ankle was a cancerous tumour.

“It was scary. I’d gone numb,” he narrates his story to The Indian Express in an exclusive interview ahead of Oman’s match against Namibia.

England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: A quick recap of Oman vs Australia

For about 1/3rd of that match, Oman had Australia under pressure. The bowlers did a brilliant job, there was Aqib's absolute stunner of a catch... they'd be wondering what if that Stoinis catch was taken at long off. Because after that dropped catch, he took off big time! Including 3 more sixes in that very over. His 67 was the difference in the end on a night where most batters struggled. Came in and picked up three wickets too for good measure.

England vs Oman Live Score, T20 World Cup: And New Zealand are all but out

With their superb fightback against New Zealand, co-hosts West Indies made it three wins out of three and qualified for the Super 8. That result has all but ended New Zealand's hopes of qualifying. Kane Williamson's men were already behind the (Super) 8-ball after a damaging heavy defeat against Afghanistan to begin their campaign and their second defeat means they need a mathematical miracle to stay in contention. For starters, they need Papua New Guinea to beat Afghanistan. A washout or Afghanistan win seals their fate. Even if Rashid Khan and co somehow slip up against PNG, New Zealand will need mammoth wins in their last 2 matches because of a woeful NRR that reads -2.425 after two defeats. Even after that, Afghanistan still have a match left against West Indies. So yeah, chances are the Kiwis will be flying home after their group stage.

Off the sixth ball he faced, he swivelled into a pull but the ball just about lobbed over the bowler. England seamers thought the short ball was the way to go. (ICC/X)

“What’s happening, mate? Am I the enemy now? I am just trying to help. You are always fighting me,” when Justin Langer, Western Australia’s coach, asked him one day in 2014, Ashton Agar broke down. “I don’t know. I have no idea. I don’t know.”

A game against Tasmania in Hobart. Agar bowled two balls, two good deliveries, but a “deep sadness” welled up in him. After another delivery, he felt a tear breaking out from his eye. He threw away the ball, got his hat from the umpire, walked out of the ground, and started to sob. (READ MORE)
