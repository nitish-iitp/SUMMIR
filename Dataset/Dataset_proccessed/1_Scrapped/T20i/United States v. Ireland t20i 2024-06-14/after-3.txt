United States qualifies for next phase of T20 Cricket World Cup after Ireland washout

The United States has qualified for the next phase of the men’s T20 Cricket World Cup after their game with Ireland was rained off.

The U.S. needed a win or a no result in their final Group A game at Lauderhill in Florida on Friday to reach the Super Eight stage.

By reaching the tournament’s second round they also automatically qualify for the next T20 World Cup, taking place in 2026 in India and Sri Lanka.

Wins over Canada, in the opening game, and Pakistan — via a dramatic super over — had left the co-hosts, playing in a global cricket tournament for the first time, in a strong position to advance.

But persistent poor weather in the area meant no play was possible with the match abandoned without a ball being bowled and both teams being awarded a point.

And that point was enough to ensure the U.S advance alongside India. They lost to India, one of the tournament favourites, in the group phase.

HISTORY IN THE MAKING!!! 🇺🇸🔥🙌

The Super Eight phase (another round-robin stage before the semifinals) will see eight teams compete for places in the last four.

The U.S. will now play South Africa (on June 19), West Indies (on June 22) and one of England or Scotland (on June 23).

The top two in each group will progress to the semifinals before the tournament’s final, at the Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados, on June 29.

T20 or Twenty20 cricket is the game’s shortest format and sees each side have one innings of up to 20 overs (six balls).
