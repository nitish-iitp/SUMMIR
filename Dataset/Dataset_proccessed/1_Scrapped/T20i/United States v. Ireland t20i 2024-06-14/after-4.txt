Hello and welcome!
USA vs Ireland, T20 World Cup 2024 Highlights:

USA vs Ireland, T20 World Cup 2024 Highlights: Co-hosts USA have stunned one and all by making it past the group stage in their first-ever T20 World Cup. Their match against Ireland on June 14 was washed out in Lauderhill, Florida. Both teams were awarded a point each which has thus put the USA out of reach of the maximum points that Pakistan can achieve. USA's progression thus also confirms that 2009 champions and 2022 runners-up Pakistan have been knocked out in the group stage itself. USA and India are the two teams who have made it out of Group A.

USA vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, USA vs IRE: The news could come any time now folks. Pakistan fans, look away. The patter slowly becomes heavier. It will take the greatest of miracles for any kind of cricket match to happen here, logically speaking.

USA vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, USA vs IRE: Inspection underway

USA vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, USA vs IRE: Match referee Javagal Srinath is also there. They are still walking quite gingerly on the outfield. A long chat between him, the umpires and the ground staff and then they all rush inside when thunders ring out from the clouds. A lightning warning has been issued and so everyone's off the ground now. Still technically we are a go for the match because no one seems ready to sound the clarion yet.

USA vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, USA vs IRE: Why Pakistan's fate is dependent on the result today

USA vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, USA vs IRE: To put it simply, it is because Pakistan lost two matches. To make matters worse for them, they were both games they really should have won. First, they snatched defeat out of the jaws of victory against the United States in what is surely the biggest upset in the history of the T20 World Cup. Then they failed to complete a chase they were seemingly bossing at around the 10th over mark against arch-rivals India. Both were results that gave the team a lot of existential crises to deal with, something that is never too far away in Pakistan's case. They finally opened their account with a seven-wicket win over Canada, but it looks like it may have been too late.

USA vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, USA vs IRE: And the result of the inspection is….

USA vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, USA vs IRE:… yet another inspection! Yes, this next one surely will be the one that satisfies the officials one way or another. Or not. Who knows at this point. Jokes aside, kudos to the ground staff. They really are giving it everything they have got. The next inspection will take place at 10.45pm IST.

USA vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, USA vs IRE: Info on the cut-off time

USA vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, USA vs IRE: The latest cut off time for a five-over-a-side match is 11.45pm. The umpires should walk out for their next inspection any time now.

June 14, 2024 9:27 PM IST
USA vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, USA vs IRE: Another pitch inspection scheduled

USA vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, USA vs IRE: This brand new shiny inspection is going to take place at around 10pm IST. So, the officials aren't in such a hurry to put the metaphorical blanket over this match and fire the metaphorical shot yet. They still have hope. Or maybe they hope that their hope is unfounded. Whatever it is, we have about half an hour more to find out… well whatever it is that we will find out.

USA vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, USA vs IRE: It is not looking good at all for Ireland (and Pakistan)

USA vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, USA vs IRE: Murmurs from the middle indicates that the officials could call this game off already without waiting till we get any closer to the cut off time. It seems highly unlikely that the outfield will get ready any time soon.

June 14, 2024 9:06 PM IST
USA vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, USA vs IRE: The umpires take a walk

USA vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, USA vs IRE: The overall good news is that there is still no rain here. The umpires seem to have given the pitch a thumbs up but they remain unhappy with the outfield. While there are no visible puddles, water is gathering at their shoes whenever they take a step, which was the case an hour back as well.

June 14, 2024 8:56 PM IST
USA vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, USA vs IRE: What a washout will do today

USA vs Ireland Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, USA vs IRE: Well, if there is no match today, we might end up seeing Pakistan announcing new captains for their Test, ODI and T20I teams next week. For a washout would lead to both USA and Ireland taking a point each from this match and that would put the former beyond Pakistan's reach, which means that the 2009 champions would be knocked out in the group stage. Considering the stuff that ex-Pakistan cricketers have already said about the players after their losses to USA and India and how PCB has reacted to crises such as these in the past, the rain in Florida could bring thunder and lightning halfway across the world today.
