7.50pm So, that's your lot. England have won a cricket match! But even in victory, they somehow managed to feel a bit defeated... but it's a new younger team, and an important rite of passage for Saqib Mahmood in particular. But from Alan, Thilak, Matt and the team, thanks and goodnight. See you on Wednesday!

7.41pm Time for some presentations... here's Moeen Ali, the Player of the Match: "Jas was going really well, I was quite fortunate, hung in there, he stepped it up beautifully. We thought we got a good score in the end, but they played well. CJ at the end played a great knock. A lot more clear now without playing red-ball, but you never quite win the game with the way they played. Me and Rash, we've played together quite a bit, and he makes it easier for me when the guys come after me."

Kieron Pollard: "We lost wickets in clusters but the way we fought at the back end, they can hit the ball a long way, and the confidence that Akeal has... and Shepherd wants to put up his hand and take responsibility. [Spin] has been a thorn for us, we will overcome it, we are working diligently but the biggest disappointment was our fielding display. But confidence is high and it augurs well for the next three games."

Eoin Morgan: "I'm delighted, even with the last quarter of the game, these are the games we want to play in, tight games to work on death hitting and death bowling. But the majority of the day we adapted well, with more intent and clarity. We need to establish the rhythm of the game, not necessarily fluent partnerships ... dot, dot, dot, wicket, boundary. But we countered what West Indies had to offer. Every team in the world is trying to get better at death bowling. Conditions got better and the ball skidded on, but we need to find better execution, we'd like it to be up there with the best in the world. The majority of our plans was yorkers, to defend the wide side... and we missed."

7.34pm Good grief. England square the series, but that's not actually the talking point anymore! Akeal Hosein and Romario Shepherd have confirmed that West Indies' next generation is primed for action. This could and should have been a rout to rival the opening fixture, but with the boot on the other foot. Instead it's one of the most confusing contests I've ever witnessed!

James L: "If that second wide had been called at 19.1…"

Will: "Good thing Topley bowled as well as he did in the 19th! " So true, that was where the match was made safe, even in the face of that late charge. What a stunning finale!

19.6
6
Mahmood to Hosein, SIX runs

Too much room outside off again, and crashed magnificently over long-off! It's the most outstanding failure imaginable! West Indies have lost by one run! And they had no right to get within fifty runs!

19.5
6
Mahmood to Hosein, SIX runs

Another massacred slam over long-on! Mahmood is looking a touch like Stuart Broad at Durban right now... wide-eyed and a little bit powerless to resist a rampant batter!

No more wides... or things get tasty!

19.4
6
Mahmood to Hosein, SIX runs

Flogged over midwicket once more! This is phenomenal hitting, predicting the line and length, and rifling it flat over Roy's head on the edge of the rope!

19.4
1w
Mahmood to Hosein, 1 wide

Another wide... this is turning into a bit of a morale boost for West Indies

19.3
4
Mahmood to Hosein, FOUR runs

Hoisted handsomely down the ground! Full again, in the arc, launched over long-on to bring up a ballsy fifty stand

19.2
4
Mahmood to Hosein, FOUR runs

Bashed hard into the gap at wide long-on! Full length outside off, but tighter to the left-hander this time, and Hosein flings gleefully through the line

19.1
•
Mahmood to Hosein, no run

Attacking the wide line, and Hosein is a bit miffed that that wasn't called as well. With some reason...

19.1
1w
Mahmood to Hosein, 1 wide

A very wide wide, outside the off stump.

Topley to Shepherd, FOUR runs

Pumped out through point, one hand comes off the bat as Shepherd connects well enough to beat the tumbling sweeper. That was a fine over, and it's left Windies needing miracles

18.5
1
Topley to Hosein, 1 run

Full again, attacking the left-hander's leg stump, Hosein gives himself room, but Topley follows him. Slapped to deep point. Clever bowling

Marcus: "Jordan needs to bowl yorkers. If you bow widel half trackers at his pace you go to the boundary. Aim at their toes."

18.4
•
Topley to Hosein, no run

Good delivery, length ball at pace, and nipping past the edge. Test-match vibes!

18.3
1
Topley to Shepherd, 1 run

Slower ball, back-of-the-hander, full length again, winds into another full-blooded pull as the ball plops at midwicket. Cunning bowling

18.2
2
Topley to Shepherd, 2 runs

Hacked with energy up and over the off side, but can't get enough bat on it, plugs in the deep

18.1
•
Topley to Shepherd, no run

Full and wide, that's excellent bowling, pushed across the right-hander, finding some swing on the angle to elude a booming drive

Noor: "I am starting to get England vs New Zealand World T20 semi final vibes now." Hmmm

17.6
1
Jordan to Shepherd, 1 run

Full and pressed into the covers, to end a lively and almost contest-reviving over...

17.6
1w
Jordan to Shepherd, 1 wide

Good finish ... or not! That looked like a good delivery, wide of off stump, but adjacent to the blue guide line, umpire Wilson decides it's the wrong side of it!

17.5
2
Jordan to Shepherd, 2 runs

Fires in the yorker, and leathered through point! Topley slides round the rope, and does well to palm it in. Unexpectedly valuable runs saved!

17.4
6
Jordan to Shepherd, SIX runs

Back of a length, and taken to the beach! Shepherd swings up into another violent pull, cramped on the body but his fast hands do the needful!

17.3
6
Jordan to Shepherd, SIX runs

Pumped into the stands once more! Into the pitch, skidding into a brutal thwack across the line! Roy can't get close at deep midwicket!

17.2
1
Jordan to Hosein, 1 run

Pace off on the wider line, and dropped by the backpedalling Morgan! Leaping on the edge of the ring, at extra cover. It was tough but not that tough... and he's annoyed with himself
