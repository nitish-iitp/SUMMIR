Hosein, Shepherd almost pull off heist in Barbados

Akeal Hosein and Romario Shepherd almost pulled off one of the most sensational wins in the history of T20 international cricket as the West Indies lost to England by one run in the 2nd T20I at Kensington Oval, Barbados.

Chasing 172 for victory, the West Indies were 98 for 8 after 15.1 overs and seemed to be tailing away to defeat.

However, Shepherd and Hosein had other ideas, bludgeoning 72 runs of the final 29 balls of the innings to fall just a run short of England's target.

The West Indies needed 30 runs off the last over, and Hosein after failing to score off the first ball, hammered two fours and three sixes to take 28 runs off the over, falling just short in the end.

Earlier, England posted 171 for 8 with Jason Roy (45) and Moeen Ali (31) top-scoring in the hunt for a series-tying win.

West Indies lost Brandon King and Shai Hope with six runs on the board before a mid-innings collapse saw them lose four wickets for 15 runs in the space of 20 balls.

However, after the loss of Fabian Allen for 12 at 98 for 8, Shepherd smashed 44 not out off 28 balls and Hosein 44 not out off 16 balls in a gallant effort that fell agonizingly short.

"We lost wickets in clusters but the way we fought at the back end, they can hit the ball a long way, and the confidence that Akeal has... and Shepherd wants to put up his hand and take responsibility," skipper Kieron Pollard said after the game.

West Indies lost five wickets to spinner Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali in the middle overs, and Pollard admitted this has been a weak point.

"[Spin] has been a thorn for us, we will overcome it, we are working diligently but the biggest disappointment was our fielding display. But confidence is high and it augurs well for the next three games," the West Indies captain said.

England skipper Eoin Morgan was pleased with the win and felt his team adapted well to the conditions. 

"I'm delighted, even with the last quarter of the game, these are the games we want to play in, tight games to work on death hitting and death bowling," he said.

"But the majority of the day we adapted well, with more intent and clarity. We need to establish the rhythm of the game, not necessarily fluent partnerships ... dot, dot, dot, wicket, boundary. But we countered what West Indies had to offer," Morgan added. 

Moeen Ali took the Player of the Match award for his 3 for 24  and 31 off 24 balls.

The series is level at 1-1 with the third match of the five-game series scheduled for Wednesday.

Summarized scores: England 171 for 8 in 20 overs (Roy 45, Holder 2/25) vs West Indies 170/8 in 20 overs (Hosein 44, Shepherd 44; Ali 3/24). England won by 1 run
