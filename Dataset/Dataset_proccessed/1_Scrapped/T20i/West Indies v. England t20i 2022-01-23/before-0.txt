Star Proteas pacer Kagiso Rabada has been released from the South Africa ODI squad ahead of the three-match ODI series against India due to a high workload over an extended period of time.

The Proteas management wants to manage his workload by giving him some rest to prepare for the upcoming South Africa tour of New Zealand.

Cricket South Africa will not include any player in the ODI squad as Kagiso Rabada’s replacement because there is an extended squad in place in the Bio-Secure Environment (BSE). However, George Linde has been retained from the Test team as an extra spin-bowling option.

“No replacement will be brought in for him as there is an extended squad in place in the Bio-Secure Environment (BSE), but George Linde has been retained from the Test team as an extra spin-bowling option for the series,” stated an official Cricket South Africa (CSA) release.

Confidence Is Well Within The Team – Temba Bavuma

During a virtual press conference ahead of the first ODI game against India, white-ball captain Temba Bavuma said that the Proteas team has a lot of confidence and they will be taking the momentum from the Test series onto the ODI series.

“Yeah, momentum is a real thing, you would have seen after the first Test, how we managed to get some momentum in the Johannesburg Test and how we carried through. Momentum is a real thing, obviously, it is a different format and there is a different kind of pressure. Confidence is well within the team and we will be leading onto that to inspire the new guys,” said Bavuma during a virtual press conference.

While giving an update on wicketkeeper-batsman Quinton de Kock, Temba Bavuma said that he is fit and fine.

“I would like to have as many options as possible considering the balance of the team. I am not aware of any physical or mental issues with Quinton de Kock. He had his commitments with his family, he is here with the team now and he is training with the team. As far as I know, Quinton is fit and fine,” he added.

The three-match One Day Internationals (ODI) series will begin from January 19, 2022, at Boland Park, Paarl. The second One Day Internationals will be played at Boland Park, Paarl on January 21, 2022, and the third and final One Day Internationals will be played on January 23, 2022, at the Newlands, Cape Town
