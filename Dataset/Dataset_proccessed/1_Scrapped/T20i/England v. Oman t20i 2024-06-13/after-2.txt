T20 World Cup 2024 Highlights: England thrash Oman in must-win clash.

England vs Oman, T20 World Cup 2024, Highlights: Defending champions England won their first match of the T20 World Cup 2024 as they hammered Oman by eight wickets in a Group B clash in Antigua on Friday. After dismissing Oman for just 47, England finished on 50-2 in a mere 3.1 overs to bolster their net run-rate which could yet prove decisive in their bid to qualify for the second-round Super Eights. England would hope for a favour from arch-rivals Australia, who face Scotland in their final group game on Sunday. (Scorecard | Points Table)

We are back. The players are out in the middle. Jos Buttler and Phil Salt to open for England. Bilal Khan to bowl first.

!

... The Run Chase ...

!

Mark Wood from England is up for a quick chat. He says they had a point to prove and he is pleased for the whole bowling group. Tells there is some tennis bounce and the seamers used it well. Shares it is skiddy and shiny. Mentions that the spikes don't work most of the time and he slips most of the time. Ends up appreciating the bowling spell by Adil Rashid.

!

The bowling from the defending champions was top-notch. They poured their anger over the previous mishaps from the tournament on the Oman batters. The pace of Jofra Archer and Mark Wood was unplayable for the Oman batters while the spin of Adil Rashid was not easy for them to read either. Adil Rashid picked up 4 and gave away just 11 off his 4 overs. Mark Wood and Jofra Archer had identical figures as they both gave away 12 and took 3 each. With not a lot to chase the English batters would look to chase this down inside the powerplay and boost their NRR. Will they be able to do that? We shall find it out soon with the chase in a while.

!

After being asked to bat first, Oman never got off to any sort of groove as they were pinned back to the wall from the get-go. The side managed to score just 25 runs and lost 4 wickets inside the powerplay. The bowlers kept on bowling those consistent lines and lengths and made life even more difficult for the batters. The batters couldn’t get out of the jail and wickets kept tumbling. The side were soon 35 for 7 after the end of 10 overs and the last 3 wickets didn’t add much either as the team was bundled out for 47 in total. The batters were simply outclassed by one of the finest bowling attacks. Only Shoaib Khan managed to get into the double figures for Oman.

!

The title holders have dismantled the Oman batting unit as they bundle them out of 47 runs in just 13.2 overs. A clinical bowling performance from the defending champions puts them in the front seat to boost their NRR. This also happens to be the lowest total England have bowled out any of their opponents in T20I cricket.

JOFRA ARCHER TO SHOAIB KHAN

OUT! GONE! That is it! Quick work from England! A pacey-length delivery on middle, Khan gets across and tries to wrists it away but top edges it to short fine leg. Jos Buttler calls for it, runs across and gobbles it up. OMAN END WITH 47 ON THE BOARD.
