In Short
England need to win their remaining games to advance to the Super 8
England lost to Australia by 8 wickets in their previous game
England also need to improve their net run rate of -1.800

England have a huge task on their hands as they are set to lock horns with Oman in the T20 World Cup 2024 Group B clash on Friday, June 14 at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua. Jos Buttler’s men, placed fourth in the table, cannot afford more slip-ups as they need 2 outright wins to have any chance of qualifying for the Super 8.

Moreover, they also need to take care of their net run rate, which is currently at -1.800 following their 36-run defeat to Mitchell Marsh’s Australia. The Three Lions will also look up the match between Scotland and Australia on June 16. If the Aussies lose to the Scots, England will be knocked out of the competition regardless of the results in their last 2 matches.

England’s bowling hasn’t been at its best by any means. After failing to pick up a single wicket against Scotland, they leaked over 200 runs against Australia. Adil Rashid, currently the No.1 ranked bowler in T20Is, has picked up only 1 wicket and has leaked runs at an economy rate of 11.16.

Oman, on the other hand, have not been at their best under their new skipper, Aqib Ilyas. Having lost all 3 of their matches, they will be playing for pride. With England set to come out all guns blazing, Oman are likely to find themselves in more trouble in their last group match.

ENG vs OMN Head-to-Head

England and Oman are yet to lock horns at the international level.

ENG vs OMN: Team News

Despite not winning any games until now, England have not tinkered with their playing XI. It should not be a surprise if they stick to their team in their penultimate group game. Oman, on the other hand, can give fast bowler Fayyaz Butt a chance.

ENG vs OMN: Pitch Report

The pitch in Antigua has been excellent for batting. Batters are also expected to find it easier in their run-chase. However, spinners are most likely to extract something out of the surface. Both matches went in favour of the chasing teams and hence, teams should opt to field first after winning the toss.

ENG vs OMN: Probable Playing XI

England: Jos Buttler (c & wk), Philip Salt, Will Jacks, Jonny Bairstow, Harry Brook, Moeen Ali, Liam Livingstone, Chris Jordan, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood

Oman: Naseem Khushi, Pratik Athavale (wk), Aqib Ilyas (c), Zeeshan Maqsood, Khalid Kail, Ayaan Khan, Mehran Khan, Rafiullah, Shakeel Ahmed, Kaleemullah/Fayyaz Butt, Bilal Khan
