15.48 EDT

9th over: Oman 35-7 (Shoaib Khan 6, Fayyaz Butt 0) So Adil has 2-0-8-2. This is like the only time my brother and I ever opened together for the 3rd XI at school. We did so badly that we had to play another match just to pass the time.

WICKET! Shoaib c Moeen b Rashid 0 (Oman 33-7)

Adil Rashid may have been getting antsy: he’d gone eight balls without a wicket. But now he has his second as another big leg-break draws another false shot and a regulation edge. Moeen atones for his earlier drop by clinging on coolly enough.

8th over: Oman 32-6 (Shoaib Khan 5, Mehran Khan 0) Wood began his second over with figures of 1-0-1-2, payback time after two bad days at the office. And now he has 2-0-3-3.

WICKET! Ayaan b Wood 1 (Oman 32-6)

Wood does fall over this time – but it doesn’t matter as his fierce pace leads Ayaan Khan to squirt an inside edge into his stumps.

7th over: Oman 30-5 (Ayaan Khan 0, Shoaib Khan 4) Rashid did well too, changing his usual gambit (pushing it through from the front of the hand) to dish up a floaty leg-break, lovely and slow. He then beats Shoaib Khan twice outside off – but, in between, Shoaib fights back with the first good shot since the lone six, a silky square drive for four, stroked off the back foot.

WICKET!! Khalid Kail st Buttler b Rashid 1 (Oman 25-5)

Adil Rashid strikes first ball too! Jos Buttler does well here, first missing the stumping, then having another go and just doing enough to convince the third umpire. Oman may need to try and bat time now.

6th over: Oman 25-4 (Khalid Kail 0, Ayaan Khan 0) If Wood had fallen over, as he often does, he wouldn’t have caught this. As it was, he stayed on his feet and did well to react as poor Zeeshan found his straight push popping up invitingly. Wood made the grab low to his right and smiled his biggest smile since he collected a leather-bound Almanack in the Long Room in April, as one of Wisden’s Five Cricketers of the Year. And then he got another one! Here endeth the Powerplay, with England on top.

And another! Prajapati mistimes a pull and presents Liam Livingstone, at square leg, with the first easy catch of the day.

5th over: Oman 24-2 (Kashyap Prajapati 9, Zeeshan Maqsood 1) Topley continues and there’s nearly a third catch in the ring, as the left-handed Zeeshan chips him just wide of Archer at mid-on. Then the right-handed Prajapati throws his hands at a full ball outside off and gets six! Over gully. A shot in the arm for Oman and a dent in the figures for Topley: 3-0-12-0.

4th over: Oman 16-2 (Kashyap Prajapati 2, Zeeshan Maqsood 0) So Archer has 2 for 12 off his two overs, and Topley has 0 for 4 off his two. Both exemplary in their different ways.

Archer should have his third! Yet again it goes low, and Moeen at first slip gets down well enough but somehow spills it.

Jofra strikes again! And again he has a hand from some sharp fielding, as another slap brings another fine low catch, this one from Will Jacks at backward point.

3rd over: Oman 14-1 (Kashyap Prajapati 1, Aqib Ilyas 7) More tidiness from Topley, despite the Omanis’ attempts at improv. Prajapati gets off the mark at last with a scoop, whereupon Aqib says: “I see your scoop and I raise you a slog-sweep.” But both shots yield only a single.

2nd over: Oman 11-1 (Kashyap Prajapati 0, Aqib Ilyas 5) Jofra Archer joins Topley in a new-ball attack that is mysteriously short of off-spin. And suddenly it’s all happening. A wide! A four! With Athavale going down the track (brave). A catch! (See below.) A bouncer! And a play-and-miss from Aqib, a good batter who has yet to click in this tournament. Another four! A classic cut. And a single to finish.

Meanwhile Phil Bowen has a bone to pick with Brendan Large. “I’m growing tired of reading about England being robbed of a point in their game against Scotland,” Phil fumes. “Scotland were 90 for 0 when rain rescued England.”

A slap to cover, where Phil Salt does superbly to get his fingers under a stinger.

1st over: Oman 1-0 (Pratik Athavale 1, Kashyap Prajapati 0) Topley finds that steep bounce right away and Athavale does well to shovel the first ball away for a single, possibly off the arm but given as a run. Topley then manages to cramp Prajapati, who has been recalled straight after being dropped with scores of 0 and 7. A single and five dots: good start from Topley.

“The weather,” says Nasser Hussain, “is set fair. There was a shower earlier but now it’s blue skies and a breeze.” Does the curse of the commentator apply when someone from Sky is talking about the sky?

Out come the teams, both in red – their top halves anyway. Oman’s trousers are red too, while England’s are blue. One of these decades, cricket will hear about the concept of the second strip. Even the flags, lavishly displayed on the outfield, are quite alike. The Omani national anthem, to my untrained ear, is magnificent but on the long side.

Teams that have won all their games in this World Cup: India, Australia, West Indies and South Africa.

One brings two. “Good evening Tim,” says Krish Krishnamoorthy. “Stepping up to cover the OBO of England vs Oman must be the equivalent to getting a free ticket to watch Waiting for Godot. Who knows, you may be covering history today. Whisper softly...”

Ha. At my school, when we were about 15, we had to read Waiting for Godot round the room. It almost put me off Beckett for life.

The first email comes in from Oman Scandinavia. “Hei Tim,” says Brendan Large. “I’m tuning in from Norway and am now having a slight panic attack. Is there a chance of rain for the game today? If England get knocked out because of 2 washouts it would be very harsh, but also... I want to watch some cricket. So it would be a very very dull result.” It would! The last forecast I saw threatened a few showers, but it seemed to be saying that we would get a game of sorts.

Teams in brief: Topley comes in

As widely predicted, Reece Topley gets his first go of the tournament, replacing Chris Jordan. With his swing and height and left-arm angle, he could have made all the difference against Australia.

Toss: England win and bowl

“Looks a really good wicket,” says Jos Buttler. “But we’d like to know what we’re chasing.” How much will the net run rate prey on his team’s minds, Mike Atherton wonders. “Yeah, a little bit.”

Aqib Ilyas says he would have bowled first too.

Preamble

Evening everyone and welcome to a giant banana skin. A game that should have been a breeze for England is now fraught with danger. It’s not just must-win, it’s must-win-big. After their first two matches of this World Cup, England have no wins, one point, and two old foes sniggering as they see them squirm – Scotland and Australia. Now they meet a new foe in Oman, who will be facing England for the first time ever in international cricket.

England have never successfully defended a World Cup in cricket, football or rugby (not even the women have managed it). So far they haven’t looked remotely like changing that dismal record. Their bowlers were flayed by the Scottish openers, then marmalised by the Aussie ones. Against Scotland, England neither took a wicket nor scored a run. Against Australia, they did both without coming close to winning.

There’s no shame, of course, in losing to the world’s best tournament team. And it was cruel that England’s hopes of bashing 109 in ten overs against Scotland were washed away by the Bridgetown rain. But the upshot is that they are in grave danger of heading for the same embarrassment as when they went to India, eight months ago, as the 50-over world champions.

That said, they’re English – they’re used to being embarrassed. And they now face what are on paper their two easiest assignments, against Oman and Namibia. Oman have even fewer points than England (none), but only because they lost to Namibia in a Super Over.

Both games are at the Viv Richards Stadium in Antigua and, weather permitting, England should win them by a street. The question is: will it be a wide enough street to lead to the Super Eights?

Play is due to start at 3pm local time, 8pm BST. So I hope to see you soon around 7.35pm BST with news of the toss and teams.
