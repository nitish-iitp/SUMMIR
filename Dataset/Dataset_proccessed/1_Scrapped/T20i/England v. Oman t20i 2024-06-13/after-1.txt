In short:
England defeated Oman by eight wickets after completing the quickest run chase in tournament history.The win keeps England's hopes alive of qualifying for the Super Eight stage.
What's next?
England must beat Namibia and rely on Australia defeating Scotland to advance from the group phase.

England needed only 19 deliveries to reach its victory target against Oman and keep its men's T20 World Cup hopes alive in Antigua.

Having won the toss and opted to bowl with the net run-rate in mind, England dismissed Oman for a paltry 47 in 13.2 overs, the fourth lowest total in tournament history.

England took only 3.1 overs to overhaul Oman's total and complete a convincing eight-wicket victory to stay in the race for the Super Eight stage.

The win with 101 balls remaining, and after an hour and 42 minutes, was the fastest in men's T20 World Cup history.

It was not only the magnitude of the win but the speed with which it was achieved that helped improve England's outlook.

The result moved the defending champions up to third in Group B with three points, behind Australia (six points) and Scotland (five points).

Most importantly, England's net run-rate is now 3.08, ahead of Scotland's 2.164.

England took a point from its washed-out match against Scotland and was beaten by 36 runs by Australia. That made it imperative that England not only defeated Oman, but won emphatically to improve its net run-rate and prospects.

"We had a point to prove after the last couple of games," England quick Mark Wood said.

England will next play Namibia on Sunday AEST. Its qualification for the Super Eight stage is still dependent on the outcome of the other group match between Australia and Scotland the same day.

If Scotland wins, it will qualify. England will advance via a superior net run-rate if it beats Namibia, and Australia is victorious.

England's triumph over Oman came in the wake of comments made by Australia fast bowler Josh Hazlewood following his side's defeat of Namibia on Wednesday AEST.

Talking to reporters after Australia secured one of the group's two spots in the Super Eight stage, Hazlewood said he and his teammates would be happy to eliminate England in the preliminary phase to avoid meeting its Ashes rival later in the tournament.

Asked how Australia could do that against Scotland, Hazlewood said: "Not too sure really, whether you get close and just knock it around and drag it out."

Speaking in the lead-up to the Oman match, England's Australia-born coach Matthew Mott played down Hazlewood's comments.

"I am very much hoping it was an off-hand remark by a really good bloke who is having fun," Mott told BBC Sport.

"Knowing Josh, he has got a pretty dry sense of humour.

"I am hoping it was very much tongue in cheek."

While Mott – at least publicly — was not reading too much into what Hazlewood said, the comments drew reaction on social media platform X following England's win.

The BBC's Test Match Special was among those to poke some fun at Hazlewood.

In dismissing Oman at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, England spinner Adil Rashid took 4-11 to be named player of the match, while Jofra Archer and Wood both returned the figures of 3-12.

With the bat, England came out in a hurry and Phil Salt hit the first two balls for sixes before being bowled with the third after Bilal Khan's delivery deflected off the inside edge and onto the wicket.

Will Jacks then went for 5, caught by Kashyap Prajapati off Kaleemullah and England was 2-20 after two overs.

But Jos Buttler (24 not out) and Jonny Bairstow (8 not out) got the job done inside four overs.

"I thought the tone was set really well by the bowlers who managed to pick up those early wickets and restrict them and knock them off," Buttler said.

"Job done today and we've got another big game in two days' time."
