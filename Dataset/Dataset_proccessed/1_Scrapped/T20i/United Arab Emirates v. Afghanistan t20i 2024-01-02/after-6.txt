Earlier in the match, the UAE team struggled to score runs, reaching 126/9 in 20 overs due to a difficult pitch with low bounce and significant turn. The Afghan bowlers, particularly Naveen-ul-Haq (4/20) and spinners Qais Ahmad (3/24) and Azmatullah Omarzai, capitalized well on the conditions. The UAE batters made some inexperienced shot choices, leading to early dismissals. However, late contributions from Ali Nasseer, Akif Raja, and Muhammad Jawadullah helped the UAE reach a competitive total.
The United Arab Emirates bowled well. They were a bit poor in their fielding. Had they controlled their overthrows, things could have been a bit different. Junaid Siddique picked up two wickets but was a bit expensive. Aayan Khan, Muhammad Jawadullah, Ali Naseer, and Dhruv Parashar chipped in with a wicket each.
Najibullah Zadran's heroics at the end made Afghanistan get over the line and win the series! I have to say it was a hard-fought win as they beat the United Arab Emirates by 4 wickets. Chasing a middling score of 128 runs, the Afghan top order was off to a steady start. They were well in control at the halfway stage, but the UAE bounced back and picked up quick wickets right after the drinks break. Najibullah Zadran stepped up in the end and scored a quickfire 28 off just 13 deliveries to get their side well over the line.
