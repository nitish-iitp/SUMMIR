6.38pm So, a very impressive day's work for Bangladesh. As Shakib said, it was about holding their nerve on a very tricky surface, and they did that superbly with grit and determination throughout their XI. Huge congratulations to them, this is a proud day in their development towards two World Cups, in India this winter and in June 2024 too. For England, there's some food for thought after another off-colour display with the bat. That's where this series has been lost, although they are of course lacking a few key members of that World Cup-winning side. We'll be back in Mirpur on Tuesday to see if they can save some face, or slump to a 3-0 defeat. From Miller, Vish and Binoy, good night.

Mustafa Moudi: "Fun Fact: England has won just 2 Bilateral Series (1 each in 2 formats) out of total 9 across formats (including this series), under Buttler since Morgan's Retirement. Also they have lost their first Bilateral Series in Bangladesh. They might be the World Champions in both ODI and T20I but they arent justifying the tag !!"

Jos Buttler: "It was a different game of T20, credit to Bangladesh for out-playing us. No batter ever wants to get out but a tough wicket to start your innings on, We needed someone to stick with Ben Duckett. Outstanding bowling performance, creating pressure and defending a low score. Proud of everyone's efforts."

The Player of the Match is Mehidy Hasan Miraz for an excellent allround display, in particular his four wickets. "I'm really happy, after a long time playing T20. I was a little confused but everyone supported me. Wicket was a little turning, so help for spinner, so good line and length. Keep the ball on the right track."

Shakib Al Hasan: "They had a very good start, but we kept our nerve, a very good team effort. In a tricky game like this it was important to keep our nerve. Shanto ... Mehidy, a superb innings for the team."

Aveir : "What a thriller! Gives me hope that we have what it takes to compete once the big 4 all retire. I have been so engrossed in this game that I forgot it was daylight savings switch in the U.S. tonight, and I have an hour's less sleep than the already little amount I thought I would get. So worth it! "

6.15pm And breathe. It was a low-scoring thriller for much of that chase, but in the end, Bangladesh proved too strong in their own conditions. They've sealed the series with a game to spare, and against the World Champions too. It's their first win in any bilateral series against England, and it's been achieved with two contrasting run-chases. Hugs and handshakes all round from a jubilant home side, most particularly for Shanto, surely the man of the series-elect, after his efforts in both chases to date.

For England, Archer was superb, which is the biggest plus for a depleted team. But 117 was just not enough to defend, and for that Mehidy takes the plaudits after his exceptional spell of 4 for 12.

Jordan to Taskin, FOUR runs

Belted through the covers to seal a famous win! In the end, it was a saunter, as Taskin caps a fine day with the ball with a blazing cameo with the bat!

4
Jordan to Taskin, FOUR runs

Sure enough, smeared through the off side! A huge wind-up, outside his eyeline, though what the hell, carved handsomely over cover, and that's nearly game set and series!

Taskin on strike with two balls remaining. Might be justified in having a go, with Shanto on strike for the final over

18.3
1
Jordan to Shanto, 1 run

Pulled again, more pace on this time, Woakes gathers well and this time just the single to backward square

18.2
2
Jordan to Shanto, 2 runs

Leg-sided, pace off again... but a misfield from Rehan gives them the second! Big error, went for it with one hand when he could have taken time, and Shanto gets back on strike

18.1
4
Jordan to Shanto, FOUR runs

Pulled away for a precious boundary! Slower ball, down the leg side, two men behind square but bissects them both! Huge swing off the momentum there

Sure enough, here's Chris Jordan for his first over. 13 off 12 needed, and Shanto the key man

Archer to Taskin, no run

Sharp bouncer! Taskin ducks as well he might, round the wicket and searing towards his lid. That's a mighty spell from Archer. 3 for 13 are his second-best in T20Is. And second-best of the match too

Graham: "Is Chris Jordan playing as a specialist fielder??" Good point. I wonder if he'll make a late appearance now, with the tail exposed...

17.5
W
Archer to Afif, OUT

Splatters the stumps! Archer cranks the pace back up, close to 92mph, and fired in at the base of off stump. Afif had a flat-footed swing, but he was in no position to combat that. Big moment in this suddenly dicey chase!

Afif Hossain b Archer 2 (3b 0x4 0x6 6m) SR: 66.66
17.4
1
Archer to Shanto, 1 run

More pace on the short ball, reminiscent of his penultimate World Cup Super Over delivery, into the pitch and clawed out to the leg side off the splice

Matthew: "In this era of Bazball, a low scoring T20I can be a thriller! What a world to live in! "

Wild times...

17.3
•
Archer to Shanto, no run

Pushed across the left-hander on a full length, more tricksy variation in pace, and Rashid at backward point secures a precious dot

17.2
1
Archer to Afif, 1 run

Slower ball, Afif watches it well, working with the angle across his bows to nudge the single to deep third

17.1
1
Archer to Shanto, 1 run

Pace on, and pulled without timing out to deep midwicket, back of a length on a tight line outside off

16 off 18... ordinarily it's Bangladesh all the way. But this is not an easy pitch... and Archer will bowl out right now with the main man Shanto on strike

Moeen Ali to Shanto, 1 run

Pressed urgently off the front foot, into the covers for the sharp single

16.5
1
Moeen Ali to Afif, 1 run

Flipped off the legs to the on-side

100 from 100 balls... 16.4 is a notable number these days...

16.4
W
Moeen Ali to Shakib, OUT

Inside-out, and lofted straight to long-off! Moeen claims a crucial strike to just prise this contest back open again. The turn away from the left-hander was ample, and he couldn't control his stroke as Jordan reached back, five metres inside the rope. Mirpur loses its buzz once more

Shakib Al Hasan c Jordan b Ali 0 (3b 0x4 0x6 5m) SR: 0

Archer to Shakib, no run

Fuller length, lashed on the drive, but no timing as mid-off tidies up

15.5
•
Archer to Shakib, no run

Flashes into an uppercut, but can't connect as Archer touches 149.9kph. He's shelved his raw pace at times, but that was brisk!

Enter the skipper, with a series to win

15.4
W
Archer to Mehidy Hasan Miraz, OUT

Mistimes the pull to midwicket! Mirpur falls silent as Mehidy winds across the line but Archer has cranked his pace back up this time. Rashid gobbles the top-edge, very similar to Archer's first wicket. But has Mehidy done enough already?

Mehidy Hasan Miraz c Rashid b Archer 20 (16b 0x4 2x6 19m) SR: 125
