Florence Pugh, known for taking risks in fashion, wore a gorgeous outfit to the Valentino Paris Fashion Week show. Florence's grey jumper has a round neckline embellished in shimmering silver diamantes, full-length sleeves, a cropped midriff-baring hem, and a figure-skimming silhouette.

Florence wore it with an ivory see-through mesh skirt featuring a high-rise waistline, shimmering silver sequins and floral beaded embellishments, a floor-sweeping train on the back, and a bodycon fitting highlighting her frame. She wore the sheer skirt over a low-rise bikini bottom with high-leg cut-outs.
