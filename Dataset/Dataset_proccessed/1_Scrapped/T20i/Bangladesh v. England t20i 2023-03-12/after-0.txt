NEW DELHI: Mehidy Hasan Miraz produced an all-round performance as Bangladesh pulled off another upset four-wicket win over world champions England and took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match T20I series on Sunday.
Mehidy spun the web around the visitors to return impressive figures of 4/12 before playing a crucial 20-run knock to help Bangladesh chase down 118-run target in 18.5 overs.
Bangladesh got off to a disappointing start with both openers back to the pavilion inside the powerplay. But Najmul Hossain Shanto (46 not out) and Mehidy forged a 41-run partnership to lead Bangladesh fightback.
In a tricky game like this it was important to keep our nerve. Shanto… Mehidy, a superb innings for the team,” Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan said.
Jofra Archer dismissed Mehidy and Afif Hossain to end with three wickets in his four overs, but Najmul and Taskin Ahmed were able to chase down the target with seven balls to spare.
Archer’s spell will be one of the few positives that England can take from the match as the speedster continues to improve after his return from a lengthy injury lay-off. Sam Curran, Moeen Ali and Rehan Ahmed also picked up a wicket apiece for England.
Earlier, England, who had never lost a T20I to Bangladesh before this series, had struggled with the bat from the outset and Dawid Malan (5) departed early before fellow opener Phil Salt was caught and bowled by Shakib on 25.
Ben Duckett top-scored for the visitors with a run-a-ball 28 but could not push on and was given little support as Mehidy (4-12) ripped through the middle order on a turning pitch.
“It was a different game of T20, credit to Bangladesh for out-playing us. No batter ever wants to get out but a tough wicket to start your innings on, we needed someone to stick with Ben Duckett,” England captain Jos Buttler said.
“Outstanding bowling performance, creating pressure and defending a low score. Proud of everyone’s efforts.”
Ahmed scored 11 on his T20I debut as England ended on 117 — their eighth-lowest T20I total.
The third and final T20I will be played on Tuesday at the same venue.

India Vs West Indies: In T20 cricket, no one’s favourite: Hardik Pandya | Cricket News

NEW DELHI: India came back from 0-2 down to level the five-match series 2-2 against West Indies with an emphatic nine-wicket victory in the fourth T20I at Lauderhill, Florida on Saturday. The momentum is with them, but skipper Hardik Pandya refused to call themselves as favourites going into the final T20I at the same venue on Sunday.

“In T20 cricket, no one’s favourite. You got to respect the opposition. Tomorrow we turn up and do exactly what we did today,” Hardik said at the post-match presentation.
As it happened: India vs West Indies, 4th T20I

Hardik was all praise for young India openers Shubman Gill (84 not out off 51 balls) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (77 off 47), who destroyed the West Indies attack in a competitive chase of 179-run target. The duo added a record 165 runs, joint most in the shortest format for India for the opening wicket, as they chased down the target in 17 overs.
“Shubman and Yashasvi were brilliant. The way they ran in the heat … and … they finished the job. There is no doubt in their skill set. Going forward, we’ll have to take responsibility as batters and help our bowlers,” the elated captain said.

Regarding his captaincy, Hardik said: “I like to captain how I see the game. I like to go with my instincts. It was our own error in the first game. We didn’t do much different in the next two games. All these games give us a lot of confidence. We had to pull up our socks and play good cricket, that’s exactly what the boys did.”
Hardik also acknowledged the support his team got in Florida.
“There are more Indians here. The way they have been supporting, they make sure that we give them some entertainment,” Hardik said.

West Indies captain Rovman Powell said that they were short by 10-15 runs on this good batting surface.
“It’s a pretty good batting surface. We were maybe 10-15 runs short. Having said that, Hetmyer and Hope played well. We didn’t stick to our plans, you’ll always find yourself under pressure against quality batters. We didn’t bat well in the middle overs. If we can improve against spin, we can do well. It’s 2-2, tomorrow is the final and in the final, I back the West Indies. I am okay and ready to lead the side tomorrow,” Powell said after the match.

4th T20I: How India blew away West Indies for series-levelling victory | Cricket News

NEW DELHI: India made a complete mockery of the 179 chase as Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill‘s belligerent opening stand powered India to a series-levelling nine-wicket victory in the fourth T20I against West Indies in Lauderhill, Florida on Saturday.

Jaiswal and Gill smoked dazzling half-centuries as the duo toyed with the West Indies bowling attack during the chase, helping India cross the finish line without breaking a sweat.
As young gun Jaiswal (84 not out) fired his maiden T20I fifty in the impressive chase, the 21-year-old also became the fourth youngest Indian to score a half-century in the shortest format.

As India bossed West Indies in the fourth game, here’s a look at the key moments of the contest:
Arshdeep’s two-wicket burst in powerplay
As West Indies opted to bat first on a batting beauty, openers Kyle Mayers and Brandon King got off to a brisk start. But left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh cut short Mayers’ stay in the middle, removing the left-hander for 17 in the second over. Arshdeep then got rid of the other opener King (18) in the final over of the powerplay with West Indies managing 55 runs in it.
As It Happened
Kuldeep double-wicket over
Soon after powerplay, Hardik Pandya introduced Kuldeep Yadav into the attack and the left-arm spinner got into action straightaway, removing Nicholas Pooran (1) and skipper Rovman Powell (1) in the 7th over. As West Indies slumped to 57 for 4, India took control of the match.
Hetmyer audacious fifty
As West Indies lost wickets in quick succession, Shai Hope and Shimron Hetmyer did manage to arrest the slide with the 49-run fifth wicket partnership but then Yuzvendra Chahal got rid of Hope in the 13th over to put pressure back on West Indies. Hetmyer however battled on and scored an impressive 39-ball 61 to help his side post a competitive total.
India’s fast start
Chasing a tricky total in the must-win game, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill came out all guns blazing as the duo added 66 runs in the powerplay. Taking the West Indies bowlers to the cleaners, the duo hit boundaries at will as fours and sixes rained in Florida. Gill, who already had a T20I hundred to his name, got to his maiden fifty in the 11th over. Two balls later in the same over, Jaiswal too got to his maiden T20I half-century.
Unstoppable Jaiswal and Gill
Both Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill bossed the West Indies bowlers as Romvan Powell and co. looked absolutely clueless against the young Indian duo. Jaiswal and Gill added 165 runs for the opening wicket, which is now the joint highest opening partnership for India in T20Is. Gill eventually fell in the 16th over but Jaiswal and Tilak Varma ensured no further harm was done as India completed the chase in 17 overs.

I just love to go out and enjoy myself: Yashasvi Jaiswal | Cricket News

NEW DELHI: From 0-2 down, India drew level in the five-match T20I series with a nine-wicket mauling of West Indies in the fourth game in Lauderhill, Florida on Saturday.

Young Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill made a mockery of West Indies bowling in their pursuit of 179 with their 165-run stand for the opening wicket – joint highest for India in T20Is.
The 21-year-old Jaiswal notched up his maiden fifty and went on to score an unbeaten 84 off just 51 balls while Gill chipped in with a brilliant 77 off 47 balls.

Jaiswal, who was adjudged man of the match for his whirlwind knock studded with 11 fours and three sixes, admitted that performing at the highest level is not easy but he loves to cash in on the opportunities that comes his way.
“Of course (international cricket) is not easy but I just love to go out and enjoy myself. I would love to thank Hardik bhai and the support staff, the way they have spoken it really had an impact,” Jaiswal said.

The left-handed batter also spoke about how he approached his innings, saying: “I just try to play how the team needs and how I can express myself. I just think of how quickly I can score and how many runs I can get in the powerplay. Of course reading the wicket and reading the situation, but my intent is always to score runs.”
Playing alongside West Indies players Jason Holder and Obed McCoy in the IPL for Rajasthan Royals helped Jaiswal to read their bowling.
“I have played a lot of balls against them (Holder and McCoy in the IPL), helped me to read them,” he added.
