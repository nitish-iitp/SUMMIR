Keshav Maharaj injured while celebrating during SA vs WI match and requires stretcher to leave field
SABAMARCH 11, 2023CRICKET NEWS

On Saturday, March 11, South Africa secured a whitewash over the West Indies by winning the second Test at The Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg by a whopping 284 runs. This victory marked the ninth consecutive series win for the Proteas over the Windies, maintaining an unbeaten record against them since 1993.

While South Africa’s bowling performance was impressive, the left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj’s injury during the match garnered attention on Day 4. Maharaj took two wickets in the second innings, dismissing Roston Chase and Kyle Mayers.

During the last over of the first session, Maharaj got Mayers out LBW and collapsed while celebrating the wicket. He was subsequently stretchered off the field, and Fox Sports reports that he suffered a left ankle tendon injury.

Returning to the match, Day 4 began with South Africa resuming their innings on 287/7, leading by 356 runs in the second innings. Captain Temba Bavuma continued his impressive knock and scored 172 runs, his first hundred in seven years, with his last century coming in 2016 against England in Cape Town.

South Africa was eventually dismissed for 321 in their second innings, setting a target of 391 runs in the fourth innings for the West Indies. The West Indies openers, Kraigg Brathwaite and Tagenarine Chanderpaul, faced a daunting challenge to win the match.
