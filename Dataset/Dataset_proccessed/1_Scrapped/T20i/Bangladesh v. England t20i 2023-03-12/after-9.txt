Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan: "I thought we bowled really well. They had a good start but we kept ourselves going. Spin restricted them and we did well. In a tricky game like this where this not much to be scored it was important to keep our nerves. All the bowlers and batters did really well."

England captain Jos Buttler: "It was a differerent game of T20 cricket and credit to Bangladesh for outplaying us. No batter ever wants to get out, it was a wicket which was tough to start your innings on. I thought Ben Duckett did well for us and we just needed someone to stick with him.

"I thought it was an outstanding bowling performance. Everyone put their hand up and we bowled without luck at times. More runs and we would have put more pressure on. But credit to Bangladesh."

'Everyone will want Archer'

Former England captain Nasser Hussain is just discussing how England will manage Jofra Archer's fitness after he impressed with a spell of 3-13 in this defeat.

Speaking on Sky Sports, Hussain said: "It will be interesting to see if he plays on Tuesday and then, of course, he goes off to the IPL. I think on his off days there he will be increasing his workloads.

"The challenge for English cricket is he will be wanted by everyone. Jos Buttler an Matthew Mott will want him for the World Cup in India later in the year. Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes will want him in the summer for the Ashes.

"I would say the latter is it's less likely, and I would keep working on his white ball."
