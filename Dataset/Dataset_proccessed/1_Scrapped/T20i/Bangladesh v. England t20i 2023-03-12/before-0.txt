All done and dusted

They can't wait to get out of the Narendra Modi Stadium. Technically, the earliest they could have ended the game was if Australia declared with 17.5 overs remaining, thus giving India 15 overs to bat, which is when both sides could shake hands. That is exactly what they did. Never seen teams run out of a joint that soon. India end winners by 2-1, the fourth straight series between these sides that has ended at that scoreline. Now they will meet each other in the WTC final at The Oval. Thanks for joining us.

Gill and Pujara bowling

A decent first over in Tests for Shubman Gill followed by Cheteshwar Pujara rolling his arm over. It can mean only one thing: we are just waiting to get out of here at the first possible opportunity.

What's the earliest this can end?

That's the question on everyone's mind as we enter the final session of the series. The earliest the Test can be called a draw is either an hour before the close or with 15 overs remaining, whichever comes later. Given there are 32 overs remaining, it will be the latter. It means we have to wait for 17 overs to be bowled.

However, Australia can make it even quicker if they declare with 17 overs left, which means two overs for the changeover.

However, amid all this, Marnus Labuschagne might want to get to a hundred. Australia might not want to declare because the lead might not be enough. So the offer of the draw might have to come from India 17 overs into the session or later.

A session closer to the end

The pitch still refuses to yield as Australia end the second session at 158 for 2, a lead of 67 with 32 overs remaining in the series. Marnus Labuschagne can think of a hundred, going into the tea break unbeaten on 56. Steve Smith hasn't yet opened his account.

For India to entertain a result, they need eight wickets in 18 overs or so.

No. 50 for Axar Patel

Finally a wicket. Travis Head misses out on a century. This is lovely bowling from Axar. Tossing it up, inviting a drive, pitching it in the rough, and going through the gap to hit top of off. Axar has 50 Test wickets now. He has bowled only 2205 balls for it, which gives him an impressive strike rate of 44.1

Australia 62 ahead with 15 minutes left in the penultimate session of the series.

Fifty for Labuschagne

This hasn't been the tour Marnus Labuschagne would have wanted, but he now has a half-century to help Australia save a Test. Plus he is part of a side that has won a Test in India and drawn one. You don't manage it every year in India.

Labuschagne has reached 51, Australia 150, which makes it a lead of 59. The pace of the match is sluggish as tired bodies seek replenishment and treatment. Virat Kohli has been off the field having his back/side looked. The ball also gets changed.

Two personal landmarks and the final drinks awaited.

An hour closer to a draw

A mid-afternoon drinks break now, and the pitch is beating the bowlers into submission. Travis Head has a century for the taking. The bowlers are tiring down. Australia lead by 32. For there to be any excitement, India have to take the next nine wickets for 90 runs.

Travis Head 76, Marnus Labuschagne 37.

Fifty for Travis Head
BCCI

One of the success stories for Australia on this tour is Travis Head, whom nobody rated as a player of spin. Even Australia kept him out in the first Test. Despite what everybody said, it was not an unreasonable call.

Then something similar to what R Sirdhar has confessed to happened. During India's tour of Australia, Ravindra Jadeja didn't even take a concussion test on the field and during a break, Sanju Samson reminded the management of the concussion sub and they got Yuzvednra Chahal on the field and ended up winning the match.

Here David Warner got hit on the head, didn't take a concussion test on the field, but Australia asked for a concussion sub during a break, paving the way for Head to open. In all likelihood, both Jadeja and Warner had late onset of concussion symptoms. They also had other injuries that ruled them out of the series.

Be that as it may, Head has found an ideal slot for himself with his aggressive opening on pitches where runs are at a premium. He was instrumental in the nervous chase in Indore too. And now he has a fifty as he guides Australia towards safety.

Australia have also got into the lead with three-and-a-half hours remaining in the Test.

Kohli-Menon, the greatest bromance
BCCI

The media - social and otherwise - is always too eager to put Virat Kohli in bromances because - we get it - it gets views and retweets and likes and whatnot. One of the lesser appreciated relationships he has had on the field is with umpire Nitin Menon. Two highly skilled experts at what they do caught in a competitive environment. So sometimes it has kept Kohli from appreciating Menon's skill as he has expressed his ire at marginal calls going against him. However, at a quieter time today, he showed he can laugh about it too.

After Australia survived a close call with Menon umpiring, Kohli could be heard from slip: "Would have been out if I was the batter." Menon smiled and participated in the banter by raising his finger.

Meanwhile Australia have got to within seven of levelling the scores. This one is meandering towards a draw now.

India through to the WTC final

That's the mundane, short story of it. On the field, though, New Zealand and Sri Lanka played a Test for the ages. New Zealand won by two frames on the last ball of the Test with two wickets in hand. I don't envy those covering the match. By the end of it, the two WTC finalists are identified: Australia and India.

In Ahmedabad, things are more serene. Australia resume their quest for safety.

Australia closer to safety

Australia have batted the first session out for the loss of Matt Kunhemann. Things are happenin g but perhaps a day too late. Thirty-nine false responses in 36 overs. Just the one wicket. Australia have got to within 18 of India's lead.

While the draw looks the likeliest result in Ahmedabad, the Test is alive and kicking in Christchurch. Asitha Fernando's yorkers have brought Sri Lanka back into the contest. The numbers that matter: 36 balls, 44 runs, five wickets.

India sense something

The ball has begun to do things but is it too late? India have managed to draw 29 false responses in 29 overs, which is much better than in the first two innings of this Test. However, they have got only one wicket, that of the nightwatcher. Half an hour to lunch, and Australia are 37 behind with nine wickets in hand.

Over in Christchurch, it seems almost certain India will get the favourable result. There are just 11 overs left with seven wickets in hand. The only side that can win there is New Zealand, who need 73 runs now. Thrilling finish, but one that is sure to end Sri Lanka's run and propel India into the final.

Australia 58 behind

Australia have batted out the first hour for the loss of just Matt Kuhnemann. There is not enough in the pitch to create continuous trouble for the batters. They have managed to score 31 runs this period, which brings down the deficit to 58.

Kuhnemann could have survived

As I said earlier, a specialist batter would have definitely reviewed that call because that ball didn't straighten at all. The projection shows it was missing leg.

Now, this is the problem with DRS. Once it is handed over to the teams, it becomes a competitive tool rather than an umpiring once. Which means they don't use it on a lower-order batter.

At any rate, the non-striker should have been telling Kuhnemann the replays will return an umpire's call at best, which means they will not lose the review. India won't mind it one bit.

Twenty minutes into the day, R Ashwin has Matt Kuhnemann lbw. A specialist batter would have definitely used a review there. Offbreak with a square seam, lands on the leather more than the seam, and goes straight on. No hesitation from Nitin Menon in raising the finger. Australia 14 for 1, trailing by 77.

No Usman Khawaja still. Marnush Labuschagne has come in at No. 3.

Iyer's injury doesn't sound good

As ever, cryptic updates from the BCCI, but this doesn't sound good. "Shreyas Iyer will take no further part in this Test," says the board. "A specialist opinion will be sought."

It might be fair to assume he is out for at least the ODI series against Australia.

An eye on Christchurch

Far far away in New Zealand, the weather might have given India the push to get into the WTC final anyway. Only 50 overs were possible on the final day. Sri Lanka need to win that series 2-0 to deny India the final. New Zealand have 32 overs to bat out the draw there with seven wickets in hand.

Day 5 - Is there life in this Test yet?

"Kohli got to three figures yesterday," says Karthik Krishnaswamy from Ahmedabad. "Crowd might be struggling to get there today."

If word goes around that India are taking wickets, there might be some who might rush in. There isn't much life in the pitch, but the match situation can do things to you. Can India get it done? The good thing for Australia is that they are behind by only 88, which means they can start getting into the lead soon.

India can't lose

We have reached stumps on day four. Australia have survived the day with Usman Khawaja unavailable to open today. They opened with Matt Kuhnemann and Travis Head. R Ashwin came close to getting Kuhnemann, but KS Bharat dropped him. India end the day 88 ahead with all of Australia's wickets standing. They will need to bowl Australia out in two sessions tomorrow to give themselves a chance to win. However, only 19 wickets have fallen in the first four days.

The fourth day belongs to Virat Kohli, who ended a 41-innings century drought with a disciplined and determined 186. It was a day when Axar Patel and KS Bharat scored quickly around Kohli to take India to a place of suc safety that they can't lose the Test from here. We will see you tomorrow to see if India can perform a miracle tomorrow.

Kohli misses a double

Well Virat Kohli doesn't continue it for too long. That is to his credit. He doesn't want it to be about his double at the cost of the interest of the team. Tries a big slog-sweep, gets a top edge, caught at deep midwicket for 186. An innings of exemplary discipline and concentration. He still has seven doubles, which is the joint-fourth-highest, behind only Bradman, Sangakkara and Lara. India's innings ends at 571 with Shreyas Iyer absent. They lead by 91. About 18 minutes left today plus a whole day tomorrow. Can India make something out of this?

It's all about the double-century now

Australia won't mind this period of play one bit. They have the field back, Virat Kohli - in his 180s and with the last man in - is turning down singles and unable to find the boundary. This takes time out of the game without letting India inflate their lead. The longer this goes on, the fewer the overs Australia will have to bat out for a draw.

Diamond duck for Umesh Yadav

Running out of partners, Virat Kohli tells Umesh Yadav even before facing the third ball of the over that he will play with soft hands into the leg side and take two. Umesh is ready accordingly. Kohli does exactly as promised, but it is still timed too well, and Umesh is caught short by a direct hit at the non-striker's end. Still no Shreyas Iyer. Mohammed Shami walks in at No. 10. India 89 ahead.

We are now infomred Iyer is not present at the ground. So this could well be the last partnership for India if a wicket falls tonight.

The Test slows down again

Not just in terms of runs. There is hardly any play happening. The Australian fielders are tired, the breaks between overs are getting longer, and now Virat Kohli is cramping and getting treatment. As a result we have 14 overs remaining with just 18 minutes left in the day. So it is a given that the extra half hour will slapped on top of it, but we will still not get today's allotment in. India lead by 84, Kohli is 17 short of a double-century.

Axar Patel continues to bat to the team plan of scoring quickly as he drives at a ball that is not quite there. Gets an inside edge, and Mitchell Starc has a wicket. There won't be a maiden Test hundred for him here. Gone for 79 off 113. India 555 for 6 now. Another 106 overs to go, India lead by 75. This wicket is just what Australia needed to slow down India's march towards a declaration.

Still no Shreyas Iyer. Here is R Ashwin.

Might India declare tonight?

Arguably for the first time in the Test, the batters are imposing their will on the proceedings. Axar Patel in particular. Since the drinks break, he has scored 26 off 11 balls, including three slog-swept sixes off Matt Kuhnemann. He is on 78 now, and within sight of a maiden Test hundred. India lead by 71 with 108 overs left in the match. I still don't think it would make sense to declare today. They are better off looking at giving Australia 80 overs to so to survive, and target a big lead by then.

Classic Virat Kohli as he gets pace on the ball from Cameron Green. Proper limited-overs style manipulation of the fields. First a cover-drive to one outside off, but well away from the body, and using the wrists to play it in front of sweeper-cover. And then the shuffle across to flick a similar ball past midwicket. Runs flowing now. India reach 500. Lead by 20 with 115 overs left in the match.

Much more intent from India in the middle session as they added 110 runs in 27 overs. Virat Kohli, who ended his Test century drought, was happy to play anchor with KS Bharat and Axar Patel doing a majority of the scoring. India have pretty much made sure they can't lose the match from here. How much can they push the scoring the last session today in order to give Australia a nervous third innings to bat out a draw? Right now India are just eight behind Australia's 480.

Australia's pace attack

Here's Andrew McGlashan on them:

"Even taking into account the surfaces played on in this series, it was has been, up to now, one to forget for Australia’s quicks bowlers. Pat Cummins, Scott Boland, Mitchell Starc and Cameron Green have, as of drinks in the afternoon of the fourth day, managed just four wickets. That equals the fewest an Australia pace attack has managed in a series (excluding one-off Tests). It also stands as the third-highest overall average for a series and fourth-highest strike-rate. While the spinners have dominated, it probably can't just be brushed off. Earlier in the series, Karthik Krishnaswamy noted how India's quicks had outbowled their counterparts, a continuation of a home trend. Today, Cameron Green was taken for 21 off an over as he tried to employ a short-ball tactic after lunch and Mitchell Starc, who wasn't used until the afternoon session, didn't quite get things right when given a three-over burst."

No. 28 for Virat Kohli
Getty Images

Virat Kohli scored 27 of those in his 141 Test innings, but it has taken 42 innings and upwards of three years for the 28th one to arrive. It is among his slowest hundreds, off 241 balls. His slowest was in Nagpur in 2012-13, off 289 balls.

The smile has never left his face, but this one is extra sweet. He removes the helmet, kisses his wedding ring, and accepts all the applause. International century No. 75.

It has been an innings of determination and pure reaction to what is bowled at him on a pitch where it has been difficult to both get out or force the pace. Nineteen false responses in his innings, a higher rate than other batters, but the ball ha turned just that bit more since he has come out to bat.

Finally one jumps at KS Bharat, who is lunging in defence, and we have the rare bat-pad catch. India 393 for 5 with Bharat gone for 44 off 88. Virat Kohli only two away from a hundred.

A little more urgency in run-scoring in the second hour of the first session, but we are still not watching anything that might raise any hopes of a result. A total of 73 runs scored in 32 overs. Virat Kohli has just added 29 to his overnight but is now within touching distance of a much-awaited 28th Test century.

India go into lunch at 362 for 4, still a 118 behind. At this rate it might be well into the evening side when India get into a lead. At the rate the wickets are falling, it looks unlikely Australia will get a big lead either. The pitch has neutered both the batting and the bowling.

A word of praise for Murphy

Here's Andrew McGlashan on Australia's find of the tour, Todd Murphy.

"Todd Murphy produced another excellent spell this morning. It was good to see him given the ball first up having waited until the 32nd over of the innings to get his initial bowl. For someone so young and inexperienced his control throughout the series has been outstanding. Today he sent down a spell of 10-3-19-1. Those three maidens came in consecutive overs and two of them were against Virat Kohli in a continuation of one of the duels which has stood out over these four Tests. It may be a little while until Murphy gets another opportunity in Test cricket – it seems unlikely conditions in England during June and July will call for two spinners – and Nathan Lyon has a few years ahead of him as long as he wants to keep playing. The only home Test that may occasionally call for a twin spin attack is the SCG. Now, though, Australia can have confidence that when the transition between eras does come, they should be well-served by Murphy."

Virat Kohli has scored a few 70s since his last Test century, against Bangladesh in 2019, and now he has slowly inched out of the dreaded 70s. Australia have given him nothing to score off, and he has been happy to defend. Two-three balls have misbehaved, but he has done well to keep them out.

One of them has gone for four, one has fallen just wide of mid-on, and the final one straight into mid-on's lap. He is out for 28 off 84. india 309 for 4.

Day 4 - A hundred for Kohli?
BCCI

It has been a while since Virat Kohli scored a hundred in Tests. There hasn't been a better opportunity either: a slow flat pitch, defensive bowling and all the time in the world. He starts the day on 59. For a bigger picture of the match, I quote from Andrew McGlashan as we start day 4.

It’s a slightly more overcast, hazy day but the sun is starting to burn through. Can either side force a result or are we heading for a lesser-spotted draw? India’s best route feels like batting throughout today and leaving Australia with one of those nothing-to-gain third innings on the final day. For the visitors, they really need a lead of around 100 to work with but that looks unlikely at the moment. There has never been a sense of a clatter of wickets in this match. It could come down to whether Steven Smith wants to roll the dice at some stage, although Australia need to bowl India out first.

BCCI

Only three wickets have fallen on the third day, which makes it 13 wickets in three days. What's more, the number of wickets have reduced as the Test has gone on: 6, 4, 3. India end 191 behind with seven wickets in hand. How will we manage a result here? We will see tomorrow. I leave you with a teaser from the end-of-the-day report. See you tomorrow: same place, same time.

Second week into the third month, Shubman Gill scored his fifth international century of the year to lead India’s response to Australia’s 480. For long periods, Australia did well to keep a lid on the scoring rate, but Gill was not to be denied for too long: his 128 off 235 was a contrast to the 152 the others managed off 361 balls between them.

India ended the third day 191 behind with seven wickets in hand. Virat Kohli scored his first fifty since the Cape town Test at the start of last year, and ended the day with the promise of a hundred.

Fifty for Kohli

It has taken 107 balls, but Virat Kohli has looked fairly comfortable after the initial nervous period just before tea. He has not looked to force the pace, but has just reacted to what has been bowled at him. There haven't been many freebies, and the fields have denied him runs. India 269 for 3.

Eight overs still remain in the day as we go past the regulation close of play. We might not get all the 90 overs in today if Australia do claim the new ball and go to pace at some point. This old ball is doing the job for Australia, though: this stand has added just 21 runs in 13.2 overs. Kohli is on 48, closing in on a milestone. India 266 for 3.

Gill finally gets out

It takes a lapse in concentration as Shubman Gill goes back to a full offbreak, and is trapped right in front. He is out for 128 off 235 balls. He had been cramping and getting treatment between overs. A remarkable innings, though: this was just the 10th false response he offered during his 235-ball stay at the wicket. In comes Ravindra Jadeja with a little over left to the new ball becoming available. India 245 for 3.

India have batted 75 overs out for their score of 228 for 2, which means Australia can take the new ball in five overs' time. I am not sure they will, though, because all the quick scoring in this Test has happened against the new ball.

Should Starc be bowling over the wicket?
Getty Images

Shiva Jayaraman has taken the analysis of Starc creating rough for Lyon deeper. This is what he says:

Nathan Lyon had taken 29 wickets against right-handed batters at an average of 31.4 in Tests in India before this tour. With Mitchell Starc in the Australia side, he had averaged 34.1 and without him, 28.2. At first glance, these numbers do seem to suggest that Starc being in the side, or bowling from over the wicket to create rough, is not material to the offspinner’s effectiveness.

The wickets in the first-three matches of the series had so much for the spinners that Lyon took 17 wickets at an average of 16.64 against the right handers. Lyon didn’t need anyone to create a rough for him to trouble batters.

However, the flat wicket in Ahmedabad has brought up the question as to why Starc shouldn’t be bowling from over the wicket more to create a rough outside India’s right-handed batters and thereby help Lyon. Superficially, the numbers don’t seem to support this theory. But dig deeper, and the story is a little different – 11 of Lyon’s 29 wickets against the right handers in India before this tour have come after Starc has sent down at least five overs from over the wicket, and these have come at an average of 26.1 apiece. At all other times (when Starc hasn’t been in the XI, or when he hasn’t bowled as much from over the wicket), Lyon has 18 wickets at an average of 34.7.

The number of balls Starc has to bowl to create a rough good enough for Lyon to exploit might differ depending upon the nature of the wicket, but numbers do suggest that it’s a ploy worth exploring.

No free review this time

Alex Carey has been pretty clever all series in whipping the bails off whenever a batter is beaten off spin. Because if he can get the stumping reviewed, the catch gets reviewed automatically without using the player review.

Steve Smith's reactions during the discussion with Carey are cute. He desperately wants to go for it, but he also wants to trust Carey, who doesn't support him. Carey eventually is right. The session begins with Murphy and Lyon.

The Indian crowds!

This is such a clear demonstration of what they want. Cheteshwar Pujara is given out lbw, he reviews, and the crowd cheers when they see the replay of the ball missing the bat. And then during the DRS review, they keep chanting "Kohli, Kohli." And then the loudest cheer of the day comes about at the confirmation that Pujara is out. India 187 for 2.

Kohli gets to play four balls before tea, and either edges or misses three of those. This is a timely break for him. Australia have bowled really well in this session: 59 runs and a wicket. They haven't been able to deny Gill a hundred, though.

Shubman Gill takes the bow as gracefully as he bats. There has been a period of quiet in this session but he has broken free again with four quick boundaries. The fifth of these is a sweep over the leg slip. This is Test century No. 2. This is the year of Gill. He has offered false responses to just nine of the 193 balls he has faced.

Australia keep India in check

The first hour of the afternoon has been attritional with Australia bowling to one side of the field. An hour in which Shubman Gill has scored just 11, and Cheteshwar Pujara 12. Here is Andrew McGlashan with his analysis of how Australia are going about their job.

Australia have some reasonably recent memories of trying to forge an opening with the ball in conditions such as these. It has a similar feel to the final Test against Pakistan last year – albeit there is a bit more spin on offer than in Lahore – when the home side were well placed in response to Australia’s first-innings total. Then Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins blew the game open with devastating reverse swing. Starc has tried to find some movement in this session with a spell from around the wicket but there has been precious little on offer so far. Steven Smith is going through his various playbooks in the field; Nathan Lyon has operated with a 7-2 leg-side field to Cheteshwar Pujara as Australia try to get him in similar manner to the second innings in Indore. The surprising aspect from Australia’s tactics has been how little Todd Murphy has been used so far. He produced the most unplayable delivery of the day so far when one turned and bounced through Gill’s gate but as of now he’s had just three overs.

Usually you start a session with two men likeliest to get you a wicket. I don't think Cameron Green is that man, but Australia have opened the session with him and Lyon. Shubman Gill plays a beautiful on-drive wide of mid-on in Green's first over since lunch. India 136 for 1.

Lunch it is

India take that first session with 93 runs for the loss of Rohit Sharma's wicket. Shubman Gill has been sublime in his unbeaten 65 off 119, and Chetshwar Pujara has been, well, Cheteshwar Pujara in his 22 off 46. The odd ball has misbehaved, which will become a good sign for India if they can get themselves into a lead.

It has been perplexing that Mitchell Starc has bowled around the wicket more than over, which denies their offspinners the rough. Is it possible Australia are also thinking of denying R Ashwin the rough when he bowls next?

India 129 for 1 at lunch.

It has taken till the 32nd over for Todd Murphy to be introduced into the attack. India are 107 for 1, looking not as comfortable as Australia did, but also showing more urgency thus leaving themselves a little more suspect. That doesn't mean they look in any serious concern.

Australia drag things back

The first hour is done with India adding 45 runs for the loss of one wicket. That's not how it started when Shubman Gill and Rohit Sharma batted comfortably. The first five overs produced largely comfortable 28 runs, but since then Nathan Lyon and Matt Kuhnemann have exercised some control. Two balls have disturbed the surface. Cheteshwar Pujara's start hasn't been very comfortable. The last nine overs: 17 runs, one wicket.

You could call it a loose stroke. Ever since Australia have gone spin at both ends, they have exercised control, and the odd ball has done that rare bit of naughtiness. Kuhnemann drops a touch short, Rohit Sharma tries to punch it, but sends it straight to short extra cover in the air. It might have stopped a touch, but it is a bit of a risk to play this so forcefully. India 74 for 1.

Starc, Lyon open the day

As expected, Australia start the day with Mitchell Starc and Rohit Sharma, but the one surprise is that Starc is bowling around the wicket. He is also going cross-seam probably to see if one side can be roughed up for reverse.

In his second over of the day, Starc moves back over the wicket. Shubman Gill has unleashed a lovely cover-driven four already. Followed by another incredible shot. Starc is bowling short with a field set for the short ball on the on side. So Gill backs away and slaps a short ball through mid-off for three.

India 52 for 0 in 13 overs, Gill 32 off 42.

Day 3 - How will India respond?

Big batting day for India. As R Ashwin said yesterday, he wouldn't want to be batting today. Not only will India want to bat long, they will want to do so at a quick pace so that they can give themselves a shot at victory. Australia will want the exact opposite. They will be hoping Mitchell Starc creates rough for the two offspinners, who can then get it to turn back in and trouble a right-hand-heavy batting order. Welcome to another exciting day of Test cricket.

India fight back

A classic see-saw Test contest, but India will be pleased with how the day has ended. They have reached 36 for 0 in the 10 overs available including a six in the last over that led to a hunt as the ball found its way under the white sheets next to the sight screen.

Australia had a great first session, but Ashwin took three wickets in the afternoon to win India the session. Then Todd Murphy and Nathan Lyon frustrated India with a 70-run ninth-wicket stand. With the third new ball, Ashwin took the last two to end with figures of 6 for 91 at under two an over.

Special efforts from Cameron Green and Usman Khawaja, but the3 day belongs to Ashwin, whose quality shone through on the first flat track of the series. See you tomorrow.

Ashwin ends with six
BCCI

What a shift R Ashwin has out in. Lovely dip and drift to take the outside edge of Nathan Lyon to end with immense figures of 47.2-15-91-6. The skill of Ashwin has shown through on the first flat pitch of the series. When you go for underprepared pitches, you tend to take that skill out because then it becomes mostly about firing the ball in.

Australia have still got 480 on the board. They will not be extremely disappointed, but India have reason to be pleased with their toil. Despite 168 overs in the field, they have conceded just 480, which still leaves them an opening in this Test.

India have 10 overs to bat this evening.

And it is R Ashwin who gets India the wicket. Nice drift and drop, and then the ball goes straight on to miss the inside edge and trap Todd Murphy lbw. That's a five-for No. 32 for Ashwin, now level with James Anderson at the sixth spot. His figures: 46.3-14-91-5. A stellar effort.

Just after tea, we know who the unofficial vice-captain of India is. Cheteshwar Pujara reviews what looks to most is not-out for missing leg, but the replays and the projection prove him right. This one is hitting the leg stump. Usman Khawaja, finally missing one off the back foot, is done in after 422 balls, the sixth-longest innings by a visiting batter in India. At 611 minutes, it is the third-longest by minutes.

Australia 409 for 8. Axar Patel has his second wicket of the series.

Ashwin's different load-up

We have noticed it just now so not sure when he went to this but R Ashwin has been bowling slightly differently. His high load-up, well above his head, has now given way to a lower one, around the chin. I know that when he gets high and his elbows stick out, he is trying to spin the ball harder. Today he could be looking for some overspin, but who knows. Meanwhile Australia get to 400 for the loss of seven wickets.

The first job is done in the air. Mitchell Starc gets a full stride in, but the ball has dropped enough on him to pitch out of his reach. And then the lack of turn creates the inside edge for short leg to catch. Ashwin 35.3-9-77-4 on a flattie. Masterful bowling. Australia 387 for 7, and now we are into the shaky last three of Australia.

No wicket for 60 overs, then R Ashwin takes two in one over, and the reward is to vacate the bowling end for Mohammed Shami. Surely there is some method to this?

Shami gets a hint of reverse to beat Mitchell Starc twice in the over. And it is drinks. So we will have to wait and see if Ashwin will bowl from the other end.

Just shows you how good the bowling has generally been. That slow run rate has been justified. The moment someone tries to impose himself, he takes a big risk and is out. R Ashwin bowls a lovely offbreak outside off, inviting a big shot, Carey goes for it, but is nowhere near the pitch of the ball, and skies one to point. Ashwin has now taken out Carey five times for 25 runs in 40 balls in Test cricket.

How good has Khawaja been?

Let Shiva Jayaraman answer the question.

Usman Khawaja’s numbers in the subcontinent by themselves are very impressive. At lunch on Day 2, Khawaja has made 1282 runs at an average of 55.7. Among batters from the SENA countries who have scored at least a 1000 runs in the subcontinent, only Stephen Fleming, Mike Hussey and David Gower have averaged better than Khawaja.

However, what the average doesn’t tell us is how difficult conditions and how good the bowlers were in the matches the batter got these runs. One way to get an idea of this is to compare the batter’s average with others in the team.

In innings where Khawaja has batted in the subcontinent, the other Australia batters in the top seven have averaged 28.61. Khawaja has averaged 1.95 times the other top-order Australia batters in innings when he has batted. Among 34 batters from SENA countries who have scored at least 1000 runs in the subcontinent, Khawaja’s multiple is the second highest. Stephen Fleming tops this list with a multiple of 2.50, also perhaps because he often played with a New Zealand batting order that wasn’t as good in the subcontinent as the current Australia teams is. Khawaja though hasn’t had this factor prop him up, considering Steven Smith is fourth on this list with a multiple of 1.65.

In the 113rd over of the innings, Ravindra Jadeja gets some excitement out of a wide line bowled from over the wicket to Usman Khawaja. One turns in sharply to take the inside edge for four. Another goes straight on to beat the outside edge. Can India build something from this? Australia 313 for 4.

Umesh Yadav into the sixth over of a spell despite having gone for 25 in five. In a five-man attack, it does beg the question if the most profligate bowler needs such a long spell.

After the first 13 overs of the day go for just 25 runs, Umesh Yadav provides the release to Australia with two leg-side boundaries for Usman Khawaja in his first two overs. His figures are now 17-2-73-0. India have bowled 17 overs in the first hour and drawn just eight mistakes from the matters. Australia have added 41 for no loss. They seem happy to not go out of their way to push the game forward. Possibly because they are not that confident in their lower orderA?

Australia sneak ahead

Thanks to that new-ball spell during which Cameron Green helped them plunder 54 runs in nine overs, Australia have got their noses ahead on a tightly fought day. They end at 255 for 4 with Green unbeaten on 49 off 64. In those last 45 minutes, India just veered away from what has made them a great Test side. We leave you with a teaser from my end-of-the-day report.

Australia managed only the fourth opening stand of 50 or more for a visiting side in India in the last five years. Umsan Khawaja and Steve Smith batted through the middle session, the first wicketless session of the series, the most comfortable any batting side has been in a session against India in India in the last 10 years. Khawaja scored a fine, patient hundred, only the sixth against India in India in the last five years.

Yet it was India who controlled which way the game headed for most parts of the day after losing the toss on a flat pitch. Only to lose the gamble with the new ball at the end of the day to hand Australia slight advantage. Khawaja ended unbeaten on 103 having brought up the milestone in the last over of the day, and Cameron Green feasted on the new ball to score 49 in 64 in an 85-run stand that started after the loss of two wickets for 19 runs.

Hundred in the last over of the day
Associated Press

More than six hours at the wicket, 246 balls faced, and Usman Khawaja gets to his hundred in the last over of the day. Just the 13 false responses over such a long innings. Well played, Khawaja.

That is the first over with the new ball, bowled by Umesh Yadav. Also the costliest over of the day. I am not sure why they have taken the new ball so early, and have given it to a fast bowler.

India take the new ball

The last five overs have gone for just three runs but India have taken the new rock at the end of the 81st over. Nine overs to go in the day, Australia 203 for 4.

I am surprised they have done so. They used to wait for the last four overs or so on such days because you ideally want fresh bowlers with the new ball so as to make sure there is no damage if the pitch doesn't do much for you. That used to give them two shots at it: in the evening and in the morning.

Quicker pace in the session

Time for the final drinks break of the day. The game has moved along in thus last hour with 42 runs coming and also two wickets falling. Despite having been in control for most of the day, Australia find themselves having to work hard to retain parity because of their slower run-rate. They are 191 for 4 in 80 overs. the final hour will become big if India claim the new ball, but from my experience of having seen this side operate, they will take the new ball with only four or so overs left in the day so as to get two bites at the cherry. Australia 191 for 4. Usman Khawaja looking immoveable on 80 off 211.

What a delightful day of bowling it has been from India. You can't overly attack with the field, but India have kept the stumps in play, not letting Australia get away at all. With a 70-over-old ball, Shami gets one to hold its line, and beats the outside edge of Peter Handscomb to sent the off stump on a walk. All of a sudden, it is 170 for 4. India performing like a well-oiled bowling unit here.

Jadeja vs Smith
7
Number of times Ravindra Jadeja has Steve Smith in Tests. Stuart Broad has got him nine times, James Anderson and R Ashwin eight each. It makes sense too because these three sides play against each other the most. Jadeja is the only one among these to average under 30 against Smith. And nobody has found Smith's timber as often as Jadeja: four times.

Out of nowhere

A drop in concentration from Steve Smith. Not a big error, but on this day, enough to get out. Just after tea, he pushes defensively at one from Ravindra Jadeja, only slightly away from the body, gets an inside edge, onto the pad, and softly into the wicket. Hard enough to dislodge the bail. India's persistence spell after spell has paid off. They have three wickets in just 28 false responses. Now it is 151 for 3. If India can add on top of this, they are right back in it. Smith gone for 38 off 135.

Easiest in 10 years?

Number of sessions of 20 overs or more in the last 10 years in India in which batters had higher control percentage than that middle session: India vs Bangladesh, day 2, Indore, 2019-20. India batted in that session so this is the least trouble a visiting batting side has been in a session in India in 10 years

First wicketless session
Associated Press

First full wicketless session of the series as Australia go into tea at 149 for 2. The scoreboard says that, but you have to commend India for bowling with discipline. On a flat track, they have not just bowled 62 overs in two sessions, they have also conceded at under 2.5 an over. Just the six false responses in 33 overs of bowling in that session. It also shows the batters can trust the pitch enough to wait for the bad ball. Except that not enough have arrived. Can Australia break India's resistance down in the next session? Or can India find some reward for tight bowling? We will soon find out.

It haas taken him 146 balls, but Usman Khawaja has got to a half-century, his third in the series. He has read the conditions well, and knows that there is not going to be that inevitable with his name on it. So He can trust it, and wait for the loose balls, which have been few and far between. Australia 128 for 2, runs coming quicker in the second hour of the second session.

Australia pitch in

Not great signs for India that in the one full hour since lunch, they have drawn only one false response from the batters. However, it is a good sign that they have conceded just 35 in that time, in 17 overs. So in effect, they are bowling so well that even without help from the pitch they are telling the batters they will have to take some risk if they are to score quicker. Overall run-rate only 2.39 on a good batting pitch and despite only two wickets lost in 46 overs. But India will have to keep this kind of control and intensity on for long. Australia 110 for 2.

Double change

With 21 trouble-free runs in the first eight overs of post-lunch session, India have had to go back to R Ashwin. Jadeja bowled four overs for 14 runs post lunch. Immediately, Ashwin bowls a maiden, and also Axar Patel replaces Umesh Yadav. Australia 96 for 2.

The Axar question
14
Number of spells Axar Patel has bowled this series for just 40 overs. That is the problem with Axar: he looks like he needs long spells under his belt, but he has not provided enough control or penetration to be bowling long spells. Ideally he would have played a Ranji game before the series, but he had personal commitments, which is fair enough.

How important was that second hour for India?

The answer to it lies in the other question: how big was that first hour? It was a rare dominating opening stand against India in India as Shiva Jayaraman has worked out. On that note we start the second session with Ravindra Jadeja getting a change of ends. Umesh Yadav will share the attack.

In recent times very rarely have visiting openers had India on the mat like Travis Head and Usman Khawaja had them in the first hour. Since the beginning of 2018 and before this Test, opening partnerships of visiting teams had averaged a poor 15.7 runs in India – easily the lowest among countries that have hosted more than one Test in this period (India’s first wicket has averaged 50.9 in these matches). The next-worst country for the opening wicket for away teams is West Indies, where the average opening stand has been broken for 20.3 runs. Exactly half of the 38 opening partnerships by visitors in India had been broken before they could add 10 runs. As many as eight opening stands had not bothered the scorers. Only three of those 38 opening stands had managed to reach 50 and each of them have come in the first innings. One of these was 151 by New Zealand in Kanpur on a rare lifeless track offered by the hosts. New Zealand managed to draw that match. Rory Burns and Dom Sibley added 63 for England’s in the first innings of the first Chennai Test in 2020-21 – a match that the visitors won. The third one came in this series in Delhi where David Warner and Khawaja added 50 runs laying a platform for a competitive first-innings total on that pitch. In that Test too, the visitors were well placed to win before their collapse on the third morning. Even on pitches tailor-made to suit the home team in India, visiting teams have had a fighting chance if they have started well in their first dig. This Ahmedabad wicket has looked like it will demand a lot more from bowlers than the earlier pitches seen in this series. Australia would’ve wanted Head to put a dearer price on his wicket here. They had the chance to finish ahead in the first session.

Australia 75 for 2 at lunch
BCCI

Hard-fought Test in which the quality of R Ashwin shone through, and Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammed Shami supported him superbly. After Australia's start of 56 for 0 in the first session, India have pulled things back with just 19 runs and two wickets in the next 15 overs. Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith are the unbeaten batters. Ashwin has had a great session with 10-4-18-1 with not more than two easy balls. Jadeja is 4-2-6-0 and Shami 8-2-14-1.

That it is a good pitch is obvious in how only 20 balls out of 172 have created a false response. Australia will be disappointed they have lost one wicket too many, but that is the skill of Shami. Just that little bit of late movement, and he had Labuschagne bowled.

We'll be back shortly.

Excellent bowling change

Despite a good start of 4-1-6-0 from Ravindra Jadeja, Rohit Sharma goes to Mohammed Shami. My suspicion is, they have seen the ball might be ready for reverse. Two balls in Shami has found the inside edge of Marnus Labuschagne, and then the wicket. Australia 72 for 2 now. The last half hour has been full of control for India. Just 16 runs in eight overs, and they have brought them two wickets.

Ashwin dismisses Head

It has been bowling with excellent control from R Ashwin with three overs for six runs on the first morning on a batting track. He has managed to get Travis Head to take the extra attacking option. Head skips down the track looking to hit him straight, perhaps over mid-off, but the ball drifts and doesn't turn, taking the inner half of the bat to mid-on. This is a pitch where India need their spinners to stand apart from Australia's, and Ashwin will like to believe he has made a start.

First hour to Australia

Travis Head has run away to a quick start on a batting track as Australia get to 56 for 0 in 14 overs. Head is 31 off 39, having attacked any sign of width, and then milked the consequent straightness. Umesh Yadav has gone at 4.5 an over, and there have been eight byes too. Are India reminded of the Chennai Test that they lost to England in 2021?

Bharat drops Head

Not the greatest of starts for India on what looks like a pitch that will make them work hard. Mohammed Shami started with his radar not quite there. Then KS Bharat wasn't quite flash to a couple of difficult takes. However, the big one came towards the end of the sixth over, Umesh Yadav drawing the outside edge from Travis Head, and he just dropped a sitter. He just got his hands in the wrong place, and his feet also got locked. Australia 23 for 0 in six overs. Eight byes, one wide, one no-ball.

Australia bat, remain unchanged

The captains both feel it is a much better batting surface than in the first three Tests. Which means it becomes a no-brainer for Australia to elect to bat. No green seamers, as India's captain had earlier hinted at for preparation for the WTC final.

Australia are unchanged, India have made one change: Mohammed Shami in for Mohammed Siraj. Australia will be looking at the Chennai Test from 2021 where on a flat pitch, England managed to bury India under a mountain of runs. India know they will have to work hard on day one here.

India 1 Rohit Sharma (capt.), 2 Shubman Gill, 3 Cheteshwar Pujara, 4 Virat Kohli, 5 Shreyas Iyer, 6 Ravindra Jadeja, 7 KS Bharat (wk), 8 R Ashwin, 9 Axar Patel, 10 Umesh Yadav, 11 Mohammed Shami

Game on

The friendship celebrations in Ahmedabad are over. Now it is time for the toss. All three Tests so far have been won by sides losing the toss. Might a team be tempted to bowl after winning the toss? I doubt it, but it is something worth pondering.

The Border-Gavaskar Trophy is staying with India, but India have won every Test series at home in the last 10 years. They will hate for this to be a draw. And, to be fair, a drawn series here will be as good as a win for Australia.
