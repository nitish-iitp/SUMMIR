The second season of the Major League Cricket in the USA will begin on July 5 - here is all you need to know about MLC 2024, including the complete schedule, full squads list, and broadcast and streaming details, including where to watch live.

MI New York emerged as winners of the inaugural edition of MLC last year, beating Seattle Orcas in the final. MINY captain Pooran was the star of the show that night, as he smashed a blistering 137* (55) to help them chase down 184.

A few big moves have been made this year, as Australian World Cup-winning captain Pat Cummins and legendary batter Steve Smith will be playing in the league. Another couple of premier Australian T20 players, Glenn Maxwell and Jake Fraser-McGurk will also be in action.
