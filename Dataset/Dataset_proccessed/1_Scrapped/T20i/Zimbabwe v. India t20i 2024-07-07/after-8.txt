Abhishek Sharma reveals his mantra behind T20I batting

23-year-old Abhishek Sharma slammed his maiden T20I hundred on Sunday, 7 July while playing against Zimbabwe in Harare. With India 0-1 down in the series, Abhishek lit up the stadium with some exceptional shot-making to score a century in just 46 balls. Sharma gave hope to the transitioning Indian team, who saw three of their stalwarts retire from the format right after the T20 World Cup 2024 win.

Abhishek Sharma's approach brought freshness to the Indian side as the youngster went after everything that was pitched full to him. The batter spoke about his approach in the post-match presentation ceremony and said that it was his day today.

The left-hander, who has had two terrific Indian Premier League seasons with SRH, said that if the ball falls in his arc, he would never back down from going after it.

"I think it was pretty much a good performance by me, the defeat we had yesterday we didn't have it easy for us. I felt today it was my day and I made it count. I feel T20 is about momentum and I took it to the end. Special mention to the coach and team management, I always feel that as a youngster if it's your day, if you have to express yourself. We were talking after every ball and he said to me that you should take it on. I always believe in my ability, if there's in my arc and even if it's the first ball," Sharma said in the post-match presentation ceremony.

ZIM vs IND, 2nd T20I: Highlights

Abhishek Sharma, Ruturaj Gaikwad Dominate

Abhishek Sharma and Ruturaj Gaikwad put together a match-winning 137-run partnership to take the game away from Zimbabwe. Both batters played 47 balls in the innings. While Abhishek hit 100 off 47 balls, Gaikwad hit an unbeaten 77-run knock.

The runs came in contrasting styles on Sunday. While Abhishek started his innings with a massive six through the leg side, Ruturaj conceded 5 dot balls in the row after Shubman Gill's early dismissal. Gaikwad continued his conservative approach in the two-paced pitch in Harare, while Abhishek tried to be as positive as he could in his innings.

ZIM vs IND, 2nd T20I: Full Scorecard

After falling for a 4-ball duck on his debut with the Indian team, Abhishek Sharma did the most Abhishek Sharma thing ever. The 23-year-old started his innings with a six over deep square leg and put in a sensational batting display to score his maiden T20I hundred on Sunday. Abhishek took a little time to get his innings underway, scoring fifty off 33 balls. The opener ripped into the Zimbabwean spinners after the powerplay, notching up the next fifty runs in just 13 balls.

On the day, Abhishek hit 8 sixes and 7 boundaries. He tried to be aggressive from the very start of his innings and did not change his approach despite the two-paced nature of the Harare pitch.

The opener was fortunate in his innings as he was dropped in the 8th over when he was batting at 27. Sharma was especially aggressive in two particular overs. He smashed Dion Myers for 28 runs and then ripped into Wellington Masakazda with a 21-run over. Sharma reached his century hitting three back-to-back sixes but got out trying to hit the fourth one in the final ball of the 14th over.
