India vs Zimbabwe 2nd T20I Highlights: Chasing a massive target of 235 runs against India at the 2nd T20I encounter at Harare Sports Club on July 7, Zimbabwe's entire innings crumbled for 134 run in 18.4 overs. With this, India won by 100 runs.

This is the highest defeat margins for Zimbabwe in T20Is by runs. Previously, Australia defeated Zimbabwe in 2018 by a margin of 100 runs. Abhishek Sharma was awarded the player of the match for his superb innings and maiden hundred.

For Zimbabwe, Wessly Madhevere (43), Wessly Madhevere (33) and Brian Bennett (26) scored few runs, but they were not enough as Indian bowlers dominated from the very beginning.

For India, Mukesh Kumar and Avesh Khan took three wickets each, while Ravi Bishnoi picked two wickets and Washington Sundar took one.

Earlier after winning the toss, India decided to bat first at the 2nd T20I encounter at Harare Sports Club on July 7. The Shubman Gill-led Men in Blue scored a massive 234/2 in the first innings. Zimbabwe need to score 235 in 20 overs to win.

The 234/2 by India is the highest team total against Zimbabwe surpassing 229/2 by Australia in 2018.

For India, Abhishek Sharma hits his maiden century in just 47 deliveries, while Ruturajk Gaikwad (77) and Rinku Singh (48) made some very important contributions.

For Zimbabwe, only Wellington Masakadza and Blessing Muzarabani could clinch one wicket each.

After suffering a shocking defeat at the hands of hosts Zimbabwe in the 1st T20 clash in Harare, Shubman Gill and Co. would be looking to stage a comeback in the 5-match series by winning the match today. 

During the first T20I match, Zimbabwe posted a meagre total of 115/9 in their quota of 20 overs. However, the inexperienced Indian team found it extremely hard to chase down the total with only three batsmen, Shubman Gill, Avesh Khan and Washington Sundar, going into the double digits.

There will be some tough decisions for the Indian skipper and coach VVS Laxman, given that the whole batting lineup did not perform. Meanwhile, Shubman also wasn't happy with the fielding effort on Saturday and said that players looked ‘rusty’.

Zimbabwe skipper Sikandar Raza, on the other hand, has said that while he is happy with the performance of his side in the first clash, the job isn't done yet. 

India vs Zimbabwe Playing XI in the 2nd T20I match:

India: Shubman Gill (C), Abhishek Sharma, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Riyan Parag, Rinku Singh, Dhruv Jurel (WK), Washington Sundar, Ravi Bishnoi, Avesh Khan, Mukesh Kumar, Sai Sudarshan.

Zimbabwe: Tadiwanashe Marumani, Innocent Kaia, Brian Bennett, Sikandar Raza (C), Dion Myers, Johnathan Campbell, Clive Madande (WK), Wellington Masakadza, Luke Jongwe, Blessing Muzarabani, Tendai Chatara.

India vs Zimbabwe Live Score: Abhishek Sharma awarded with ‘player of the match’ honours

He said at the post match presentation, as quoted by Cricbuzz, “I think it was a pretty good performance by me, the defeat we had yesterday, it wasn't easy for us. I felt today it was my day and I made it count. I feel T20 is about momentum and I took it to the end. Special mention to the coaches, captains and the team management to keep confidence. I always feel that as a youngster if it's your day, you have to express yourself. We were talking after every over and he (Ruturaj) said to me that you should take it on. I always believe in my ability, if it's in my arc and even if it's the first ball, I will go after it."

In that light, Gill and coach VVS Laxman may look to make some changes in the playing XI. While the duo haven't officially made any announcements about changes in playing XI, Dhruv Jurel might have to make way for Jitesh Sharma in the playing XI. Meanwhile, Harshit Rana could also make his debut in place of one of the spinners.
