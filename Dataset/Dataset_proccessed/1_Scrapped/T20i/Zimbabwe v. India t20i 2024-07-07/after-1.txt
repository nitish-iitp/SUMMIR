Sikandar Raza | Zimbabwe Captain

The world champions will eventually play like world champions. Dropping catches today certainly hurt us today. I expected 200 on this wicket today but they got 30 runs more. Coming into this game, I thought it would be a close game but it wasn't to be, the top-order didn't play well. He has grown by leaps and bounds, he is very hungry and his graph will keep going up. It's a task we have been talking about since a long time, today we came out positive and played our shots.

 7 Jul 2024, 08:07:46 pm IST
Abhishek Sharma | POTM (India)

I think it was pretty much good performance by me, the defeat we had yesterday we didn't have it easy for us. I felt today it was my day and I made it count. I feel T20 is about momentum and I took it to the end. Special mention to the coach and team management, I always feel that as a youngster if it's your day, if you have to express yourself. We were talking after every ball and he said to me that you should take it on. I always believe in my ability, if there's in my arc and even if it's the first ball, I will go after it.

 7 Jul 2024, 08:08:14 pm IST
Shubman Gill | India Captain

Very happy, great to be back on the winning note back again. With the way Abhishek and Rutu batted, it was not easy especially in the powerplay, with the ball moving around but Abhi and Rutu built the innings brilliantly. Yesterday, it was more about not being able to handle the pressure, it's a young side and many of them are new to international exposure. It was actually good to have pressure in the first game and we knew what to expect coming into this game. We have got three matches to go and we are looking forward to them. It's always good to have more options rather than not having options.

 7 Jul 2024, 08:23:01 pm IST
Goodnight!

India and Zimbabwe will lock horns again in the third T20I of the series on Wednesday. For now, we will be taking your leave. It's goodbye from our side. Goodnight and take care!
