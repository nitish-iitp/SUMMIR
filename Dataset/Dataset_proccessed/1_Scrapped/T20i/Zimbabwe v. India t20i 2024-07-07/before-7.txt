Cricket never stops in India. Our celebrations for the T20 World Cup 2024 triumph are still going on, but the players, albeit a different set, have already embarked on a fresh challenge. The Indian cricket team, led by Shubman Gill, has reached Zimbabwe for a five-match T20I series. The right-handed opener has been tasked with leading a bunch of youngsters.

Several players, who proved their mettle in the IPL 2024, have earned their maiden national call-ups, including Riyan Parag, who impressed everyone with his performances for Rajasthan Royals in the IPL 2024. After T20 World Cup-winning stars like Sanju Samson, Shivam Dube and Yashasvi Jaiswal were ruled out of the first two games, the Assam all-rounder has a strong chance of playing in the starting XI.

Thrilled about his maiden overseas tour with the senior men's team, Riyan Parag couldn't contain his excitement which led to a few mistakes. He forget to keep hold of the most important thing needed to fly out of the country - his passport. In a video shared by the BCCI's official social media handles, the 22-year-old could be seen boasting about forgot his passport and phone in excitement. Let's take a look what he said:


Riyan Parag told BCCI TV, "So excited that I’ve forgotten my passport. I’ve forgotten my phone. I’ve not forgotten, I’ve misplaced them. But I have it now."

Travel Day ✅

The journey begins... 👌

Riyan Parag said that even though there are many new faces in the team, they are familiar to him because they have played together a lot. He stressed that ever since he began playing cricket, he had always dreamt of playing for India. It was his ultimate goal.

Father was also a cricketer


Riyan Parag's father Parag Das also played cricket at first-class level. Riyan is fulfilling his father's dream. According to him, Zimbabwe will always have a special role for him. Whenever he plays his first match on any ground, he will always remember it.

“The feel of donning India jersey, travelling with the side is different. Coming from Assam, I had this dream of playing for India. Really happy. There will be a special connection for Zimbabwe when I play my first match. That will be a special moment for that ground and myself, which would be very sacred,” he added.
