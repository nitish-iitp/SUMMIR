The Indian cricket team arrived at the Wankhede Stadium following their open-top bus victory parade along Marine Drive in Mumbai. Earlier, the players received a rousing reception at Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport.

A Day of Celebrations

The team had a packed schedule, starting with a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi in the morning. They then traveled to Mumbai for a BCCI felicitation function at the Wankhede Stadium and participated in an open bus trophy tour through the city. For Indian cricket fans, entry to the felicitation event at the Wankhede Stadium was free on a first-come, first-served basis, with gates opening at 4 pm. To accommodate the celebrations, Mumbai's traffic police closed seven roads in South Mumbai and prohibited parking on ten roads.

Team India's Journey Home

The team faced travel challenges due to a hurricane in Barbados but were flown out of the West Indies on a specially-arranged charter flight. They flew from Barbados to New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Air India flight AIC24WC — Air India Champions 24 World Cup — departing around 4:50 am local time on Wednesday and arriving in Delhi at 6 am IST on Thursday after a 16-hour non-stop journey. Team India clinched victory against South Africa by seven runs in the final held in Bridgetown last Saturday.
