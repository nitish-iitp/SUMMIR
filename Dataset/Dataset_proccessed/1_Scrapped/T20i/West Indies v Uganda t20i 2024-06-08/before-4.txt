Uganda is slated to take on Cameroon in match no. 27 of the 2024 edition of the Kwibuka Twenty20 (T20) Tournament at the Gahanga International Cricket Stadium (A), Kigali. The game is scheduled for 4:45 PM Indian Standard Time (IST) on the 7th of June 2024.

Match 27 Uganda vs Cameroon
Squads:

Uganda – Janet Mbabazi (C), Rita Musamali, Consy Aweko, Kevin Awino, Stephanie Nampiina, Immaculate Nakisuyi, Sarah Walaza, Malisa Ariokot, Lorna Anyait, Patricia Timong, Akurut Asumin, Proscovia Alako, Jimia Muhammad, Immaculate Nandera

Cameroon – Michele Ekani (C, WK), Cathy Mbelel, Tchouabo Leslie, Madaleine Sissako, Olive Ranedoumoun, Elsa Kana, Edwige Guehoada, Jeanne Ngono, Manuella Aboui, Cynerah Mboe, Marguerite Bessala, Catherine Messina, Brenda Waluma, Sandra Nono

Players to watch out:
Proscovia Alako

The 21-year-old all-rounder has amassed 690 runs from 50 T20I innings, including the highest score of 116, and also has a couple of wickets to her name. Proscovia has consistently managed starts (23, 12, 11, 4*, and 17) in this competition and against Zimbabwe A, she converted her start into a solid 62*. It is hoped she continues to lead the scoring and has another good knock around the corner.

Consy Aweko

The 33-year-old off-spinner in T20Is has bagged 109 wickets from 81 outings, averaging 10.35 and maintaining an economy rate of 3.70, while also scoring 146 runs from 37 innings. Consy has been at her economical and consistent best in this competition, returning figures of 0/12, 2/4, 2/20, 1/4, 2/12, and 2/11. She can be banked upon to carry this rewarding form into the business end.

Marguerite Bessala

The 21-year-old middle-order batter has added 94 runs to the tally from 19 T20Is and registered the highest score of 24*. Marguerite, in her first outing in this competition, added 4 runs to the tally and followed up with two unbeaten innings of 24 and 7. In her previous 3 innings, she has departed on scores of 7, 0, and 0, and will be backed to step up her efforts, contributing with all-round efforts.

Cynerah Mboe

The 31-year-old all-rounder has scored 54 runs from 10 outings and from 4 bowling innings has struck 3 wickets, with bests being 20 and 2/12. While Cynerah hasn’t scored many runs, departing on scores of 7, 4, 1, 4*, and 4, she has been effective with the ball, producing figures of 2/12 (3), 0/17 (3), and 1/9 (3). It is expected that she builds on this momentum and delivers the goods.

Pitch:

The Gahanga International Cricket Stadium (A) offers a slow track, one that poses challenges for batters and provides an advantage to spinners. The average score in the 130s indicates the demanding conditions and the need for careful batting on this pitch.

Weather:

Kigali promises ideal conditions for a complete game of cricket, with no expected rain and sunny skies. The temperature is forecasted to hover around 28°C, with light winds and humidity of 45%.

Fantasy playing XI:

Kevin Awino, Proscovia Alako, Stephanie Nampiina, Rita Musamali, Jeanne Ngono, Immaculate Nakisuyi, Janet Mbabazi, Consy Aweko, Sarah Walaza, Lorna Anyait, Patricia Timong
