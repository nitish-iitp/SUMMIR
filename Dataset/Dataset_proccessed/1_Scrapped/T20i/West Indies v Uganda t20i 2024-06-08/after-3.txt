Welcome back for the second essay. The two umpires have made their way out to the middle as have the players of the West Indies. It will be Roger Mukasa and Simon Ssesazi to open the innings for Uganda. West Indies are starting with spin in the form of Akeal Hosein. Let's play...

!

... THE RUN CHASE ...

!

Right then, the West Indies have the momentum with them courtesy of their strong finish with the bat and will look to carry that into their bowling effort. As for Uganda, they have a real job on their hands, especially with their batting unit struggling so far in the tournament. Given the African side's struggles with the bat and the bowling resources they have, the West Indies will fancy their chances of boosting their NRR here. Back in a bit for the chase.

!

Johnson Charles is up for a chat. He says it's good to have some runs under the belt, it was a tough pitch to bat on but he wanted to make the most of the first six overs, however, Uganda stuck to their plans and bowled well. Feels they have enough runs on the board and their bowlers need to execute the plans now.

!

Uganda will be a bit disappointed with how the last over went as the 18-run over from Cosmas Kyewuta spoiled what was otherwise a stellar death bowling display. Given the strong batting might of the West Indies, the African side should still be proud of the fight they have shown with the ball throughout the 20 overs. Uganda started well with the ball, maintaining tight lines in the first couple of overs. However, the decision to take Alpesh Ramjani off despite his economical first over backfired, as Johnson Charles took advantage of the pacers and found his rhythm. Ramjani was reintroduced in the 5th over, and he made an immediate impact. With the easing of field restrictions after the Powerplay, Uganda's spinners, in particular, pulled things back considerably in the middle phase. The African side also did an excellent job of containing the boundaries at the death until Cosmas Kyewuta missed his mark in the final over, allowing the West Indies to reach 173.

!

West Indies finish on a high to end up with 173 on the board! Andre Russell came through for the Windies to give them the desired finishing kick. After electing to bat first, the West Indies began cautiously before Johnson Charles got going with a flurry of boundaries. Brandon King's stay at the crease was short-lived, but Nicholas Pooran's explosive hitting helped the Windies post 54 runs in the Powerplay. Both Charles and Pooran showed promise and looked set to take control of the game, but neither could capitalize fully on their starts. Similarly, Rovman Powell and Sherfane Rutherford failed to convert their starts into substantial contributions. Andre Russell did what was asked of him, and although some of his boundaries were streaky, he played a useful cameo to take his side past 170.
