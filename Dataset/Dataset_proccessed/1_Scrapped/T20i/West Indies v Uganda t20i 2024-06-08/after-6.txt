West Indies and Uganda are set to be up against each other in a Group C match of the T20 World Cup 2024 on Saturday, June 8 (Sunday, June 9) at the Providence Stadium in Guyana.

West Indies, led by Rovman Powell, will be returning after a week’s break following their 5-wicket win over Papua New Guinea (PNG) at the Providence. However, the hosts would be looking to work on certain aspects of their game after almost bottling their run-chase.

Johnson Charles would want to make amends after he bagged a golden duck last time around. Roston Chase was a positive for them after he made an unbeaten 42. Gudakesh Motie did an excellent job against South Africa, after which he bowled well against PNG.
