The Asia Cup 2023 will begin on August 30, 2023, and will be played in a hybrid model with four matches to be played in Pakistan and the rest of the encounters to be hosted in Sri Lanka, respectively. Speaking of the tournament format, India, Pakistan, and Nepal have been put in Group A, while Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan are in Group B.

A total of 13 matches will be played, which includes six league matches, six Super 4 matches, and a final. Pakistan and India were seeded as A1 and A2, while Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were seeded as B1 and B2. In case Nepal and Afghanistan qualify for the Super Four stage, they will take the slot of the team knocked out (Pakistan or India in Group A and Sri Lanka or Bangladesh in Group B).

The Asia Cup 2023 will feature a lot of known names, but there will be some youngsters who will be itching to prove themselves on the big stage in the form of a multi-nation tournament where there will be immense cut-throat competition between the teams coming from the same region.

In the same vein, Let's have a look at the five youngest players in Asia Cup 2023:

India opener Shubman Gill is already known for his sublime timing and ability to accelerate his innings in ODIs. The youngster, who had made his ODI debut in 2019, has been continuously performing well. His batting technique impresses everyone.

Gill has played 27 ODIs and has made 1437 runs at an average of 62.47 including 4 centuries and 6 fifties to his name. He became the youngest batter in ODIs to hit a double century in the format when he achieved the feat against New Zealand earlier this year. The pitches in Sri Lanka will suit his style of batting as he is a good player of both pace and spin and his temperament is something that stands out.
