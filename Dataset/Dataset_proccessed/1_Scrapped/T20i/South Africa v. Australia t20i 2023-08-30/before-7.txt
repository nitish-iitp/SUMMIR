South Africa vs Australia - Dream11 Prediction - 1st T20I

South Africa will take on Australia in the first T20I of the three-match series at the Kingsmead, Durban on Wednesday (August 30). Ahead of the match, here's all you need to know about the SA vs AUS Dream11 prediction, including fantasy cricket tips, today's playing 11s and the pitch report for this game.

It's been nearly five months since South Africa last played international cricket. They lost their last T20I assignment to West Indies (1-2) in a T20I series. While the focus will be on the ODI World Cup, the Proteas will be looking to test out a few of their fringe players in the shortest format.

Meanwhile, Australia will be featuring in a T20I for the first time since the T20 World Cup last year. They have rested quite a few of their regulars for this series and the likes of Glenn Maxwell and Steve Smith are out injured. Moreover, this will be Mitchell Marsh’s first series as T20I captain.

The 22-yard surface at Kingsmead, Durban is usually a very good one to bat on. Out of the four completed games in the SA20 League earlier this year at this venue, three of them saw teams batting first post totals in excess of 165. The pacers usually get good bounce and more of the same can be expected from this game.
