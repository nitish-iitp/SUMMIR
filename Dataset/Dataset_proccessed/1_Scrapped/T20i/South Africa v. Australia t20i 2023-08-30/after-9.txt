South Africa won the toss and decided to bowl in the first Twenty20 international against Australia at Kingsmead on Wednesday.

Australia fielded four new caps in opening batsman Matt Short, all-rounder Aaron Hardie, fast bowler Spencer Johnson and leg-spinner Tanveer Sangha.

Sangha was a late replacement for Adam Zampa, who was ill.

South Africa handed first caps to batsman Dewald Brevis and fast bowler Gerald Coetzee, although Coetzee has previously played in Tests and one-day internationals.

"The guys who play here regularly say the wicket stays the same and even gets a bit better later on," said South African captain Aiden Markram.

Australian captain Mitchell Marsh said the series was part of a build-up to next year's T20 World Cup.

"We're happy to bat first and hopefully put up a big total."

Teams:

South Africa: Aiden Markram (captain), Temba Bavuma, Reeza Hendricks, Rassie van der Dussen, Dewald Brevis, Tristan Stubbs (wkt), Marco Jansen, Gerald Coetzee, Lungi Ngidi, Lizaad Williams, Tabraiz Shamsi.

Australia: Mitchell Marsh (captain), Matt Short, Travis Head, Josh Inglis (wkt), Marcus Stoinis, Tim David, Aaron Hardie, Sean Abbott, Nathan Ellis, Adam Zampa, Spencer Johnson.

Umpires: Bongani Jele, Lubabalo Gcuma (both RSA)

TV umpire: Stephen Harris (RSA)

Match referee: Richie Richardson (WIS)
