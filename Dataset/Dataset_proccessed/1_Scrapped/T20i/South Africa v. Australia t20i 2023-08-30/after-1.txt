“How old is he now? Twenty?” Marsh said of Brevis ahead of the series. 

“I think anytime you get a 20-year-old kid debuting for their country it’s always exciting for international cricket.

Brevis has memories of watching Australia battle South Africa at Kingsmead and now gets his shot at facing the fierce rivals of the Proteas in Durban.

“I am so excited. It’s going to be proper heat and lots of fighting, and I can’t wait for that. I can’t wait to go there and run straight into them. They are one of the top cricketing nations,” Brevis told reporters.

Brevis has been well-prepared for elite cricket and is well aware that there will be few low-pressure situations that cross his path while in the green and gold.

“I know there will always be expectations,” he said. 

“Pressure is always there; I feel the pressure, but I like it. I just want people to get to know me as Dewald Brevis and just see how I go about my things.”
