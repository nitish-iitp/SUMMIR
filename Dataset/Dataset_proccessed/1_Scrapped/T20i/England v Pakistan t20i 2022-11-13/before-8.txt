Babar Azam and Co. are heavily dependent on the performance of their pace battery and spinners who have been spot on in the tournament. With the middle order looking sorted now, their batting is also looking good. On the other side, England are depending a lot on their opening pair who are among the top 10 run scorers in the tournament.
