Bangladesh vs Netherlands, T20 World Cup, Super 12 Highlights: Four-wicket haul by Taskin Ahmed helped Bangladesh defeat Netherlands by 9 runs in their Super 12 clash of the ongoing T20 World Cup, at Bellerive Oval, Hobart on Monday. Chasing a mere target of 145, Netherlands faced a quick fall of wickets at regular intervals but Colin Ackermann scored 62 and kept the hopes alive but could not take his side through. For Bangladesh, Afif Hosain top-scored with 38 runs as Netherlands performed fairly well with the ball. Bas de Leede and Paul van Meekeren scalped two wickets each for Netherlands and restricted Bangladesh at 144/8. (LIVE SCORECARD) 

Bangladesh (Playing XI): Najmul Hossain Shanto, Soumya Sarkar, Litton Das, Shakib Al Hasan(c), Afif Hossain, Yasir Ali, Nurul Hasan(w), Mosaddek Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Hasan Mahmud

Shaun Pollock says the sun is out and it is a lot warmer than it was in Hobart. States the square bundaries are not that big but the boundaries down the ground are really big. Carlos Brathwaite says the wicket is slightly damp and it seems a touch dry but it should be a good one to bat on and we should get a high score.

!

GOOD NEWS! The rain has now stopped completely and the covers are coming off. Also, the players are out there warming up. Let us hope we have no more weather interventions and we get a whole game of cricket.

!

That is it from this game then! Another game follows though and it is a clash between South Africa and Zimbabwe. That game was scheduled to begin at 1330 IST (0800 GMT) but due to the rain delay, there might just a delay. Do join us for the build up for that game too. Until next time, take care and goodbye!

!

Shakib Al Hasan says he has been around for a long time and has not been able to win a game in the second round and he is pleased they could do so. Adds he felt they were under par but is pleased they with how the pacers performed. Mentions they are a good fielding unit and they believe the fielding makes a lot of difference.

!

Scott Edwards says the bowlers were excellent and he felt Bangladesh were under par. Adds they could not bat that well and it is a disppointing effort. Credits Colin Ackermann for his knock.

!

MAN OF THE MATCH, Taskin Ahmed says it is a very good win and he is very happy to contribute. Adds he was sticking with the basics, the ball was moving in the first innings and he was looking to bowl the Test-match length. Mentions he just tries to give his best. Informs he is focusing on improving and he wants to be the best.

!

... TIME FOR THE PRESENTATION ...

!

Earlier in the day, Bangladesh crawled their way to a score which we felt was under-par. Thanks to Afif Hossain's effort they got themselves to 144 but that proved to be enough as their bowlers were brilliant.

!

Netherlands will be very disappointed with their effort! They bowled so well but were equally poor with the bat. The run outs just did not help their cause. Their innings was just about one man, Colin. He seemed like he was batting on a different surface as he was scoring freely. He though kept losing partners. Also, there were far too many dots from the Dutch batters and in the end, the margin of defeat was just the 9. Maybe had they rotated strike better, maybe had someone given better support to Colin Ackermann, the result could have well been different. Nevertheless, they did well to come this close after being 4 down for 15.

!

A superb bowling effort from Bangladesh! We really felt they were 15 to 20 runs short at the end of the first innings but their bowlers have risen to the occasion and they have begun their campaign with a win. It was Taskin who wrecked havoc earlier on as he got two in the very first over. Nerves then got to the Dutch as we saw two run outs in one over and that completely pushed them onto the back foot. The bowlers to follow, like Shakib, Hasan Mahmud were also brilliant. It was a combined bowling effort from Bangladesh but Taskin was easily the pick.
