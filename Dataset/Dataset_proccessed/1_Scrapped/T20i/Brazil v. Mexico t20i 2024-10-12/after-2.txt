Shilpa Shetty is one of the fittest and most fabulous divas we have in the industry. She has been promoting a healthy lifestyle forever. Her emphasis had always been on overall witness and not just on looking a certain way, which back in the day was not every diva's motto.
During an old media interaction, Shilpa once said, "Nowadays everybody is fit, but when I joined the industry, it was rare to see actresses who were into working out. At that time, they wanted you to be a bit 'hari bhari' (healthy), (and they used to say), 'What is this? You are looking so lean like a toothpick'. "So I've had a producer who wanted me to put on weight."
Shilpa remembered all the occasions when producers asked her to put on weight for the perfect conventional image of that time. That made her more determined to create and follow a path of her own when it came to health and fitness. She started promoting the idea of overall health and with time people who used to say that she had lost a lot of weight started accepting these new norms of having a healthy body.
Shilpa emphasized the importance of spreading awareness about health, stating, “It’s crucial to understand that whether you have time for a rigorous fitness regime or not, you can still improve your health with a good diet. Fitness is not just about hitting the gym; it's about making choices about what you eat and how you live.”

This is a marked shift from the traditional industry norms, where the emphasis was mainly on appearing fit and not necessarily being healthy. Shilpa's journey has played an important role in reforming the dimension of wellness where health comes first.
Shilpa Shetty still stands tall as an inspiration to many; she brings across a very personal narrative that fitness is an individual's journey and should be designed according to one's needs and circumstances.
