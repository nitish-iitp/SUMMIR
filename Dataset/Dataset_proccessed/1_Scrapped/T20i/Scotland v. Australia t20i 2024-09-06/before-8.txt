September 6, 2024, at 18:45 will see the much awaited game between Slovenia and Austria in the UEFA Nations League B. With a capacity of 16,038, Stadion Stožice in Ljubljana, Slovenia will host this Round 1 meeting. Romanian referee Petrescu R. M., who is renowned for his rigorous rule-abiding, will officiate the game. Following their last 16 of Euro 2024, both teams are keen to begin their UEFA Nations League campaigns on a positive note. Fans should expect a fiercely fought struggle between these two competitive sides as they lock horns in Group 3 of League B.

Though not winning a single game in regular time, Slovenia, who advanced to the knockout levels of Euro 2024, will want to build on their recent development. Under Ralf Rangnick, Austria is trying to recover from a dismal Nations League A campaign and will rely on their strong Euro 2024 group stage performances to start League B strongly.

Slovenia Results

Slovenia has shown a mixed bag of results in recent matches, balancing between solid defensive displays and struggles to convert scoring opportunities. Below are the details of their last five matches:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	W/L
01.07.24	Euro 2024	Portugal vs Slovenia	1-0	L
25.06.24	Euro 2024	England vs Slovenia	0-0	D
20.06.24	Euro 2024	Slovenia vs Serbia	1-1	D
16.06.24	Euro 2024	Slovenia vs Denmark	1-1	D
08.06.24	Friendly	Slovenia vs Bulgaria	1-1	D

With four draws and one loss in their last five games, Slovenia’s recent performances exhibit a pattern toward drawing games. Though their attack led by Benjamin Šeško needs to be more clinical to turn draws into victories, this defensive solidity led by goalkeeper Jan Oblak has been a major asset. As seen against England and Denmark, their ability to hold off more formidable opponents highlights their tenacity; but, converting chances will be absolutely vital against Austria.

Austria Results

Austria’s recent form has been inconsistent, with both victories and defeats against varied opposition. Here’s a look at their last five matches:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	W/L
02.07.24	Euro 2024	Austria vs Turkey	1-2	L
25.06.24	Euro 2024	Netherlands vs Austria	2-3	W
21.06.24	Euro 2024	Poland vs Austria	1-3	W
17.06.24	Euro 2024	Austria vs France	0-1	L
08.06.24	Friendly	Switzerland vs Austria	1-1	D

Recent games for Austria show a mix of high-scoring victories and limited losses, proving their capacity to score as well as their sensitivity in defense. With important players like Christoph Baumgartner and Marko Arnautović playing major roles, the triumphs against Poland and the Netherlands highlighted their attacking ability. Still, their defensive lapses especially their early goal concessions raise questions given their losses to Turkey and France.

Slovenia vs Austria Head-to-Head

Historically, Austria has held the upper hand in this fixture. Here are the last five matches between Slovenia and Austria:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result
13.10.19	Euro Qualifiers	Slovenia vs Austria	0-1
07.06.19	Euro Qualifiers	Austria vs Slovenia	1-0
23.03.18	Friendly	Austria vs Slovenia	3-0
26.03.97	Friendly	Slovenia vs Austria	2-0
05.09.95	Euro Qualifiers	Austria vs Slovenia	3-1

Austria has a dominant record against Slovenia, winning four out of their last five meetings. This historical advantage may give Austria a psychological edge going into the match. However, Slovenia’s ability to draw strong teams recently suggests they won’t be easy opponents this time around.

Key Factors to Watch

Form of Key Players: Benjamin Šeško for Slovenia and Christoph Baumgartner for Austria are crucial players. Their form leading into this match could be decisive;

Free Tips on Slovenia vs Austria

When preparing to place a bet on the Slovenia vs Austria match, it’s essential to consider various factors that could influence the outcome. By analyzing previous match statistics, team forms, and other relevant data, you can gain a clearer understanding of what to expect. Below are some free tips based on detailed statistics and historical data that could help you make more informed betting decisions.

Team Motivation and Stakes: This match is crucial for both Slovenia and Austria as they aim to start their UEFA Nations League campaign on a strong note. A team with more at stake, like Slovenia, who is looking to establish themselves further in League B, might display greater determination and intensity throughout the game.
Head-to-Head Performance: Historically, Austria has had the upper hand against Slovenia, winning three out of their last four encounters. This could give Austria a psychological edge, although Slovenia’s improved form in recent games suggests they are capable of breaking this trend.
Home vs. Away Performance: Slovenia tends to perform better at home, leveraging local support at Stadion Stožice to boost their morale and performance. Austria, while strong on neutral ground, has faced challenges in maintaining consistent away form, which could be a factor in this encounter.
Injuries and Squad Selection: Team news is vital as injuries can significantly impact performance. For this match, Slovenia will miss the services of defender Zan Karnicnik due to injury, potentially weakening their defensive lineup. Austria, meanwhile, is expected to field a strong squad, which could influence their strategy.
Impact of Recent Schedule: Both teams are coming off demanding schedules following their participation in Euro 2024. Fatigue could play a role, especially if key players are not fully rested. This could affect the pace of the game and the overall performance levels of both teams.

By considering these factors, you can make more educated predictions on the Slovenia vs Austria match, potentially increasing your chances of a successful bet.

Slovenia vs Austria Match Prediction 2024

Given the recent form and key factors, the Slovenia vs Austria prediction suggests a closely contested match. Both teams have shown resilience in their recent performances but have also struggled to convert crucial chances.

However, considering Austria’s scoring ability and Slovenia’s solid defense, a low-scoring game could also be expected. The Slovenia vs Austria odds may slightly favor Austria due to their head-to-head record, but Slovenia’s recent form makes them a formidable opponent at home.
