India’s Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty on Sunday won the French Open Super 750 title defeating Chinese Taipei’s Lu Ching Yao and Yang Po Han in the men’s doubles final in Paris. In a clash that lasted 48 minutes, the India duo pair, ranked world number 8, outwitted the 25th-ranked Lu and Yang by 21-13 21-19.

Satwik-Chirag is the first Indian duo to win a super 750 tournament. With the latest title, the shuttlers have continued their dream run this season. The year has so far brought then coveted titles such as the Indian Open Super 500 winner, Commonwealth Games gold, Thomas Cup crown, and a bronze at the World Championships. The French Open Super 750 title is their third world tour title after the 2019 Thailand Open Super 500 and India Open Super 500 this year.

The badminton pair had also made it to the 2019 French Open final, but lost the game to Indonesian ace players Marcus Fernaldi Gideon and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo.

In 1983, Vikram Singh and Partho Ganguli of India had claimed the French Open title when it was a minor tournament.

The French Open champions will now participate at the Hylo Open Super 300 badminton tournament at Saarbrücken, Germany, from 1 to 6 November 2022.
