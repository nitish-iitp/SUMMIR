PAK vs BAN Dream11 Prediction Tips & Fantasy Team

The 41st match of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022 will see Bangladesh (BAN) take on Pakistan (PAK) at the Adelaide Oval in Adelaide on Sunday, November 6. Ahead of the match, here's everything you need to know about the PAK vs BAN Dream11 predictions.

After a disappointing start to their T20 World Cup campaign, Pakistan have bounced back with two convincing performances with the ball. They are still in with a chance of making the semi-finals, with a win being the bare minimum they will need. However, they come across a decent Bangladesh side who have also won two out of their four matches. Although they lost their previous game against India, the likes of Litton Das and Taskin Ahmed impressed for the Bangla Tigers. Pakistan will start as the clear favorites but will be wary of what Bangladesh are capable of doing in white-ball cricket. All in all, another entertaining game beckons at the Adelaide Oval with two valuable points up for grabs.

PAK vs BAN Dream11 match top picks
Top Wicketkeeper Pick
Mohammad Rizwan (77 matches, 2531 runs, SR: 127.06)

Mohammad Rizwan has not been able to get going in this tournament with only one score in excess of 30 in four outings. However, Rizwan is one of the top batters in this format with an average of 49.63. With the Pakistan keeper due for a big score, he is a top pick in your PAK vs BAN Dream11 prediction team.

Top Batter Pick
Litton Das (4 matches, 117 runs, SR: 144.44)

Litton Das comes into the game on the back of a breathtaking 27-ball 60 against India. He has scored 117 runs in four matches at a strike rate of 144.4. With Litton batting at the top of the order for Bangladesh, he is a must-have in your PAK vs BAN Dream11 prediction team.

Top All-rounder Pick
Shadab Khan (4 matches, 8 wickets, ER: 5.86)

Shadab Khan also had a brilliant outing in his previous game, scoring his first T20I fifty against South Africa. However, it has been his bowling that has served Pakistan well. He has picked up eight wickets in just four matches at an economy rate of 5.86. With Shadab in fine form, he is another must-have in your PAK vs BAN Dream11 prediction team.

Top Bowler Pick
Taskin Ahmed (4 matches, 8 wickets, Average: 13.12)

Taskin Ahmed has been the pick of the Bangladesh bowlers in the tournament, taking eight wickets at an average of 13.12. Taskin comes into the game on the back of a fine performance against India, conceding only 15 runs in his four overs. Given the conditions on offer, Taskin should be a good pick for your PAK vs BAN Dream11 prediction team.

PAK vs BAN match captain and vice-captain choices
Shakib Al Hasan

Shakib Al Hasan is an elite all-rounder who has played over 100 T20I matches. While he has not had the best of outings in the ongoing T20 World Cup, Shakib's last T20I fifty came against Pakistan earlier in the month. With his left-arm spin also bound to come into play. Shakib could be a fine pick as captain or vice-captain in your PAK vs BAN Dream11 prediction team.

Mohammad Rizwan

Mohammad Rizwan has a brilliant record against Bangladesh, scoring 242 runs in six matches at an average of 60.50. Although he has struggled for form, the conditions and dimensions of the Adelaide Oval should suit Rizwan. With the Pakistan keeper capable of scoring big runs, he is a good captaincy choice for your PAK vs BAN Dream11 prediction team.

Mohammad Nawaz has not been used much on the bowling front following Mohammad Wasim's inclusion in the side.
