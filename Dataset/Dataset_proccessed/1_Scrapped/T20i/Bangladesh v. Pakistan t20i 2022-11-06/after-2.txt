Pakistan vs Bangladesh, T20 World Cup, Super 12 Highlights: Mohammad Haris played a quickfire knock of 31 off just 12 balls as he helped Pakistan defeat Bangladesh by 5 wickets to seal a spot in the semi-finals. Pakistan have now joined India to qualify for semi-finals from Group 2. Earlier, Shaheen Shah Afridi returned with the figures of 4/22 as Pakistan restricted Bangladesh to 127/8 in 20 overs. Najmul Hassan Shanto was the only bright spot with the bat for Bangladesh as he registered a fifty. Shakib's dismissal was filled with a lot of drama as he was given out LBW even though the replays seemed to have indicated that there was an inside edge. (SCORECARD)

Here are the Highlights from T20 World Cup Super 12 match between Pakistan and Bangladesh straight from Adelaide Oval

Right then! That is it from this game. We have got our four semi-finalists, Pakistan, India, New Zealand and England. However, the action continues as India takes on Zimbabwe at the MCG and that game is set to begin at 1.30 pm IST (8 am GMT). You can switch tabs to follow all the updates. Cheers!

!

Babar Azam, the skipper of Pakistan is up for a chat. He says that he is happy with the performance. Adds that the pitch was a bit tricky and the plan for him and Mohammad Rizwan was to take the game deep, but it did not work out. Tells that it was good to see Mohammad Haris bat with some aggression. Ends by saying that they are all excited to play in the semi-finals.

!

Shakib Al Hasan, the captain of Bangladesh is up for a chat. He says that with the start that they got, they should have got something around 150. Mentions that the pitch was slow and it was not easy for the new batters. Tells that this is their best ever T20 World Cup campaign, but they could have done better. Ends by saying that as long as he remains fit he would love to play for his team.

!

Shaheen Afridi is the player of the match for his amazing bowling performance. He says that he has improved. Adds that it is not easy to bowl at the same pace after coming back from a injury. Mentions that as a team they have played good and tells that the plan was to bowl in the right areas. Ends by saying that they are actually looking towards the finals.

Presentation Time...

!

Earlier in the day, after electing to bat, Bangladesh got off to a good start but some brilliant bowling from Pakistan led by Shaheen Afridi's four-fer, restricted them to a low score which was quite easily chased.

!

Bangladesh were just not up for this game to be honest. After a disappointing display with the bat, the bowling and the fielding wasn't great either. There were quite a few extras and an important drop of Mohammad Rizwan earlier on too. Saying that, they just did not have enough on the board. Maybe another 20 runs and things could have been different.

!

127 was never going to be enough to be honest and the openers got Pakistan off to a steady start. Both fell in quick succession but then came the innings which took the game away from Bangladesh and it came from the bat of Mohammad Haris. He went after the bowlers right from the word go and got able support from Shan Masood. Their stand took Pakistan to the brink of victory before Haris fell. Masood though ensured there were no more wickets to fall and took their side over the line.

!

Pakistan, Pakistan it is who storm into the semi finals with a very convincing win over Bangladesh. What a turn around on this last day of the Super 12 stage. At the start of the day, not many would have predicted Pakistan to go through but they grabbed the opportunity that came to them after Netherlands beat South Africa and now are the fourth and final side to make it through.

EBADOT HOSSAIN TO SHAN MASOOD

Shan Masood hits the winning runs! Ebadot Hossain serves this full and on the pads, Shan Masood flicks it towards fine leg for two runs. The whole Pakistan dugout jumps up in joy. PAKISTAN WIN BY 5 WICKETS AND THEY ARE THROUGH TO THE SEMI-FINALS.

OUT! TAKEN! Mustafizur Rahman gets another wicket, but it is too little too late for Bangladesh. Mustafizur Rahman bowls the slower delivery, on off, Iftikhar Ahmed goes for the big slog, but gets a top edge straight up in the air towards the cover-point region where Najmul Hossain Shanto keeps his eyes on the ball, turns around and takes a really good catch.

Mustafizur Rahman nails the yorker, on off, Shan Masood is late to put his bat down to play at it and it goes through to the keeper. Nurul Hasan throws it at the bowler's end, but it hits the umpire. Shan Masood calls for the run, but he is sent back and rightly so.

SHAKIB AL HASAN TO MOHAMMAD HARIS

OUT! TAKEN! Mohammad Haris looks to finish things off early, but throws his wicket away. Shakib Al Hasan slows it up and bowls this around off, Mohammad Haris skips down the track and tries to clear the in-field, but he only manages to slice it uppishly towards cover-point where Nasum Ahmed takes a nice leaping catch. Haris is not happy with himself as he wanted to stay till the end.
