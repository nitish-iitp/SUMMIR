Thanks a lot for joining us, people. From Ekanth and I, Shashank, it's time to say goodbye. There's plenty for you to read and watch. We've got a star-studded ESPNcricinfo line-up of experts, so make sure you dig into everything that's coming your way across our channels. We'll see you tomorrow. Ta!

Aaron Finch is Player of the Match for his 44-ball 63.

"Wasn't the easiest wicket, lot slower than we thought it was be. They bowled well, cutters and stuff, was hard to get into rhythm. Nah, not feeling the pressure at all to be honest. The support from the change room and support staff has been incredible. T20 is a high risk-game, sometimes it comes off, sometimes it doesn't. It wasn't easy to come out and go after the bowling from the start. I've had a bit of a hammy twing, I don't feel too bad at the moment but generally overnight it can stiffen up a bit, let's see how it goes, will have a scan tomorrow."

Finch on Tim David [who didn't take the field]: Just a bit of hammy tightness, that was more precaution than anything.

Andrew Balbirnie: "We're making progress, to keep up with these big teams. It was hard fought. If someone had stayed with Lorcan Tucker, who knows."

Australia have won this easily in the end, but there will definitely be a fair few concerns in the camp. Aaron Finch didn't field for more than half the innings because of a hamstring issue. Tim David spent the entire innings off the field. Stoinis kept going in and out. So there are a number of injury concerns to address, the status of which we should/will know over the next 24 hours.

As such, the win itself gives Australia two handy points as they jump to No. 2 on the table with four points. They're one ahead of England, who have games against New Zealand and Sri Lanka to come. Australia, meanwhile, have one game to go against Afghanistan.

So Australia can win that game and move on to six points

ravi: "Little could have dived and would have probably made in. with 11 balls to go, Tucker could have reduced the margin by around 20 odd runs"

18.1
W
Maxwell to Little, OUT

That's the end of that. Little is well short of the crease at the bowler's end as Maxwell collects the throw on the bounce and breaks the bails cleanly to have Little well short. Australia win; it's not as massive as the 75 runs or more they needed to win by to get ahead of England on Net Run rate but it's a confidence-boosting win nonetheless. Coming back to the delivery, Little reverse swept this on the bounce to point and began running, and once he did that there was no looking back. He couldn't quite beat the throw and Maxwell and is well short.

Cummins to Little, 1 run

Heaved into the leg side, they'll get one off a thick inside edge

ShahSafeer : "Barry McCarthy has broken Tucker's back here, they had two wickets and could've caused some problems. He should always have gone for a one."

17.5

Cummins to Little, no run

Steep bounce, raw pace, good short ball. Beaten as he backs away to ramp.

Cummins to Little, no run

Hit on the body as he backs away to pull

17.3
•
Cummins to Little, no run

Arches back to ramp but is beaten again by this superb bouncer.

17.2
W
Cummins to McCarthy, OUT

Pulled but straight down Smith's throat at deep midwicket. He didn't have to move an inch, but let that not take anything away from the catch because this was really struck hard.

17.1
•
Cummins to McCarthy, no run

Slash and a miss. Dug in short outside off, he made room to slash this over point but is beaten for pace

So, are we on to something here? 44 needed off 18. Tucker stands in the way of Australia and victory. Can they make a fist of this?

Full toss and he's worked that into the gap at midwicket.

16.6

Starc to Tucker, 1 wide

Slips this full delivery down leg, Tucker misses the tickle. Wide called and rightly so.

16.5

Starc to Tucker, FOUR runs

Lofted imperiously over mid-off, superbly done. Starc too the pace off, Tucker was ready for it.

16.4

Starc to Tucker, no run

Slips it full and across Tucker who has backed away so far that he can't even reach the ball despite a full stretch

16.4
1w
Starc to Tucker, 1 wide

Backs away to slash that over short third, but is done in by the slowness of this bouncer. Got some bat on it but it doesn't carry to Wade. Wide called for height.

16.3

Starc to Tucker, 2 runs

Whips this to deep square, they'll come back for the second

16.2
4
Starc to Tucker, FOUR runs

That is a wonderful hit, one bounce to the long-off fence. Tucker is playing some innings here. Backs away to loft this inside-out over the infield

16.1

Starc to Tucker, FOUR runs

Scooped over the keeper for four. Gutsy this. Sees this pacy length ball from Starc, goes down low and well outside off to get inside the line and put that away.

Hazlewood to Tucker, FOUR runs

Carved over backward point. He saw width and threw his bat at that to get it up and over the infield, four more.

15.3
6
Hazlewood to Tucker, SIX runs

He's clubbed this over the ropes at long-on. That's into the second tier. He's teed off like a golfer, what a terrific hit that. This was slower, fuller, right into his swinging arc and Tucker absolutely nailed that.

Hazlewood to Tucker, no run

Slower bouncer on middle, Tucker beaten as he looks to pull. Played too early.
