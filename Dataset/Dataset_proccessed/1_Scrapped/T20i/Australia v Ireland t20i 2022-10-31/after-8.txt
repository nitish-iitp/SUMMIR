In Short
Barry McCarthy saved 4 runs for his team with his fielding effort
McCarthy also picked up 3 wickets for 29 runs
Australia scored 179/5 after being put in to bat first

Ireland's Barry McCarthy gave an account of his stupendous fielding skills in his team's T20 World Cup 2022 Super 12 match against Aaron Finch’s Australia at The Gabba in Brisbane.

In the second ball of the 14th over, Mark Adair bowled a slower delivery at a full length and Marcus Stoinis tried to go downtown for a massive six. The batter got enough elevation, but didn't seem to have gotten enough distance.

However, it seemed as if the ball would cross the boundary down the ground. However, McCarthy had other ideas. He judged the trajectory of the ball to perfection and pulled off a dive. On realising that he was about to land beyond the boundary, McCarthy released the ball into play.

The third umpire checked if McCarthy’s effort was a clean one. In the end, he managed to save four crucial runs for his team at a stage when Stoinis and Australia were looking to give their innings a finishing kick.

Stoinis went on to score 35 runs off 25 balls with three fours and one six before Joshua Little accounted for his wicket. The Aussies scored 179 for the loss of five wickets after being put in to bat first.

Skipper Aaron Finch made 63 runs off 44 balls with five fours and three sixes and helped Australia post a competitive score. Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell and Tim David also played useful cameos at the death.

As far as McCarthy is concerned, he was the pick of the bowlers for Ireland. The right-armer picked up the wickets of David Warner, Finch and Marsh and gave 29 runs in four overs.
