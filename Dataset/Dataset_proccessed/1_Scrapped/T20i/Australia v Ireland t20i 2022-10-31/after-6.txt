Australia march on

Of course they do, does everyone not remember last time?

That’s it from Brisbane and from me. Things are tantalisingly poised in both groups of this T20 World Cup, there’s no wiggle room whatsoever. Let’s hope the weather keeps its beak out. We’ll be back to OBO England v New Zealand in the morning, loins girded for that. Until then, goodbye!

Lorcan Tucker ran the drinks for Ireland at last year’s T20 World Cup. He’s the top-scorer in this one

Australia win by 42 runs!

Oh no! A mix up and Josh Little is run out by a Mitch Marsh/Maxwell combo. That’s yer lot. Australia win by 42 runs and improve their NRR in the process. It wasn’t quite as big a win as they might’ve hoped when they reduced Ireland t0 25-5 but crucial to get the points on the board and worry about the rest later.

Ireland recovered well largely thanks to Lorcan Tucker who made a dashing 71*, the next highest score on the card being 14.

18th over: Ireland 137-9 (Tucker 71, Little 1) Josh Little joins Tucker in the middle, he faces three dots and then pinches the strike from Tucker with a single off the last ball. Two overs to go, 43 needed from 12 balls.

McCarthy ct Smith b Cummins 3 (Ireland 136-9)

Gah! Full blooded pull shot but straight to Steve Smith on the midwicket boundary. Ireland nine down.

17th over: Ireland 136-8 (Tucker 71, McCarthy 3) Starc back to bowl his final over. We’ve seen both sides of him this evening, the wickets and the leaked runs. Tucker shows off all of his batting skills, a clever (and brave) scoop over Wade brings four and a lofted drive off the next ball more of the same. Starc looks annoyed and begins to spray it about, a couple of wides before Tucker lays into him again with a fantastic aerial drive over the covers. Do Ireland dare to believe? They need 44 off 19.

16th over: Ireland 118-8 (Tucker 55, McCarthy 3) Lorcan Tucker brings up his fifty with a huge six! Hazlewood sends one down in his arc and the Irishman tees off. Swatting him into the stands. Well batted that man. Tucker digs out a yorker to keep strike. A spirited knock and every run eats into the Aussie run rate.

12.09 CET

15th over: Ireland 106-8 (Tucker 44, McCarthy 2) Adam Zampa finishes his stint, he’s bowled very well, 2-19 off his four.

Right, so England's net run rate will stay ahead of Australia after this game, just. They owe Lorcan Tucker a beer.

Wicket! Hand b Zampa 6 (Ireland 103-8)

Zampa has another victim, he foxes Hand with the googly. Australia need just two more to chalk up the win.

12.04 CET

14th over: Ireland 102-7 (Tucker 42, Hand 6) Shot! Hand drives Pat Cummins away for a sweetly timed four. Ireland score seven off the over. They need 78 off 36 balls.

This is worth remembering too:

England have the advantage of playing last in Group 1 - so therefore knowing what they need to win by to get their NRR ahead of Australia - but have the disadvantage of their last two games being v NZ & SL while Aus play Ire & Afg. NRR won't matter if they lose. #T20WorldCup

Wicket! Adair st Wade b Zampa 11 (Ireland 91-7)

Zampa fizzes one past Adair’s edge and Wade flicks off the bails with the batter well out of his ground. Five singles off the over, Fionn Hand joins Tucker in the middle. Australia look a bit twitchy with Finch off the field, plenty of lieutenants waving arms as they try to win this match by a decisive margin.

13th over: Ireland 95-7 (Tucker 40, Hand 1)

12th over: Ireland 90-6 (Tucker 36, Adair 11) Amongst it all Lorcan Tucker has batted very nicely, Starc drags down and Tucker smacks him away in front of square. Seeing it big and early despite the express pace. Another lovely shot! Tucker leans back and punts Starc over extra-cover for four. A flayed drive brings two more. DROP! Starc is livid, how crucial will that be? A top edge from Tucker goes high into the Brisbane sky and falls straight through Pat Cummins’ upturned hands. Tense stuff. Twelve from the over.

11th over: Ireland 78-6 (Tucker 25, Adair 10) Zampa continues, Adair cuts him in the gap behind point for four. Five off the over. Mitchell Starc is coming back, can he finish this off quickly and give the Aussies a NRR shot in the arm?

Wicket! Delany c Maxwell b Stoinis 14 (Ireland 68-6)

Delany gets a top edge to Stoinis and is snaffled by Maxwell running round at midwicket. Edgy times for the rest of the group, all eyes on that margin of victory.

This has the makings of a very bad evening for England. Obviously have a game in hand, but big NRR swing incoming. Australia win by 75 or more and they overtake England's NRR. Would add another very large consideration to games against NZ and SL.

9th over: Ireland 67-5 (Tucker 24, Delany 14) Adam Zampa into the attack and he spears in an over that goes for just five singles.

One great gift of DRS is the wicket-keeper's instant shift from loud gleeful appeal (to umpire) into instant nah-mate-didn't-hear-anything (to captain re review). Involves highly skilled facial gymnastics. Matthew Wade world class just now

8th over: Ireland 62-5 (Tucker 21, Delany 12) Aaron Finch limps off the field, he seems to have aggravated an injury he sustained whilst batting. It’ll be interesting to see who takes the reins for Australia… it looks to be Wade behind the stumps. Five runs off the returning Hazlewood.

@Jimbo_Cricket is this a good day for bears and picnic baskets in Western Australia? Why are there so many Park Rangers in the Gabba?

— eamorugby (@HoarseRoar) October 31, 2022

It’s no picnic for Ireland at the moment.

6th over: Ireland 49-5 (Tucker 17, Delany 4) Ireland aren’t going down without a fight, they take sixteen off Starc’s over. Tucker looks in fine fettle, he flicks Starc to mid-wicket and pings an imperious pull off the next to hit consecutive boundaries. Delany gets in on the act with an open faced drive for four to third. Welcome runs for England fans fearful of that NRR.

5th over: Ireland 35-5 (Tucker 9, Delany 0) Right then, who is batting now? Tucker is still there and so is Gareth Delany. Cummins continues after the Starc carnage, Tucker walks down the wicket and pings him through wicket, ain’t no thang. What a shot that is amongst the mayhem. Tucker nudges two to fine leg and a lesser spotted three off a hack through mid-on. Ten off the over and NO ONE DIED GOT OUT.

Reasons to be fearful/cheerful… one, two, three. Worth noting that if the Aussie margin of victory is 75 runs or more then their NRR will leapfrog England’s. I’m just the messenger.

Wicket! Dockrell b Starc (Ireland 25-5)

I can’t type these wickets out quick enough! “Rinse and repeat” says Isa Guha on tv comms and that is exactly it - full and fast with a bit of shape - Starc has two in the over, a double wicket maiden. This is an obliteration.

4th over: Ireland 25-5 (Tucker 0, Delany 0)

Wicket! Tector ct Sub (S Smith) b Maxwell (Ireland 22-3)

Harry Tector plays a sublime drive through mid-off… and then pulls a simple catch to Smith at square leg. Two in the over for Maxwell! Oh and Mitchell Starc is coming on.

3rd over: Ireland 24-3 (Tucker 0, Campher 0)

Wicket! Balbirnie b Cummins 6 (Ireland 18-1)

Stirling sends Pat Cummins into the stands, a huge six off a good length ball. Nonchalant from the big man too. A swivelled pull brings Stirling four more and a leg bye brings the Irish skipper back on strike. His luck runs out as he steps to the offside and is cleaned up by Cummins. Frenetic start!

2nd over: Ireland 18-1 (Stirling 6, Tucker 0)

1st over: Ireland 7-0 (Stirling 6, Balbirnie 1) Hazlewood gets one to hoop with a perfect seam, Balbirnie aims big yahoo and misses, the ball clips the bails as it goes past but incredibly they remain unmoved! The luck of… DONT say it. Stirling then sets his stall out in fine fashion by pulling Hazlewood for six! Fantastic stuff.

Australia set Ireland 180 to win

20th over: Australia 179-5 (David 15, Wade 7) Poor old Mark Adair… he gets some more tap from his final over, seventeen runs coming off the last of the innings to leave Ireland staring up at an imposing total. Tim David climbs into the first half of the over, bunting full deliveries and full tosses to the boundary. Wade then improvises a sprawling ramp from a very wide delivery that was heading off the cut strip, four more runs. A scampered two off the last brings the Aussie innings to a close. Adair is left to lick his wounds, 59 runs snatched off his spell.
