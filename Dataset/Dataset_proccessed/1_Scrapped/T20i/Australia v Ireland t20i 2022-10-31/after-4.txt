Australia has beaten Ireland by 42 runs, improving their net run rate and keeping their T20 World Cup hopes alive.

The victory may have come at a cost though, with three players, including skipper Aaron Finch, absent during Ireland's chase and set for scans in the morning.

After being put into bat, Australia made 5-179, with player of the match Finch leading the way, scoring 63 off 44 balls.

With an imposing total to chase, Australia's bowlers promptly ended the match as a contest with a blistering assault on the Irish top order.

Andrew Balbirnie (6), Paul Stirling (11), Harry Tector (6), Curtis Campher (0) and George Dockrell (0) all fell inside the opening four overs, leaving Ireland teetering on 5-25.

Lorcan Tucker though saved Ireland's blushes with a brave 48-ball 71, frustrating Australia's hunt for a vast improvement on their perilous net run rate. 

The equation for Australia heading into this match was simple — win first and improve net run rate later.

Losing the toss and then David Warner for just 3 inside three overs was not part of the plan, but some big hitting from Mitch Marsh (28) and Finch helped settle the Aussies into their innings.

Glenn Maxwell came and went for just 13, one of Josh LIttle's two victims in his excellent figures of 2-21.

Marcus Stoinis hammered 35 from 25 balls before he also fell to Little, with Tim David (15 not out) and Matthew Wade (7 not out) helping Australia to its impressive total.

Barry McCarthy also impressed with the ball, taking the wickets of Warner, Marsh and Finch.

Pat Cummins, Maxwell and Mitchell Starc then took centre stage, ripping through Ireland's attack in a devastating display of bowling to eviscerate Ireland's hopes of a third underdog victory at this tournament.

Australia may have had designs on wiping out their net run rate deficit in one fell swoop, but that did not take into account the hitting of Tucker.

"First and foremost that was our main goal, to win the game," Finch told ABC Sport.

"You do have dreams when they are 5-35 that you can really blow it apart, but they played brilliantly well during that middle part of the innings.

"They come back at us, they fought fire with fire."

Tucker was inventive in his innings, hitting nine fours and one massive six straight down the ground off Hazlewood to bring up his fifth T20I fifty.

"He played a really smart innings," Finch said.

"He got away early then he manipulated the field really well.

"It's one of those innings really good players can have in T20 cricket."

He had precious little support though, with only Gareth Delany (14) and Mark Adair (11) lasting more than ten balls in the middle.

There are injury concerns for Australia as Finch (hamstring) and Stoinis (side) exited the field during Ireland's batting innings, while David never came out after batting.

"It's not too bad," Finch told ABC Sport.

"I'll have a scan tomorrow and get the full picture of it but hopeful I'll be right for Friday [against Afghanistan in Adelaide]." 

All will require scans.

Finch being off the field may have played a role in Australia's foot being taken off Ireland's throat, with Matthew Wade thrown into an unfamiliar captaincy role and three sub fielders on the ground.

Australia will now pay close attention to the match between England and New Zealand at the Gabba on Tuesday, as Group One continues to take shape.

Australia wins by 42 runs

By Simon Smale

The early flurry or wickets ensured that Ireland were never really in this chase, but a brave unbeaten 71 from Lorcan Tucker gave Australia a little bit to sweat on.

Eventually though, Ireland were all out for 137.

A comfortable win, but Australia would have hoped to get those wickets earlier, especially given they had Ireland at 5-25 after 4 overs.

RUN OUT!

By Simon Smale

Little bought out the reverse sweep, took off for a single.

There were two men back there and he's been run out at the non-strikers end by a mile.

Over 19: Glenn Maxwell to bowl

By Simon Smale

Over 18: Cummins continues

By Simon Smale

Little tries the ramp over the keeper off a short wide ball. Doesn't make contact.

Little swings, it hits him on the back, there's no run as gully fields and cocks his arm ready to throw.

Another dot.

And now Little gets a single AND THEY TAKE IT! Why!?

Little farms the strike and Ireland get just one off the over.

IRE 9-137

OUT! BARRY McCARTHY HOLES OUT TO SMITH AT LONG OFF

By Simon Smale

Oh that's a shame. McCarthy swung lustily, but picked put Smith on the boundary, who did not need to move.

Any faint, faint hopes have now been extinguished.

Little will be on strike next ball.

31 Oct 2022, 11:15am
Over 18: Pat Cummins returns

By Simon Smale

Ireland need 44 from 18 balls.

Surely not...

Wide bouncer and Barry McCarthy, who just needs to get off strike really, swings and misses.

31 Oct 2022, 11:11am
Over 17: Mitchell Starc comes back into the attack

By Simon Smale

He's been switched to the Stanley Street end.

LOVELY SHOT! He's scooped that back over his head for four runs!

(Getty Images)

Aaron Finch has just thrown a white towel onto the pitch... I think for Hazlewood to dry his hands as I can't imagine he'd want to concede this...

Four more! That's a lovely shot to long off. One bounce and over the rope.

Two more runs for Tucker there off his pads. Intelligent batting.

Wide, very wide, Lorcan Tucker would have needed a stepladder to get close to that one.

Ireland need 51 from 21.

Wide yorker, Starc saw him go to the leg side and bowled it to the off. No run.

SHOT! Inside out from Tucker and that's another four, this time a two-bounce four over mid off.

Attempted yorker misses down the leg side. Another wide.

Tucker will take two by punching the ball to wide long on - a well placed shot.

IRE 8-136
31 Oct 2022, 11:04am
Over 16: Josh Hazlewood is back

By Simon Smale

McCarthy hammers a ball to Starc at mid on, who flings at the stumps, but cannot hit the target.

Tucker swings, misses at a bouncer. Wade has to dive forward to take it and it falls short anyway, so pace off from Hazlewood.

SIX! TUCKER HAS 50!

(Getty Images)

That flew up over our head and into the tier above us in the press box. A big hit.

Great innings from Tucker, 50 off 40 balls.

It's been a singular effort for Ireland, but a decent one.

Slashed away, edged really over gully for four more!

He gets off strike with a mishit shot into the off side that came off his leg.

Ireland need 62 runs, by the way, from 25 balls.

Wide yorker from Hazlewood reduces that to 24 balls.

IRE 8-118
31 Oct 2022, 11:03am
Over 15: More from Zampa

By Simon Smale

Barry McCarthy took a wicket with his first ball of his first two overs.

He survives the first he gets with the bat, scoring a single to long off.

Tucker heaves and gets a single to midwicket.

McCarthy pushes down to mid on for another single to end the over.

IRE 8-106
31 Oct 2022, 11:02am
BOWLED HIM! HAND GOES!

By Simon Smale

He looked for the pre-meditated sweep, stepped a long way across his stumps and was bowled on middle and off.

He departs for a run a ball 6.

Australia are two away.

31 Oct 2022, 11:01am
Over 15: Zampa to continue

By Simon Smale

Tucker gets a single to rotate the strike.

31 Oct 2022, 10:55am
Over 14: Pat Cummins is back

By Simon Smale

Tucker, who is now on 40 from 33, misses with a wild swing. No run.

That's lofted away to mid off, falls safe and they run a single.

Hand fends into the off side, and gets a single as well.

Cummins just misses his length on an attempted yorker, and Tucker gets the full toss away for a single.

A bouncer outside off, Hand attempts to dab the ball over the keeper.

Hand throws his appendages at this outside off and gets four! Lovely shot.

IRE 7-102
31 Oct 2022, 10:54am
Over 13: More from Zampa to complete his over

By Simon Smale

Hand fends the first backward of square to gully.

He takes a single down to long off after Zampa strays long with that ball.

A quick couple for Tucker there out to the midwicket boundary,. Good running.

He takes a single off the last ball into the same midwicket region.

IRE 7-95
31 Oct 2022, 10:52am
STUMPED HIM! ADAIR DEPARTS FOR 11

By Simon Smale

Adair came, Zampa saw, Wade conquered.

Lovely stuff from the Aussie spinner, who pushed the ball past the advancing batter and Wade made no mistake.

Ireland 7-91 and not long for this match, or tournament.

31 Oct 2022, 10:52am
Over 13: Zampa may well bowl through here

By Simon Smale

A single off the first to Tucker.

31 Oct 2022, 10:48am
Over 12: Starc is back

By Simon Smale

Adair tucks the first away off his pads for a single.

There's a Mexican wave going round the ground now.

But now everyone is up applauding another excellent shot from Tucker, pulling a ball from outside off to the midwicket boundary with consumate ease.

SHOT! Four more! Tucker backs away, gives himself room and just hammers the ball through mid off for four more!

A slower ball bouncer and despite getting in a good position, Tucker can't get it away. He hammers the bat in frustration with his gloved fist. He is making a decent effort of this fruitless chase, is Tucker.

That ball squirts off his bat backward of square to third man for another couple of runs.

Field change. square leg comes up, midwicket goes back.

AND THAT BALL IS HAMMERED STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR! Cummins is underneath it! AND HE DROPS IT!

Wow! Tucker fell into the trap but managed to wiggle his way out again, running a single as he does.

IRE 6-90
31 Oct 2022, 10:44am
Over 11: Zampa will continue

By Simon Smale

Great stop by David Warner at cover, and then a good throw at the non-strikers end would have had Tucker short had it hit! Nice work. No run.

Runs here though! Four of them! Adair leans back and cuts backward of square for a boundary.

Straight back to Zampa now. No run.

Another cut, this one goes square and earns Adair a single.

Zampa gets down well to stop another run down to mid off to end the over.

Stoinis has just disappeared down the tunnel as well - a few changes in personnel for the Aussies - let's hope none of them are serious.

IRE 6-78
31 Oct 2022, 10:40am
Over 10: Stoinis still has four to bowl

By Simon Smale

That's gone straight up too off a top edge from Adair! It will fall safe though despite Matthew Wade scurrying after it as quick as his padded legs will carry him.

They ran two.

They run another two now as Adair helps the ball backward of square on the leg side.

Adair tries to help the ball up over Wade's head but does not make contact. No run.

Adair baseball-strikes the ball down the ground for a single.

IRE 6-73
31 Oct 2022, 10:38am
STOINIS CAN MAKE THE BREAKTHROUGH! DELANY GOES!

By Simon Smale

It's a tame ending really, George Delany hitting the ball straight up in the air, two fielders converged but it was it was well taken in the end by Maxwell.

We'll take this opportunity to have a drink.

31 Oct 2022, 10:35am
Over 10: Can Marcus Stoinis make the breakthrough?

By Simon Smale

A single off the first for Tucker - he's on 25 now from 24 balls.
