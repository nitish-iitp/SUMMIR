Nepal Vs Sri Lanka, T20 World Cup Highlights: Match Abandoned Due To Non-Stop Rain; Teams Share Points

The 23rd match of ICC T20 World Cup 2024 between Sri Lanka and Nepal was washed out due to relentless rain in Lauderhill, Florida on Wednesday, June 12. Umpires were forced to call off the game without a ball being bowled as the continuous downpour left the outfield too wet for play. The result handed both teams a point, but made their potential route to Super 8s that much more challenging. Catch the highlights of the NEP vs SL match at T20 WC 2024, right here

Nepal Vs Sri Lanka: Weather Update

Non-stop rain in Florida means that the toss has been delayed for the Nepal vs Sri Lanka game. A full game today looks unlikely, and whether or not we will get any play depends on when the rain will cease. Stay with us for the latest updates on that.

Rain Stops, For Now

The update from the ground is that the rain has stopped for now. But given the volume of downpour already and the wet patches in the outfield, it is expected to take another 90 minutes to get ready for play. If there is no more rain, that is.

Ground Inspection At 6am IST

The umpires will next inspect the ground conditions at 8:30pm local (6am IST) to gauge when (and if) the match can begin. The cut-off time for a five-over game is 10:48pm local (8:18am IST).

Super 8 Qualification Scenarios

In case the match is washed out, Sri Lanka and Nepal will share one point each. What that would mean for the Super 8 qualification scenario is as follows: Sri Lanka would need to defeat Netherlands in their next game and hope Bangladesh lose to both Nepal and Netherlands, in order to stand a chance to qualify. As for Nepal, they would need wins against South Africa and Bangladesh, and hope for Netherlands to lose their next two clashes.

Match Washed Out

And that's unfortunately that. The game is called off by the umpires due to all the rain through the day in Florida. This means that both teams get a point each - their first points in T20 World Cup 2024.

This also means that South Africa are the first team to confirm their passage to the Super 8s.

 12 Jun 2024, 06:34:08 am IST
What Next For Nepal

Nepal will next take on South Africa and Bangladesh, and need to win both matches to have a fair chance of qualification for Super 8s.

 12 Jun 2024, 06:53:06 am IST
What Next For Sri Lanka

Though they are virtually knocked out, Wanindu Hasaranga's Sri Lanka are mathematically still in contention for Super 8s. They will next face Netherlands (and seek a win), plus hope Bangladesh lose to both Nepal and Netherlands, in order to stand a teeny tiny chance to qualify.
