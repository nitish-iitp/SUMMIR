SL vs NED Scorecard
Sri Lanka vs Netherlands Commentary
3:56 AM IST That is all from this game. The places have been filled for the Super Eights but we still have a couple of games to go from the group stages. New Zealand will face Papua New Guinea on the 17th of this month. Join us at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT) and earlier for the build-up. Till then, cheers!
3:55 AM IST Wanindu Hasaranga, the skipper of Sri Lanka says that after the first two defeats, this win is healthy for them. Adds that they saw that the wicket was good last night and thought that anything above 160, they could defend. Tells that losing a lot of wickets in clusters cost them a lot. Praises Asalanka and says that he has a lot of talent and showed what he can do for the team. Ends by saying that Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva also played key roles in this game.
3:52 AM IST Scott Edwards, the skipper of Netherlands says the wicket was better than what they have been playing on in other grounds. Adds they didn't execute the plans though and credits the way Sri Lanka batted. Tells they were slow to react and use the longer side of the fence. Feels against a good quality side, they can't afford to be lost for even a small period. Mentions they wanted one of the batters to have big contributions but it didn't happen.
3:49 AM IST Wanindu Hasaranga did said at the toss that the batters need to step up and boy they did, all of them made some crucial contributions. The surface was perfect to bat on and Sri Lanka showed a lot of character right till the last ball. In the second innings, the first six overs didn't go the Lankans' way but they bowled well throughout, took regular wickets to win by a big margin. Nuwan Thushara was the pick of the bowlers as he took three wickets while Wanindu Hasaranga and Matheesha Pathirana took two each.
3:48 AM IST Netherlands were 47/2 inside the Powerplay, they were going strong but the news came in about their qualification chances and all of a sudden, they lost 5 wickets in 5 overs. Scott Edwards was there for a long period of time but Netherlands never showed any intent to chase down this humongous total. On the other hand, this was the best performance by Sri Lanka in this tournament. Proper all-round performance from them but it came a little too late as they had nothing but to play for pride.
3:47 AM IST A convincing win in the end for Sri Lanka! The eyes were on Netherlands though at the start of the game. They came on the ground with a purpose but when it mattered the most, they succumbed under pressure. The bowling group mainly didn't execute their plans. Netherlands were ordinary with the ball throughout the innings. They allowed a couple of big partnerships to build on to make things worse for them. With the bat, the openers started well, Michael Levitt particularly showed a lot of intent but Sri Lanka knew they were a couple of wickets away from dominating the game.
