PREVIEW

Group D matches are set to end on Sunday, with Sri Lanka taking on Netherlands in St. Lucia. It has been a terrible campaign for the Sri Lankans as they crashed out of the tournament after their match against Nepal was rained out. The Netherlands, on the other hand, still has faint hopes of making it to the Super -8 stages if Nepal can beat Bangladesh in the other encounter.

Sri Lanka (SL) came into the T20 World Cup with high hopes. In the end, those hopes were dashed thanks to the abysmal batting performance by the 2014 T20 World Cup winners. Barring Pathum Nissanka and Nuwan Thusara, none of the players stood up and showed their real talents on the field.

Netherlands (NED) have been one of the most dynamic sides in ICC events in recent times. The team is filled with youth and experience, and their natural flair on the field makes them an exciting bunch. After starting the campaign with a win over Nepal, the Dutch saw their campaign come apart with losses to South Africa and Bangladesh.

Nuwan Thushara SL | BOWL

The 29-year-old pacer was at his best with the ball as he picked 4/18 from his 4 overs. This spell nearly swung the game back in favor of Sri Lanka and nearly pulled off a win.

Aryan Dutt NED | BOWL

Young Aryan Dutt is slowly becoming a very good T20 bowler and his ability to prize out wickets with his penetrative bowling against the left-handers makes his a dangerous prespect.

Dasun Shanaka

SL | ALL

Former Sri Lankan skipper Dasun Shanaka has been having a tough time with the bat and ball in what has been a disastrous T20 World Cup campaign. Questions will surely be asked once the team heads back home about Shanaka's place in the team.

Bas de Leede

NED | BAT

Young Bas De Leede created quiet a hype around himself in 2023 due to his all-round skills. This year his performance has taken a huge dip and his naturally attacking play has been missing much to the disappointment of his team.
