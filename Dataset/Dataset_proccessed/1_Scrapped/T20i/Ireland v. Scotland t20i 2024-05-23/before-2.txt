Earlier in the day, Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara asserted there were no lapses on the part of the government in handling cases relating to the alleged sexual abuse of women by Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna and that the Special Investigation Team was probing them from all angles, news agency PTI reported. He also rubbished the opposition parties’ allegations about the collapse of law and order in Karnataka and defended the state police, saying they have “done well,” according to the report.

India’s first research testbed to study Nor’westers getting ready: Here’s all you need to know

Meteorologists will soon be able to deploy drones, mobile vans and high-end instruments to track the monstrous nor’westers, or Kalbaisakhi, that affect the east and northeast regions of India every summer. The proposed multi-crore rupees research testbed facility will cover a large area adjoining West Bengal, Odisha, and Jharkhand. The control centre will be at Chandbali in the Bhadrak district of Odisha, about 130 km east of Bhubaneswar. Originating over east and northeast India, south Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh, the nor’westers are extremely severe thunderstorms accompanied by squally winds. Though the nor’westers were less active this summer, there were occasional instances in April and early May. Strong winds and thunderstorms swept through the northern districts of West Bengal, Assam and Tripura, killing at least five people last month.
