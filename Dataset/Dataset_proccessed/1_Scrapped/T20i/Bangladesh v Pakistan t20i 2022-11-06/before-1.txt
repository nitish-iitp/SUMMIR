The cricket expert also emphasized the fact Pakistan's game against South Africa will be a tough one. The Men in Green will need to upcoming game at any cost and they need to win it by a decent margin to keep their hopes alive in the tournament. 

It is going to be one hell of a game: Akhtar on PAK vs SA game

“They could’ve put the match in jeopardy but they did not do that. India has done really well. Pakistan was praying for India to lose the game somehow. Pakistan’s match against South Africa will be a tough one. It’s going to be one hell of a game. It’s not going to be easy for Pakistan," said Akhtar.

Akhtar also praised Kohli for continuing his excellent form in the tournament. The veteran also gave his views on the viral video of Kohli's hotel room. He said that everything in Kohli's room was properly arranged which shows his mannerism.

“I think Virat Kohli has been amazing and brilliant. Plus, his video that came out yesterday regarding his hotel room. We also stay in hotels all the time, so I request the staff and fans not to make such videos. You invade his personal life, showing his personal stuff on the video. Some people are staying with their wife and kids. But I was happy to see that he is very tidy. Everything is arranged properly. That goes to show the mannerism of the man," Akhtar added.
