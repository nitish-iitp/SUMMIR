T20 World Cup Group D Points Table Updated after SL vs BAN: South Africa on top; Bangladesh second after win over Sri Lanka

Bangladesh pipped Sri Lanka by two wickets in a low-scoring thriller in Dallas on Saturday to move to third in the Group D points table of the 2024 T20 World Cup.

JUNE 08, 2024 09:28
BAN 125/8 in 19 overs

Shanaka into the attack. SIX!! Full toss first up, Mahmudullah deposits it over squareleg for six. Shorter in length, turned leg side for a single. Tanzim goes for the lofted shot, the ball keeps low and rolls through to the keeper. Full on the pads, flicked to deep square for a single. Short ball outside off stump, left alone but wide not given. 

Another short delivery that Mahmudullah misses, vociferous appeal from Kusal and SL review. Looks like daylight between bat and ball. Wide given as well. 

Ohh!! Mahmudullah crunches the drive to mid off, sets off for a single. Was nowhere close to making it to the crease. There was no direct hit and the batters scamper back for a second to seal the win. BAN has squeezed out a win with two wickets left.

JUNE 08, 2024 09:18
W
BAN 114/8 in 18 overs

Thushara into the attack. Slower length ball, pulled to deep square for a single. WICKET!!! Slower ball in the slot, Rishad’s eyes lit up seeing the length but completely misses his lofted shot. Unnecessary wicket for Bangladesh to lose at this juncture. 

Rishad Hossain b N Thushara 1(3)

Full and straight to Taskin, appeals for lbw not given. SL review. Impact in line and wickets hitting. Two in two for Sri Lanka!

Taskin Ahmed lbw b N Thushara 0(1)

JUNE 08, 2024 09:12

JUNE 08, 2024 09:04
W
BAN 100/5 in 15 overs

Hasaranga returns. WICKET!! Litton looks to prod forward and defend, is hit on the pads and the finger is raised. After a lengthy deliberation, Litton goes up for the review. Three reds and he has to head back. 

Litton Das lbw b Hasaranga 36(38)

Mahmudullah in at 7. Turns the first ball to midwicket to bring up 100 for Bangladesh.

JUNE 08, 2024 08:50
BAN 92/4 in 12 overs

Hasaranga with his third. Six!! Full in the slot, Hridoy slog sweeps it over midwicket for six. Six!! Full again, slog swept for a bigger six. Six!! Full outside off, lofted over long off. Hridoy helping Bangladesh run away with it. Appeal for LBW, not given on field. Hasaranga opts to review. Looks very very close in slow mo. Three reds and Hridoy has to depart. 

Towhid Hridoy lbw b Hasaranga 40(20)

Shakib in at 6. Gets off the mark with a single. 

JUNE 08, 2024 08:46

W
One more for Thushara!

Bangladesh continues to struggle against Thushara. Shanto is snared by a slower one, which he drive straight at Asalanka at short cover. Sri Lanka making a game out of this.

BAN 34/3 in 6 overs

JUNE 08, 2024 08:19
BAN 28/2 in 5 overs

Theekshana continues. Nothing for the Bangladesh batters to work with. Litton looks to take Theekshana with a sweep. Top edge and runs away for a four. 

JUNE 08, 2024 08:15
BAN 20/2 in 4 overs

Second over for Thushara as Sri Lanka continues its hunt for another wicket. Four singles from the over as Shanto and Litton refuse to take on the Lankan pacer.

JUNE 08, 2024 07:42

Sakib with the last over. Mathews kicks it off with a four to the leg side. A misfield at short third allows Mathews to squeeze in a double. Two dot balls follow as Mathews opts to retain the strike. Slower ball from Sakib and Mathews slices it straight to short third. 

Angelo Mathews c Mustafizur Rahman b Tanzim Hasan Sakib 16 (19b 1x4 0x6)

Sri Lanka ends with a disappointing 124/9 in 20 overs.

JUNE 08, 2024 07:35

SL 118/8 in 19 overs

JUNE 08, 2024 07:30

Final over of the day for Taskin. Shanaka with a single to start the over. Taskin goes short to Mathews. Too short says the umpire. Wide given. Short of a length from Taskin and Shanaka can only edge it to the keeper. 

Dasun Shanaka c †Litton Das b Taskin Ahmed 3 (7b 0x4 0x6)

JUNE 08, 2024 07:22
W

JUNE 08, 2024 07:19
SL 109/5 in 16 overs

JUNE 08, 2024 07:13
Rishad gets one more!

One brings two. Rishad slides one in which spins sharply off the pitch. Edged and gobbled up at first slip.

Fizz almost gets another one. Around the wicket from the left-arm pacer. DDS almost slices it onto his stumps. Length now from Fizz. DDS manages to squeeze it away for a single. Fizz squares up Asalanka and strikes him on the pad. A lot of discussion, but no review taken. 

JUNE 08, 2024 07:04
SL 94/3 in 13 overs

Third over for Shakib. Much quieter one from the Bangladesh veteran. Just five singles from it. 

JUNE 08, 2024 07:01
SL 89/3 in 12 overs

Peach! Taskin has the measure of Asalanka with a good length ball which nips away just enough. Beaten all ends up. Taskin keeps the pressure on against Asalanka too with some well directed back of length deliveries. Asalanka dabs one short and sets off for a single which is not there. Quick throw and it ricochets off for a four before Asalanka put in a full-length dive to get back into the crease. 

JUNE 08, 2024 06:54
SL 83/3 in 11 overs

Second over for Rishad. He starts with a slip against Asalanka. The left-handed batter leaves the second ball of the over, a rare sight at this stage of a T20 innings. Full from Rishad and DDS carts it straight back. Good fielding at long off to prevent a boundary. But Asalanka doesn’t miss out. Quicker from Rishad and it is launched over long on for a six. 

JUNE 08, 2024 06:49
SL 74/3 in 10 overs

A tidy over from Mahmudullah. Just four runs from it. Drinks break taken. 

JUNE 08, 2024 06:44
Fizz again!

Fizz back at it. Couple of singles to start with. Half tracker from the left-arm pacer. Nissanka has all the time in the world to thump it for a four to cow corner. 

Fizz now produces his trademark cutter. Mishit from Nissanka and an easy catch for Shanto. 

Pathum Nissanka c Najmul Hossain Shanto b Mustafizur Rahman 47 (28b 7x4 1x6)

JUNE 08, 2024 06:39
SL 64/2 in 8 overs

Rishad Hossain gets his first over of the day. Nissanka cuts one very fine and gains a four from it. Well flighted by Rishad next up. Beats Nissanka’s outside edge. 

JUNE 08, 2024 06:28
W
Fizz gets into it!

Mustafizur strikes first ball. Slower ball straight up and Kamindu Mendis chips it straight to mid off. Talk about instant impact. 

Kamindu Mendis c Tanzim Hasan Sakib b Mustafizur Rahman 4 (5b 1x4 0x6)

Dhananjaya de Silva is the new batter. Full and wide from the Fizz and DDS carves it behind point for a four. 

SL 53/2 in 6 overs

JUNE 08, 2024 06:25
SL 48/1 in 5 overs

Nissanka takes on Shakib now. Back-to-back boundaries. The first driven down the ground and the next pulled over mid wicket. And he isn’t done. Too leg-sideish from Shakib and swept away for a four. Shakib pushes it full and Nissanka pumps it over mid wicket for another four. 16 runs off the over. 

JUNE 08, 2024 06:22
SL 32/1 in 4 overs

Sakib surprises Nissanka with a shorter one. Clangs him on the helmet. Nissanka is unfazed as he whacks the next one -- a fuller ball -- for a six straight back. 

Sakib goes back of a length and has Nissanka beaten for pace for the next two balls. 

JUNE 08, 2024 06:15
B
Taskin strikes!

Short from Taskin to start with. Pulled off the front foot for a four by Kusal Mendis. Length ball outside off now. Mendis frees his arms. Wide of deep third and four more. 

But Taskin has the last laugh. Keeps it just outside the off stump and Mendis chops it on. 

Kusal Mendis b Taskin Ahmed 10 (8b 2x4 0x6)

Kamindu Mendis is in and he gets off the mark with smashing cut shot. FOUR!!

SL 25/1 in 3 overs

JUNE 08, 2024 06:11
SL 13/0 in 2 overs

A slice of luck for Sri Lanka. Shakib into the attack and Nissanka tucks one to mid wicket and sets off for a quick single. A quick throw comes in and it runs away for a four. Quiet over otherwise.

JUNE 08, 2024 06:05
Sri Lankan first innings begins!

On the pads from Sakib and Nissanka whips it away. Just about clears the fence. FOUR!!

Sakib keeps the line tidier for the rest of the over. Just a single from the rest of it. 

SL 5/0 in 1 over

Toss Update!

Bangladesh wins the toss and opts to bowl first against Sri Lanka.

“After last game we don’t have a score in mind. We will see at the end of PowerPlay and take it from there,” says Wanindu Hasaranga

JUNE 08, 2024 05:24
PREVIEW

Sri Lanka-Bangladesh renew rivalry

In Dallas, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will renew their rivalry in a bid to improve their chances to reach the Super 8.

Group D or the ‘Group of Death’ features three full members -- South Africa, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh -- Netherlands, which is capable of pulling off upset wins and Nepal. Margin of victories could play a vital role towards the end of the group stage.

Sri Lanka will have to bounce back from its crushing defeat to South Africa in its opener. Its batters will be expected to show better shot selection and greater match awareness.

The bowlers did well while defending 77 against South Africa and the Islanders would fancy their chances against an out of form Bangladesh side.

Bangladesh has struggled in the shortest format this year. The Tigers have had series losses against Sri Lanka and USA. They were handed a comprehensive defeat by India in their warm up game as well.
