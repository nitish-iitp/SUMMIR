Washout puts Sri Lanka on brink of exit; Nepal hurt by result too but SA confirm Super Eight spot

Sri Lanka now rely on other results, including a washout, for any hope of qualification. Nepal's road gets tougher with South Africa up next

Match abandoned without a ball bowled Sri Lanka vs Nepal

Sri Lanka and Nepal came to Lauderhill searching for their first wins, hoping to put their T20 World Cup 2024 on track. However, incessant rain, heavy enough to trigger flash-flood alerts for local residents, left both teams splitting one point apiece. That means Sri Lanka are almost certainly out of Super Eight contention while Nepal's chances of qualification also take a hit. South Africa, currently Group D toppers, were confirmed a place in the Super Eight.

For Sri Lanka to now qualify, they first need the Bangladesh vs Netherlands fixture on June 13 in Kingstown to be a washout, then they need to defeat Netherlands in their last group game on June 16. They also need South Africa to beat Nepal by a big margin on June 14, and then for Nepal to beat Bangladesh by a small margin on June 16.

Nepal could still qualify if they manage big wins against South Africa and Bangladesh in their last two games, and if Netherlands don't win both their remaining matches.

However, the Lauderhill weather now puts upcoming games at the venue under the scanner. The venue is set to host three Group A games - USA vs Ireland on June 14, Canada vs India on June 15 and Ireland vs Pakistan on June 16 with rain forecast through the week.
