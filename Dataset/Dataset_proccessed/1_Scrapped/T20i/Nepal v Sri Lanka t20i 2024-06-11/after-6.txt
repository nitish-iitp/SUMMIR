Goodbye for now!

Unfortunately, there was no action in Lauderhill today, with both Nepal and Sri Lanka sharing points as the match was abandoned due to rain.

This result certainly opens up some exciting possibilities for Group D, with all the teams eyeing a chance to make it to the Super Eights.

Do join us again in around eight hours’ time, at 10:30 GMT, when we begin our live build-up and coverage of the massive USA vs India match in New York.

Thank you for being with us as we brought you all the updates from Florida.

Until the next time, this is Rohan Sharma and Hafsa Adil signing off on behalf of Al Jazeera.

Sri Lanka’s last chance for a win

For Wanindu Hasaranga’s Sri Lanka, it’s last chance saloon on June 17, when they come face-to-face with the Dutch in Saint Lucia.

It’s been a disappointing campaign for the 2014 champions on several fronts, and Hasaranga’s side will look to finish it off with a win and possibly make the most of that outside chance of a Super Eight slot.

Nepal’s last two games

Rohit Paudel’s side will have a chance, with former captain Sandeep Lamichhane back in the side, to deliver that first win when they meet South Africa in Kingstown, Saint Vincent in three days’ time.

Their last group match will be against Bangladesh at the same venue on June 16.

‘We want to make them [fans] happy’

Nepal’s captain Rohit Paudel, too, was full of praise for the fans back home and in the US.

“It’s a privilege, especially because in an [ICC] associate country, you don’t get a big crowd,” Paudel said on Monday.

“And the way they [fans] have been supporting us, not only in Nepal, but outside of our country, is a privilege for us, and so we want to play our best cricket and make them proud and happy.”

Paudel and his men were on the ground during the rain delay and after the game was abandoned to thank their vociferous fans who kept their spirits up in the stands.

‘Once you have passion, you are not far away from glory’

Here’s what Sri Lanka’s bowling coach Aqib Javed had to say about the passion for cricket in Nepal.

“The first time I went to Nepal, I was surprised, taken aback” the former UAE head coach said on Monday. “We went to the stadium and it was packed and there were a few thousand [fans] outside the ground.”

“It’s good to see Nepal coming up and qualifying for the T20 World Cup,” the former Pakistan fast bowler said.  “It [Nepal] is a growing nation, cricket is expanding [there] and it’s good to see Nepal in this tournament.”

Javed said Nepal will not be too far off from beating big sides and becoming regulars at ICC World Cups.

“Once you have passion, you are not far away from glory.”

The indomitable Nepalese spirit

Spare a thought for these Nepal fans, who braved the torrential rain to stay inside the stadium until the game was officially called off.

They brought the same colour and passion to their side’s opening game in Dallas and can be expected to follow them to the West Indies, where they will play their last game.

If you’re just joining us

It’s 7:30am in Nepal, 7:15am in Sri Lanka and 9:45pm (01:45 GMT) in Florida, where we’ve had our first washout on the US leg of the T20 World Cup.

It’s bad news for Nepal fans, and even worse for those of you joining us from Sri Lanka. Both teams shared the points and their chances of qualification for the Super Eights took a dent.

Meanwhile, South Africa have qualified for the next round and Bangladesh and the Netherlands have a strong chance to follow them.

USA vs India next

Up next on Al Jazeera: The T20 World Cup’s new boys and co-hosts USA take on powerhouse India, who top Group A. USA are second with two wins.

Pakistan, having secured their first win against Canada, sit in third place in the group with two points. Their superior net run rate relegates Canada to fourth place with two points as well.

Ireland round out the group with zero points after two games.

If India win, they will become the second team after South Africa to qualify for the Super Eights.

If USA lose to Ireland in their final match, and Pakistan beat Ireland in Lauderhill (which is at risk of being rained out), then it will all come down to run rate.

This means that Pakistan must beat Ireland by a significant margin to have any chances of qualifying for the next round.

🚨 ANNOUNCEMENT! 🚨

We are pleased to announce the release of promotionally priced tickets for #TeamUSA’s upcoming clash against India on June 12th! 🏏

Netherlands’s qualification chances

Netherlands, who are currently in third place in Group D, already have two points, courtesy of their win over Nepal.

They almost beat South Africa, too, in their last match, had it not been for an inspired innings from David Miller.

The Dutch will relish their chances against Bangladesh, whom they play on June 13. A win there would put them in a good place to make the Super Eights.

Their final match is against Sri Lanka, who will either already be knocked out of the tournament or will be hunting for a final victory to try and get a chance at the next round.

A tough outing but our fighting spirit was on display. We will 𝗯𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 stronger 💪#Nordek #T20WorldCup #strongertogether pic.twitter.com/0jYBSSTwLN

Nepal’s qualification chances

After losing to the Netherlands in their first match and now just earning a point from today’s washout, Nepal is in dire need of a win.

They sit in fourth place at the moment.

Their next matches are against South Africa on June 14, and Bangladesh on June 16.

They will need at least one win against either side, and hope other results fall in their favour, to have a shot at making the Super Eights along with South Africa.
