UPDATE - We have come back with rather an unfortunate news! THE GAME HAS BEEN CALLED OFF. There was non-stop drizzle going on and even the puddles formed right from the start was not good enough for the officials to wait long enough and rather make an easy decision. That means, both Nepal and Sri Lanka get a point each but the overall picture for them looks dimming as their chances to qualiify for the next round fades away. However, this also means that South Africa becomes the first team to qualify for the Super Eights. That is all from this game. You can join us for the match between Australia and Namibia which have already kicked-off. So, switch the tabs and join us there. Cheers!

!

UPDATE - 5.37 am IST (12.07 am GMT) - Well we have more positive news for you! It has stopped raining for quite a while now and the officials have scheduled an inspection in the next 30 minutes. So, the vibes are optimistic and if all goes as per planned, we should get some action today. Stay tuned.

!

UPDATE - 4.44 am IST (11.14 pm GMT, the previous day) - Good news! The rain has stopped completely and the super-soppers are out to do their job. It might take another hour or so for the groundsmen to get the ground ready, barring there is no more rain. Stay tuned.

!

UPDATE - 4.32 am IST (11.02 pm GMT, the previous day) - Well, not the start that we hoped for as it's currently raining in Lauderhill, Florida. It's pelting actually and there are puddles formed in couple of areas on the ground. It will take a lot of time for the groundstaff to get the ground ready but before that, let's hope the rain stops. THE TOSS HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY DELAYED. Stay tuned.

Nepal, on the other hand, have only played one game where they lost to Netherlands. Just like their opponents, it was their batting that let the down. Their skipper, Rohit Paudel, Gulshan Jha, and Kushal Malla holds the key in batting while Karan KC and death over specialist Abinash Bohara will be crucial with the ball. The big news for them is that their best bowler, Sandeep Lamichhane has sorted out his Visa issues and will be available from now on which is huge for them. They have enough quality in their side to challenge the Lankans and who knows, maybe knock them out as well. Stay tuned for toss and team news in a bit.

!

Sri Lanka have been very disappointing so far in this World Cup. They lost to South Africa and then Bangladesh pipped them in a low-scoring thriller. The batters have let them down massively and needs to step up their game massively. Skipper Wanindu Hasaranga will be hoping for a better performance from his team. They have a pretty solid bowling attack and the likes of Matheesha Pathirana, Maheesh Theekshana, and Dushmantha Chameera should be a threat to the Nepal batters.

!

Hello and welcome to our coverage of Match 23 in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024. Sri Lanka are taking on Nepal in a really crucial game. The Lankans desperately need a win to stay alive in the tournament while Nepal will want to cause an upset and increase their chances of qualification to the next round.

... MATCH DAY ...

!

Group D in the T20 World Cup may have been perceived as less competitive on paper, but the matches have shown a different story. South Africa, the favorites to top the group, have managed to secure three wins but have faced challenges in each game. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka has struggled with two losses and zero points alongside Nepal. The Netherlands sits in the middle, with only two points separating Bangladesh in second place and Sri Lanka in fifth. Despite the standings, there is still ample opportunity for teams to secure their positions in the group, making for an exciting competition ahead. Sri Lanka's performance in the T20 World Cup has been inconsistent, with some good and some poor moments. Despite a close match against Bangladesh where they almost secured a win, they suffered losses in both of their matches so far in the tournament. Batting first, they scored 124/9 with Pathum Nissanka scoring 47 runs from 28 balls. However, they fell short in defending the total, missing out on a victory by just two wickets despite early breakthroughs against Bangladesh. Nepal has yet to earn any points in the T20 World Cup but have only lost one match. They will face Sri Lanka next and may be in a stronger position as they need more contributions from their top and middle order, especially after captain Rohit Paudel being the only player to score above 11 runs in the last match. In terms of bowling, only a few players managed to take wickets in the defeat against the Netherlands. Nepal will need improved performances from all players if they need to make a strong statement in this T20 World Cup.
