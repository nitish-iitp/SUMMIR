MI vs KKR Dream11 Prediction Today Match: Players to Avoid? 

Tim David, Mohammad Nabi, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, and Ramandeep Singh when selecting your fantasy team.

MI vs KKR Dream11 Team Must Have Player?

Top Batter –  Rohit Sharma, Philip Salt, Sunil Narine

Top Bowler –   Jasprit Bumrah,  Gerald Coetzee, Vaibhav Arora

MI vs KKR Dream11 Fantasy Cricket Expert Tips: 

Rohit Sharma, Tilak Varma, and Suryakumar Yadav are the key batters for Mumbai Indians. Rohit has scored only one century this season at Wankhede, Tilak has been the most consistent with three fifties, and Surya is a match-winner.

Bumrah and Coetzee are in great form, and MI needs them against KKR. Tushara’s slingy action could pose a challenge, as many KKR batters haven’t faced him before. 

Narine, Salt, and Russell have been excellent for KKR, scoring over 350 runs this season. Harshit Rana and V Arora have also been very impressive.

Having a maximum number of Mumbai Indians Batters and bowlers on your fantasy team is good, as this will help you score more fantasy points. 

If you consider Rohit Sharma a captain or vice-captain in your fantasy team, he will be the X-factor. That will be the game-changer move.

MI vs KKR Match Prediction MI vs KKR Who Will Win Today’s Match ??

“Backing KKR to win. Aggressive cricket on flat tracks, while MI players are out of form and lacking confidence. KKR seems a better bet.”

Final Verdict: Kolkata Knight Riders will beat the Mumbai Indians.
