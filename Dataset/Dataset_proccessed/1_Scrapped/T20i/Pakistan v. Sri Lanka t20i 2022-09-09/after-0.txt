SL vs PAK Highlights: Sri Lankan batsmen Wanindu Hasaranga de Silva, third left, and Pathum Nissanka leave the field&nbsp;

Sri Lanka vs Pakistan Highlights, Asia Cup 2022: Wanindu Hasaranga led the bowling effort with a three-wicket haul before Pathum Nissanka notched up an unbeaten fifty as Sri Lanka beat Pakistan by 5 wickets in the final Super 4 contest of the Asia Cup 2022 in Dubai. Sri Lanka slipped to 29-3 in their chase before Nissanka (55 not out) and Bhanuka Rajapaksa put on a key stand of 51 as the island nation achieved their target with three overs to spare. Rajapaksa fell after his 19-ball knock but Nissanka stood firm and Hasaranga hit the winning runs. Earlier, Hasaranga returned with 3/21 including two in successive balls in his last over as the Sri Lankan spin troika accounted for 5/60 in 12 overs. Maheesh Theekshana (2/21) and Dhananjaya de Silva (1/18) were at their tidy best restricting Pakistan to a below-par total after Dasun Shanaka opted to field. Mohammad Nawaz's 26 off 18 stood out in what was an ordinary batting effort from Pakistan, as skipper Babar Azam looked under pressure after Mohammad Rizwan (14) and Fakhar Zaman (13) got out cheaply. Pakistan kept losing wickets and Hasaranga finished his spell with two successive wickets to flatten the Pakistan batting, which survived only 19.1 overs despite a late cameo by Mohammad Nawaz.

SL vs PAK Live Score: Hasaranga delighted over his comeback

"I'm really happy because last few games I've given up some runs, but today I've made a comeback strongly with wickets. First two overs, I just tried to bowl dot balls and build the pressure. I always look to come onto the pitch positively and give my best," says Wanindu Hasaranga, who picks up Player of the Match for his three-fer.

SL vs PAK Live Updates: Dasun Shanaka on his team's effort

"Always acceptable these kind of results. The combination we have with the left-arm fast bowlers, the leg spinners - the variation we have is amazing. I think the extras were a concern in this game, and the lines the fast bowlers bowled. These are areas we can improve, if we could get early wickets in the next game that will be good," says birthday boy and SL skipper Shanaka.

SL vs PAK Live: Babar Azam impressed by his bowlers

"We played well in both games, but the batting has not been up to the mark. But surely impressed with our fast bowlers, Pakistan has always produced good pacers - the way Hasan made a comeback today was good. This was definately a good learning experience, we will sit back and analyze this game, and see where we can improve for Sunday," says Pakistan captain Babar Azam.

SL vs PAK Live Score: Nissanka on his fifty

"Because of the three all early wickets it gave me the allowance to play my natural game and see the team over the line. Although there was extra pace from the Pakistan bowlers, I backed my skill and knew what to do. This win will help us to gain momentum and we are looking forward to doing well in the final as well," says Pathum Nissanka.
