Sri Lanka and Pakistan are set to face each other twice in as many days as they play out the final match of the Super 4 round, a dead rubber, before battling it out for Asia’s Supremacy. Both teams will lock horns in Match 6 of this stage on Friday, September 09, 2022, at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai. The ultimate and the mega final takes place on a Super Sunday at the same venue.

Five times Asia Cup winners Sri Lanka and Pakistan, who have won the tournament twice in their history, have similar results in the ongoing tournament. Both lost their respective opening fixtures and then bounced back brilliantly to register three successive victories. The Men in Green and the Lankan Lions will clash in this final dress rehearsal and would also look to give chance to some of their benched players.

 SL vs PAK Head-to-Head in T20Is:

Sri Lanka and Pakistan have faced each other in 21 T20Is so far with Sri Lanka winning eight encounters and Pakistan 13. Speaking of their meetings in Asia Cups (ODI & T20), both have met in 15 matches so far with the Lankan Lions winning ten times and Pakistan five.
