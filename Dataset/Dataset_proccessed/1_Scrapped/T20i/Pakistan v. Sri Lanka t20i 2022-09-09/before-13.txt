WATCH: Pakistan & Afghanistan Fans Clash Against Each Other After Asia Cup 2022 Super 4 Match

Date – Friday, September 09, 2022
Time – 07:30 PM IST
Venue – Dubai International Cricket Stadium

PAK vs SL Match Preview:

Pakistan registered two victories in their first two matches of the Super 4 stage, against India and then a nail-biter against Afghanistan. Babar Azam was yet again ineffective as he was dismissed for a duck against Afghanistan. Mohammad Rizwan, the highest run scorer in the tournament till now has been in good form, and together with Shadab Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed, Khushdil Shah & Asif Ali, Pakistan are looking formidable enough to take on the Lankan side. 

Spinner Mohammad Nawaz is currently the highest wicket-taker in Asia Cup 2022 with 8 wickets to his name in 4 matches. Pakistan vice-captain Shadab Khan has picked up 7 wickets in the tournament while Haris Rauf was deadly economical with the ball in the match against Afghanistan. 

The Lankan team has displayed what can be called a perfect team performance. While chasing a 170+ target against Afghanistan, none of the batters crossed the 40-run mark and yet all the 30s combined to take Sri Lanka to a win in their first Super 4 match, followed by a 6-wicket win against India. Kusal Mendis has been the highest run scorer for Sri Lanka in Asia Cup 2022 and the second highest run scorer overall with 155 runs in 4 matches. 

The bowlers have also impressed as a unit and despite only one bowler in the top 10 wicket-takers in Asia Cup 2022 so far (Dilash Madushanka - 8th with 6 wickets), the Sri Lankan team has reached the finals and would be looking to give Pakistan a tough fight in both the remaining matches.
