In Short
Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan by 5 wickets on Friday
Shanaka confident of his bowling attack for Sunday's final
Wanindu Hasaranga shone with the ball vs Pakistan

Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka talked up their bowling attack after completing a comfortable 5-wicket win over Pakistan in their final Super 4 match of Asia Cup 2022 on Friday, September 9. Sri Lanka bowled out Pakistan for just 121 runs in the dress rehearsal for Sunday's much-anticipated final in Dubai as the spinners and pacers proved too hot to handle for Babar Azam's men.

Sri Lanka began their Asia Cup 2022 campaign with a crushing loss to Afghanistan but they haven't looked back since completing a stunning win over Bangladesh in a must-win group-stage match. Sri Lanka ended the Super 4 stage with 3 wins in as many matches, handing out losses to Afghanistan, India and Pakistan.

Sri Lanka were not considered as favourites when they headed to Asia Cup on the back of a poor run in T20is but they have laid down a marker. Dasun Shanaka's men, under Chris Silverwood's coaching, have come out as a rejuvenated unit, finding new heroes in every match.

On Friday, it was Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana who broke the back of the Pakistan batting unit with 5 wickets between them. Wanindu got the big wicket of Babar Azam after which he removed Asif Ali and Ifthikar Ahmed in successive deliveries.

Left-arm pacer Dilshan Madushanka has been impressive as well with wickets in key games, including the big scalp of Virat Kohli in their Super 4 match on Tuesday.

"Bowling combination, starting with left-arm fast bowler, off-spinner, leg-spinner, variation from the spinners, any kind of batting line up will be challenged," Shanaka said.

The Sri Lanka captain said picking up wickets with the new ball will be crucial to their chances on Sunday. Pakistan will be hoping their star batters Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam fire in the final.

"Lines of fast bowlers in the early stages of the game. If we can get a couple of wickets early in the final it will be good for us," he added.

HASRANGA DELIGHTED WITH COMEBACK

Meanwhile, Wanindu Hasaranga, who was named the Player of the Match against Sri Lanka, said he was elated to find form before the big final on Sunday.

Hasaranga, Sri Lanka's star spinner, had picked up 3 wickets and was expensive in the group stage. He went wicketless in the Super 4 matches against Afghanistan and India but on Friday, he was back to his best, bamboozling the Pakistan batters.

"That's how I try to play when I enter the match. I am really happy because last few games I went for some runs. Have come back strong with some good quality wickets, so happy. I tried bowling dot balls in first few overs, that's why the three wickets came," Hasaranga said.
