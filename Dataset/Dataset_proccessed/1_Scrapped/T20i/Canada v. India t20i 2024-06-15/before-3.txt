Ex-India player Bluntly Hits Back At Critics Of Virat Kohli The Opener With 'Practically Impossible' Remark
Virat Kohli's three consecutive failures with the bat in the ongoing T20 World Cup has sparked a debate on his batting position. Though Rohit Sharma's Team India have qualified for the Super 8 round, they still have few questions to answer

Virat Kohli reacts after getting dismissed on duck against USA

Rohit Sharma-led Team India have been absolutely clinical so far in the ongoing T20 World Cup and have already qualified for the Super 8 stage. India have performed like a strong unit so far and have ticked almost all the boxes in the three games that they have played so far. The only concerning thing right now is about their opening combination. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are not only the stalwarts of Indian cricket but of world cricket too. Much to India's dismay, this opening combination hasn't quite reaped results for Team India.
Post India's group stage game against USA, there have been debates and discussions around Virat Kohli opening the batting for India and how comfortable he is against the new moving ball. The conditions in New York have extremely been difficult for batters of all the participating teams and Virat has experienced the challenges. Unlike of his stature and reputation, Kohli has managed to score only 5 runs from 3 group stage games. With Yashasvi Jaiswal in India's squad, fans and experts all around the globe have been discussing his chances of making it into India's XI. Former India cricketer Wasim Jaffer too jumped into the bandwagon and has now expressed what he feels about Virat Kohli.
Jaffer, while speaking on his YouTube channel said:
Virat Kohli should continue to open in this T20 World Cup in my opinion. The manner in which Rishabh Pant has batted at number 3 for India shows that he is in a great form. Going into the Super 8s, India might not want to change things around this combination. You are always tempted by the idea to get a left hand-right hand combo at the top of the order and going by this logic Jaiswal might make the cut but how things have been as of now, it seems practically impossible. I still think that Virat should open and Pant should continue batting at number 3.
India are due to play their last group stage game against Canada at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground, Lauderhill, Florida on June 15, 2024. Post that India play their first Super 8 game against Afghanistan on June 20 at the Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados.
