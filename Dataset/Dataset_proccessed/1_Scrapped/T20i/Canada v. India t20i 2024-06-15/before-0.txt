In short:
The United States will contest the Super Eight stage of the men's T20 World Cup in its tournament debut.The Americans qualified after their match against Ireland was washed out.
What's next?
West Indies, India, Australia, South Africa and Afghanistan have so far advanced to the Super Eight.

The United States men's cricket team has made history by advancing from the preliminary round in its Twenty20 World Cup debut after its last group match against Ireland was washed out.

Rain meant the match at Broward County Stadium in Lauderhill, Florida, was abandoned without a ball bowled, allowing the Americans to progress to the Super Eight stage.

They also automatically qualified for the 2026 Twenty20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.

The US qualified for this T20 World Cup only as a co-host with West Indies, but it has used its home advantage to make a stunning first impression.

While the Americans progressed alongside unbeaten India from Group A, former champion Pakistan and winless Ireland were eliminated from Super Eight contention.

Pakistan won the title in 2009 and reached two more finals, including at the last T20 World Cup in 2022.

With Australia's Josh Hazlewood causing a stir in the lead-up to the match, England thrashes Oman with 101 deliveries remaining to keeps its hopes alive at the men's T20 World Cup.

Pakistan has failed to get out of the group stage for the first time. Ireland was expected to be a threat, having reached the second round on debut in 2009 and repeated that feat in 2022.

The competition point from the washout was enough for the US to advance after beating Canada in Texas and stunning Pakistan on Long Island in the first week of the tournament.

Tying Pakistan in regular overs then beating it in a super over was one of the greatest upsets in men's T20 World Cup history.

The Americans were thumped by India, one of the title favourites, but the hosts' progression without being able to play Ireland was still well deserved.

The umpires made four inspections of the wet outfield before heavy rain arrived.

The match was called off three hours after its scheduled start.

The 17th-ranked US joined West Indies, India, Australia, South Africa and Afghanistan in the Super Eight, with two more teams yet to qualify.

The Super Eight stage is split into two groups, with each team guaranteed three matches to try and reach the semifinals.
