T20 is a very fast-paced and unpredictable format and there is no shying away from this fact. The 17th edition of the recently concluded IPL (Indian Premier League) was pathbreaking in many ways and what grabbed eyeballs was the amount of runs scored in the tournament. The 200 runs landmark became a new norm IPL 2024 but things have drastically changed in the T20 World Cup that is being partially hosted by USA and the West Indies.
The drop-in surface installed at the Nassau County Stadium drew criticism for how inconsistently it played. During the India vs Pakistan game which was played at the same venue, former Pakistan pacer was critical about the pitch that was prepared in Australia and installed in New York.
Wasim Akram said:
I was talking to the groundsmen about the pitch, a drop in pitch takes 12 months to settle, this one in New York was only given 5 months, hence the inconsistency.
Former India Test cricketer and now a broadcaster Aakash Chopra has been critical of the Nassau County Stadium drop-in surface in his own cheeky and quirky way. But his assessment did not sit too welk with an X user who decided to share his opinion on social media. The user wrote 'U want batting paradise? Forget it sir . These are the best pitches where your technique and standard of cricket being test.'
Fans and experts all across the globe have voiced their opinions on the notorious and unpredictable behaviour of the New York surface which left both the batsmen and the bowlers guessing on numerous occasions. There were always speculations about the pitch in the lead up to the World Cup. People also questioned the ICC's intent and their role in the preparation of the tracks. The ongoing T20 World Cup is ICC attempt to promote the game in the states, but the pitch that was installed in New York seems to have played a spoilsport as of now. India play their last Group Stage game against Canada on June 15, 2024 at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground, Lauderhill, Florida.
