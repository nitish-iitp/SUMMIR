Sikandar Raza of Zimbabwe plays a shot.

Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza, one of the most volatile batters in T20 cricket, scripted a new record when he scored a 33-ball century against Gambia in a T20 World Cup Qualifier game on Wednesday, October 23. The Pakistan-born all-rounder is known for his power-hitting as well as timing.

His ability to consistently place the ball into gaps makes him feared worldwide. He is in high demand in the IPL as well and the Punjab Kings are lucky to have him.

Raza's record-shattering knock has made us take a look at all the players who have taken their opponents by storm in T20Is whenever the fancy hit them. Or whenever their country needed them to do so.

We take a look at the top five fastest centuries in men's T20Is by a full-member nation player:

Trending
#1 Sikandar Raza (33 balls)

Zimbabwe skipper Sikandar Raza currently holds the record for scoring the fastest century in T20Is by a player from a full-member country. He achieved this feat in Zimbabwe's run-spree against Gambia in a T20 World Cup Qualifier match in Nairobi, Kenya on Wednesday, October 23.

Zimbabwe batted first to put up a mammoth 343-3 on the board in their quota of 20 overs and Raza top-scored with an unbeaten 133 off just 43 balls (7 boundaries and 15 sixes). He bagged this record since he got to his ton off just 33 deliveries. In response, Gambia were bowled out for a lowly 54 in just 14.4 overs.

#2 David Miller (35 balls)

South Africa's David Miller comes second on this list thanks to the 35-ball century he scored against Bangladesh in Potchefstroom in 2017. SA batted first to pile up the agony on the visitors - they finished with 224-4 in 20 overs with Miller peeling off a 36-ball 101 not out.

The usually sedate Hashim Amla scored a 51-ball 86, giving him company at the crease for some time. The visitors were harassed so badly that Rubel Hossain, Taskin Ahmed and Mohammad Saifuddin all bowled at an economy rate of over 12. Bangladesh, in response, were bowled out for 141 inside 18.3 overs.

#3 Rohit Sharma (35 balls)

India captain Rohit Sharma, who is also the leading run-scorer in this format, finds himself third on this list. His claim to fame is the 35-ball ton he scored against a hapless Sri Lankan bowling attack in Indore in December 2017. India put up a gigantic 260-5 in their quota of 20 overs.

Sharma got going from ball one and was eventually dismissed for an enthralling 43-ball 118. His opening partner KL Rahul also chipped in with a handy 89 off just 49 deliveries.

Despite Kusal Perera's 77, Sri Lanka were bundled out for 172 in 17.2 overs, handing India a massive win by 88 runs.

#4 Johnson Charles (39 balls)

The mercurial Johnson Charles, who hardly knows when to stop once he has got going, is fourth on this list owing to a 39-ball ton he scored against South Africa at the Supersport Park in Centurion in March 2023. In his 48-ball 118, Charles scored 10 boundaries and 11 sixes.

After the Windies had put up 258-5 in their 20 overs, South Africa gave chase and did not quit until the required runs were under their belt. Their pocket-sized dynamo Quinton de Kock laid the platform for the other batters to come with an even 100 off just 44 balls.

Fellow opener Reeza Hendricks' 68 and Aiden Markram and Heinrich Klaasen's last-minute heroics ensured that the Windies had to return to the dressing room in shame. The Proteas made a mockery out of the massive target they were asked to chase inside just 18.5 overs!

#5 Sanju Samson (40 balls)

India wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson is one of the newest entrants into this list thanks to the 40-ball swashbuckling century he scored against Bangladesh in the third T20I of the bilateral series being played between the two teams in Hyderabad on 12 October.

Samson impressed with his shots around the wicket and made sure that the Bangladeshi bowlers were tormented for pitching the ball into poor areas. His 47-ball 111 played a big role in India setting Bangladesh an improbable 298 to chase. In response, the Tigers were restricted to 164-7, handing India a 3-0 whitewash.
