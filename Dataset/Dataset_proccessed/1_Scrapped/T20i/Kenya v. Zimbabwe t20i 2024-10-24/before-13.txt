16th ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Dialogue
23 October 2024

The ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand (AANZ) relationship today faces multiple challenges – from global pressures and uncertainties to geopolitical challenges.

Join us at the 16th AANZ Dialogue focused on bolstering regional resilience; impact of the US elections on the Indo-Pacific; role of social media and geopolitics; demographic challenges of ageing populations and intra/inter-regional migration; and Malaysia’s assumption of the ASEAN chair in 2025, among others.

The two-day roundtable features the ambassadors, academics, analysts and officials discussing some of the pressing issues in the region.
