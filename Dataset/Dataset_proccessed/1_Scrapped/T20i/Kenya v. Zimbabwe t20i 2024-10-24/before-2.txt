IN-W vs NZ-W Win Prediction

India’s women’s team is in good form, and they are playing at home, which gives them an advantage. New Zealand is also strong, but India’s recent performances and key players like Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur could tilt the match in India’s favor. If India performs well in batting and bowling, they have a good chance to win.
