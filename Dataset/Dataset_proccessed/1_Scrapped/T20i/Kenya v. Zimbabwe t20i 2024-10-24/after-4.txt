PREVIEW

The Kenya (KEM) cricket team is all set to face Zimbabwe (ZIM) in the 14th game of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup Africa Sub-Regional Qualifier B, 2024, slated to take place on October 24 at Nairobi. Notably, both sides are currently unbeaten in the group-stage matches and would be looking to continue their winning streak.

The KEN side places themselves at the top spot with four out of four wins. On the flip side, ZIM placed in the second spot with three wins from the three matches they have played so far.

The Zimbabwe cricket team is set to rely on their experienced players like Sikander Raza and their potent pace attack to dominate the game. Their aggressive batting approach and dynamic players make them clear favorites heading to this game. However, Kenya's recent form can pose a big threat to them.

PITCH REPORT

The pitch favors batting, with pace bowlers likely to dominate, accounting for 8 out of the 11 wickets in recent games. Winning the toss and opting to bowl first has been a successful strategy at this venue, but no team bowling first has won recently.
