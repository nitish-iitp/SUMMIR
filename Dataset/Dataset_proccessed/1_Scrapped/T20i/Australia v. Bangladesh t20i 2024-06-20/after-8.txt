Australia vs Bangladesh Commentary
4:50 AM IST Right then, Australia are up and running in the Super 8s. They have given their NRR an early boost, taking them above India at the top of the standings in Group 1. Next up on Friday, June 21, the defending champions, England, will be in action as they take on South Africa at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in Gros Islet, St Lucia. The game will start at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT), but our build-up will begin much sooner. See you then. Cheers!
4:49 AM IST Mitchell Marsh, the Australian skipper says that it was a solid bowling performance and the boys played really well. Adds that they have a settled playing XI and the team has the capacity to go all the way. Ends by sharing that they have an amazing group and all are raring to go.
4:47 AM IST The captain of Bangladesh, Najmul Hossain Shanto says that the wicket was on the slower side but was a good one to bat on. Feels that they should have tried to get at least 170. Adds that they should have tried to take more risks. Shares that he is enjoying the captaincy role and hopes to contribute more with the bat. Tells that the top order getting runs was important in this game and hopes that bowlers can continue the good work in the next game against India.
4:42 AM IST Pat Cummins is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his hat-trick. He finished with figures of 3 for 29 from his 4 overs. He says that he forgot about the hat-trick but Marcus Stoinis came in and reminded him. Adds that getting the set batter out worked in their favour. Shares that the Hat-trick club is good to be a part of and he is really happy to start the Super 8s with a win with a healthy net run rate.
4:39 AM IST Earlier in the game, after electing to bowl first, Mitchell Starc gave Australia an early breakthrough. Litton Das had a real struggle out in the middle, taking 10 balls to open the account. Najmul Hossain Shanto started positively and a good 5th and 6th over meant that Bangladesh had a decent Powerplay. Das couldn't really get out of the rut and the experiment to promote Rishad Hossain did not quite work out for the Asian side. Just as Bangladesh wanted to put their foot on the gas, Shanto's departure pegged them back. Towhid Hridoy fought a lone battle to keep Bangladesh afloat, but Pat Cummins' hat-trick thwarted their hopes for a late flourish. A late contribution from Taskin Ahmed helped Bangladesh get to 140. Pat Cummins became the 7th bowler, but only the 2nd Australian bowler after Brett Lee, to pick up a hat-trick in Men's T20 World Cups. Adam Zampa chipped in with a couple of wickets while Mitchell Starc, Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis took one wicket each.
4:37 AM IST With the bat, Bangladesh could never really hit top gear, resulting in a below-par total. This meant they were on the hunt for early inroads. While Mahedi Hasan bowled a decent opening spell, the pacers struggled with their lines and lengths during the Powerplay. Moreover, David Warner made them pay for dropping him when he was on 5. The rain break came at a crucial time for Bangladesh, as they were under pressure. Upon resumption, Rishad Hossain struck in successive overs, providing his side with a much-needed opening. However, they could not build pressure on the opposition as they failed to squeeze in quiet overs and eventually succumbed to a loss.
