Australia win by 28 runs [DLS method]

That's it folks. There will be no more play. The last shower was heavier and hung around longer than the others this evening. Australia are comfortable winners here, having kept Bangladesh to 140 for 8.

Here's a summary of how the game went down:

Adam Zampa led Australia’s charge through Bangladesh’s middle overs, before Pat Cummins claimed a hat-trick at the death.

Outside of a 58-run second-wicket stand between Litton Das and Najmul Hossain Shanto, Bangladesh were unable to string together any dominant periods with the bat.

The result was them stumbling to 140 for 8 from their 20 overs. Although the North Sound pitch was on the slower side, and assisted the spinners, this was always going to be difficult to defend.

David Warner and Travis Head combined to blast 65 for Australia in the first 6.5 overs, and though Bangladesh’s spinners imposed themselves after that, Australia were always cruising. They were 28 runs ahead when showers interrupted play (there had been squalls blowing through all evening).

Warner rocks it before the rain arrives

Soon after Warner gets to his fifty, though, the heavens open up again and the covers get dragged on.

Australia are WAY ahead of the DLS par score, which is 72. Not surprising. They are cruising to the target at this stage.

Just as we talk Rishad Hossain up, though, he concedes 13 runs in his third over, and the momentum has swung decidedly back towards Australia.

David Warner keeps powering through and gets to another T20 fifty, in his last T20 World Cup.

Total no. of wickets Rishad has got in this World Cup

He is having another excellent outing against Australia, having now also got Mitchell Marsh out in his second over. That wicket takes him to a wicket tally of nine - which among spinners is behind only Zampa's haul of 11 wickets.

Spin exerting some control for Bangladesh?

Runs Australia have scored from 30 balls of spin so far.

Head and Warner had taken a liking to the quicks, but Mahedi Hasan and Rishad Hossain have so far been excellent on a sticky Antigua surface. They need a couple more wickets soon to make a game of it though.

Bangladesh get a breakthrough

Rishad Hossain, who has been so impressive in this World Cup so far, has got rid of the extremely dangerous Head. This was a nicely flighted delivery, pitched on off, but slightly short. Head went back to try to cut it but it spun hard off the surface - much more than the batter expected, and came back to crash into off.

The rain break has done it for Bangladesh.

Rain interrupts Australia's charge

Showers have been been rolling through North Sound this evening, and one that is heavy enough to interrupt play has now come through. The covers are on.

Bangladesh needed something to break Head and Warner's rhythm. Both have looked excellent so far. AUstralia are likely well ahead on DLS, but Bangladesh will be the happier side with a little break.

Travis Head, and David Warner, as expected, have put the pedal to the metal already - they have plundered 36 for no loss from the first four overs. They've each hit a six, and struck four fours between them. The overs so far: First over, bowled by Mahedi Hasan.

Where Bangladesh hit the wall

While we wait for the field to be dried after a shower, it' worth pointing out when exactly Bangladesh's innings slowed.

46
Runs Bangladesh scored off 48 balls, between the 9th and 16th overs, for three wickets

They'd actually been nicely placed at the end of the 8th over, at 57 for 1, with two set batters in. Zampa dismissed Litton Das with a slider that slipped past his sweep shot, though, and then came the big slow. Outside a pair of consecutive sixes from Hridoy off the bowling of Stoinis, there wasn't much for Bangladesh to cheer after that.

The players are out there now. Warner and Head are in the middle.

Bangladesh amble to the finish
Zampa's middle-overs spell slowed Bangladesh's progress•ICC/Getty Images

Outside of a decent platform-laying innings from Najmul Hossain Shanto, and some semblance of a good finish from Towhid Hridoy, Bangladesh didn't have much to write home about in this innings.

Zampa was the star with the ball for Australia, as you'd expect on a slower pitch with a little turn. His 2 for 24 really put the brakes on an innings that wasn't exactly flying in the early overs to begin with.

The quicks, and Glenn Maxwell, kept picking up wickets too, and Cummins finished with a hat-trick. This should be a fairly straightforward chase for Australia, but Bangladesh do have two form bowlers in Mustafizur Rahman and Rishad Hossain.

Hat trick for Pat Cummins!
Cummins became only the second Australian to take a T20I hat trick.•ICC/Getty Images

The first two wickets came at the end of the 18th over - both off hard length deliveries. Mahmudullah first tried to pull Cummins, and ended up playing it back on to his stumps, before Mahedi Hasan ramped Cummins straight to the fielder at deep third.

He then took out the dangerous Towhid Hridoy with a slower ball to start the final over. Hridoy tried to scoop him over the shoulder, but Cummins had outwitted him, and the batter only offered a catch to short fine leg.

Only Brett Lee had previously taken a hat-trick for Australia - that was also against Bangladesh.

Marcus Stoinis had Shakib Al Hasan caught at the start of the over, but back to back sixes from Hridoy - smashing a short ball over deep midwicket, then flicking a full one over deep square leg - put some much-needed momentum into Bangladesh's innings.

He's got Mahmudullah for company. They need many more big blows.

Bangladesh's slowdown
27
Number of runs Bangladesh scored between the ninth and 13th overs (five overs) while losing three wickets

It's been a big slowdown since Litton Das' wicket fell, with Adam Zampa tying down the middle overs nicely. His latest victim is Shanto, who was key, batting on 41.

It's down to Shakib Al Hasan to resurrect this innings now. Nothing short of 150 is likely to test Australia, even on a slightly sticky pitch.

Spinners leash Bangladesh's batting

Playing Zampa on this pitch was always going to be a challenge, but even Glenn Maxwell's got into the act, dismissing Rishad Hossain in the 10th over (Zampa did the catching).

Bangladesh have some batting resources left, but they are going at less than seven an over after 11 overs. They need to get a move on.

Litton and Shanto build for Bangladesh
Shanto produced his best innings of the tournament so far•AFP/Getty Images

It hasn't been easy going - the early overs were genuinely tough. But on what seems like a lowish, slowish pitch not completely different from those Bangladesh encounter at home, Najmul Hossain Shanto and Litton Das have made some headway.

Just as I say that, though, Adam Zampa's dangerous legspin strikes and cuts the partnership short at 58 off 48 balls. Litton Das is bowled for 16, attempting to sweep.

Shanto's highest score in four innings so far this World Cup

One of Bangladesh's concerns in this World Cup so far has been the form of captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, who has skidded through the group stage on three single figure scores and a 14 against South Africa.

Bangladesh did play on some tougher pitches, but would love a decent innings from him to kick off the Super Eights. Right now, he's on 13 off 9 having struck Josh Hazlewood down the ground for a lovely six at the start of the fourth over.

So far, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood are bossing it.

There's a little movement in the air, and some freshness in this pitch, perhaps thanks to the showers that have been blowing through.

Starc didn't need much help from the pitch to remove the leaden-footed Tanzid Hasan with a full delivery though - one that swung through the air a touch, then took the inside edge and cannoned into the stumps.

Hazlewood followed that up with a maiden.

Battle of the leggies

One thing to watch out for in this match are the two legspinners. Adam Zampa's strengths are well known by now. as Mel Farrell recounts here.

But Bangladesh have a legspinner of their own in Rishad Hossain, who's looked pretty good so far this World Cup. He's gone hunting for wickets through the middle overs, and generally got them.

Australia win the toss, but there's rain around

Australia have won the toss, which was delayed by a light shower. Mitch Marsh has decided to bowl first, which Najmul Hossain Shanto would have done too.

But there's a little rain around still, perhaps. This is from Mel Farrell, who is at the ground.

"Uh oh. The ground staff have got one of the covers and are standing half way between the boundary and the pitch. I wonder if they know something's coming and they're just waiting for the toss."

The teams:

Australia 1 David Warner, 2 Travis Head, 3 Mitchell Marsh (capt), 4 Glenn Maxwell, 5 Marcus Stoinis, 6 Tim David, 7 Matthew Wade (wk), 8 Pat Cummins, 9 Mitchell Starc, 10 Adam Zampa, 11 Josh Hazlewood

Bangladesh 1 Tanzid Hasan, 2 Litton Das (wk), 3 Najmul Hossain Shanto (capt), 5 Shakib Al Hasan, 5 Towhid Hridoy, 6 Mahmudullah, 7 Mahedi Hasan, 8 Tanzim Hasan Sakib, 9 Rishad Hossain, 10 Taskin Ahmed, 11 Mustafizur Rahman

Welcome!

Folks, welcome to this Super Eight encounter between Bangladesh and Australia. Aside from some dropped catches against Scotland, Australia had looked very smooth in the group stage. Bangladesh scraped through the tough Group D, but they managed to get through it by winning some big moments.

Andrew McGlashan's preview is here, while we wait for the toss in North Sound.
