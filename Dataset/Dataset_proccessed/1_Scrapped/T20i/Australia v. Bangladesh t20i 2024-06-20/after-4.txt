Watch: Pat Cummins registers first hat-trick of T20 World Cup 2024
Commentary
10:20 (IST) Jun 21

Right then, Australia are up and running in the Super 8s. They have given their NRR an early boost, taking them above India at the top of the standings in Group 1. Next up on Friday, June 21, the defending champions, England, will be in action as they take on South Africa at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in Gros Islet, St Lucia. The game will start at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT), but our build-up will begin much sooner. See you then. Cheers!

10:19 (IST) Jun 21

Mitchell Marsh, the Australian skipper says that it was a solid bowling performance and the boys played really well. Adds that they have a settled playing XI and the team has the capacity to go all the way. Ends by sharing that they have an amazing group and all are raring to go.

10:17 (IST) Jun 21

The captain of Bangladesh, Najmul Hossain Shanto says that the wicket was on the slower side but was a good one to bat on. Feels that they should have tried to get at least 170. Adds that they should have tried to take more risks. Shares that he is enjoying the captaincy role and hopes to contribute more with the bat. Tells that the top order getting runs was important in this game and hopes that bowlers can continue the good work in the next game against India.

10:12 (IST) Jun 21

Pat Cummins is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his hat-trick. He finished with figures of 3 for 29 from his 4 overs. He says that he forgot about the hat-trick but Marcus Stoinis came in and reminded him. Adds that getting the set batter out worked in their favour. Shares that the Hat-trick club is good to be a part of and he is really happy to start the Super 8s with a win with a healthy net run rate.

10:09 (IST) Jun 21

Earlier in the game, after electing to bowl first, Mitchell Starc gave Australia an early breakthrough. Litton Das had a real struggle out in the middle, taking 10 balls to open the account. Najmul Hossain Shanto started positively and a good 5th and 6th over meant that Bangladesh had a decent Powerplay. Das couldn't really get out of the rut and the experiment to promote Rishad Hossain did not quite work out for the Asian side. Just as Bangladesh wanted to put their foot on the gas, Shanto's departure pegged them back. Towhid Hridoy fought a lone battle to keep Bangladesh afloat, but Pat Cummins' hat-trick thwarted their hopes for a late flourish. A late contribution from Taskin Ahmed helped Bangladesh get to 140. Pat Cummins became the 7th bowler, but only the 2nd Australian bowler after Brett Lee, to pick up a hat-trick in Men's T20 World Cups. Adam Zampa chipped in with a couple of wickets while Mitchell Starc, Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis took one wicket each.

10:07 (IST) Jun 21

With the bat, Bangladesh could never really hit top gear, resulting in a below-par total. This meant they were on the hunt for early inroads. While Mahedi Hasan bowled a decent opening spell, the pacers struggled with their lines and lengths during the Powerplay. Moreover, David Warner made them pay for dropping him when he was on 5. The rain break came at a crucial time for Bangladesh, as they were under pressure. Upon resumption, Rishad Hossain struck in successive overs, providing his side with a much-needed opening. However, they could not build pressure on the opposition as they failed to squeeze in quiet overs and eventually succumbed to a loss.

10:05 (IST) Jun 21

Having limited Bangladesh down to 140, it was a job well done for Australia with the ball. While chasing, David Warner got off the blocks quickly and Travis Head followed suit soon after. A strong Powerplay for Australia ensured they had the required rate under control. Despite losing Head and Marsh in quick succession, Warner kept going and Maxwell played his part too to take the wind out of Bangladesh's sails. When the rain arrived again, Australia were well ahead of the DLS par score and no further play was possible, resulting in them securing the two points.

10:02 (IST) Jun 21

That's all, folks! Rain has had the final say! Not the kind of finish any of us wanted to the game but the latest bout of rain was too strong, and the players could not get back on the field. AUSTRALIA WIN BY 28 RUNS (DLS METHOD). Deservingly so, Australia were always in control of the chase and have gotten their Super 8 campaign off to a winning start.

09:44 (IST) Jun 21

UPDATE - 9.44 am IST (4.14 am GMT) - We have started to lose overs now. More covers are brought in as the rain gets heavier at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. The cut-off time for the play to resume is 10.15 am IST (4.45 am GMT).

09:29 (IST) Jun 21

UPDATE - 9.29 am IST (3.59 am GMT) - Oh No! The rain has returned. It's been that kind of day. The covers are back and off go the players. Australia are in a commanding position and are 28 runs ahead of the DLS par score. It's raining heavily now and we might be in for a longer delay.

We are all set for the resumption. The two umpires and players have made their way out to the centre. No overs have been lost, which is a good thing. David Warner and Travis Head are all set to resume their innings. Rishad Hossain is at the top of his mark. Away we go...

08:47 (IST) Jun 21

UPDATE - 8.47 am IST (3.17 am GMT) - Not again! The rain has returned, as have the ground staff with the covers. The entire square has been covered, which wasn't the case earlier when the play was stopped, so the rain seems to be heavier this time around. Stick around for more news.

08:38 (IST) Jun 21

UPDATE - 8.38 am IST (3.08 am GMT) - Oh, no! The heavens have opened up and the umpires have asked the ground staff to bring the covers on. In case you were wondering, the DLS par score at this stage for Australia is 35 and they are well ahead. However, the rain has subsided and the strip has been uncovered. The ground staff are busy mopping up the outfield and we should be back underway soon.

UPDATE - 7.57 am IST (2.27 am GMT) - Good news folks! The rain has eased away and the covers are off. We should resume in a short while from now.

07:46 (IST) Jun 21

Right then, Australia needs 141 for the victory and start their Super 8s campaign on a winning note. How soon can they do it or will Bangladesh spring in a surprise? We shall find out. Join us in a bit for the second essay. Oh No! It has started to drizzle in Antigua and the covers are on. Let's hope this is a passing shower and we can resume quickly. Stay tuned for all the updates!

Adam Zampa is in for a chat. He says that having played here last week, they knew what to expect. Adds that the wicket is slightly different than last time. Shares that the ball is coming out of his hand nicely and he has the full backing from the captain. Says that he is happy to have restricted Bangladesh to 140 and feels that this is definitely a gettable total.

07:44 (IST) Jun 21

For Australia, Pat Cummins and Adam Zampa were the stand-out bowlers with five wickets among them. Starc, Stoinis, and Maxwell chipped in with one apiece. Australia will be the happier side going into the break. They bowled tight lines and kept chipping away with wickets at crucial stages of the game and did not allow Bangladesh to score easy runs. The bowlers have done their job and the onus will now be on their batting unit to chase this down.

07:42 (IST) Jun 21

An outstanding bowling display from Australia has restricted Bangladesh to 140 for 8 in their 20 overs. Having sent into bat first, Bangladesh lost Tanzid Hasan in the first over but their skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto and Litton Das added 58 for the second wicket. Das looked scratchy while Shanto made a sublime 41. Bangladesh kept losing wickets at regular intervals and failed to build partnerships in the middle. Only Towhid Hridoy with 40 off 28 hung around in the middle and stuck some lusty blows to take his side to the 140-run mark.
