Thanks for following the OBO live coverage as Australia beat Bangladesh by 28 runs (DLS method).

We’ll be back again for Australia’s second Super Eight match when they face Afghanistan at 10:30am AEST on Sunday, and when Bangladesh meet India earlier the same day.

For now, catch up on the report from Australia’s win over Bangladesh that was just enough to lift the 2021 champions to top spot in Group 1:

Australia captain Mitch Marsh looks suitably pleased without daring to show a hint of getting carried away. “I thought it was a really solid bowling performance, everyone chipped in,” Marsh said.

But the all-rounder was reluctant to be drawn on whether the starting XI from today would be preferred throughout the rest of the Super Eight stage and beyond. “I think it’s a very good playing XI,” he said. “We’ve spoken throughout the tournament that we think we’ve got 15 guys here that can take us deep in the tournament, and we’ll pick guys based on the conditions.”

Here are the match highlights as Australia beat Bangladesh by 28 runs (DLS method):

Bangladesh skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto laments his side falling 30 runs short of their target with the bat.

“The wicket looks very, very good,” Najmul said. “A bit slow but I think we should have scored at least 170.”

“It was very important today that all the top order got some runs, that is where we struggled in the last couple of matches. I hope the bowlers can continue their good form and we look forward to playing India.”

Pat Cummins is named player of the match after taking just the seventh hat-trick in men’s T20 World Cups.

“I had no idea,” Cummins says with a smile, about whether he knew he was on a hat-trick with the first ball of Bangladesh’s 20th over.

“To end the [19th] over, I saw it come up on the screen, so I thought ‘I’ll make sure I remember’, but I totally forgot about it.”

Cummins says that is his first hat-trick for Australia.

“A few [hat-tricks] in juniors but never for Australia. Ashton Agar and Nathan Ellis both have T20 hat-tricks, both on the bench today but I’ve joined their club.

“It’s pretty awesome to tick that off, the boys are welcoming me into their club, it’s a good club to be part of.”

Australia beat Bangladesh by 28 runs (DLS method)

Australia have been repaid for the fast start that openers David Warner and Travis Head put together in the run chase. That was enough to send Australia down the path to being 28 runs in front of Bangladesh’s comparative DLS score of 72 at the 11.2 over mark.

The 2021 champions start their latest Super Eight campaign with a victory as well as a healthy boost to their net run-rate which lands on 2.47. That nudges Australia ahead of India on a NRR of 2.35 and to the top of Group 1.

The rain has settled in a touch more now in Antigua, and we’ve started to lose overs in the clash between Australia and Bangladesh.

As it stands, Australia are 100-2 from 11.2 overs and 28 runs ahead of Bangladesh’s DLS-adjusted score of 72.

Bangladesh’s emerging spinner Rishad Hossain struck twice between the two rain delays to breathe new life into the contest, although Australia remain in control especially with David Warner undefeated on 53.

Let’s hope we see more action soon, if only because it was just starting to feel like there is much more to play out.

For those that have been with us from the start or are now just catching up – after we all enjoyed the latest rendition of the Bangladesh national anthem, the question came through from Showbizguru on which nation has the longest song.

Showbizguru has been kind enough to do their own research, and now it might be over to fact-checkers to confirm or deny: “So I checked. Because no-one else appears to give a monkeys. But at 2:45 the Bangladesh national anthem is officially the longest in the world.”

Warner reaches half-century

The 37-year-old opener brings up his fifty in style with a six over square leg. Warner has taken 34 balls to notch the milestone for the 29th time in 108 T20I innings, this time with five boundaries and three sixes.

11th over: Australia 93-2 (Warner 46, Maxwell 14): That is a ridiculous reverse sweep from David Warner and it deserved more than just four. The ball pitched well outside leg-stump but the left-hander spun around to knock it away to the boundary. A sublime stroke! Maxwell swats a six over long on then targets the same region again but can only add two more.

10th over: Australia 80-2 (Warner 41, Maxwell 6): Maxwell shows no signs of being a batter in need of runs at this tournament as he punches a drive to the boundary. Warner joins the fun and continues to look comfortable as he sits back on his heels to pull for four. The players are skipping drinks now, after the rain delay less than four overs ago.

9th over: Australia 70-2 (Warner 36, Maxwell 1): Young leg-spinner Rishad Hossain has added a spark to this contest with two wickets in two overs, and now has nine scalps at the tournament even while just learning his craft at the age of 21.

WICKET! Australia 69-2 (Marsh lbw b Rishad 1)

You get one, you get two – another for Rishad as the Australia captain again misses out. Marsh goes down on one knee to sweep but misses at a fuller ball and it thuds into his knee-roll. The umpire is quick to raise the finger but Marsh reviews. Ball-tracking shows it was brushing the outside of leg-stump and umpire’s call has Bangladesh nudging Australia back towards the ropes.

8th over: Australia 66-1 (Warner 34, Marsh 0): Mahedi Hasan bowls out his fourth over and again works away at a good line. Warner picks up the only run with a cut shot, while Mahedi finishes with an impressive 0-22.

7th over: Australia 65-1 (Warner 33, Marsh 0): Rishad gets the much-needed breakthrough, sending Head on his way for 31. The Australia skipper comes to the crease and is due a few runs, but for now closely watches the one delivery he faces.

WICKET! Australia 65-1 (Head b Rishad 31)

The rain delay has disrupted Australia’s flow and Rishad takes full advantage. The leg-spinner gets a ball outside off to grip, Head is undeterred and takes a swipe at it but misses and loses his off-stump.

Play resumes with Australia needing 77 more runs

Warner and Head are back at the crease after a frustrating rain delay that had the covers coming on, off, on and off again.

The 21-year-old leg-spinner Rishad Hossain picks up where he left off with four balls remaining in the over.

There was a glimmer of hope that play would resume soon as the covers were removed, but just as they passed the rope the rain returned and the grounds people were called back into action.

Australia’s one-two punch of Warner and Head have mostly kept pace with each other, the veteran scoring 32 from 18 balls while his opening partner has 31 from 20.

Both Warner and Head have hit three fours and a pair of sixes – here are all four maximums from the duo so far:

The covers are on. Rain has been threatening to interrupt this Super Eight clash since the toss was delayed but had held off appearing during play until now.

Australia are 64-0 after 6.2 overs, and 29 runs ahead of the required 35 under the DLS thanks to an imperious powerplay from Warner and Head.

6th over: Australia 59-0 (Warner 28, Head 30): Australia bring up their 50 without loss as their openers look like making light work of this run case. Mahedi had almost sent down another neat over until the last ball is a horrible half-tracker that Warner treats with disdain as he rocks back and smacks it over mid-wicket for six.

At the end of the powerplay, Australia need 82 more runs with all 10 wickets still in hand.

5th over: Australia 49-0 (Warner 20, Head 29): Mustafizur takes his first turn with the ball but the outcome is much the same. After four balls of the left-armer varying his deliveries, Head sends an over-pitched one straight back over the bowler’s head for a monstrous six. The left-hander gives himself room for the next ball, upper cutting it to take one bounce over the boundary.

4th over: Australia 36-0 (Warner 18, Head 18): Bangladesh bring their main strike bowler Taskin Ahmed into the attack, a smart move in trying to prevent the Australia openers getting too far away from them. The first ball breaks 140 km/h, but Warner has little trouble crunching the next past mid-on to the boundary. Head finds four more through mid-off, sending Taskin to finish the over bowling around the wicket. Head watches the first coming from that angle then refuses to be cramped up, stepping back to pull a thunderous shot over mid-wicket for six.

2nd over: Australia 14-0 (Warner 6, Head 8): WARNER DROPPED! Bangladesh turn to pace with Tanzim Hasan handed the ball. The Australia veteran slices away to point, the ball flying straight to a fielder but it dips late and tumbles out of fingertips. A quick single brings Head on strike and he is straight onto the front foot with back-to-back twos then a punishing drive for four.

1st over: Australia 5-0 (Warner 5, Head 0): Bangladesh follow England’s lead to test Australia early with spin, but as in the group stage it fails to do much more than prevent an onslaught of runs. David Warner picks up a boundary with a tasty reverse sweep after taking all of one ball to get his eye in.

Taskin Ahmed looks keen to take the new ball for Bangladesh as the Australia openers stride out to start the run chase.

The Bangladesh speedster is a personal fave, full of fire and brimstone as he charges in, then launching into a guttural cry in moments of celebration. Let’s hope Taskin can take a wicket or two today, not only to spice up the contest, but also for the photos we can drop in here.

Pat Cummins’ hat-trick might have overshadowed Mitchell Starc’s fast start today, but the left-armer has already proven himself in white-ball tournaments over the years.

Starc now has the most wickets from ODI and T20 World Cups combined.

Bangladesh set Australia 141-run target

Bangladesh finish on 140-8 with unbeated duo Taskin Ahmed on 13 and Tanzim Hasan on four. Pat Cummins started the last over of the innings by wrapping up a hat-trick, then Bangladesh couldn’t find a way to get the star quick away and had to settle for ones and twos.

Cummins finished with 3-29 but it was Adam Zampa (2-24) that picked up the crucial wickets whenever Bangladesh looked like gaining the momentum.

Najmul Hossain Shanto picked the ideal time to make his first real contribution with the bat at this T20 World Cup, the skipper compiling 41 from 26 balls with five fours and a six. Towhid Hridoy added 40 from 28 from the middle-order to ensure Bangladesh set Australia a testing target thought it is one Zampa is confident they can chase down.

Pat Cummins takes just the seventh hat-trick in men’s T20 World Cups and the second for Australia, after Brett Lee also claimed three-in-three against Bangladesh.

Towhid Hridoy played his part with a ramp shot that went over the keeper and straight to Hazlewood to grasp the simple catch.
