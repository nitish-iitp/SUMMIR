Australia has cruised towards a 28-run victory via DLS over Bangladesh in a rain-affected T20 World Cup Super Eights contest at Antigua’s Sir Vivian Richards Stadium on Friday morning AEST.

Pat Cummins became the second Australian to take a hat-trick in a Men’s T20 World Cup match as the Tigers were restricted to 8-140 from their 20 overs in North Sound.

In response, Australia raced towards 2-100 in the 12th over before rain forced a premature end to the match, with veteran opener David Warner finishing unbeaten on 53.

MATCH CENTRE: T20 World Cup, Australia vs Bangladesh scorecard

Leg-spinner Adam Zampa (2-24) and part-timer Glenn Maxwell (1-14) tormented Bangladesh’s top order after Australian captain Mitchell Marsh won the toss and chose to bowl first, with Cummins ripping through the tail at the death.

The New South Welshman, later named player of the match, finished with figures of 3-29 from four overs, joining childhood hero Brett Lee on the illustrious list of cricketers with a T20 World Cup hat-trick.

“I had no idea,” Cummins laughed when asked about the hat-trick during the post-match presentation.

“I totally forgot about it.

“It’s pretty awesome to tick that off.”

Warner, who will retire from international cricket after the tournament, cleared the boundary rope on three occasions to keep Australia ahead of the DLS target throughout the stop-start run chase.

The victory was Australia’s eighth consecutive win in T20Is, putting the team one step closer towards becoming the first nation to unify the three major ICC trophies.

Mitchell Starc snared Australia’s first breakthrough in the opening over of the match, with Bangladesh opener Tanzid Hasan tentatively prodding at a delivery with no footwork and chopping back onto his stumps for a third-ball duck. The dismissal made Starc the leading wicket-taker in World Cup events, bringing his career tally to 95 scalps.

After a cautious start, Tigers captain Najmul Hossain Shanto and opener Litton Das picked up the tempo once the fielding restrictions were lifted, combining for a 58-run partnership for the second wicket.

However, as he’s done so often before, Zampa struck just when the Australians desperately needed a wicket, bowling Das for 16 after the right-hander attempted an ill-judged sweep.

Rishad Hossain was promoted up the order to No. 4, but the gamble backfired when he recklessly charged down the deck and top-edged a wild slog against Maxwell, caught at short third man for 2.

The dangerous Shanto departed in the 13th over after missing a sweep shot against Zampa, trapped LBW for 41, before seamer Marcus Stoinis swallowed a leading edge off his own bowling to remove veteran all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan for 8.

Cummins knocked over Mahmudullah and Mahedi Hasan in consecutive deliveries before starting his following over with another wicket to become the fourth Australian to take a hat-trick in men’s T20Is.

Towhid Hridoy, who was Cummins’ third victim, contributed a handy 40 (28) during the death overs to steer the Tigers towards a defendable total.

Warner was gifted an extra life on 5 early in the run chase, with Hridoy dropping a low chance at point off Tanzim Hasan Sakib’s bowling in the second over. The Australian openers blasted 59 runs during the Powerplay before the dreaded rain arrived in the seventh over, forcing a lengthy delay.

Bangladesh leg-spinner Hossain struck twice after the break, bowling Travis Head through the gate for 31 and trapping Marsh on the pads for 1, with the Australian skipper cruelly denied a reprieve by Umpire’s Call on review.

Warner brought up his 28th T20I half-century in 34 deliveries before another heavy shower swept across the venue. The match was finally called off at 12.30am local time, with Australia declared the victors via the DLS Method.

“I think we play again tomorrow,” Marsh giggled at the post-match presentation.

Australia will next face Afghanistan in a crucial Super Eight contest at Kingstown’s Arnos Vale Ground on Sunday, with the first ball scheduled for 10.30am AEST.
