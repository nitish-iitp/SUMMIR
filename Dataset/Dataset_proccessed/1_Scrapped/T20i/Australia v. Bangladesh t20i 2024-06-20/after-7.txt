Australia vs Bangladesh Highlights, T20 World Cup 2024 Match Today:  Australia defeated Bangladesh in their Super Eight clash of the ongoing T20 World Cup by 28 runs — via the DLS after rain interrupted the game.

Australia were 102/2 after 11.2 overs chasing 141 runs against Bangladesh when the game was held up once again by the rain at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound Antigua on Friday. The par score at this stage was 72, which meant Australia were 28 runs ahead of the par score when the interruption occurred.

The Aussies were flying at the start of their innings, but they lost the wickets of Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh due to the first rain interruption. When the game was stopped at this stage, Australia needed 77 runs from 82 balls with both their openers Travis Head (30 off 19 balls) and David Warner (28 off 17 balls) going great guns. But from being 64/0 at the rain-inflicted break, Australia lost two quick wickets right after the restart.

Earlier, Pat Cummins ended with a hat-trick as the Australian team restricted Bangladesh to 140/8 in their Super 8 match. Just after the 20 overs were done, rain interrupted the game and it remains to be seen when the second innings will resume.

For Bangladesh, only captain Najmul Hossain Shanto (41 runs) and Towhid Hridoy (40) managed to get decent scores on the board.

Earlier, after a brief delay due to rain, Australia won the toss and asked Bangladesh to bat first. The Australians have brought back Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood into the side in place of Agar and Ellis. Bangladesh, meanwhile, have brought in Mahedi Hasan for Jaker Ali.

The 2021 winners and termed as frontrunners for the silverware this year as well, Australia and Bangladesh are playing their first Super-8 game.

Led by Mitchell Marsh, Australia remained unbeaten in the group stage as they went past Oman, England, Namibia and Scotland to top Group B. Bangladesh on the other hand, did lose a game against South Africa in Group D but ended up making it to the second round on the back of three wins – against Sri Lanka, Nepal and Netherlands.

Australia vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Australia captain speaks

Mitchell Marsh says at the post-match presentation ceremony: "It was an exciting bowling performance with everyone chipping in. This is a very good playing XI, we spoke before the start to have the team to take us deep into the tournament and have a team based on the conditions and it's going well. I'm loving it (on captaincy), great team to lead, great group filled with experience, the support staff have been excellent and the families are here as well. Have another game tomorrow and we're looking forward to it."

Australia vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Bangladesh captain speaks

Najmul Shanto says at the post-match presentation ceremony: "The wicket was good, a bit slow, but we should have made at least 170. Playing against this team, we should gamble, today Rishad came at 4 to tackle the spinners, he's a big-hitter but he couldn't execute that. I'm doing alright so far, enjoying playing here and think I can do a bit more. It's very important for the top-order to get runs like we did today, that's a big boost, hopefully the bowlers will continue their form. Looking for a good show against India in our next match."

Australia vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup: Hat-trick hero speaks

Pat Cummins is the Player of the Match. He says: "I had no idea (about the hat-trick). But then saw when it came up on the screen. Set batter in, playing the innings, you never know how it'll go about, so that was a big wicket (on Hridoy's wicket) and happy to have restricted them. I have taken a few hat-tricks in juniors, but never for Australia," grins Cummins. "Agar and Ellis, who are on the bench, have hat-tricks. Today I have joined their club. It's pretty awesome to tick that off. Good club to be part of. Fairly polished performance, the goal was to win and we did well with the run-rate, we'll need to continue with the momentum going ahead in the Super 8s."
