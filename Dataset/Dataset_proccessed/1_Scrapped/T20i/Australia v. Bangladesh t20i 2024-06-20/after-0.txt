A Pat Cummins hat-trick and half-century to David Warner has guided Australia to a 28-run victory via the DLS method over Bangladesh to get the Super 8 section of the T20 World Cup off to a winning start.

Australia reached 2-100 in 11.2 overs in pursuit of Bangladesh's total of 8-140, before rain brought the game to a premature close.

Mitchell Marsh won the toss and elected to bowl at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua and got off to the perfect start when Mitchell Starc struck with the third ball of the match, bowling Tanzid Hasen.

That was Starc's 95th wicket across ODI and T20 World Cup matches, and a new record in men's competition.

Australia's pace bowlers restricted Bangladesh in the power play to just 1-39.

The introduction of Adam Zampa's leg spin broke the partnership of 58-run partnership of Litton Das and captain Najmul Hossain Shanto.

Zampa bowled Das for 16 in the ninth over before Rishad Hossain (2) was dismissed in the 10th after a top edge from the bowling of Glenn Maxwell was caught by Zampa.

Najmul's innings ended on 41 when Zampa took his third wicket, dismissing the right-hander LBW.

Towhid Hridoy (40) was the only other batter to score more than 20 runs for Bangladesh, as he pushed the Tigers to what they hoped would be a defendable total.

However, Bangladesh could only manage 8-140, with Cummins taking his hat-trick with the final two balls of the 18th over the first ball of the 20th.

Rain delayed the start of Australia's innings by about 15 minutes.

David Warner and Travis Head came to the crease and immediately went about chasing the 141 for victory.

The pair were dominant during the power play, and had Australia 0-64 after 7.2 overs before more rain came.

The 25-minute delay was good for Bangladesh who took the wickets of Head (31 off 21) and Mitchell Marsh (1 off 6) off the bowling of Rishad Hossain.

Warner and new batter Glenn Maxwell steadied the ship.

Warner got to 50 and Australia reached 100 when more rain stopped play. Australia was 28 runs ahead of where they needed to be by DLS when they went off.

The rain was too much and the game was ended.

Australia is on top of Group 1 in the Super 8, level on points with India who defeated Afghanistan earlier in the day.

Australia will next face Afghanistan on Sunday at 10:30am AEST.

Look back at how the action unfolded in our live blog.

That is all for the blog today

By Michael Doyle

Sadly, the ending was anti-climactic.

Rain has stopped the Aussie run chase, which they were well in control of.

There was not much anyone could do and the game concluded early.

Australia wins and is now top of their group.

They next play Afghanistan on Sunday at 10:30am AEST.

ABC Sport will be live blogging the game, so I hope you join us then.

Goodbye.

We are starting to lose overs

By Michael Doyle

The rain is falling and we do not think we will get the full number of overs in.

Duckworth-Lewis will be required, whether that is to revise the total Australia is chasing or end the game, we do not know.

If no more cricket is played, Australia will win. They are currently 28 runs ahead of where they need to be.

AND the rain is back.

The covers are being rushed onto the ground.

This is the strongest I have seen the rain so far.

Let's hope it is brief.

11th over — Rishad continues after striking twice

By Michael Doyle

Here comes the man with the hot-hand.

Rishad bowls to David Warner and the first ball is a dot.

FOUR. Another reverse sweep from David Warner. He has hit that out of the middle of the bat. Two bounces before going reaching the boundary.

Rishad tosses the third delivery up to tempt Warner, who just knocks it to the leg-side for a single.

SIX. Glenn Maxwell has crunched a flat six over mid-on. It was not an easy shot. It wasn't a bad ball from Rishad, but Maxwell through the hands at it and dragged it across and over the rope.

Maxwell goes for it again, but does not hit it as well. He gets two runs, after one of the Bangladesh fielders in the deep dived to stop the boundary.

A dot ball ends the over. Australia scored 13 off that one. That will be a pressure release.

Warner works a slow ball of his pad for a single to end the over.

WICKET. MARSH IS OUT LWB

By Michael Doyle

Rishad has struck again.

It looked like a ball which just straightened.

Marsh goes for the sweep and misses. It hits the pad. APPEAL.

OUT.

The finger goes up and the captain has to go.

Marsh does challenge the decision, but it's not going to change.

The hitting of the stumps came back as UMPIRES CALL.

Marsh goes and Rishad strikes again.

What happens if the rain persists

By Michael Doyle

Hi Michael What are the rules if rain persists and play can't continue? Is it a minimum of 5 overs bowled?

- GAPPA

Hello my friend.

Australia is currently well ahead of Duckworth-Lewis.

At this stage of the match they need 35 runs, so they have that well and truly taken care of.

The covers go off, then back on. Australia needs 77 runs from 80 balls

By Michael Doyle

Hi Michael, While we await match to resume, are you allowed to predict match progress? Do you think, Maxwell will get to bat tonite ?? I dont think so. Head-Warner-Marsh are enough for BAN score of 140.

- Mukesh

Looks like the rain has come and gone. And the rain is back.

It is an annoying stoppage, but nothing anyone can do.

Hello Mukesh — thanks for joining me on the ABC Sport live blog.


My predictions are not worth much. I don't win footy tipping with my mates.

However, you are on the money thus far.

Warner and Head have put Australia well in front of this game.

It will take something special from Bangladesh to pull this game out of the fire.
