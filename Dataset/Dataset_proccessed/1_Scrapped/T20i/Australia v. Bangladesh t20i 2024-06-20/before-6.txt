New Zealand vs Papua New Guinea Live Score, T20 World Cup: Where it all started to wrong for NZ

Riding on outstanding spells from Fazalhaq Farooqi (4/17), Rashid Khan (4/17) and Mohammad Nabi (2/16), Afghanistan thrashed New Zealand by 84 runs to register their first-ever win over the Blackcaps. Glenn Phillips (18) and Matt Henry (12) remained the only two Kiwis, who crossed the double figures. If it was Farooqi, who started the mayhem with the new ball, picking up three wickets in the powerplay, then it was Rashid and Nabi, who weaved their magic against a clueless and rusty New Zealand to help Afghanistan register an emphatic triumph.

New Zealand vs Papua New Guinea Live Score, T20 World Cup: How NZ lost to WI

New Zealand reached 100/6 at the end of 17 overs in their run-chase. West Indies were 112/9 at the end of 18 overs. In an ideal world, New Zealand would have been needing somewhere like 25 to 30 off the last 3 overs, a very doable task. But instead, they needed 50 more runs off the last 18 balls.

The reason? Sherfane Rutherford.

In what will go down as one of the best knocks of the tournament, the left-hander displayed immense ability to hold down his end under pressure before going big later. His 39-ball 68 on a night almost everyone struggled to get going with the bat was the big difference as West Indies staged a remarkable fightback from 76/7 to post 149/9. The bowlers then stepped up, led by spinner Gudakesh Motie and pacer Alzarri Joseph to hand New Zealand a 13-run defeat, a result that all but eliminated Black Caps from Super 8 contention.

New Zealand vs Papua New Guinea Live Score, T20 World Cup: Why AUS and IND are in the same Super 8 group? we explain

One of the idiosyncrasies of the ongoing T20 World Cup is that the Super 8 stage is also being held in the round robin format after the initial group stage, which saw 20 teams start in four groups.

But what catches the eye is the fact that India and Australia find themselves bunched in the same group despite both teams topping their groups. Moreover, Australia are carrying a notation of B2 (second seeds from Group B) in in the Super Eight, even though they topped Group B. (READ MORE)
