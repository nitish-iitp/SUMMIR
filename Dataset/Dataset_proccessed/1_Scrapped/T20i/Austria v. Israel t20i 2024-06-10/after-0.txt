They regularly take part in the European Championship, and are currently ranked the 12th best non-Test team in Europe by the International Cricket Council (ICC), having been an associate member of that organisation since 1974.

In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Israel and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 hold the T20I status.

History
Beginnings

As is most often the case, cricket was introduced to Israel by the British. Local enthusiasts managed to keep the game going once the British had left in 1948, but the game was struggling until the mid-1960s, when an influx of Jewish immigrants from cricket playing countries, mainly South Africa, United Kingdom, and the Indian Subcontinent, revived the game.

The first national league was formed in 1966, which led to the formation of the Israel Cricket Association (ICA) in 1968. The league prospered despite conditions ill-suited to cricket. Games were played on dusty, grass-less football fields, on matting wickets. However, the enthusiasm of the players has overcome these drawbacks.

ICC membership

Israel became an associate member of the ICC in 1974, with only Pakistan opposing their membership. Israel competed in the first ICC Trophy in 1979, failing to get past the first round. They also failed to progress beyond the first round in the 1982 and 1986 tournaments.

They reached the plate competition of the ICC Trophy in 1990 and 1994 and in 1996 competed in the first European Championship in Denmark, finishing eighth in the eight team tournament. The 1997 ICC Trophy in Malaysia gave them a brief, though unwanted, moment in the spotlight. Malaysia does not recognise the state of Israel, and they faced political demonstrations throughout the tournament from the Islamic Party of Malaysia. They were the first Israeli sports team to play in the country and finished in 22nd and last place.

In 1998, they finished ninth in the European Championship ahead of only Gibraltar and the following year travelled to Gibraltar to take part in a quadrangular tournament also involving France and Italy, losing to France in the third place play-off.

21st century

Israel have been playing in Division Two of the European Championships since 2000, finishing fifth in 2000, fourth in 2002 and sixth in 2004. In the 2006 tournament, the Israeli team were again met with protests, due to the then ongoing crisis in the Middle East. Their first match, against Jersey was cancelled and their remaining two group games were met by protests. Their play-off games were then moved to RAF Lossiemouth to be played under armed guard. The second of these games, against Greece was forfeited by the Greeks, who had travel problems. Israel thus finished in seventh place.

In November 2007, Israel were defeated in a relegation match against Croatia, in the first international cricket game played in Israel. The loss meant that they were relegated from the 2nd European division, to the 3rd Division. In 2009 they got promoted to Second division with a win over Croatia.

2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup

Israel participated in T20 World Cup qualification for the first time when it took part in qualifiers in the Netherlands for the 2021 T20 World Cup.It was in Group C along with Norway, Guernsey, Sweden, Czech Republic and Gibraltar. Its lone win was a 52 run victory over Gibraltar.

2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup

Israel was to participate in qualifiers in Finland for the 2022 T20 World Cup. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic these were cancelled.

2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup

Given the change in the ICC laws, despite playing matches in previous years, Israel's participation in the qualifiers in Belgium for the 2024 T20 World Cup was recognised as its first official T20 internationals. Israel was in Group 2 of Qualifier C along with Spain, Portugal and Malta. Israel didn't win a game in pool play, losing to Portugal by 47 runs, to Spain by 7 wickets and to Malta by 16 runs. In the 7th place play-off, it defeated Hungary by 12 runs with Gabriel Schachat adjudged man of the match.

These are the details of the match against Portugal, its first-ever official T20 International.
