IND vs IRE Live Score 1st T20I Updates: Superb batting from Deepak Hooda and Hardik Pandya made sure India beat Ireland in the first of the two-match series with 16 balls remaining. India were always in control except when they lost Surya Kumar Yadav and Ishan Kishan off successive balls. But then Pandya and Hooda combined for a fifty-plus run stand took India home with easy. Hooda remained unbeaten at 47.


Harry Tector played an astonishing knock of unbeaten 64 runs to help Ireland post a formidable total in front of India in a rain-curtailed 12 overs a side clash. Tector played some glorious shots against the Indian bowlers who might have underestimated him. Yuzvendra Chahal was the pick of the bowlers for India with his economical figures of 1/11 in 3 overs.

Team India captain Hardik Pandya won the toss and elected to bowl against Ireland in Dublin. Young pace sensation Umran Malik received his debut cap for the opening match of the series. He became the 98th player to represent India in the shortest format of the game. Maverick batter Suryakumar Yadav also returned to the XI after recovering from injury. While Deepak Hooda was picked in the XI ahead of Sanju Samson and Rahul Tripathi in the XI.

Hardik Pandya will lead the Indian team for the first time as the reserve players are ready for the crucial audition ahead of the T20 World Cup. In the absence of several senior stars, Pandya has been appointed Team India captain as VVS Laxman has travelled with the team to guide them as head coach Rahul Dravid is currently in England with the Test side.

The Men in Blue might give debut caps to a couple of players for the opening T20I to test the bench strength. Meanwhile, players like Sanju Samson and Deepak Hooda will look to make their case for the T20 World Cup by showing their talent in this series.

Returning from a wrist injury, Suryakumar Yadav will walk back into the playing eleven and he is likely to bat at number three or four.

Ishan Kishan made a strong case for the reserve opener’s slot with his consistent run against South Africa and he will be looking to build on that success.
