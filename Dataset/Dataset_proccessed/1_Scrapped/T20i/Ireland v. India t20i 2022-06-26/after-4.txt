IND vs IRE, 1st T20I Highlights: Deepak Hooda and captain Hardik Pandya starred with the bat as India defeated Ireland in a rain-hit first T20I at the Malahide Cricket Club in Dublin. Chasing a target of 109, India chased down the total with 16 balls to spare, with Hooda smashing an unbeaten 47, after Hardik was dismissed on 24 (12). Earlier, Harry Tector scored an unbeaten 64 as Ireland managed to post a total of 108 for four in 12 overs against India. Despite losing early wickets, Tector and Lorcan Tucker kept their cool, and took Ireland to a challenging total. The match was earlier reduced to a 12 overs a side affair after rain had interrupted proceedings on several occasions. (SCORECARD)

India Playing XI: Ruturaj Gaikwad, Ishan Kishan, Deepak Hooda, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya(c), Dinesh Karthik(w), Axar Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Avesh Khan, Yuzvendra Chahal, Umran Malik
