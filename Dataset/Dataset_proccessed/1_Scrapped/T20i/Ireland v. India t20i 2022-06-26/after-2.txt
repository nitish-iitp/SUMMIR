COMMENTRY
Right then, that is all we have from this game! India have taken a 1-0 lead and would be looking to finish the series with another convincing performance in the next game. The second and final game will be played on Tuesday, 28th June 2022. It will start at 9 pm IST (3.30 pm GMT) but our build-up will begin a lot earlier. So do join us for that. Till then, goodbye and cheers!
Hardik Pandya, the Indian captain, smiles and says that he is feeling fantastic and it's great to start the series with a win. Adds that as a group it's important to start with a win. Regarding Umran Malik getting to bowl late, Hardik Pandya replies that he has been fantastic for his franchise and he is more comfortable with the old ball and Pandya wanted to give him time to settle his nerves. Further says that maybe, in the next game, Umran Malik will get the full opportunity. On Harry Tector's batting, Pandya says that he played fantastically and some of his shots had him awe-struck and it's good to see a talent like him. Further says that Ireland need to make sure that Tector is looked after well.
Andy Balbirnie, the Irish skipper, says that it's never easy when you come to the ground, do your full warm-up and then it's a delayed start. Admits that it was tough against some high-class Indian pacers in favourable conditions. Feels that they were good and bad but against a team like India, you need to be more good than bad. Praises Harry Tector for his knock and tells that he has been in good form of late.
Yuzvendra Chahal (3-0-11-1) is the Player of the Match! The leggie says that it was difficult to bowl in these conditions but you have to adapt. Adds that Hardik Pandya gave him the liberty to bowl whatever he wanted to bowl. Shares that the atmosphere in the team is pretty chilled out. Smiles and says that he is wearing three sweaters.
Stay tuned for the presentation...
Bhuvneshwar Kumar (3-1-16-1) comes for a quick chat. The pacer says that he enjoyed the surface, especially with the new ball as there was handy movement. Adds that it doesn't matter which format you are playing, if the pitch is offering movement, you need to bowl the Test-match lines and lengths. Mentions that there is an excellent pool of talent in the dressing room and not just India but other countries have also benefitted a lot from the Indian T20 League. He is happy with all the support here in Ireland.
The chase began in style for India as Ishan Kishan smashed Josh Little all over the park in the first over. He looked in ominous touch before Young delivered a two-wicket over, getting rid of Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav off consecutive deliveries. The key was that Craig Young bowled fuller lengths than his other teammates. Deepak Hooda, who was sent to open, in place of Ruturaj Gaikwad, struggled initially but got into his groove eventually. Both Hardik Pandya and Hooda lashed on the one over bowled by the spinner, Andy McBrine and India never looked like in any sort of trouble in this chase. Hardik Pandya departed when the victory was a mere formality and Hooda along with Dinesh Karthik finished things off with ease.
After rain played spoilsport early on, the game was reduced to a 12-overs-a-side affair. The Indian bowlers started off brilliantly with the ball but Harry Tector, with his brilliant knock, took Ireland to a challenging total. Yuzvendra Chahal was superb with the ball along with Bhuvneshwar Kumar who displayed some crafty swing bowling. India though were still the favourites to win this one at the halfway mark.
This one promised to be an entertaining affair, and it certainly was! India though stayed true to their billing and notched up a comfortable win in this first T20I. Ireland had their moments both with the bat and ball, but they need to come out with better execution to get over the line against this second-string yet talented Indian team.
