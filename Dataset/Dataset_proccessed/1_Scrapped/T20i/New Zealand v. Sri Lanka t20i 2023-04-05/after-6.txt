Massive blow for New Zealand with Kane Williamson likely to miss World Cup

The Black Caps are set to be without captain Kane Williamson for this year's ODI World Cup after it was revealed the star batter had suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and was headed for surgery.

Williamson sustained the knee injury in the IPL season-opener on Saturday while on debut for the Gujarat Titans, attempting to take a catch on the boundary.

After laying on the ground in agony, then soon later being carried off the park, he was on Sunday ruled out of the rest of the IPL campaign by his Titans side.

Williamson then arrived back in Auckland on Tuesday, on crutches, and was headed for a scan and to see a specialist.

New Zealand Cricket on Thursday then delivered the news that the whole country had hoped wouldn't be coming.

"Unfortunately for Kane, he has ruptured his ACL in his right knee," Black Caps coach Gary Stead said in a video interview with NZC.

With six months until the start of the World Cup – which runs from October 5 to November 19 – and ACL's typically taking a six-to-nine-month rehabilitation period, Williamson, who is set to undergo surgery in the next three weeks, is unlikely to be fit for selection for the this year's event in India.

In a statement, the 32-year-old sent a message of thanks for the support he had received since the injury, and vowed to still help the team in whatever capacity he could.

"I've received great support over the past few days and want to thank both the Gujarat Titans and New Zealand Cricket for that," he said.

"Naturally it's disappointing to get such an injury, but my focus now is on having the surgery and starting rehab.

"It's going to take some time, but I'll be doing everything I can to get back on the field as soon as possible.

"I look forward to doing what I can to support Gary and the team over the next few months."
