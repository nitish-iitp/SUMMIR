TV channels and Live streaming details

The 16th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) – the most glamorous and financially lucrative T20 cricket tournament – is set to commence today (March 31) with Gujarat Titans (GT) taking on Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the opening game at the iconic Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.

The 10 franchises will compete eagerly for the coveted trophy over the course of the next eight weeks. During the group stage of the cash-rich league, each of the ten franchises will play 14 games – seven at home and seven away – making a total of 70 matches.

Following the group stage, a four-game finals series will take place. The top two teams on the standings will play in a Qualifier, and the winner will advance directly to the final. The defeated team will then compete against the winner of the Eliminator, which will take place between the third and fourth-ranked teams, to determine the second finalist.

Notably, the fans will have a different experience this year as BCCI has sold  television and digital rights separately for the first time, which means two different broadcasters will telecast IPL matches. While Disney Star has acquired the  TV rights, and they will be available to watch on the Star Sports channel, Viacom18 has obtained the digital rights, and as a result, Jio Cinema will be live streaming the IPL matches and that too for free.Watch live sports online
