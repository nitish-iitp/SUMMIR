India vs South Africa, 5th T20I Highlights: The fifth T20I between India and South Africa on Friday was abandoned due to rain at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. The five-match series ends with a 2-2 draw, with both teams sharing the trophy. The rain had earlier interrupted the start of play after stand-in South African skipper Keshav Maharaj had elected to bowl with the Proteas making three changes. India had lost two early wickets and were 28 for two after 3.3 overs before rain came back to play spoil sport. After a series of inspections, the match was eventually called off due to a wet outfield. (SCORECARD)

India: Ruturaj Gaikwad, Ishan Kishan, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant (capt & wk), Hardik Pandya, Dinesh Karthik, Axar Patel, Harshal Patel, Avesh Khan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Yuzvendra Chahal
