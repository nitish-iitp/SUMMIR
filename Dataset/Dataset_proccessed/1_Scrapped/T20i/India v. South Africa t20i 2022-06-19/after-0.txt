India vs South Africa Highlights 5th T20I: Play called off officially and the five-game series ends tied at 2-2. Follow Highlights and Updates of IND vs SA Match Today at M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru.
IND vs SA Highlights: India's captain Rishabh Pant, right, and South Africa's Keshav Maharaj pose with the trophy

India vs South Africa Highlights 5th T20: Just 21 deliveries were bowled in the fifth and final T20I in Bengaluru when rain intervened and forced the encounter to be called off. The five-game T20I series ended tied at 2-2 as umpires called off the match after rain refused to go away for over 90 minutes and players exchanged handshakes. Rain returned to halt play for the second time after India lost both Ishan Kishan (15) and Ruturaj Gaikwad (10) early in the powerplay. Bengaluru weather forecast had shown that there was a 90 per cent chance of rain interruption. Earlier, a heavy shower earlier interrupted the start in Bengaluru after Keshav Maharaj won the toss and elected to bowl in the fifth and final game of the series at M Chinnaswamy Stadium. Maharaj led the visitors in the absence of injured Temba Bauma. Proteas made three changes with Tristan Stubbs, Reeza Hendricks and Kagiso Rabada coming in place of Bavuma, Tabraiz Shamsi and Marco Jansen.

"The way the team showed character from 0-2 down was a huge positive. We are in a nice spot as we are finding different ways to win the game. I can only think about giving my 100 per cent as a player and captain. It is for you guys to decide on how I am doing as a player and captain, I can only focus on giving my 100 per cent," says Rishabh Pant.

"We will be keen to win the Test we are going to play in England and from a personal point of view I am keen to contribute more to the team with the bat."

India vs South Africa Live Updates: ‘Still work in progress for Australia’

"Very disappointed we didn't get a full game for the end of an exciting tour. We tried a few combinations. Still a work in progress for Australia," says SA skipper Keshav Maharaj.

"You may still see changes. I am sure the future series against India will be interesting like this one. We carried our confidence from past tours at the same time we didn't want to take anything for granted."

India vs South Africa Live: Bhuvneshwar Kumar is Player of the Series

"Really proud. Body feels good, but I don't want to talk much about it. Just want to focus on getting stronger physically and with my bowling. Most of the times I bowl two at the top and two at the end. Being a senior, I think about how to help the youngsters," says Bhuvneshwar, who picks up player-of-the-series award.

India vs South Africa 5th T20 Live Score: Rishabh Pant's mediocre run

South Africa won the opening two matches before the hosts bounced back to win the next two games with big margins. While stand-in skipper Rishabh Pant didn't record any big score in the series, he very much remains in the scheme of things for this year's T20 World Cup. Bhuvneshwar, on the other hand, was his old self, mixing his deliveries well. Seemed like he was looking to prove a point!
