India vs South Africa, 5th T20 Highlights: India and South Africa shared the honours in the Twenty20 International series after the deciding fifth and final match in Bengaluru was abandoned due to rain. The touring side won the first two matches before India bounced back to level the series at 2-2 to send the series to an effective final on Sunday. Rain forced the players off the field just as play was set to start at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium and South Africa fast bowler Lungi Ngidi dismissed the hosts’ opening batsmen to reduce India to 28-2 after the restart. But it started pouring again with only 3.3 overs bowled and no more play was possible.

India (Playing XI): Ruturaj Gaikwad, Ishan Kishan, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant(w/c), Hardik Pandya, Dinesh Karthik, Axar Patel, Harshal Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Avesh Khan

South Africa (Playing XI): Quinton de Kock(w), Reeza Hendricks, Rassie van der Dussen, David Miller, Heinrich Klaasen, Tristan Stubbs, Dwaine Pretorius, Kagiso Rabada, Keshav Maharaj(c), Lungi Ngidi, Anrich Nortje

Rishabh Pant's takeaways

There are a lot of positives. The way the team showed character from 0-2 down was a huge positive. We are in a nice spot as we are finding different ways to win the game. I can only think about giving my 100% as a player and captain. It is for you guys to decide on how I am doing as a player and captain, I can only focus on giving my 100% every time I go on the field and keep improving. This is the first time I have lost so many tosses, but it is not in my control. We will be keen to win the Test we are going to play in England and from a personal point of view I am keen to contribute more to the team with the bat.

Keshav Maharaj reflects on series

Very disappointed we didn't get a full game for the end of an exciting tour. We tried a few combinations. Still a work in progress for Australia. You may still see changes. I am sure the future series against India will be interesting like this one. We carried our confidence from past tours at the same time we didn't want to take anything for granted.

19 JUN 2022
Player of the Series: Bhuvneshwar Kumar

Really proud. Body feels good, but I don't want to talk much about it. Just want to focus on getting stronger physically and with my bowling. Most of the times I bowl two at the top and two at the end. Being a senior, I think about how to help the youngsters.

India vs South Africa 5th T20I Live: Series shared 2-2

So we have a series which has been won by neither teams as the decider ended on a rather limp note. The match gets abandoned and the spoils are shared. South Africa keep their record intact of not having lost a limited-overs series on Indian soil since 2011.

? Update ?

Play has heen officially called off.

The umpires reckon they can start the match at 10.02 pm as the rain has receded to a drizzle. "We should be able to play by then once it is playable. We have to wait until it fully stops, can't start with a drizzle," they say.

It's still raining in Bengaluru, although just a light drizzle for now.

India vs South Africa 5th T20I Live: Bhuvi in the limelight

At the Indian Premier League 2022 auction, only four of the ten franchises bid for India’s premier swing bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar. His old franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad, which hadn’t retained him ahead of the auction, was able to buy him back for Rs 4.2 crore, at less than half of his retention price of Rs 8.5 crore in 2018. It was an apt indication of Bhuvneshwar’s falling stock then. (READ Abhishek Purohit's piece)

A closer look at Mithali Raj's career

As we wait for the rain to cease, here's our blog View Review focussing on recently retired Indian women's team captain Mithali Raj.

#MithaliRaj #ViewReview
The dissonance at the end can't jar the marvellous effect @M_Raj03 had on the game in a 23-year career. She leaves us with the highest of elbows, the most mesmeric forward defence, and memories to last a lifetime

India vs South Africa 5th T20I Live: Raining!

The covers are back on the field and probably we will lose out on more overs as the rain shows no signs of slowing down. Good time for the rain to come as far as India are concerned. They can go back to the drawing board and assess what went wrong.

Rahul Dravid on wearing coachâ€™s hat: â€˜Journey has been challenging, saw 6 captains in last 8 monthsâ€™!

Before India battled South Africa in the series-deciding fifth T20 International in Bangalore, India head coach Rahul Dravid admitted that his stint with the senior men’s team has been exciting and challenging at the same time. However, the 49-year-old also pointed out the frequent changes in captaincy across formats and how it has helped create more leaders in the team. (Read More)

Ind vs SA: It's raining!

Just like the players, rain is also out in the middle. It has started raining at the Chinnaswamy stadium and the ground staff quickly get the hessian and the covers. Surely there is going to be a delay but plenty of time is left before we start losing overs. The players walk off as it’s raining forcibly.

Ind vs SA: Captains corner!

Rishabh Pant - The practice isn't working for me (on the toss). Looks like a good wicket, we would like to get anything around 180-190. We just need to focus on the process and put in our 100% into the game. Playing the same team.

Keshav Maharaj - We will bowl first, the overhead conditions, the dew, we can look to exploit the conditions, but it does look like a good wicket to bat on. Tristan Stubbs, Reeza Hendricks and KG Rabada are back, they replace Temba Bavuma, Marco Jansen and Shamsi. We have gone for the extra batter, hopefully, we'll look to utilize it while batting upfront.

Ind vs SA: Pitch report

Deep Dasgupta: This venue has been a nightmare for bowlers but we have seen a lot of fireworks from the batters. One reason is the high altitude of this city. Second reason is the dimension of the ground. 67m side boundaries, the straight boundary is 77m. The pitch today is nice and firm, something the batters enjoy. There are some decent number of cracks where the spinners would land the ball and they are wide. The smaller pieces are wobbly too. So this might help spinners and the pitch seems abrasive to the touch. Yuzi Chahal has got more than 50 wickets in T20 cricket at this venue. It's been overcast for the last 4-5 days, so haven't seen much of dew. Having said that the chasing side has benefited a lot in general here. The toss might be important for this decider.

The stage is set ??#INDvSA #BePartOfIt pic.twitter.com/CuGEdgSGqv

Rishabh Pant hasnâ€™t learned, he has to stop looking to go aerial that far outside the off-stump: Gavaskar!

In a chat with Star Sports, Sunil Gavaskar said, “People expect that he will come along and start hitting the ball for boundaries and sixes. That is something, which because of what he has performed over the last 3-4 years, people have come to expect, and therefore there is that disappointment. But what I think he needs to do, is introspect. (Read More)

India vs South Africa 5th T20, Weather Report: Rain to play spoilsport in Bengaluru!

The series hasn’t been one of India’s best but somehow, just like top teams do, the ‘Men In Blue’ have found their way out to win matches under pressure. A lot of grey areas are yet to be addressed but a young Indian team, with an admirable collective temperament, will start as favourite in the series-deciding fifth T20 International against South Africa in Bengaluru on Sunday. However, also in play will be a few grey clouds.

Ind vs SA: DK's magic!

Karthik was in full flow, the currents lashing furiously like a river in monsoon. There was a swept-six of Dwaine Pretorius, wherein he simply walked outside the off-stump and whacked the ball over deep midwicket. Fast feet, faster hands and even faster brains. The ball was not too full for the slog, but he hyperextended his bat, got under the ball and heaved it over the drops.
