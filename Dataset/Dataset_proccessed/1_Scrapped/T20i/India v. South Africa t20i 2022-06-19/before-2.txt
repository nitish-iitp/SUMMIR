Nick Knight Said The Special Words On The Launch Of A New Documentary

“Playing against India, you felt you were not just playing against eleven players, you were playing against a nation. The support put a little bit of pressure on you as a player and you realize how iconic these games and these series were,” Knight said speaking on the launch of Sony Sports Network’s docu-series ‘Architects in White – India Cricket in England’.

‘Architects in White – India Cricket in England’ features some of cricket’s greatest speakers, including Sunil Gavaskar, David Gower, Nick Knight, Chetan Sharma, Kiran More, and Maninder Singh, among others, and documents Team India’s greatest cricketing triumphs in England. Lawrence Booth (Editor, Wisden), Scyld Berry (Former Editor, Wisden), Sharda Ugra, and Ayaz Memon, among others, are among the famous sports journalists from India and England featuring in the docuseries.

Sunil Gavaskar, a legendary Indian cricketer, noted that in the past, beating England in England was regarded as the most important thing, “For a long time in cricketing history, England v India was a bigger rivalry than any other. We all wanted to beat England in England – that was the main thing.”

India will go to England for a T20I and ODI series, as well as to complete the ‘fifth Test’ match that was postponed due to Covid-19 concerns last year. India is 2-1 up in the five-match series.

From June 16 to June 19, 2022, the four-episode serial will air on the Sony Sports Network in four languages on the SONY TEN 1 (English), SONY TEN 3 (Hindi), and SONY TEN 4 (Tamil & Telugu) channels, as well as on SonyLIV, the company’s on-demand OTT platform.
