Hong Kong made a losing return to international cricket on Wednesday, slumping to a four-wicket defeat by Kuwait in their opening fixture of the T20i Tri-Nations Series in Malaysia.

And Ayush Shukla got the sort of record no fast bowler wants, conceding an eye-watering 56 runs from his 3.5 overs at Selangor Turf Club – the most by a Hong Kong bowler in a T20 international.

To make matters worse for the opening quick, his bowling display, which included two wides and two no balls, came a day after head coach Simon Willis had said his side were finally getting over their fielding woes.

The batsmen also showed up their head coach, with Nizakat Khan (57) and Babar Hayat (41) once again providing the bulk of the runs in an innings where Hong Kong scored 168 for eight in their 20 overs.

Opener Anshy Rath, Aizaz Khan and Yasim Murtaza were all out for 16, while of their teammates only wicketkeeper Zeeshan Ali, who was run out for nine, came close to double figures.
