The Indian cricket team comfortably beat Ireland by eight wickets in their T20 World Cup 2024 opener at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York on Wednesday.

Hardik Pandya was the wrecker-in-chief for India picking up 3/27 in four overs as Ireland were skittled out for 96. Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh chipped in with two wickets each.

India captain Rohit Sharma top-scored in the contest with 52 off 37 balls, hitting three sixes and four fours, before retiring hurt as India comfortably closed out the match with 46 balls to spare. Rishabh Pant remained unbeaten on 36 off 26 balls.

Opting to bowl first, India got off to a great start as Arshdeep Singh sent back both the openers, including Ireland skipper Paul Stirling, in the third over. Soon, Hardik Pandya picked up two wickets in his first two overs as the Ireland cricket team slid to 49/6 at the halfway mark.

A fighting 27-run partnership for the ninth wicket was not enough as Ireland folded up with four overs left. Pandya ended with three wickets as Bumrah had impressive figures of 2/6 in three overs and Arshdeep Singh picked up 2/35.

In response, India started cautiously as they reached 39/1 at the end of the powerplay. Rohit shifted gears hitting two consecutive sixes in the ninth over and brought up his half-century in the next over.

The Indian skipper walked off the field after getting hit on the shoulder and Suryakumar Yadav was dismissed soon after. However, Pant and Shivam Dube ensured there were no further hiccups in the run-chase.

India are up against arch-rivals Pakistan in their next game in the T20 World Cup at the same venue on Sunday.

India vs Ireland T20 World Cup 2024 brief scores: Ireland 96/10 (Gareth Delaney 26, Hardik Pandya 3/27, Jasprit Bumrah 2/6) lost to India 97/2 (Rohit Sharma 52 retired hurt, Rishabh Pant 36*, Mark Adair 1/27, Ben White 1/6) by 8 wickets.
