COMMENTRY
Right then, that is all we have from this one-sided affair as England take a 2-0 lead in the series. New Zealand will have want to save the series in the next encounter now that they have lost the opportunity to win it. The third T20 will take place on Sunday 3rd September as we move to Edgbaston in Birmingham. The first ball will be bowled at 7 pm IST (1.30 pm GMT) but you can join us for the build-up well in advance. Until then, goodbye and cheers!
Jos Buttler, the captain of England says that he is very happy with how his team played. He credits Gus Atkinson who on his debut performed exceptionally well and adds that some experience will be useful for him for future tournaments. He feels that having many bowling options is a big plus point. He credits Harry Brook for playing a brilliant knock and appreciates his talent.
Tim Southee, the skipper of New Zealand says that margins can be important in this format. He feels that they started well with the ball but failed to capitalize in the middle stages and says they have got to improve in all three areas. Speaking about Jonny and Harry's partnership, he says that they batted brilliantly. He mentions that the batting unit needs some improvement and they will learn from this game
Jonny Bairstow is the Player of the Match for his unbeaten knock of 86 in 60 deliveries. He says that it was a great team performance. He adds that it is good to be back in form and the swing wasn't easy at the start but this ground suited his batting. He credits Harry Brook for the way he batted and built a partnership with him. He hopes that they will bat more together. He mentions that he gave the strike to the batters who were striking the ball well. He claims that Gus Atkinson's bowling is scary for any opposition due to his pace and this performance will be a great confidence booster for him.
Time for the presentations...
England dominated with the bat as well and a 131-run partnership for the third wicket in just 65 deliveries between Jonny Bairstow and Harry Brook took England close to the 200-run mark. Bairstow remained unbeaten on 86 of 60 deliveries and Harry Brook scored a quickfire 67 in just 3 balls. All the bowlers barring Adam Milne were expensive for New Zealand with Ish Sodhi taking two wickets while Tim Southee and Mitchell Santner chipped in with one wicket each. In this end, their bowling effort was well under par but the batters were unable to make up for the deficiencies of the bowler as the succumbed under the scoreboard pressure.
New Zealand got off to a disastrous start losing their two openers Devon Conway and Finn Allen in consecutive overs off the bowling of Gus Atkinson and Sam Curran. The former claimed his first wicket in international cricket on just his fourth delivery and England were right on top of their opponents. Tim Seifert and Glenn Phillips started the rebuild as the Kiwis ended the Powerplay on 42 for the loss of two wickets. Adil Rashid broke the partnership that was building as he dismissed Phillips after which wickets fell at regular intervals. Mark Chapman played a few lusty blows off the bowling of Liam Livingstone but the spinner had the last laugh. A wicket each from Brydon Carse, Will Jacks and Adil Rashid had New Zealand right on the back foot and Gus Atkinson wrapped up the innings with three wickets in one over to end with the best figures by a debutant for England in T20Is.
Gus Atkinson has made an instant impact in international cricket! A clinical performance by England and they have now taken an unassailable 2-0 lead in this four-match series! They have dominated in all three departments to seal a massive 95-run win and New Zealand will have to go back to the drawing-room if they are to get back into this series and have a chance of sharing the honours. The hosts had the upper hand in this game right from the word go and never took their foot off the pedal as they showed why they are the champions of the shortest formats of cricket.

OUT! TIMBER! Gus Atkinson has cleaned him up! He has recorded the best figures for any Englishman on debut in T20I. He bowls this very full and quick straight on the stumps. Lockie Ferguson swings but is nowhere near the ball. The ball goes crashing into the stumps and New Zealand is bowled out. What an amazing spell from Gus Atkinson.
Lockie Ferguson is the last batter for the Kiwis.

OUT! CAUGHT! Gus Atkinson gets his second wicket and he is having a great debut! He bangs this in short and outside the off pole. Tim Seifert looks to pull this away but gets a top edge high into the air. The ball is dropping down near the centre of the pitch but Jos Buttler has enough time to run from behind the stumps and take a diving catch. New Zealand are now eight wickets down and staring down a barrel of defeat.
Ish Sodhi is the new man in.

OUT! CAUGHT! Adil Rashid strikes and it is a remarkable catch from Moeen Ali at slip! This is flighted full and in line with the stumps. Adam Milne goes for the reverse sweep and hits it straight to the man at slip. Moeen Ali holds onto the ball with quick reflexes. New Zealand are now seven wickets down and are in the danger of being bowled out. Clinical performance by England here!
