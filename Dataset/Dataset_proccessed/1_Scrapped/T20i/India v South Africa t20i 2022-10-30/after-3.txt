Rahul is yet to go past single-digit score in T20 World Cup 2022
KL Rahul's place in the T20I side has been questionedf

KL Rahul's poor run of form continued as the Indian vice-captain struggled to get going against South Africa on a pace-rich Perth pitch on Sunday. Rahul was out for 9 off 14 deliveries as he looked scratchy and extra-cautious throughout his brief stay in the Super 12 match of T20 World Cup 2022.

KL Rahul played out a maiden at the start of the innings after India opted to bat, struggling to put bat to ball to the left-arm pace of Wayne Parnell. Rahul got off the mark after facing 7 dot balls but he hit a six to open the scoring in Kagiso Rabada's first over. Rahul made full use of a length ball and deposited it into the mid-wicket stands.

Just when it looked like Rahul would cut loose, the under-pressure opener was not able to rotote the strike and put pressure on his batting partner and captain Rohit Sharma.

It was in the 5th over that India were pegged back as Lungi Ngidi, who replaced Tabraiz Shamsi in the XI for the match in Perth, got the big wickets of India's captain and the vice-captain. While a sharp bouncer got Rohit, Lungi beat Rahul with pace and bounce as the vice-captain edged one to the slip cordon.

Rahul looked dejected as he was unable to control the bounce. The vice-captain slammed the ground with his bat and kept shaking his head in disappointment as he took the long walk back.

KL Rahul's place in the side has been questioned as the India opener has struggled to make an impact in the powerplay. Rahul has played 27 innings in the powerplay in the last 2 years and averages less than 30 and has a strike rate of less than 120. Rahul's inability to rotate the strike or keep going at a good click has put immense pressure on the rest of the batters.

Rahul has so far failed to go past a single-digit score in the T20 World Cup 2022 campaign. Rahul looked timid in another test of pace against Pakistan in their Super 12 opener. On the other hand, he was out for 9 in India's win over the Netherlands in their second T20 World Cup 2022 game.

The India team management was asked on the eve of the match against South Africa in Perth whether they were thinking of replacing KL Rahul with Rishabh Pant, who has been warming the benches. However, batting coach Vikram Rathour played down such talks, backing the out-of-form vice-captain.

"I do not think that it (2 games) is a good enough sample size anyway. He (Rahul) has been batting really well and also batted well in the practice games. So, we are not changing anything," Rathour had said,

However, the pressure is now growing on the vice-captain who has looked completely out of rhythm in the World Cup campaign in Australia.
