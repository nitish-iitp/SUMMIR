It seems only yesterday that Kohli's form and place were under serious question. Many fans and experts across the globe asked the Indian team management to send Virat back to domestic cricket and try and get some form. Before the Asia Cup, Virat himself opened up on the issue and said that he wasn't feeling like picking his bat up and was faking his aggression on the field. Things changed, and they changed drastically when Virat Kohli played in the Asia Cup.
