New Zealand brush aside Uganda to finally get off the mark in the competition

New Zealand vs Uganda, T20 World Cup 2024, Highlights: New Zealand brush aside Uganda to finally get off the mark in the competition. Who would have thought that a team consistently reaching the semis in all ICC limited-overs Men’s events since 2014 would take three games to secure their first points? With only 41 runs to get, the Kiwis were expected to get there without any blemishes, but it wasn’t to be as Finn Allen’s struggling stay came to an end as he fell on 9. Although it has come late, his opening partner, Devon Conway, seemed to regain his touch and struck a few classy boundaries in the Kiwi chase.

A brutal end to what has otherwise been a memorable maiden World Cup campaign for Uganda. Their maiden World Cup win against Papua New Guinea was the highlight for them, and the experience they would have gained rubbing shoulders with top nations has its weight worth in gold. Considering the calibre they have shown across their debut World Cup outing, the African nation is certainly going to grow from strength to strength from here. Given the fight shown by the batting unit to drag the innings till the 19th over, a similar fight was expected by Uganda with the ball. Cosmas Kyewuta and Juma Miyagi bowled tightly with the new ball and made the Kiwi batters work hard for every run.

NZ v UGA LIVE SCORE, T20 World Cup 2024: NZ need 41 to win

A good toss to win you reckon for New Zealand. Bowling first, Trent Boult and Tim Southee had their tails up as with fresh seam and a lot of swing they troubled the Uganda batters from the word go. Trent Boult, typically in his style, struck twice in the first over. Uganada were 2 for 3 but it got worse for them as Mitchell Santner came into the attack and he too got a lot of purchase off the deck. Santner got one wicket in his first over while Lockie Ferguson too scalped one in his first spell.

The ball keeps does not rise at all and it scoots through to beat the inside edge and raps Miyagi low on the front pad. The dreaded finger goes up again but Juma Miyagi reviews it. There is nothing on UltraEdge and it is three reds on Ball Tracking. Southee on a hat-trick now with Uganda 9 down.
