Afghanistan will take on Uganda in match number five of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 at the Providence Stadium in Guyana on Tuesday, June 4. The Group C clash will begin at 6:00 AM IST and 8:30 PM local time.

Afghanistan would look to build on their brilliant ODI World Cup campaign in India last year. The Asian side defeated England, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Netherlands. They could also have pulled off an upset against Australia had it not been for Glenn Maxwell's sensational double hundred. Eventually, they finished a credible sixth in the points table.

Uganda booked their berth in the 2024 T20 World Cup by stunning Zimbabwe by five wickets in the Africa qualifiers. Afghanistan look way too strong on paper for Uganda, but the latter can take inspiration from Papua New Guinea (PNG), who pushed the West Indies hard at the same venue on Sunday.
