The stands, barring the premium ones, were packed to the rafters for their Group D game against South Africa. Bangladesh fans dominated the crowd at the 34,000-seater Nassau County Cricket Ground, accounting for the second-biggest crowd at the venue after the one for the India vs Pakistan blockbuster on Sunday, June 9. According to journalist Peter Della Penna, close to 25,000 people were at the venue to watch the crunch match.

"Always happy to see the crowd, really appreciate it. And their support is really motivating for us," Tanzim Sakib said. He then raised his microphone, earning another big round of cheers from the crowd.

Tanzim picked 3 wickets in the powerplay, rattling the South African top-order after Aiden Markram won the toss and opted to bat on a used pitch in New York. In the first over, Tanzim got the wicket of Reeza Hendricks for 0. He then returned to get Quinton de Kock for 18 in his second over. It was revenge time for the right-arm pacer as he managed to disturb the woodwork of the left-handed opener after the South Africa star smashed him for a couple of sixes.

Tanzim also got the wicket of Tristan Stubbs for 0 as he finished with figures of 3 for 18. His partner in crime on Monday was Taskin Ahmed, who got the wickets of Aiden Markram and Heinrich Klaasen.

Speaking about his favourite wicket on Monday, "Tanzim said: We saw all matches have been low-scoring in New York. Tried to stick to the basics and that worked. De Kock's wicket was my favourite - he hit me for sixes and I got him which was crucial."

Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller stitched a 79-run stand for the 5th wicket -- a record for South Africa in men's T20 World Cup 2024. Barring that partnership, South Africa struggled to get any sort of momentum into their innings and were restricted to 113 for 6 in their quota of 20 overs.
