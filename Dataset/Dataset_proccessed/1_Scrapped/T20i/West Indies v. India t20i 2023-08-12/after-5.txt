India vs West Indies 4th T20I Highlights:

India vs West Indies 4th T20I Highlights: Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal have blown the West Indies bowlers out of the park by putting up a century-stand as India chase a target of 179. Both players have scored half centuries. They ended up equalling the record for the highest ever T20I opening partnership for India before Gill fell on 77 off 47 balls. The opening partnership ended up producing 165 runs. Jaiswal carried on and finished unbeaten on 84 off 51 as India ended up winning the match by nine wickets. Earlier, Shimron Hetmyer's half century helped the West Indies set up a total of 178/8. West Indies scored 57 runs in the last five overs largely thanks to Hetmyer, who returned to form by scoring  a 39-ball 61.

India vs West Indies 4th T20I Live: India beat the West Indies by 9 wickets

A bye off a wide delivery finished the job for India. A dominant, dominant win for them and they have now levelled the series 2-2. Jaiswal finishes unbeaten on 84 off 51, Varma at the other end on 7 off five. Jaiswal is making some very loud noises at the start of his career in all formats of the game. He was not selected in the ODI series, or else he may as well have got a century in that series as well. Shubman Gill had scored a half-century in the last ODI over the course of what has otherwise been a pretty ordinary tour for him but this innings was by far his best in this lean period. He gives a reminder of what he can do. Considering his best has mostly come in India and the World Cup this year is also going to be held in India, this innings will pretty much do away with any doubts over his credentials to be included in that squad.

Aug 12, 2023 11:21 PM IST
India vs West Indies Live score: India 170/1 in 16 overs

Jaiswal flashes at the last ball of that over and beats shirt third to go to 83 off 48. He has Tilak Varma at the other end.

IND vs WI 4th T20I Live Score: GONE! Gill's epic ends!

A wicket at last for West Indies, Gill edges behind off Romario Shepherd. The partnership ends on 165, which is the joint-highest opening stand of all time for India in T20Is.

Gill c Hope b Shepherd 77 (47), India 165/1 in 15.3 overs

India vs West Indies 4th T20I Live: India 157/0 in 15 overs

Jaiswal on 79 off 47, Gill on 59 off 44. We are starting to enter record territories now. First of all, this is now India's third highest opening partnership in T20Is

Aug 12, 2023 11:03 PM IST
India vs West Indies Live score: FOUR AND SIX! India 151/0

India need 28 to win from 36. Jaiswal is just unstoppable. McCoy goes full outside off, Jaiswal gets a thick edge past the keeper. Then he hammers the last ball over the bowler's head for a six.

Aug 12, 2023 10:59 PM IST
IND vs WI 4th T20I Live Score: SIX! India 138/0 in 13 overs

Jaiswal sends Smith flying off the last ball of that over. That is deposited past cow corner. He moves to 67 off 40, Gill on 63 off 39. India need 41 to win off 42 so chances of either of these batters scoring centuries getting slimmer with every boundary they hit.

India vs West Indies 4th T20I Live: Gill overturns an LBW decision!

Just no respite here for the West Indies. They had gone up after the fourth ball of the 13th from Smith and the umpire raised his finger. Gill reviewed immediately. There was no bat though but the ball is missing leg stump.

Aug 12, 2023 10:53 PM IST
India vs West Indies Live score: SIX! Now Gill has some fun

Gill flicks the first ball of the 13th bowled by Odean Smith over fine leg and sends the ball sailing over the boundary. He moves to 61 off 36, Jaiswal is on 61 off 38. What an innings these two young openers have played thus far.

IND vs WI 4th T20I Live Score: SIX! Jaiswal rampaging

Akeal Hosein had bowled a good spell before this and was looking to close it out but Jaiswal whips out the reverse sweep and sends the ball sailing to the boundary. India are 123/0, need 56 to win from 48. Jaiswal has moved to 61 off 38, Gill is on 55 off 35.

Aug 12, 2023 10:45 PM IST
India vs West Indies Live score: FOUR! 50 for Jaiswal!

It has come in 33 balls. Powell had overstepped and this was a free hit delivery. Jaiswal shuffles all the way across, gets low and scoops it over backward square leg. That is a maiden T20I half century for Jaiswal. A lot of these West Indies players had played in the IPL this year and so they are more than aware just how dangerous Jaiswal can be in this format.
