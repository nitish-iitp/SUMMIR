India vs West Indies 4th T20I Live: Hardik Pandya's thoughts

“We would have batted first as well, I don’t think much will change. I think the boys turned up very well, they were excited and at the same time, they realized that they have to show some more hunger as well. Everyone chipped in, the bowlers did the job and then Tilak and Surya came in and closed the game with the bat. Yeah, same team. Our spinners have that kind of wicket-taking knack, they are aggressive with their intent as well, which I like. For us, we keep things simple, and we don't let the intensity drop.”

India vs West Indies Live score: Pitch report

“Coming to the ground dimensions, behind me, it is a 65 metres hit, the opposite is 67 metres, and down the ground is 70 metres. The pitch looks like an absolute beauty, there isn’t any grass on the surface but it has a nice sheen to it. The average score on this ground is 165. We are in for a high-scoring game,” says Samuel Badree in his pitch report.

IND vs WI 4th T20I Live Score: Rain check

There are chances of rains dampening the afternoon in Lauderhill. It is unclear as of yet as to how much of a hindrance that will be, if at all, to having a full match.

India vs West Indies 4th T20I Live: West Indies's T20I series wins vs India

Out of the nine T20I series that the India have played against the West Indies, the latter have won just twice. Both of those victories happened to be in series in which only one match could be played. The first was a two-match series in Lauderhill in which one was washed out and the other was won the Windies.

India vs West Indies Live score: The paradox of Suryakumar Yadav 

Suryakumar Yadav will certainly go down in history as one of the greatest T20 batters India has ever produced. He is also perhaps the first big example of just his different ODI and T20 formats have become. SKY himself has admitted that his ODI numbers are not good at all but how India will be hoping and wishing he finds himself, especially after seeing what he did to the West Indies attack in the 3rd T20I.

India vs West Indies 4th T20I Live: Mhambrey on Mukesh

India's bowling coach was all praise for Mukesh Kumar, who has made his debut in all three formats in this tour. “Very happy with the way he has progressed; the thought process, the discussion we had with him and his approach towards the game is fabulous. You need someone like him to come here on a tour and play against tough opponents on a different wicket which is never easy. But the way he has gone about it and the character he has shown (makes us) extremely happy. Going forward, since we know he is capable of playing all three formats, we need to be smart with his workload management. He has played a lot of domestic cricket and got quality skills out there,” Mhambrey said on Friday.
