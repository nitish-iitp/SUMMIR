India vs Bangladesh, T20 World Cup 2024 Highlights:

India vs Bangladesh, T20 World Cup 2024 Highlights: India are all but through to the semi-finals as they beat Bangladesh by 50 runs in Antigua. It is a second comprehensive win in the Super 8 for India after they earlier beat Afghanistan by 47 runs. Hardik Pandya's half-century off just 27 balls led an aggressive batting effort from India and they put up a total of 196/5. While Bangladesh got off to a strong start in the chase, they fizzled out after Pandya got the breakthrough in the form of Litton Das....Read More

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Rohit Sharma vs Mustafizur Rahman

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Rohit has been dismissed nine times by left-arm pacers in T20 cricket in 2024, including the three times he has been dismissed in this T20 World Cup. However, Rohit has a good record against Mustafizur Rahman: 122 runs in 72 balls in all T20s at a strike rate of 169.44, while being dismissed three times.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Thunderstorms in the forecast

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: It is not exactly going to be a clear day today in Antigua. With the match slated to begin at 10:30 AM local time, there are chances of thunderstorms between 10 and 11 AM, with the probability of rain being between 46 and 51 per cent. The weather, according to Accuweather, is predicted to improve gradually. Given the forecast, a washout in Antigua can be ruled out, implying a rain-curtailed game. This will hence heavily impact what the team winning the toss will opt for.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Bumrah's extraordinary numbers

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: In the four matches that he has played, Jasprit Bumrah has taken eight wickets and has maintained a ridiculous economy of 3.46. His numbers have read 2/6, 3/14, 0/25 and 3/7.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: The majesty of Jasprit Bumrah

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Jasprit Bumrha had to sit out for nearly 12 months due to a back injury that required surgery followed by four months of rehabilitation. He made his comeback with a bang in August 2023 as India's captain in a T20I series in Ireland. Since then, it hasn't really mattered what format it is that he is playing in, Bumrah has turned heads everywhere. How India didn't win the 2023 World Cup will probably remain an unsolvable mystery but he showed his mastery by being the team's best bowler earlier this year during the five-match Test series against England despite the Indian conditions suiting spinners. Mumbai Indians finished bottom of the table in the 2024 IPL but Bumrah finished with scarcely believable stats of 20 wickets in 13 matches at an economy of 6.48. In this World Cup, he has given away less than 10 runs in two of the four matches that he has played thus far.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Hardik Pandya rediscovers his mojo

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Hardik Pandya had endured an IPL season that was worse than the worst of the seasons endured by those who have ever played in the league. He was a shadow of the batter and bowler that he usually is, his captaincy was called into question as Mumbai Indians finished bottom of the table and his team's fans made it a point to boo him right from the first match of the season to the last. But worries of this poor form spilling over into the T20 World Cup seems to be unfounded.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Shivam Dube's struggles

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Shivam Dube hasn't really hit the races since he got selected to the Indian team for this tournament really. He was phenomenal for Chennai Super Kings for the first half of the 2024 IPL which is what led to him beating Rinku Singh of all people to the finisher's role for this tournament. Since that team was announced by the BCCI though, there was a significant tail-off from the all-rounder for CSK and that seems to have continued with India. In this tournament, Dube has managed scores of 0 not out, 3, 31 not out and 10.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Consecutive SKY bailouts for India

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: India have relied on Suryakumar Yadav to get them out of sticky situations in the last two matches. In their last group game against the USA, Suryakumar came in with India 10/2 in the third over. He was not out on 50 off 49 at the end of the match, steering India to victory with an unbeaten 72-run stand off 65 balls with Shivam Dube.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Can India's openers fire today?

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: It is interesting to note that the only fixed batting positions in this Indian lineup are also the only places from where the team has hardly got any contributions throughout this tournament. Rohit Sharma scored an unbeaten 52 in India's first match of the tournament against Ireland but since then, his scores have read 13, 3 and eight. Virat Kohli finally managed to get to double digits in India's last match against Afghanistan after managing scores of 1, 4 and 0 in the group stage, but how useful his run-a-ball 24 was for India on a pitch that didn't have too many devils, is debatable. Thus far, they have managed to put up stands of 22, 12, 1 and 11. And all this with Yashasvi Jaiswal, who has been impressive in the format since he made his debut last year, on the bench.
