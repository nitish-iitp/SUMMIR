IND vs SA Highlights: Indian bowler Avesh Khan celebrates with teammates after the wicket of South African batsman Dwaine Pretorius

India vs South Africa Highlights 4th T20: Dinesh Karthik hit 55 off 27 deliveries to record his maiden T20I fifty before Avesh Khan picked up a fourfer as India clinched a series-levelling win in Rajkot. Put in to bat first, the hosts reached 169/6 in 20 overs in the fourth T20 International. Chasing 170 for the win, Proteas managed to reach only 87 for nine in 16.5 overs with Temba Bavuma not returning to bat. The sides will next head to Bengaluru for the deciding fifth T20 on Sunday. Earlier, India gathered just 56 runs in the first 10 overs before the Hardik-Karthik stand boosted the scoring rate. While Hardik perished after hitting 46, Karthik went on to score his maiden T20I fifty. He gathered 55 off just 27 deliveries, hitting nine fours and two sixes en route to the fifty mark. SA captain Bavuma won the toss and elected to bowl against unchanged India. South Africa made three changes, replacing Kagiso Rabada, Wayne Parnell and Reeza Hendricks with Marco Jansen, a fit-again Quinton de Kock, and Lungi Ngidi. India, on the other hand, opted for an unchanged side. After outwitting India in the first two games, the Proteas were at the receiving end in the third match and eventually faced a defeat. Led by Rishabh Pant, the hosts made a stellar comeback in the series after being down 2-0 and clinched the 3rd T20I game at Vizag by 48 runs.

India vs South Africa 4th T20 Live: Goodbye!

India vs South Africa 4th T20 Live: Dinesh Karthik on his onslaught

No prizes for guessing who the 'player-of-the-match' is. Dinesh Karthik collects the trophy for his blistering 55 off 27 balls.

"When I went in, Hardik told me to bide time. To execute things well is great. To go and be a local boy in Bengaluru, despite not representing RCB, is a thrill. The series is on the line which is great. Rahul Dravid has focused on what batters and bowlers need to do and not the results, the dressing room is secure and feels fuzzy which is good. That clarity and environment has helped," says Karthik.

India vs South Africa 4th T20 Live Updates: Rishabh Pant on the win

"Really happy with the way Hardik put up a show. DK went for the kill rightaway and that gave us the positivity. As an individual, I can look to improve in certain areas. Looking to take the positives and looking to improve. Let's see what happens in Bangalore. Looking forward to give our 100 per cent," says winning skipper Rishabh Pant.

India vs South Africa 4th T20 Live Score: ‘We need to be bit more proactive’

"Obviously didn't go according to plan in the last few overs, but we felt the pitch got a bit better at the end. It is the lack of adaptability on our side. We need to be a bit more proactive. We stifled ourselves in the powerplay. We didn't get ant partnerships and just exploded," says Keshav Maharaj.

"Their bowlers bowled really well too. DK played really well at the end but we need to have better plans and adapt better. India is a tough place for spinners to bowl with small grounds. There will be a lot of buzz at the ground in Bangalore. Expect it to be a cracker."

India vs South Africa 4th T20 Live: Temba Bavuma misses post-match presentation

India vs South Africa 4th T20 Live Score: ‘Will give our 100 percent’

"We are playing well as a team, fielding well most importantly and bowling well, we back each other and will enjoy the last game. Yes, the winner will take the series and it is going to be a good match, we will give our 100 percent," says Avesh on the final T20I of the series.

IND vs SA Live Score: Avesh Khan on his bowling tactic

While Karthik shone with the willow, Avesh Khan picked up four after blowing hot and cold in the series. "I am feeling really happy. It is my dad's birthday and want to dedicate this performance to him. The plan was to bowl up and attack the stumps, it was a two-paced wicket with the ball bouncing and keeping low, so use the odd bouncer and bowl good lengths," says the pacer.

India vs South Africa 4th T20 Live: Breathtaking innings from Karthik

Pant and Pandya batted steadily as India were 56 at end of 10 overs. But it was Dinesh Karthik's blistering fifty that helped India post a competitive total on the scoreboard. 

Karthik continued the way he played in IPL. The seasoned stumper notched up his maiden T20 international half-century in just 26 balls by hitting a six. On the very next ball though, he was dismissed by Dwaine Pretorius for 55. A night to remember for DK!
