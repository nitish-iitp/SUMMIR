The Emirates Cricket Board has declared Chaya Mughal as the Captain of the side that will play 4 league matches in Group A.

To be played in Malaysia at the Kinrara and UKM-YSD Ovals, the 10-team Championship starts Friday, June 17th, with the semi-finals scheduled on 24th May, followed by the Finals on 25th May 2022.

United Arab Emirates is part of the Pool A and therefore gets to play against Oman, Qatar, Singapore, and hosts, Malaysia.

The table-toppers from both pools i.e A and B secure their place in the Women’s T20 Asia Cup 2022, scheduled later this year.

Dr. Tayeb Kamali, Selection Committee Chairman, Emirates Cricket said; “We fully support ACC’s vision to develop the Women’s game across the Asian region. We are pleased with our player’s consistent performance as they continue to dominate the Women’s game (in Asia) winning the 2021 ICC Women’s T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier, as well as their impressive display at the recently concluded ICC Women’s Under-19 T20 World Cup qualifiers. We wish our team the very best for success in this important phase of the ACC Women’s T20 Championship 2022.”

Robin Singh, Emirates Cricket’s Director of Cricket said; “This is an incredibly exciting time for our Women’s squads. Our coaching and high-performance units have been heavily invested in developing each player, and, under the guidance of Coach Najeeb they continue to display a maturity toward their game that will only bode well for the future of UAE Women’s Cricket.” “We have a number of women who will be staying on after finishing the U19 (T20) World Cup qualifiers and, through the confidence gained by that performance, we strongly believe they will achieve the goal of winning the Pool and the overall Championship title.”
