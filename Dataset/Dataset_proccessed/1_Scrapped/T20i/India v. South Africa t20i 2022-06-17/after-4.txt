IND vs SA Highlights: Indian bowler Avesh Khan celebrates with teammates after the wicket of South African batsman Dwaine Pretorius

India vs South Africa Highlights 4th T20: Dinesh Karthik hit 55 off 27 deliveries to record his maiden T20I fifty before Avesh Khan picked up a fourfer as India clinched a series-levelling win in Rajkot. Put in to bat first, the hosts reached 169/6 in 20 overs in the fourth T20 International. Chasing 170 for the win, Proteas managed to reach only 87 for nine in 16.5 overs with Temba Bavuma not returning to bat. The sides will next head to Bengaluru for the deciding fifth T20 on Sunday. Earlier, India gathered just 56 runs in the first 10 overs before the Hardik-Karthik stand boosted the scoring rate. While Hardik perished after hitting 46, Karthik went on to score his maiden T20I fifty. He gathered 55 off just 27 deliveries, hitting nine fours and two sixes en route to the fifty mark. SA captain Bavuma won the toss and elected to bowl against unchanged India. South Africa made three changes, replacing Kagiso Rabada, Wayne Parnell and Reeza Hendricks with Marco Jansen, a fit-again Quinton de Kock, and Lungi Ngidi. India, on the other hand, opted for an unchanged side. After outwitting India in the first two games, the Proteas were at the receiving end in the third match and eventually faced a defeat. Led by Rishabh Pant, the hosts made a stellar comeback in the series after being down 2-0 and clinched the 3rd T20I game at Vizag by 48 runs.

“I am not sure but he is practising. Good to see he is practising. Probably we will find out tonight or tomorrow morning,” the pacer said in the pre-match press conference.

India vs South Africa Live Updates: Ruturaj Gaikwad's batting show

Ruturaj Gaikwad, who had recorded 23 and 1 in the first two games, started off cautiously before finding his groove in Visakhapatnam. The right-handed batter hit five boundaries against Norje in a 20-run over, helping India get off to a brisk start.

The Maharashtra player stuck to proper textbook strokes despite the change in gears, smashing seven fours and two sixes en route 57. India will hope for Ruturaj to do an encore, especially when the team seeks another must-win game to stay alive in the T20 assignment.
