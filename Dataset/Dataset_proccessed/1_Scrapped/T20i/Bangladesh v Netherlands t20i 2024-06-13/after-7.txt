Bangladesh vs Netherlands Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, BAN vs NED: Bangladesh beat Netherlands by 25 runs

Bangladesh vs Netherlands Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, BAN vs NED: A comprehensive victory for Bangladesh and this makes their path to the Super 8s very easy indeed. After all the low scoring affairs in New York, Group A finally sees a match that featured scores more typical of a T20. Shakib Al Hasan is the player of the match. No surprises there. The Bangladesh all-timer was unbeaten on 64 off 46 and then bowled four overs for 29 runs. He had hobbled off the field with a cramp after bowling his last over but seems to be alright. That's it from us here! Ciao!

Bangladesh vs Netherlands Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024, BAN vs NED: The match has swung dramatically in favour of Bangladesh now. First Engelbrecht and now the dangerous De Leede.

Stunning from the Bangladesh wicketkeeper.
