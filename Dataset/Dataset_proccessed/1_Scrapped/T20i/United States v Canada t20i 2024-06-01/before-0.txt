Jones gets the job done for USA

Fittingly, Jones finishes the chase with a pair of sixes. He smashed ten sixes in all to lead USA's demolition of Canada. Co-hosts USA have announced their arrival with a crushing win over their rivals.

Gous falls but USA on course

Dutta gets Gous for 65 off 46, but USA only need 22 off 26 balls. Anderson, who did his bit with the ball earlier in the day, has joined Jones in the middle.

Gous notches up a half-century of his own and turns a potentially tricky chase for USA into a cruise along with vice-captain Jones.

Jones leads USA's chase with 22-ball fifty
Aaron Jones' innings summed up in a picture•Associated Press

USA's vice-captain has torched this chase.

After attacking spin, he goes after fast bowler Heyliger, who was particularly impressive during the powerplay. He takes a length ball from outside off and dumps it out of the ground for a 103-metre six.

This is what he had to say about his and USA's brand of cricket on the eve of the T20 World Cup opener.

"To be honest I'll say fearless cricket, positive cricket, smart cricket. I think that's what we're really and truly trying to do. We don't want to regret anything. We want to leave everything out there on the park. And then, obviously, if we come out on top, it's great. If we don't come out on top, that's how cricket goes sometimes. But we don't want to regret anything."

Jones is now walking the talk. He has raced to a 22-ball fifty, the fastest recorded for USA in T20Is

Offspinner Nikhil Dutta concedes 19 off his first over. He started with a beamer and never really recovered after that. In the next over, Jones reverse-sweeps Saad Zafar over point for four. With the dew setting in, this is USA's chance to dominate spin and pull ahead in the chase

USA lose Patel and momentum

It appeared like the ball was swinging and seaming more under lights than earlier in the evening. Captain Patel was on 16 off 15 balls. He was desperate to get a move on, but Heyliger hides a full ball away from Patel's swinging arc and finds seam movement to draw an outside edge. His next ball to Jones almost hits the outside edge near the shoulder of the bat. The asking rate has shot past 11 for USA.

Gous gets going
Andries Gous in action for ADKR in the ILT20•ILT20

Andries Gous swats Sana over midwicket and flays Gordon past point for fours. Gous was born in Welkom and played 60 first-class games in SA before moving to USA.

He was the No.1 pick for Washington Freedom in the MLC and was their second-highest scorer in the inaugural season with 142 runs in six innings at a strike rate of just under 130. He has also had exposure outside of USA and SA, featuring in the T10 and ILT20 leagues in the UAE. He had also trained in the New South Wales along with Saurabh Netravalkar under Burt Cockley, the former NSW player and current Washington Freedom S&C coach.

Kaleem Sana traps Taylor for a duck
Steven Taylor didn't trouble the scorers•Peter Della Penna

After starting with an outswinger, which was left alone by Taylor, Sana brings one back into Taylor, catches him in the crease and hits his pads. Taylor calls for a review of the on-field out decision, but he has to go as ball-tracking indicates that it would have crashed into leg stump. Near-perfect start for Canada in their defence of 194.

Canada rack up 194
Shreyas Movva's cameo down the order lifted Canada•Getty Images

Ali Khan had Kirton holing out to Anderson for 51 off 31 balls, but lost his lengths the final over of the innings, conceding 21 runs off it. Anderson was also picked apart in his last over, which cost USA 14. Movva's sparkling cameo of 32 not out off 16 balls powers Canada to 194 for 5.

Sampath Bandarupalli: Canada's 194/5 is now the highest total by an associate team at the men's T20 World Cup, surpassing 193/4 by Netherlands vs Ireland in 2014.

Kirton slams fifty
Nicholas Kirton cuts square through the off side•AFP/Getty Images

He gets to the landmark off only 28 balls. There's a bit of Nicholas Pooran about Nicholas Kirton, especially when he plays the lofted drives. He was born in Barbados and Ian Bishop tells us on commentary that he's highly rated in the Caribbean as well.

He set to work with a six off a high full-toss from Taylor and then dispatched slower, lowish full-toss from van Schalkwyk for six more. He continued to bat in a similar high tempo for Canada.

Anderson has Dhaliwal holing out
Corey Anderson is a double international•ICC/Getty Images

Corey Anderson, the former NZ allrounder, strikes with his first very ball for USA in a World Cup. He rolls out a cutter, which grips in the surface, and messes with Dhaliwal's timing. He had cleared mid-off and long-off earlier in the day, but this time he picks out Jessy Singh at long-off for 61 off 44 balls. The onus is now on Nicholas Kirton to finish the innings strongly for Canada.

Fifty for Dhaliwal
Navneet Dhaliwal hits out•Peter Della Penna

Opening batter Navneet Dhaliwal brings up a 36-ball half-century to keep Canada brisk, despite the quick wickets of Johnson and Pargat. He has latched onto anything remotely wide of off and has also often manufactured swinging room to open up scoring opportunities on the off side.

Dhaliwal celebrates the landmark with back-to-back fours off Harmeet, who finishes with 4-0-27-1.

Harmeet strikes in the powerplay
Harmeet Singh played two Under-19 World Cups for India•ICC/Getty

Remember Harmeet Singh? He played two Under-19 World Cups for India and was even compared to Bishen Singh Bedi. He also played an IPL game for Rajasthan Royals in IPL 2013. He then migrated to the USA and went first overall in the 2023 Major League Cricket domestic player draft.

He fronts up to bowl in the powerplay to the dangerous Johnson, slows it up, and has him toe-ending a catch to mid-off for 23 off 16 balls. Soon after, No.3 Pargat Singh is run out for 5. He is caught short on a double, despite a full-length dive. Canada are 66 for 2 in 8 overs.

Ali Khan leaks 17 runs off his second over. He pinged Aaron Johnson's helmet with a rapid bouncer, which ballooned over the keeper's head for four leg byes, but the batter immediately shook that blow off and picked away Khan for back-to-back fours off the bat. Canada are 40 for 0 in four overs.

Johnson was born in Jamaica and moved to Canada in 2019. He has now launched the biggest World Cup with a flurry of fours.

Spotlight on Ali Khan
Dwayne Bravo and Ali Khan have a chat•Peter Della Penna

Ali Khan was born and raised in Pakistan. He then moved to Ohio with his parents at the age of 18 and settled there. Dwayne Bravo spotted Khan in the 2017 US Open T20 tournament and signed him on for the Winnipeg Hawks in the Global T20 Canada, before recommending him to TKR in the CPL. After winning the CPL with TKR, Khan also broke into the IPL and PSL among other leagues. He has a killer yorker in his repertoire.

Khan's first ball is driven on the up for four by Aaron Johnson but the fast bowler immediately drags his length back and finds seam movement to close out a six-run opening over.

Dallas is ready for the World Cup
Officials check the pitch at Grand Prairie Stadium•AFP/Getty Images

By Cameron Ponsonby

The flag of every nation in the competition has been walked onto the pitch. The sun's out. A smattering of fans in with some USA cowboy hats on show. It isn't full. But it also isn't empty.

The stand right by the big stand tended to be fuller than the rest of the stadium during MLC whereas we seem to have a more even spread today.

The temporary tents that you'll see on the TV, where commentary and press are based, are new. Those weren't there for MLC.

The American dream finally becomes a reality today. USA will be featuring in a Cricket World Cup for the first time and the land of baseball will host a Cricket World Cup for the first time. Canada have been part of the 50-over World Cup in the past, but this will also be their first appearance in a T20 World Cup.

USA vs Canada to kick off the 2024 T20 World Cup in Dallas. It's the biggest World Cup featuring a record 20 teams and bringing the world together.

ICYMI: USA vs Canada (and not England vs Australia) is the oldest rivalry in international cricket. One-hundred-and-eighty years after they faced Canada in New York, they meet them in a World Cup opener. This is how things had panned out in 1844.
