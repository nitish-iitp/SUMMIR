“I have worked with Thais as a project scheduler on several Subsea Field Development projects and she is one of the most energetic people I have worked with. She is always on top of all of her projects and ensures that all details are on-time and within budget. She is an excellent communicator with all her team members and keeps everyone advised of issues as they arise during the progress of the project. She is a delight to work with.”

Hot off the presses! A new paper by Julia Gawlick Emily Beagle and Thomas Hamacher about coupling of the power sector and hydrogen (considering two pathways: SMR and electrolysis) in Texas. A few takeaways: *Joint optimization is necessary to show impacts of a sector-coupled hydrogen economy. *Hydrogen from renewable electricity induces immense infrastructure requirements. *Levelized costs in Texas are cost-competitive with other global producers. *Subsidies for renewable energies are required despite decreases in investment costs. Note: there are other H2 production pathways (pyrolysis, natural hydrogen, etc.) that might yield different results. Another nice collaboration between Webber Energy Group & Technical University of Munich https://lnkd.in/gvCQpceD

EQT Corporation CEO, Toby Z. Rice On AI Power Demand. “…this AI revolution is only going to take place with affordable, reliable clean energy and certainly we have that in spades.” “This market is massive, people are getting their heads wrapped around it right now. What we’re seeing is that AI power demand could be 75 GW. To put that in perspective, that is the equivalent of needing enough power to power an additional 15 x New York Cities. This is a massive opportunity here and when people are looking at who’s going to service this power demand, it’s all about speed and speed to market matters. This is going to be another differentiator for EQT and Natural Gas to take a very large amount of this market share.”. “…we need to ensure we have the ability to get energy infrastructure built in this country, whether it’s a pipeline or electric transmission line, we need to be able to get back to building things in this country…” #naturalgas #pipelines
