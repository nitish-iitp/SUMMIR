Once a proud cricketing nation, Zimbabwe are on the road to redemption. Plagued by mismanagement and a long-term economic crisis, Zimbabwean cricket went into a downward spiral.

Now, they are competing against nondescript teams for a place in the regional final, the final stop before the T20 World Cup 2026 to be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka. They missed the last World Cup after finishing third, behind Namibia and Uganda, in the African qualifiers.

Having learnt the hard lesson, Sikandar Raza & Co. have started their qualifying campaign with utmost care. Big wins, by 76 runs (DLS method) against Seychelles and by nine wickets against Mozambique, have lifted the only Test-playing team to the top of Group B, ahead of hosts Kenya, who are also unbeaten so far.

A big win against Rwanda, and their already superior Net Run Rate (NRR) of +10.892 would become even more incomparable, as against Kenya's +4.397. The top two teams from Group B will progress to the Africa regional final where they will compete against already qualified Namibia and Uganda, and four other teams (two each from Group A and C).

Zimbabwe and Kenya are the obvious favourites to take the two top spots, but Rwanda could be the proverbial party poopers. Led by experienced Clinton Rubagumya, Rwanda tested Kenya in their second match. After posting 100/7, Rubagumya & Co. rocked the Kenyan top order on Sunday, but the target eventually proved to be too small to defend.

Rwanda are third in the table with two points, thanks to a walkover against the Gambia and they have a NRR of -1.733. A shock win against Zimbabwe today would shake up the group.

Zimbabwe Vs Rwanda: Full Squads

Zimbabwe: Sikandar Raza (c), Faraz Akram, Brian Bennett, Ryan Burl, Trevor Gwandu, Clive Madande (wk), Wesley Madhevere, Tinotenda Maposa, Tadiwanashe Marumani, Wellington Masakadza, Brandon Mavuta, Tashinga Musekiwa, Blessing Muzarabani, Dion Myers, Richard Ngarava.
