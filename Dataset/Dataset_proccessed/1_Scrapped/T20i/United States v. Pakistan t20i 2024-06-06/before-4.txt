Lowest Team Total T20 World Cup 2024

Lowest Team Total: The T20 format is not always about high scores and the batters dominating the bowlers, at times it is the other way round. In the T20 World Cup history there have been matches where teams have been bowled out cheaply.




Netherlands have twice registered lowest team totals. In a match in the 2014 T20 World Cup against Sri Lanka in Chattogram, they were skittled out for 39 in 10.3 overs, the lowest ever team score in the tournament history. In the 2021 T20 World Cup in Sharjah, the Netherlands were all out for 44 in 10 overs against the same opposition Sri Lanka.




Third in the list are the West Indies who were bowled out for 55 in 14.2 overs in the 2021 T20 World Cup against England in Dubai. New Zealand were all out on 60 in 15.3 overs in the 2014 T20 World Cup against Sri Lanka in Chattogram. The fifth team in the list is Scotland who were bowled out on 60 in 10.2 overs in the 2021 T20 World Cup against Afghanistan in Sharjah. India's lowest total is 79 when they were all out in 18.1 overs against New Zealand at Nagpur in the 2016 T20 World Cup.




The 20 teams are divided into four groups, with the top two teams from each group advancing to the Super 8s stage. In this stage, the qualifying teams will be split into two groups of four. The top two teams from each group will then qualify for the two semifinals and the final.
