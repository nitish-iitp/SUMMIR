PM Modi doesn't understand pain of farmers, poor: Priyanka Gandhi in Haryana

Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, accusing him of not understanding the pain of farmers and the poor and alleging that his government frames policies only for his "billionaire" friends.

She also hit out at the BJP-led Centre over the issues of "Agniveer" and female wrestlers.

Addressing a Lok Sabha poll rally in Panipat district of Haryana after holding a roadshow in Sirsa, Gandhi announced that once the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) forms its government at the Centre, farmers will get a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP) for crops and their debts will be waived.

"One thing that has become clear in 10 years is that Modiji does not understand the pain of farmers, the poor, middle class, women and youngsters," she said.

This is '300 paar'. They will find happiness in this... There is no doubt that PM Modi's government will be formed with a huge majority... The people will form the government of those who will make 'Akhand Bharat' and bring PoK back... Rahul Gandhi will never become the PM. He will not make Sharad Pawar, Mamata Banerjee, Lalu Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav the PM either. He will make one of his servants the PM. He has a lot of experience with a dustbin. He threw Manmohan Singh's ordinance in the dustbin... He threw the whole party in the dust-bin... He will throw the country in the dustbin if he can. He is a 'Kudedaan master'. He wants to throw Sanatana in the dustbin..."

BJP filling Hindutva void created by Jayalalithaa's demise: Annamalai

The BJP is filling the void in Tamil Nadu politics left by the death of AIADMK supremo and former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, who was a "far superior" Hindutva leader, the BJP's state chief K Annamalai has said.

In an interaction with PTI Editors here, Annamalai said he is confident that the BJP will get a double-digit vote share in Tamil Nadu in the Lok Sabha elections and emerge as a third major party in the southern state.

The IPS officer-turned-politician said he will not let the BJP play second fiddle to any political party in Tamil Nadu, where there is a great scope for his party to fill the void created by the AIADMK's "drifting away" from the Hindutva ideology after Jayalalithaa's passing.
