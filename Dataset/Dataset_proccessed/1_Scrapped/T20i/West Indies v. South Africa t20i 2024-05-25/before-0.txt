Shreyas Iyer {PC:X}

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) skipper Shreyas Iyer stood tall for his team in the must-win game of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024. He slammed a terrific half-century against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in the Qualifier 1, which took place at the Narendra Modi International Stadium in Hyderabad.

Chasing the target of 160 runs, Kolkata Knight Riders after the start lost both the openers in quick succession of time. It was then when Shreyas Iyer walked in the middle and eased himself in. The India batter soaked in all the pressure and took him out of the tricky phase.

Once Shreyas Iyer got himself in, it was difficult to stop him. This was quite evident in the way he finished the game and took his team home at the Narendra Modi International Stadium in Ahmedabad. He slammed Travis Head for 22 runs in just 4 balls of the 14th over.

Shreyas Iyer started the over with the big six. Travis Head bowled a tossed-up delivery on the leg to which the batter swiped over deep mid-wicket for a maximum. On the next ball, the Kolkata Knight Riders slammed a boundary in the same area at the Narendra Modi International Stadium in Ahmedabad.

Shreyas Iyer however, didn't stop there as he then hit another maximum on third ball. Travis Head again bowled a tossed-up delivery on leg and the batter smashed it over deep mid-wicket to put the Sunrisers Hyderabad bowler under pressure.

Shreyas Iyer then made sure he finished the game on high. On the 4th ball of the over, Travis Head bowled a tossed-up delivery and the Kolkata Knight Riders skipper launched it over long-on to finish the game inside the 15 overs at the Narendra Modi International Stadium in Ahmedabad.

Shreyas Iyer ended with an innings of unbeaten 58 runs off just 24 balls. He batted with a strike rate of over 241 and also hit 5 fours and 4 sixes in his innings. He shared an unbeaten 97-run partnership with Venkatesh Iyer (51*) as the duo won the game for the team with 38 balls to spare.

We have a realistic chance to win the trophy now - Venkatesh Iyer

Venkatesh Iyer after the match against Sunrisers Hyderabad talked about reaching the final of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024. He said that it's a dreamy moment for them and they have a real chance to win the trophy now.

Venkatesh Iyer added that they were energetic coming into the match against Sunrisers Hyderabad. While talking to broadcasters, he explained:

"It is always special for players like us to play in the IPL final, it’s a dreamy moment for us, going to Chennai and looking forward to it. We have a realistic chance to win the trophy now.

"We were raring to go out there when you have the momentum you want to really go out there. You saw Rinku fielding in hotspots and taking those catches. It’s the excitement we have to go out there and perform."

Kolkata Knight Riders book their berth for the final, which will be played on Sunday at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. They would be keeping a keen eye on the tournament as to who will meet them in the final.
