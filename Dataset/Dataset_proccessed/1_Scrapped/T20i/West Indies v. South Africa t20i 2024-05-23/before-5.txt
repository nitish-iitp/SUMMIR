Watch: Virat Kohli’s pinpoint accurate throw from deep square ran out Dhruv Jurel during a crucial moment of the 2024 Eliminator between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Rajasthan Royals in Ahmedabad on Wednesday (May 22).

Chasing 173 for a win in the Eliminator, Rajasthan got off to a steady start, scoring 46 in 5.2 overs before Tom Kohler-Cadmore was dismissed for the third time in as many deliveries against Lockie Ferguson. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sanju Samson added 35 for the second wicket before departing in the space of four deliveries.

Dhruv Jurel walked out at No.5, but an electric throw from Virat Kohli at the boundary sent him back for a run-a-ball eight.

Cameron Green began the 14th over with a back-of-a-length delivery that Riyan Parag pulled to the left of Kohli at deep square leg. Kohli charged at the ball and threw it sharply back to Green, who just about managed to hold it between his wrists while breaking the stumps. It took the television umpire several replays before he ruled Jurel out.

Jurel was initially hesitant to go for the second run, which cost him his wicket.

The wicket did not prove too costly for Rajasthan, who were led by Riyan, Shimron Hetmyer, and Rovman Powell to a win with an over to spare. They will now face Sunrisers Hyderabad in Qualifier 2 in Chennai on Friday, with the winners from that clash facing Kolkata Knight Riders in the final two days later.
