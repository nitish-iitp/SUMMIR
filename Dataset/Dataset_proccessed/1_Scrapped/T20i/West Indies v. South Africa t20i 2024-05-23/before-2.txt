<image:caption>Julien Looten here has captured the Milky Way's entire 'winter arc' at the foot of a medieval castle in the Dordogne, France. Also present in the image is a natural phenomenon called 'air glow'. Julien explained: 'This occurs due to a chemical reaction in the upper atmosphere, emitting faint light known as chemiluminescence.' The stars can be identified from left to right as Sirius and the constellation of Orion, Mars, the Pleiades, the California Nebula, Cassiopeia, the double cluster of Perseus, and the Andromeda galaxy. The image is formed from 40 exposures that took an hour to record</image:caption>

<image:caption>There are few places on the planet as dark as the spot where this photo was taken, according to the photographer, Rachel Roberts. The location is Bluff Hut, nestled in the Southern Alps on New Zealand¿s South Island. It's only accessed by a difficult hike or helicopter flight. Rachel got there via the latter, explaining that the spot was chosen by the pilot after bad weather ruined Rachel's first-choice location. She said: 'I trusted the chopper pilot to choose the best spot for clear skies that evening. Thankfully, he didn¿t disappoint, and I was able to capture the Milky Way arching majestically over the hut from one of the darkest places on the planet'</image:caption>

<image:caption>Photographer Lorenzo Ranieri explained that he captured this image 'during an adventurous night on the plateau of the Atacama Desert [in Chile], a potentially dangerous area due to its designation as a mountain lion reserve', adding: 'After a whole afternoon of searching for compositions, I stumbled upon this remarkable mass of rocks adorned with tufts of grass, now burnt by the harsh environment. The area was littered with bones of small animals and footprints of a significant size, indicating the presence of wildlife not typically associated with peaceful sheep. Spending the night there was admittedly a bit nerve-wracking, but the opportunity to photograph such beauty made it worthwhile'</image:caption>

<image:caption>Explaining how this enchanting shot was captured, photographer Brandt Ryder explains: 'In May of 2023, I spent a couple of days around the iconic town of Lone Pine, California, where the lupines in the foothills were just coming into peak bloom and the skies are notoriously dark. I knew I wanted to create an image that transported the viewer into a sea of purple flowers framed by the snow-covered Sierra and the Milky Way rising above. Although this spot was special, it was the incredible panoply of colour in the night sky that I captured on this night that really elevates this image. Every time I look back at this image, I can still smell those flowers'</image:caption>
