Nepal are all set to lock horns with the United States of America in a three-match T20I series, starting Friday (October 18). The Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas will host the entirety of the T20I series.

Monank Patel will captain the USA side, with the presence of other experienced batters like Andries Gous and Aaron Jones. Meanwhile, Harmeet Singh, Saurabh Netravalkar and Nosthusha Kenjige are the key bowlers for the hosts.

USA stunned everyone by reaching the Super 8 stage of the 2024 T20 World Cup. Interestingly, they beat Pakistan and gave a good enough challenge to India a well. Recently, they emerged as the runner-up in the Netherlands Tri-Nation T20I Series and winners in the Namibia T20I series.

On the other hand, Rohit Paudel will lead Nepal and will have support from other senior players like Sandeep Lamichhane, Dipendra Singh Airee and Sompal Kami.

They failed to win any of their games in the T20 World Cup and could not reach the Super 8 stage. They are coming into this series with a decent performance in the Canada T20I Tri-series.

Both sides have met only once in the T20Is in the 2015 T20 World Cup Qualifier. The Nepalese side sealed a 122-run chase and won by six wickets then.
