A win for Yorkshire at last after whipping the tablecloth from under Gloucestershire, taking 13 wickets in a day at Scarborough. Zaman Akhter made a career-best 70 for Gloucestershire while Conor McKerr, on loan from Surrey, was on a hat-trick in each innings as he pocketed five wickets, and Adam Lyth took the catch of the match with a swallow-dive at second slip to complete a happy three days at his home ground.

Surrey enforced the follow-on at New Road, but then encountered plucky resistance from Worcestershire’s Gareth Roderick and Kashif Ali, who were untroubled for 34 overs until Jordan Clark had Roderick caught at slip as three wickets fell in the space of 10 balls. Before play Jeetan Patel, England’s spin bowling coach, supervised Surrey’s Dan Lawrence and Shoaib Bashir out in the middle.

James Vince and Liam Dawson rocked gently to their first Championship centuries of the summer as Hampshire piled up the runs at Edgbaston. Vince was unbeaten on 166 when he declared, setting Warwickshire 498 to win on a flat pitch in the hot sun.

Paul Walter danced to a frisky second Championship hundred at Chelmsford but Durham whipped through the rest, Matthew Potts bowling rapidly for four for 71. Durham didn’t enforce the follow on, and Essex were set 433 on the last day.

Lancashire had Kent on the ropes at Canterbury, after Josh Bohannon sparked the engine on his previous static car with 205, and Lancashire ran through Kent’s second innings. Three late wickets by Jack Carlson put Sussex in an excellent position against Leicestershire, the Hove pitch starting to turn and the visitors needing another 325 runs with only five wickets remaining.

Haseeb Hameed lost his stumps on 91 as Nottinghamshire fought back against Somerset. Migael Pretorius had earlier helped Somerset to a first-innings lead with an unbeaten 95, as Dillon Pennington took his first five-fer for Notts. Toby Roland-Jones grabbed five wickets as Derbyshire imploded in the first hour at Lord’s. They will need 396 to beat Middlesex.

Yorkshire beat Gloucestershire by an innings and 22 runs

At last, Yorkshire chalk a mark on the board. Gloucs bowled out for 237, Akhter, the top-scorer with 70, the penultimate man out. Three wickets each for Hill and McKerr. Northants, Leicestershire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Derbyshire now the only teams without a Championship win this season.

Jamie Porter angles one in, through, and onto Ackerman’s stumps. Three for ten, a classic mid-summer Porter delivery. Durham 107-5, the lead 355.

Kent have lost a third, and unfortunately for them it is Compton, caught off Bailey for 37. Still trail by 239.

HH and Slater press on at Trent Bridge, Notts just 26 behind Somerset now. JAck Leach yet to take a wicket in the match (though made a handy 37).

Dawson close to joining Vince in century-territory, Hants 378-5, a lead of 422 against Warwicks; and well played Roderick and Kashif, half centuries both against Surrey.

Tim Maitland is keeping an eye as Gloucestershire tumble towards early fish and chips on the Yorkshire coast. Come friendly sea fret. “With Gloucestershire on Nelson, two wickets in two balls for Conor McKerr. 111-7. McKerr also took two in two to end the Gloucs first innings, so it was the second time today he’d been on a hat trick.” Excellent knowledge!

Another Durham wicket, but with the lead 325, this isn’t really too much of a problem is it now. From the sublime etc, Ollie Robinson is done by Critchley for four.

Kent (39-2) have lost Bell-Drummond for nine, but Compton has dug foundations into the soil.

HH and Slater tucking into the deficit, Notts 59-0. While Kashif Ali and Gareth Roderick defy Dan Lawrence and Surrey’s right-arm fast-medium battery. Worcs 115-1.

Kent have had an unfortunate start to their second innings, 305 runs behind Lancs, as O’Riordan edges Williams to first slip. Kent’s hopes hang heavy on the shoulders of Compton and Bell-Drummond.

And at Chelmsford, a near miss for Borthwick who smacks Harmer into the shin of the close fielder, but Pepper can’t hold onto the rebound.

Tim Maitland, very much not in Scarbados, but peering at Youtube like the rest of us, has had a close eye on North Marine Road:

“Three quick wickets for Yorkshire and two were fantastic. I swear George Hill’s ball that trapped Cameron Bancroft LBW started on a seventh or eighth stump line, yet swung and perhaps nipped in so quickly the Aussie was nowhere close to making contact.

”Exactly four overs later, James Bracey seemed to be trying to pull out of square cutting a short, wide one from Vishwa Fernando, caught it with the toe-end and Adam Lyth at third slip diving at full length to his left somehow plucked it from the top of the turf.

”He was that chuffed he’d almost completed a full lap of honour before his teammates caught up with him.”

Forgive me for overlooking the tight thriller building at Edgbaston , where Warwickshire were all out 44 short of Hampshire’s first innings. Hants now 263-5 in their second, with nearly every batter throwing his hat into the ring. Things now in the hands of James Vince (69 of 92) and Liam Dawson (42 off 73).

Simon Harmer, incidentally, taking some more Durham tap – his first two ball slapped for four by Borthwick. Durham 37-2.

A long morning for the Northants bowlers at Sophia Gardens, where Mason Crane (56) and Andy Gorvin (26) have so far added 53 unbeaten for the last wicket. Ah, Gorvin has now been caught for 26, Glamorgan 490 all out.

Sam Robson is on fire at Lord’s, bashing 45 off 29 balls from the unfortunate Derby bowlers. Middx 46-1, after Derby were bowled out for 339, losing six for 22. TRJ 5-81 after his first innings 52.

Sussex have already built up a commanding lead against Leicestershire, 183-4 in their second dig – Sean Hunt just out for 65.

And Gloucestershire are clinging on at Scarborough with ten minutes till lunch, 38-1 following on, 221 behind

RIP Frank Duckworth

I’m sorry to read about the death of Frank Duckworth, of Duckworth-Lewis fame, at the age of 84.

I'm sad to report that Frank Duckworth MBE, co-creator of the Duckworth-Lewis method for adjusting targets in rain-affected cricket matches, passed away last Friday. His method was used just yesterday in the rain-affected World Cup match between Afghanistan and Bangladesh. RIP. pic.twitter.com/GMgn0EQBjG

County Cricket Day

Talking of festivals, next Sunday is “County Cricket Day” a fan-led campaign to encourage people to watch Championship cricket, “inspired by (but not affiliated with) Non-League Day, which for over a decade has worked to attract fans to football games at the lower end of the pyramid, and has helped spark a renaissance at that level of the game.”

Take your pick from Chesterfield, Southport, Cheltenham and more, plus free tickets at Grace Road.

"I just fancied my chances"

In case you missed it yesterday, this was Dan Lawrence last night after he smashed poor Shoaib Bashir for five consecutive sixes on the way to 175. Oh to be young and talented and bold.

“When we lost J.T. at number 10 it was a no brainer for me to then put my foot down and try and score as many runs as quickly as possible.

“After three balls, I was going to try and go for all of them (sixes). It was downwind and a short boundary and I just fancied my chances.

“I tried to hit six every ball. Thankfully I got five away and I couldn’t get the last one. I had some fun and thankfully bowled okay as well.”

Monday's round-up


Shoaib Bashir had the misfortune to meet Dan Lawrence on a mission at New Road. Lawrence bashed five consecutive sixes before five wides and a single off a no ball. The over equalled the Championship record 38 bashed by Andrew Flintoff for Lancashire against Surrey at Old Trafford in 1998.
To complement his highest first‑class score, Lawrence took two wickets as Worcestershire slipped into the ditch against Surrey.

Durham continued to charge at Chelmsford, galloping to 587, Ollie Robinson’s 198 the highlight. Simon Harmer’s four for 188 were his most expensive Championship figures. Essex faltered until an unbeaten partnership of 129 between Paul Walter and Matt Critchley.

Cakes and ale for Josh Bohannon (182 not out) and Luke Wells (150) in a second-innings partnership of 312 for Lancashire against an immature Kent. Kent went two sessions without taking a wicket.

A hundred too for Tom Abell in his second Championship game of the season, as Somerset played catch up with Nottinghamshire. Hampshire’s Keith Barker rattled the timbers of his old club with six for 74, though Jake Bethell (69) and Dan Mousley (57) kept Warwickshire’s deficit to mini sausage roll proportions.

In Division Two, Marnus Labuschagne fell seven short of his century as Glamorgan built a lead of 111 over Northamptonshire. Half centuries too for Kiran Carlson and Chris Cooke. Yorkshire were unable to capitalise on Sunday’s record-breaking opening partnership, losing seven for 87 under suddenly cloudy skies.

Gloucestershire also found batting tricky. There was a first Lord’s hundred for Luis Reece and 43 not out from Aneurin Donald as Derbyshire fought back against Middlesex. Peter Handscomb’s 92 wasn’t enough to lift Leicestershire out of trouble against Sussex.

Meanwhile Rocky Flintoff crashed a century off 103 balls for England Under-19s against a Young Lions Invitational XI.
