Wit 2 iouttnding  mathes to be played in Goup i, namely the matches between -

*   India and Autralia; and 


*   Afghanistan and Bangaldesh

The final position of SA on the said log is at present no 1.  That position will remain as number 1 if Australia beat India today.   If India win that match India will be tin th e number 1 position and SA in number 2.   if Afghanistan beats Bangla Desh and Australia loses against India thn the four seifinalists will be -


*   India no 1


*   South Africa number 2

*   England no 3

*   Afghanistan no 4,  

So for Australia to remain in the series there win against India is essential - if they lose the Aussies must hope that Bangladesh beat Afghanistan - if Afghanistan wins then Australia will be going home early.

India made 205 runs for 5   amd the qustion is can Australia make 206 to beat them.  Warner is already out and the score after 1,2 overs is 6/1 and after 2 overs the score is 8/1.

S Autralia has to make 198 runs from 18 overs at 11 runs per over.  Can hey do it?    If they lose they need to start praying Afghanistan lose against Bangladesh.     

22/1 after 3 overs.    Arshdeep bowling in the tird over was ot good enough.   Hardik will pobably do better. 

Australia put in a huge fight and Head is very good.  Depite Head's heroics the Aussies lost the match by 24 runs.

Afghanistaan is the Bookmakers favorite to win tomorrow .

The chances of Bangladesh  winning is rapidly improving - Afghanistan has only 108 runs after 19 overs with only 2 balls to be  bowled.    The innings ended with  Afghanistan having only 115 runs - when it started raining - so what will happen next?

So the unbelievable happen - Australia was sent packing in the T20WC and the 4 countries playing in the semi-finals are -

India

South Africa

England, and

Afghanistan

As I uderstand it the two semi-finals will be -

*   South Africa vs Afghanistan and

*   India vs England

I think it is likely that SA would beat Afghanistan in the semi and India would beat England in the other semi - with the final being between India and South Africa.   SA has zero chance of beating India in such a final - especially if zero Hendricks is the opening  batsman of SA.

You mean.....

I think it is likely that SA should beat Afghanistan in the semi and India would beat England in the other semi - with the final being between India and South Africa.   SA has zero chance of beating India in such a final - especially if zero Hen-ducks is the opening  batsman of SA.  

Ohh I don't know......given a sticky pitch Afghanistan could be a handful

You are a star in the Hen-ducks case.  In the emantime the Durban July is les than 14 days away and I will post some possible winners on site.   Wtach ou for Fourie riding any horse coached by De Kock, Snaith, Zackey or even Kotze.   One can be vcery sure that e will be paid particularly wellby the owners to ride their best  horses on July day.

Good I'll keep a lookout just don't expect me to tip a Caulfield or Melbourne Cup winner there are too many imports popping in and some of them don't even trial. Might tip a feature race in Sydney, one called the Everest. Quite a few SAFFA jocks over here now but none as good as the top Oz jocks.

I know there are and cannot back them - he only decent one amongst them are Jeff Lloyds son - the rest are definitely sub-sytnadard a fter the retirement of Lloyd and Schofield.  

Just the fact that the younger Fourie broke the SA record for winning rides in the year from 1 August to 31 july and is still winning more races indicates he is something special).   Wonder how long he would remain in SA though?  He can make huge money in Australia and other horse racing countries - more than he can make in SA, despite the support of racing by the Oppenheimer (Mary Slack) and Rupert (Gaynor Rupert) families,

The trainer I refer to above is not Zackey - but Sean Tarry

Hey, look at the type of bowling that took all the wickets...spin, spin and more spin. 

And Jansen stood firm where Morkel wouldn't have. Giraffe 2.0 truly is a better version.

Two shots that got us into the semis….Rabada’s 4 through the covers and Jansen’s definitive 6.

I would not write Afghanistan off just yet.

They are motivated and have shown real determination in each and every game thus far.

But even with our shakey batting we are in with a shot and a real surprise for them getting this far in the CWC.

The draw for the WC sure helped the Proteas plus a ton of LUCK.

Looking forward to the semi's and the final.

We could finally win one of these things….nerves aside, we are a way better team than Afghanistan. India is a different story, but this is T20 where a team like Afghanistan can beat Australia in a one off.

It’s time for the Proteas to redeem themselves.

Mike, Callan Murray is or has been riding at Morphetville racecourse for the Mike De Kock stable and has done an interview on a racing channel. Unless he rides in Melbourne and wins he won't come under notice.
