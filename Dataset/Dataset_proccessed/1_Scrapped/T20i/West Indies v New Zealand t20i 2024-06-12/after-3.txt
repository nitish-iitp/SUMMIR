Right then, that will be it from us for this contest. We hope you enjoyed the coverage. The action continues at the T20 World Cup as Bangladesh takes on the Netherlands on June 13th at the Arnos Vale Ground in St Vincent. That game will start at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT). But you can join early for all the build-up. Until then, take care and cheers!

!

The West Indies skipper, Rovman Powell says that he is very happy with the performance. Feels that individual brilliance is crucial on such surfaces. Adds that Sherfane Rutherford's knock gave them confidence and belief. States that they watched what the New Zealand bowlers did well and tried to replicate the hard lengths. Further says that the talk was to hit the hard length. Credits the bowlers for the way they bowled with the wet ball. Ends by saying that it was unfortunate that some of their batters could not get going, but he is glad to get the win.

!

Kane Williamson, the New Zealand skipper, says that it was a tricky surface and the bowlers did a good job. Lauds Sherfane Rutherford for his knock. Adds that that the batting depth was beneficial for West Indies and that they had some tough overs at the backend. Mentions that the wicket kept going up and down but the team did a fine job to adapt. Reckons that they tried to make the best of the preparation. Ends by sharing that they need to bounce back quickly in the last two games and take the learnings as they have to pick themselves and get back.

!

Sherfane Rutherford is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his rescue act with the bat. He starts by thanking the Almighty. Shares that even though he did not play for his Indian T20 League franchise, he was preparing there for this tournament. He says that it was about keeping things simple and backing his skills. Adds that he kept telling himself to take it deep. States he knew he could make it up in the end once he started to get into rhythm. Further says that he knew that New Zealand were 2 overs short and that if he stayed there, he could score maximum runs off those 2 overs. Hopes that the team can keep the momentum.

Time for the Presentation...

!

Earlier in the day, West Indies were sent into bat first and were reeling at 76 for 7 in the 13th over. Sherfane Rutherford scripted a comeback for the ages as he made handy partnerships with Russell, Hosein, and Shepherd to take his side out of troubled waters. Rutherford smashed an unbeaten 68 off just 39 and single-handedly took his side to a competitive score of 149. Trent Boult was the pick of the New Zealand bowlers with three wickets while Southee and Ferguson snapped a couple. New Zealand started well with the ball but gave away plenty of runs at the backend and were never in the game with the bat. New Zealand have suffered back-to-back losses and will need a miracle to progress into the Super 8s. If Afghanistan win their next game against PNG, that will be the end of Super 8 stage qualification hopes for the Kiwis.

!

Defending the score, West Indian bowlers applied the pressure from the word go and never allowed the Black Caps to get easy runs. Akeal Hosein picked up the early wicket of Devon Conway after which Alzarri Joseph and Gudakesh Motie put a stranglehold on the Kiwi batting through the middle stages of the game. Alzarri Joseph with four and Gudakesh Motie with three were the stand-out bowlers for the Men in Maroon as they make it three out of three in the group stage with a game to go.

!

WEST INDIES ARE THROUGH TO THE SUPER 8 STAGE OF THE T20 WORLD CUP! An outstanding comeback from the West Indies sees them defeat New Zealand by 13 runs. Chasing 150 for the win, New Zealand lost Devon Conway early but Finn Allen stuck a few lusty blows and kept up with the required rate. The home side came back strong and had New Zealand reeling at 63 for 5 in the 11th over. Glenn Phillips with 40 off 33 tried hard but lacked the support from other batters. Mitchell Santner stuck three maximums in the final over but it was all too late for the Black Caps as they finished on 136 for 9.
