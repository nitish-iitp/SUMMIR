Sherfane Rutherford Said - "I was in the IPL for 2 months, so I was preparing, even though I was not playing. I did a lot of work and did my planning. Keeping it simple and backing my skill".

NZ didn’t play a single match in Nassau County NY & still struggled. WI pitches have been better than NY to bat. Here Aus have scored 200, WI reached 149 but NZ even against AFG got bowled out for 75. Hence deserved to be knocked out. Squad dekh ki hi i knew they wont make semis

Where are Pakistani fans and statisticians who never miss a moment to criticise the strikerate of Babar, Rizwan? Can't they see poor strikerates of Indian batters against USA? 😡 #T20WorldCup
