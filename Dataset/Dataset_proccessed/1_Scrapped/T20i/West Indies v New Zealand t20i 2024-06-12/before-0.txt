True ting

 
Kay 2024-06-09 22:28:15 

Well, they only had six months to cut and paste an entire pitch .... what excuse does the West Indies have after 95 years of experience?

The west indies didn't choose the USA to be part of the hosting. And the only pitch in the caribbean that , as a commie indicated last night, is and was underprepared was the pitch at Providence. There are enough world class grounds for the west indies to host the tournament by itself, as it did in 2007 and 2009.

Which Caribbean are you living in. Most of the pitches in the Caribbean are crap. According to Ian Bishop last night the only proper pitch is in St. Lucia.

Yea the BCCI sorry the ICC would demand no more games there.

I don't have any proof but I know it's the BCCI who wanted that....and of course the CWI most likely bubbled theirs heads in support

What’s wrong with the pitch???

 
Raskil 2024-06-10 01:08:31 

The US and Canada teams played the pitches the best so far.
They knew the home conditions. Cricket shots and like Bish always preach, run singles.

Six months to put up a stadium that looks better than Providence and few others in the Caribbean.

Hug that up!

Providence is the only wicket to me that has played poorly. BCL academy has not debuted in the tournament and Kensington has played fantastic.

poorly or challenging to batsmen?

5 wickets to Akeal were all due to a poor pitch?

I saw Gurbaz murdering bowling there by aggressively applying himself

The extreme flat pitches like those in the recent IPL made the T20 game a farce

 
SnoopDog 2024-06-10 01:43:16 

Jumpy is just being a typical idiotic Tittie.

Providence has been one of the best pitches so far. It offers something for the good batters and the good bowlers.

 
Raskil 2024-06-10 02:54:56 

I was talking about the aesthetics of the cricket ground.
Providence looks third world.
US NY temp stadium should look third world with only 6 months notice.
Well it doesn’t.

Akeil was bowling arm balls and quick through the air, which is why the ball swung with him almost as much as it spun. Face it narper. providence is many times underprepared and sticky like molasses. And Bish and myself are not the only ones who think so. this is a Jarrod Kimber tweet from 2022


Remember when Australia would play the West Indies at the WACA in the 80s/90s.

Bangladesh at Guyana’s glue pit is a new entry in the genre.

Nikhil Uttamchandani during that same series was asking out loud on sports maxx why are we playing WI games at providence. And that was in a build up to a world cup as well

More than anything else, Pooran needs to learn to build an innings...batting 3 with plenty overs leff confuses him...he doesn't know to build an innings...we have been saying this a while...so when the going is tough he is out of his hitting mindset, fish outa water...this is also true for Hetty....bush league does this to hitters

you learn that playing longer form cricket...proper cricket

Poo Poo gives me the distinct impression that he thinks he's some kind of superstar in this game and walks around with a lil chip on his shoulders.

That's all well and good when you're batting on roads in these domestic lickit leagues where the six count is more important than any bowling stat. But where the pitch offers the bowlers something you have to use the stuff between your ears as a batter and, as you said, learn to build an innings coming in at 3.

 
StumpCam 2024-06-10 13:56:38 

Another thing in NY that the commies keep harping about was that the outfield is slow. That may have been true for the first few games, but Saturday and Sunday it was fairly fast paced. I think the distance to the boundary was actually what created that perception that it is a slow outfield. As a result, I don’t recall any sixes ended up in the stands. Only Gavaskar was able make that point, since the IPL boundaries are typically shorter.

SnoopDog 2024-06-10 14:30:50 

In reply to StumpCam

They are deliberately shorter, among other things done to dumb the game down to ensure it rains sixes.

A contest between bat and ball is now frowned upon.

Will the ICC ever investigate these flat and lifeless pitches where the bowlers are carted all over the park all day long?

 
Chrissy 2024-06-10 14:55:18 

I done talk.
Crap pitch.

 
StumpCam 2024-06-10 15:19:52

What kind of pitch is it when bowlers are going for 10-15 rpo???
Or a man can make 375 and 400??

If Pooran could do that he would be playing test cricket. You playing lickit cricket alL your life and you expect people to learn to bat at this stage? You are nuts.

excellent pitch when yuh scoring 375

 
Titleist 2024-06-10 15:51:00 

Other than the first match in NY with some uneven bounce, the pitches were fine. Also, some commentators were surprised batters had to run 3. That’s cricket. It should not be as soon as a ball pass a fielder it’s four.

dayne 2024-06-10 16:03:21 

The pitch would not be good enough even for a three-day first-class match. Poor planning by the ground supervisors.

These are exactly the type of pitches they are playing on in English County cricket. 4 days of it.

On one hand franchise cricket has forced guys to be better fielders but it has also made some glorified cowlashers.

And it's made bowlers think that going for 10 an over is a good day's work.

JOJO 2024-06-10 16:54:26 

I think the only regret ICC may have is not playing more games in the US. Look at the crowd at the ground on a Monday morning.

 
Halliwell 2024-06-10 17:01:06 

What’s so wrong with the pitch?

The scores aren’t a boring 230 everytime
And batsmen outsing themselves playing cross bat shots


It should be obvious in 5 minutes to put those shots away on this pitch and play the way you were coached as a youngster.

These low scoring games are refreshing even for this person that looked at no more than 2 games all IPL

 
newdread 2024-06-10 17:26:22 

The pitch in New York was built in Australia, shipped to Florida and driven to New York. It was made by Australia's "finest" builder of drop-in pitches. Meanwhile, the pitch in Dallas, originally curated by Jamaica's Sam Plummer, has played extremely well---both teams scoring in excess of 190 in the first game there and big scores following.

Of the 5 games played in Guyana, 4 have featured either PNG and Uganda, with 1 involving both of them - you would expect low scores.

Afghanistan have batted on it twice and scored 342 runs in 40 overs - or 8.55 runs per over.
The WI scored 310 in 39.1 overs - or 7.95 runs per over.

Of the 5 games played in Barbados

Scotland have scored 247 runs in 29.1 overs - or 8.49 runs per over
Australia have scored 365 in 40 overs - or 9.125 runs per over
In their one chance at bat England scored at 8.25 runs per over

In the lone game in Antigua

Scotland chased down 153 in 13.1 overs - or 11.68 runs per over

Oonu chatting bare shyte - there is nothing wrong with the pitches in the Caribbean.

its slow and sucks the energy of the ball. some of the Uganda bowlers were getting uneven bounce even in the first ten overs of the game. I am not saying that every pitch must be a runs paradise, but that does not usually happen in a t20. There was a pitch used in nagpur in 2016 edition of the tournament. india was bowled out for less than 100 in the first game of the tournament proper. WI beat SA, barely and lost to afghanistan on the same ground. the pitch was not the quickest but it had even bounce, not spongy bounce. And what made that ground difficult for the most part was the size of the boundaries, not the pitch. i think the square is 85 yards and the straight is 80 yards, making it one of the biggest grounds in the world in terms of playing area. That presents a challenge but it does not compromise the contest on the playing surface.

Well our batsmen have been cast by IPL in the role of finishers. They come st 6 with 5 overs or less remaining and do what they are paid to do.
Now the roles are slightly different
