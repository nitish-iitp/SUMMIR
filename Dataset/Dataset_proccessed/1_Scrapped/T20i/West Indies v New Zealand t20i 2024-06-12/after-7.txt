Santner to Rutherford, FOUR!
Scoreboard keeps ticking over. This one doesn't clear the ropes but it's another costly over. Back of a length ball outside off. Rutherford goes onto the back foot and pushes for four. Emphatic ball-striking to close out over number 20. That gets us to the halfway point of the game. West Indies finish on 149 runs for the loss of 9 wickets. Next up New Zealand will start their chase feeling confident that they will get past this total. That's been an excellent performance with the ball by New Zealand.
