6

Motie to finish his quota of overs. Six!! Phillips takes the risk, lofts a full one over midwicket, has just enough to beat the fielder in the deep. The arm ball beats Phillips, appeals for a catch from Pooran but nothing from the umpire. Just the solitary six from the over. 

JUNE 13, 2024 08:56
NZ 67/5 in 12 overs

Roston Chase into the attack. Neesham joins Phillips at the crease. A single puts the new batter on strike. Gets off the mark with a single to midwicket. A complete mixup in between the batter but Pooran misses the direct hit at the strikers. Could have calmly thrown it to King who was running in from cover. NZ get another life.

JUNE 13, 2024 08:42
W

JUNE 13, 2024 08:31
Williamson dismissed!

NZ 45/3 in 7 overs

JUNE 13, 2024 08:27
Allen departs!

Dropped!! Rutherford errs for the first time today. Alzarri Joseph forces a mishit out of Allen. It is a skier. Rutherford makes all the running, but let’s the ball slip through his grasps. 

But Allen can’t make much of his luck. Short from Joseph. Allen hits it straight to Russell. 

Finn Allen c Russell b Joseph 26 (23b 3x4 1x6)

JUNE 13, 2024 08:16
NZ 25/1 in 4 overs

Russell into attack and Allen takes him on immediately. Whips one off his pads for a four. Rusell brings the line into the stumps to cut short Allen’s scoring options. Three dot balls follow before a single is taken. 

JUNE 13, 2024 08:11
W
Hosein strikes!

Akeal Hosein continues. Slip in place for the left-arm spinner. Drifts it into Allen’s swinging arc. Smacked away for a six by the right-handed batter. 

Hosein keeps it straight against Conway, who attempts a half-hearted sweep. Top edge and an easy catch at short fine leg. 

Devon Conway c Chase b Hosein 5 (8b 0x4 0x6)

JUNE 13, 2024 08:05

JUNE 13, 2024 08:02
New Zealand’s chase begins

Akeal Hosein with the ball. Conway on strike. Hosein beats Conway’s inside edge with one that slid in. Too high on the pad. Hosein continues to use swing instead of spin to trouble the New Zealand openers. Just three runs from the over.

WI 149/9 in 20 overs

Santner to bowl the last one. Motie gets a single to long off. A wayward throw helps Rutherford scamper back for a second after hitting one to the offside sweeper. Four!! Santner maintaining the wide line, Rutherford lofts it over extra cover for a boundary. Goes for a big one over the offside again, falls short of the fielder and the batters run two. Six!!

JUNE 13, 2024 07:34
W
WI 112/9 in 18 overs

Boult into the attack. Four!! Slower short ball, Joseph turns it behind fine leg for a boundary. Two dots to follow. NZ looking for a wicket in this over. They will need the fifth bowler to bowl the next two. WICKET!! Right on cue, Boult castles Joseph with one that kept low.

JUNE 13, 2024 07:17
6
WI 91/7 in 15 overs

Southee to finish his quota. Six!! Short of a length on the body, Shepherd pulls it over fine leg, has just enough to beat the fielder. A slight mix up after Rutherford defends one to the offside. No damage done. 

JUNE 13, 2024 07:12
WI 81/7 in 14 overs

Neesham returns. Shepherd gets a single to cover. Excellent timing on the cover drive from Rutherford, will get a couple. A chance at the non-strikers after Rutherford tries to steal a single to backward point. A direct hit would have done him. Four runs from the over. 

JUNE 13, 2024 07:07
W
The dangerous Russell goes!

Boult returns. Rutherford takes a single to put Russell on strike. WICKET!! Slower ball short of a length, Russell looked to muscle it over the legside, only manages to edge it to short third.

JUNE 13, 2024 06:58
W
Santner removes Hosein!

Six!! Santner into the attack and Rutherford goes after him first ball. Pulls one into the stands at deep midwicket. A single to long on off a miscue follows. Hosein looks to go big after two dots, doesn’t get the timing right but will pick up a couple to midwicket. 

WICKET!! Hosein chips one straight to short midwicket. The gamble works for NZ.

Akeal Hosein c Neesham b Santner 15(17)

WI 58/6 in 11 overs

JUNE 13, 2024 06:51
WI 49/5 in 10 overs

Another over for Neesham as Williamson holds Santner back, presumably for Andre Russell. Couple of singles to start the 10th over. Neesham has the beating of Akeal Hosein for the last three balls. Three dots to seal New Zealand’s domination of the first half of this innings. 

JUNE 13, 2024 06:49
6
WI 47/5 in 9 overs

And finally, we have spin. Glenn Phillips with the ball. A leg bye gifts West Indies a couple of runs. Full from the offie. Hosein gets under the ball. Crashed over long off for a massive six.

Here is the list of the lowest totals put up by the West Indies in ICC T20 World Cup history.

JUNE 13, 2024 06:42
WI 36/5 in 8 overs

Ferguson continues as Williamson continues to delay the introduction of spin. Ferguson keeps it tight against Akeal Hosein, the new batter. But a misfield by Williamson at mid off allows West Indies to sneak in a double. 

JUNE 13, 2024 06:38
W
King walks back!

Jimmy Neesham introduced. Brandon King breaks free. Fuller one from Neesham and the West Indian opener lofts it over long off for a six. But his painful innings ends immediately as he too edges one to the keeper. 

Brandon King c †Conway b Neesham 9 (12b 0x4 1x6)

WI 32/5 in 7 overs

JUNE 13, 2024 06:31
W
Skipper falls!

Southee to close out the PowerPlay. On strike is the West Indian skipper Rovman Powell, who defends the first three balls. 

And now the pressure gets to the skipper. Southee keeps it in the channel. Powell can only get a thick edge to the keeper. West Indies in deep, deep trouble. 

Rovman Powell c †Conway b Southee 1 (5b 0x4 0x6)

WI 23/4 in 6 over

JUNE 13, 2024 06:25

W
Lockie Ferguson joins the party!

Lockie Ferguson into the attack. Single from King to start the over. Another short ball, another top edge and another good high catch. This it is Roston Chase. 

Roston Chase c Ravindra b Ferguson 0 (3b 0x4 0x6)

WI 22/3 in 5 overs

JUNE 13, 2024 06:18
W
Pooran falls!

Short and wide from Southee and Pooran needs no second invitation. Slashes it over covers for an easy over. Width again. Pooran slams it with vengeance. Straight at Mitchell at short extra cover. But the force of the ball meant it spilled from the Kiwi fielder’s hands. 

But Mitchell’s mistake doesn’t cost New Zealand too much. Short from Southee and Pooran goes after it. Top edge and Conway circles back to take a good catch. 

Nicholas Pooran c †Conway b Southee 17 (12b 3x4 0x6)

WI 20/2 in 4 over

JUNE 13, 2024 06:12
WI 12/1 in 3 overs

And we have the first boundary of the day. Pooran tries to take the fight to Boult. Steps down and attempts a wild slog. Thick outside edge and it runs away for a four. Pooran goes in search for another boundary. No timing on his effort to go over the leg side. Just a couple of runs. Three singles to close the over. 

JUNE 13, 2024 06:07
WI 3/1 in 2 overs

Southee in. Starts off by getting the beating of King’s outside edge with a good length delivery. King gets off the strike with a push to mid on. Pooran gets off the mark thanks to an inside edge single. 

JUNE 13, 2024 06:02
B
Boult strikes early!

As we all have come to expect, Trent Boult with the first over. A leg bye single off the first ball. Swing-and-a-miss from Charles as Boult jags it away from the stumps. The Kiwi pacer keeps it just outside the off stump. 

Charles looks to break free. Swings at a wide one. Can manage only an inside edge, which slams onto the stumps. Boult gets his early wicket. 

Johnson Charles b Boult 0 (5b 0x4 0x6)

WI 1/1 in 1 over

USA vs IND, T20 World Cup 2024: Arshdeep and Co. deflate United States as India confirms Super 8 qualification

Powered by impactful performances by Arshdeep Singh and Hardik Pandya, India steamrolled USA in the T20 World Cup 2024 Group ‘A‘ clash to book a spot in the Super 8 at the Nassau County International Cricket in New York on Wednesday.

JUNE 13, 2024 04:49
PREVIEW

The early stages of the T20 World Cup have revealed a stark contrast in fortunes within Group C. Co-host West Indies is riding high after a commanding 134-run victory over Uganda, the second-largest margin of victory by runs in the tournament’s history. Conversely, New Zealand sits at the bottom of the group after collapsing for 75 in pursuit of Afghanistan’s 160. 

Afghanistan leads Group C with a Net Run Rate (NRR) of +5.225, while the West Indies is second, having secured two wins out of two. New Zealand, on the other hand, teeters on the brink of an early exit.

As the teams prepare for their Wednesday evening clash at the Brian Lara Stadium in Tarouba, Trinidad, the West Indies is expected to stick with its winning XI. New Zealand, despite its recent setback, might also retain the same lineup, aiming to avoid a reactionary shake-up after one poor performance.

This match will mark the first T20 World Cup fixture at the Brian Lara Stadium, a venue built in 2017. Known for its batter-friendly conditions, the stadium boasts an average first innings score of 185. England posted the second-highest T20I total by a Test-playing nation here last December, scoring 267/3.
