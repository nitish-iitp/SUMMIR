The United States takes on India in the T20 Cricket World Cup.

The 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup is underway, co-hosted by the United States and the West Indies. This is the ninth time this event has been staged. In 2022, Australia hosted this event, with England defeating Pakistan to win the tournament. We’re currently in the group stage of the tournament, with Wednesday featuring a Group A match between the United States and India. These are currently the top two teams in the group as both are undefeated in the tournament. The United States beat Canada by seven wickets and Pakistan on the Super Over, while India beat Ireland by eight wickets and India by six runs.

The United States is competing in its first World Cup and qualified by being the host nation. The team has already taken down one juggernaut of the cricket world in Pakistan and now will try to do it again against a really good India squad.

India has advanced out of the group stage in every ICC T20 World Cup. It won the first one back in 2007 and was a semifinalist in 2022. The win over Pakistan goes a long way toward keeping that streak alive.
