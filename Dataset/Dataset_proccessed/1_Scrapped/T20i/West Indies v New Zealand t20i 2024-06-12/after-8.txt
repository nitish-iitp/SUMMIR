In Short
West Indies are placed second in the table in Group C
West Indies have won both their Group matches
West Indies will face New Zealand at the Brian Lara Stadium

Rovman Powell reckoned that West Indies have a great chance of beating New Zealand when the teams meet in the T20 World Cup 2024 Group C match at the Brian Lara Stadium in Tarouba, Trinidad. The Kiwis are currently languishing at the bottom of the table with a net run rate of -4.200 after losing to Rashid Khan’s Afghanistan by 84 runs in their first group match.

After being asked to chase down a competitive target of 160, the Black Caps were bowled out for 75 in 15.2 overs. Barring Glenn Phillips and Matt Henry, none of their batters got into double digits. Powell said that New Zealand are under pressure, and it’s the right time for the hosts to take advantage of their vulnerability.

‘Focusing on what we have to do’

"Definitely, if there's a good time to play New Zealand, I think it's now. As you said, they're a little bit undercooked. The pressure is really on them, because this game decides whether they go on: yes or no. Having said that, we're not focusing on New Zealand: we're focusing on what we have to do," Powell said in the pre-match press conference.

The 30-year-old Powell also hinted that a high-scoring match may not be on the cards because of the weather.

"With the rain around, that can play a part in the scores. If the groundsmen don't have sufficient time to produce good wickets, that's also a problem with the rain around. You don't get enough time to sun. Hopefully tomorrow is a very good day in terms of the weather," Powel added.

West Indies started with wins over Papua New Guinea and Uganda, and are one win away from securing their berth in the playoffs. They are placed second in Group C with 4 points and a net run rate of +3.574.
