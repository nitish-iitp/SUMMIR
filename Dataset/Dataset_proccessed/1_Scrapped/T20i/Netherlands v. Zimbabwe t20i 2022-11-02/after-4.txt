Zimbabwe vs Netherlands Highlights, T20 WC 2022, 34th Match, Super 12 Group 2: Playing a must win game to stay in contention for the semifinals, Zimbabwe opted to bat first against the Netherlands at the Adelaide Oval. The decision wouldn’t suit the team that beat Pakistan with three wickets lost in the powerplay and no partnerships being formed to do the repair work. The Dutch restricted Zimbabwe at 117.

ZIM vs NED: Netherlands win

Finally. The Dutch have two points in the Super 12. A five wicket win. There was quite a hold off with a comedy of errors towards the end but the team in orange has avoided the worst case scenario. Zimbabwe are all but out of the semifinal race and it now seems between India, South Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh from Group 2. There is another match left in the day. India playing Bangladesh at the same venue. Follow us for all the updates from that game.

12:40 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Another wicket? Dear me!

Edged and gone. The Dutch are a shoe in for the win at Adelaide but Zimbabwe aren't letting them take it without a bit of a delay. Five down, two more needed to win off 18 balls.

12:33 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Wicket!

Just after getting to his fifty, Max ODowd finds Milton Shumba at deep point. Netherlands lose a fourth but are just three away from pushng Zimbabwe out of the final four contention.
 

12:31 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Netherlands in touching distance of the win

What an over!
 
Three wides, three fours. 17 runs off it. Fifty for Max ODowd. 109/3. Just nine needed to win off the last five overs.

12:25 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Another wicket for Zimbabwe

Colin Ackermann departs while trying to loft it over the inner circle. Netherlands, 92/3 after 14 overs. 26 needed off 36 deliveries.
 

12:20 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Wicket!

Luke Jongwe breaks the Cooper-ODowd 73-run partnership. Wesley Madhevere injures his left ankle while completing the catch at deep mid-wicket. Zimbabwe, 91/2 after 13 overs. 27 needed off 42 balls.
 

12:14 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Good comeback from Chatara

Max ODowd played a lovely flick for a boundary off Tendai Chatara's first ball but the right arm medium fast makes a good comeback conceding only two more in the over. With the Netherlands 83/1 after 12 overs, the scope for a Zimbabwe comeback is looking bleak though.

12:09 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: No boundary, no problem

10 off that Blessing Muzarabani over. The pacer had only conceded 7 off his first two and he made it difficult for the set pair in the middle to find a boundary in his third. But given the long dimensions of the Adelaide Oval, 3s and 2s did the job for the Dutch. 77/1 after 11 overs.

12:03 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Drinks break

Max ODowd lofts one into the stands over covers for six. A reverse paddle from Tom Cooper to finish the 10th over with a four. 67/1 at the halfway stage.

11:59 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Fifty up!

Fifty up for the Netherlands. Six came off that Sikandar Raza over, all singles. They don't need to hurry up at all, do they? 53/1 after nine overs. 65 needed to win off 66 deliveries.
 

11:57 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Opener set in the middle!

A set batter in the middle was what Zimbabwe missed in their innings. Max ODowd looks comfortable in the middle. Goes down the ground over Ngarava's head to grab his fourth boundary. Netherlands, 47/1 after eight overs.
 

11:48 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: End of powerplay.

Tom Cooper gathers 10 runs off that last over from Blessing Muzarabani. A cut to the left of the field at point for four. A pull through mid wicket for a flat six. Netherlands, 35/1.
 

11:45 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Another short one, another boundary

The Netherlands have had a good boundary conversion rate so far off short deliveries, outside off. Tendai Chatara offers Max ODowd another one and that spoils what had been a good fifth over upto the last delivery. Seven come off it. 25/1.

11:37 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Wicket

First wicket for Zimbabwe. Blessing Muzarabani picks Stephan Myburgh, who may have been trying to slice it wide of point but instead, finds Ryan Burl perfectly. Four overs gone, Zimbabwe are 18/1.

02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Maiden, almost!

Nothing like watching a maiden over opportunity being spoiled by a last ball boundary for a bowler. Full length delivery from Chatara and Max ODowd finds the gap. 17/0 after three overs.
 

11:32 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: First maximum of the match for the Netherlands

Stephan Myburgh goes big.  Short pitched and wide, Myburgh slices it nicely all the way into the stands. 13/0 after two overs.
 

11:25 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: The chase begins

The Dutch opening pair of Max ODowd and Stephen Myburgh started off their run chase of 117 runs. Tendai Chatara of Zimbabwe bowled the first over and conceded 5 runs. All eyes will be on ODowd's batting.

11:12 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: End of innings

Logan van Beek gets Blessing Muzarabani, a second wicket for him, and that'll do it. Zimbabwe all out for 117.
 

11:10 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: One over to go

Zimbabwe have been plain disappointing in this innings. No partnership were built after they lost three early wickets in the powerplay and the lower middle order wasn't able to do to demage control owing to poor shot selection. And it has reflected on the scorecard. 116/9 with six balls to go.

02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Predictable?

It was, yes. Fred Klaassen knew the only shot Richard Ngarava was trying to play was a whack on the leg side, targeting the deep midwicket region where he had hit a maximum before in the over. Klaassen pitched a slower one way outside off and he took the bait. A ninth wicket falls. Klaassen gets his first wicket of the match. Zimbabwe, 111/9 after 18 overs.

10:59 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Wicket no. 8!

Just as Zimbabwe crossed 100, they lose another. Luke Jongwe falls and Zimbabwe are really limping now. The desperation to win today's contest and make it to the semifinals has been perhaps too big an ask for this batting order. Bas de Leede gets a second. 102/8 after 17 overs.

10:54 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Wicket!

Paul van Meekeren claims a 3fer on the final ball of his spell. A cross seamer that gets an inside edge before cleaning up Ryan Burl. Safe to say, Zimbabwe have been thrown into the deep end now. 98/7 after 16 overs.

10:46 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Gone!

Big wicket this for the Netherlands. Superb catch by Fred Klaassen. Sikandar Raza (40 off 24) walks back. Good over this from Bas de Leede. Zimbabwe, 95/6 after 15 overs.
 

10:43 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: The sweet music of the bat

Sikandar Raza is striking the ball sweet. Takes on Brandon Glover's back of a length delivery for an easy dispatch over deep midwicket. That sound reverberated across Adelaide Oval. Follows it with an effortless loft over extra cover for a four. 14 runs come off the 14th over. 92/5.

10:39 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Two quick wickets!
Back to back quick wickets for the Netherlands. Paul van Meekeren gets Sean Williams and Logan van Beek picks Milton Shumba in the next. Zimbabwe are five down now. 78/5 after 13 overs.

02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Roelof van der Merwe into the attack

Some left arm orthodox spin time. Left hander, Sean Williams picks him with a reverse-sweep to the left of backward point. Eight off that over and Zimbabwe are 62/3 after 11.

10:19 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Drinks break

Scott Edwards brings on his fifth bowler into the attack, Bas de Leede. Just three off his first and Netherlands look the more comfortable of the two camps halfway through the first innings. 53/3.

10:18 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Raza into the act

Going into this match, Sikandar Raza had more runs than any of his teammates (145 runs off six innings) at this World Cup. More runs than any of teammates this year in the format. Of course he's a key component of how they perform in this match. Which is why the back to back boundaries in the 9th over from his bat would come as a relief for them. Fifty up for Zimbabwe at the loss of three wickets.

10:12 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Another boundary as Williams eases things in the middle

Just when it was looking like Logan van Beek will wrap up another economical over for Netherlands, Sean Williams finds the gap in the extra cover region with a fierce hit. Six come off the over. 36/3 after eight overs.

10:06 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: 10-run over

Sean Williams opens his hands on the first ball post powerplay. A pull through square leg for four to begin the over. 10 off it. 30/3 after seven overs.

10:04 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Thanks but no thanks, I will do it myself, says GloverÂ 

Sriram Veera: Glover vs Regis Chakabva was worth a watch for the bowling plans and for Glover’s persistence despite two drop catches. A shortish ball outside off had Chakabwa slash straight to point where it was clanged. Couple of players ran to pat the fielder. Next ball, similar in line and length with a hint of away-shape, was edged low to the right of the keeper, who clanged it. Now, no patting. Just wincing ensued. Chakbava left the next ball outside off and watched the one - a next well-outside off delivery- sail through. 

Surely, he must have wondered if the final ball of the over would be the nip-backer. Or was he thinking the bowler will bluff, and go in the corridor again? The ball did come back in to beat Chakabva’s prod and rammed the pad dead plumb in front. Glover pumped his fist and roared. Three strikes at Chakabva, two drops by his team-mates, but he would eventually do it on his own.

ZIM vs NED: JEEZ, some over that

Back to back dropped catches and then an lbw to round it off. First from Bas de Leede at point. Then captain Scott Edwards behind the stumps. Brandon Glover does get a wicket off the over. Regis Chakabva rapped around the pads. Zimbabwe look down and out right now. 20/3 at the end of the powerplay.

ZIM vs NED: Netherlands on top!

Both the top orders in today's meeting have been vulnerable in the tournament so far, and clearly not the big strength of both these sides. The Dutch have been quick to exploit that to their advantage in Adelaide. Another miserly over bowled and Zimbabwe desperately need a couple of double digit run over. 18/2 after five overs.

09:50 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Wicket no. 2
Another wicket in the powerplay. Brandon Glover brought into the attack. Delivers a wicket maiden. Captain Craig Ervine departs. Zimbabwe, 14/2 after four overs.

ZIM vs NED: Movement, more movement

There have been a fair few edges flying and a couple of balls left early in this contest. Zimbabwe playing it cautious for the most parts. Fred Klaassen's second over costs just the one. 14/1 after three overs.

09:41 (IST)
02 NOV 2022
ZIM vs NED: Gone!

First wicket for the Netherlands. Paul van Meekeren cleans Wesley Madhevere. 13/1, Zimbabwe after two overs.

Wesley Madhevere takes guard at the striker's end. Fred Klaassen with the new ball. Off we are at the Adelaide Oval. Three off that first at the loss of no wicket.

ZIM vs NED: Here's a moment

Cricket writer Bharat Sundaresan, formerly with The Indian Express, walks out with the T20 World Cup trophy ahead of the Zimbabwe-Netherlands fixture at the Adelaide Oval.

Never not a good time to read his piece on former West Indies pacer Patrick Patterson. The most fearsome of Caribbean pacers disappeared into oblivion in the 1990s, Patrick Patterson is still around, though he does not quite remember the man he was, or his bowling spells which went down in history. But he is grateful for the dogged fan who travelled half-way around the world to his door — to hear his story. [Read more]

ZIM vs NED: Pitch

"This Adelaide pitch is so hairy - there's so much grass on the surface. The pitch is very firm. I won't be concerned about the green tinge. It's a 160 surface, good bounce. If I win the toss, I'd like to bat but I'm not fussy the other way around either," reckon Dirk Nannes and Pommie Mbwangwa.

Dimensions: 67m & 57m square, 81m for a straight hit.

ZIM vs NED: Preview

Losing their first three games in the Super 12 to Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, Netherlands became the first team to be knocked out of the 2022 T20 World Cup final four contention. Thanks to their sensational one run win against Pakistan and a washed out game against South Africa, Zimbabwe still remain in the race for the semis. If that is to remain, a win against the Dutch is the minimum that has to go in Zimbabwe’s favor as the two lock horns at the Adelaide Oval on Wednesday. [Read more]

Welcome

Hello and welcome to our live blog on another interesting game of the T20 World Cup 2022. Both Zimbabwe and Netherlands are still mathematically in with a chance of reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup, although that is the slimmest of chances for a Dutch side without a win in their first three matches in the group.

Knocked out of the T20 World Cup, the Netherlands look to upset Zimbabwe

The only meeting between the two at the World T20 was in 2014 when Zimbabwe emerged victorious by five wickets.

Losing their first three games in the Super 12 to Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, Netherlands became the first team to be knocked out of the 2022 T20 World Cup final four contention. Thanks to their sensational one run win against Pakistan and a washed out game against South Africa, Zimbabwe still remain in the race for the semis. If that is to remain, a win against the Dutch is the minimum that has to go in Zimbabwe’s favor as the two lock horns at the Adelaide Oval on Wednesday.

The two have previously met on four occasions in the format, with Zimbabwe winning twice, Netherlands winning one and a fourth that ended in a tie. The only meeting between the two at the World T20 was in 2014 when Zimbabwe emerged victorious by five wickets. (READ MORE)
