Highlights, T20 World Cup 2022, NED vs ZIM Latest Updates: Max O’Dowd scored a half-century after a fine bowling display from the Netherlands bowlers that guided them to a five-wicket win over Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe were bowled out for 117 in 19.2 overs in a Group 2 Super 12 clash at the Adelaide Oval on Wednesday. And in reply, the Dutch overhauled the target in 18 overs to finish with 120/5. O’Dowd was the top-scorer with 52 while Richard Ngarava and Blessing Muzarbani took a couple of wickets each.

Earlier, Zimbabwe opted to bat first but quickly slipped to 20/3 in the Powerplay. A recovery followed but once the 48-run stand between Sikandar Raza and Sean Williams was broken, the collapse resumed. Paul van Meekeren took 3/29 while Brandon Glover, Logan van Beek and Bas de Leede took a couple of scalps each.

Zimbabwe and Netherlands are two teams who fought hard to pave their way into the Super 12 stage from the Group phase of the ICC T20 World Cup. Both sides faced the wrath of the top teams in the main tournament and are on the verge of being knocked out. But they will want to end their campaign on a high note and clinch a win when they clash against each other on Wednesday.

This has been a huge tournament for Zimbabwe, creating massive upsets and making a statement on the big stage. The Chevrons have already exceeded all expectations, and their massive victory over Pakistan was the cherry on top. Their heart-breaking defeat against Bangladesh crushed all their hopes of making it through to the semi-finals. They weren’t really fancied to make it to the knockout phase but their incredible showings and massive strides in the world of cricket are inspiring.

The Netherlands too were exceptional in the group stages but looked out of place in the Super 12 stage. Three defeats on the trot against three world-class sides ended any qualification hopes if they ever existed. But without a doubt, the Dutch squad has some talented players on its roster, and their goal now should be to enjoy playing on the big stage.

With nothing much at stake, both these nations will go all out to secure a win and salvage some pride.

Netherlands Get First Points

Netherlands rode on a fine bowling display from their bowlers to defeat Zimbabwe by five wickets in a T20 World Cup 2022, Super 12 clash at the Adelaide Oval on Wednesday. Zimbabwe opted to bat first but found themselves struggling in the Powerplay as they were reduced to 20/3 in six overs. A brief recovery between Sikandar Raza and Sean Williams followed but once they were separated, Zimbabwe again slipped. Raza top-scored with 40 off 24 while Williams made 28 off 23 as Zimbabwe folded for 117 in 19.2 overs. Paul van Meekeren took 3/29 from four overs.

In reply, Netherlands did lose opener Stephan Myburgh but a solid partnership between Max O’Dowd and Tom Cooper followed for the second wicket which all but ended Zimbabwe’s hopes as they failed to land quick blows. O’Dowd made 52 while Cooper was out after hitting 32 off 29. Netherlands did lose quick wickets but by then the required margin was negligible. Bas de Leede sealed the win with a four as Netherlands became the sixth team in Group 2 to win at least one match in the round.
