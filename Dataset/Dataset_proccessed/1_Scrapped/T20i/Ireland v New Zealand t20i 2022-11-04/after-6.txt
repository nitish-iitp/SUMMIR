T20 World Cup 2022 Live score: The pitch

Mike Atherton says that the pitch is “smack-bang in the middle of the ground. Looks a pretty good one. Always an inviting place to come as a batter. It's a fresh pitch, and looks among the best I've seen. It's evenly grassed and quite firm. Runs to be had.”

IRE vs NZ Live score: Kane Williamson's form

Kane Williamson had a strike rate of 117.32 last year and is going at 112.70 this year. He has been a brilliant captain, but as a batter he has been struggling, particularly this year. He is striking at 93.42 in the 2022 T20 World Cup and has scored 71 runs in three innings. However, both Graeme Swann and Gautam Gambhir say in the Star Sports studio that any questions about Williamson's place in this team is nonsense, his role as an anchor is very important for them.

T20 World Cup 2022 Live score: Australia on the edge

Australian fans will be dawning Irish colours for now with their gold shirts reserved for later in the day when their team take on Ireland. Then tomorrow they can go all out for Sri Lanka. This is because Ausralia's most straightforward mode of qualification would be for them to beat Afghanistan while England and New Zealand both lose their respective matches.

Ireland vs New Zealand Live T20 World Cup: NZ's last game

A win over England would have allowed New Zealand to qualify for the semi-finals and they were in a very good position to get that heading into the last five overs of their chase. But then, the England pacers, led by the brilliantly in-form Sam Curran, applied the breaks on them and they ended up losing the match by 20 runs.

Ireland vs New Zealand Live score: How things stand in Group 1

The short is, very precariously indeed. It is pretty much a three-way race to the semis but Sri Lanka have a very, very faint chance of making it as well. So do Ireland, although their chances are even fainter than Sri Lanka's. New Zealand, Australia and England are all tied on five points, with their net run rates putting New Zealand (+2.233) first, England (+0.547) second and Australia (-0.304) third. Sri Lanka trail them by only a point but their net run rate of -0.457 means they will need a mathematical miracle to reach the semis. If Ireland, with an NRR of -1.544 make it, well the tournament should be stopped right there because no team can achieve anything bigger than that.

T20 World Cup 2022 Live score: Hello and welcome!

New Zealand are practically one step away from the semi-finals but they know that victory is something they simply can't take for granted today. Ireland have been mighty impressive in this tournament and they will have enough motivation to go out with an almighty bang. The Kiwis have their fate in their own hands at the moment but that won't be the case if they lose. If that happens, they would have to hope that either England or Australia lose their respective final matches of the Super 12 stage as well at the very least.
