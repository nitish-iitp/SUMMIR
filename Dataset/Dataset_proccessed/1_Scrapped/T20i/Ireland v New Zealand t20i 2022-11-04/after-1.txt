Ireland's Joshua Little entered the history books with a stunning hat-trick against New Zealand on Friday in their Super 12s clash in Adelaide.

Little achieved the landmark in the 19th over as he picked up the wickets of Kane Williamson, Jimmy Neesham and Mitchell Santner to become the second Irish bowler after Curtis Campher to pick up a hat-trick in the tournament.

After having won the toss and elected to field first, the Irish bowlers started off brilliantly, containing Devon Conway and Finn Allen. However, Allen broke free and helped New Zealand score 52 runs by the end of the powerplay.

IRE VS NZ LIVE UPDATES

Once the opener fell, Ireland clawed their way back into the game and restricted Conway and Williamson. Once Conway departed in the 11th over, the Kiwis skipper put his foot on the gas and started to play some delightful strokes all over the ground.

Williamson scored a well-made 61 off 35 balls and threatened to take the game away from Ireland. However, Little had other plans in his mind.

The left-arm pacer started off the 19th over well and claimed the wicket of the New Zealand skipper on the second ball. Neesham was the next victim as Little trapped the all-rounder in front of the stumps. Neesham used a review but it didn't go in his favour.

Little then completed a memorable hat-trick by trapping Santner also in front of the stumps, much to the delight of his teammates and fans. New Zealand used a review but the decision wasn't overturned.

This was the sixth hat-trick in the history of T20 World Cups, with Brett Lee being the first bowler to reach the landmark in the inaugural edition of the tournament back in 2007.

T20 WORLD CUP LIVE COVERAGE

Little's hat-trick was the second of this year's edition of the World Cup as UAE's Karthik Meiyappan claimed a hat-trick against Sri Lanka during the qualifiers of the tournament.

The left-arm pacer was able to finish the over in fine fashion as he conceded just three runs in the over to ensure that New Zealand didn't finish off their innings with a flourish.

The Kiwis ended their innings with 185 on the board.
