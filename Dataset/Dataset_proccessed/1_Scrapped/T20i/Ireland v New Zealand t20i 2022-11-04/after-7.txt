Quite happy with what we achieved in T20 World Cup: Ireland captain Balbirnie
Ireland bowed out of the T20 World Cup 2022 but head home with pride
Ireland's tournament was capped by Josh Little's sparkling hat trick

Ireland captain Andrew Balbirnie was quite happy with what his side achieved in the T20 World Cup despite losing to New Zealand in their final Super 12 match in Adelaide on Friday. Ireland bowed out of the World Cup but head home with pride after a solid tournament capped by a sparkling hat trick to pacer Josh Little.

"We played a top-class team and when you play such teams, you need to capitalize on all the opportunities. We bowled well right through the tournament, the fielding was a bit off," Balbirnie said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

"(Coming to today) It was nice to set up a platform - that has been a trend in this tournament, but we needed someone to kick on from there.

New Zealand posted an imposing 185 for six after Ireland elected to field before restricting the Irish to 150 for nine. The win saw Kane Williamson's team cement the top spot in Group 1 with seven points and a huge run-rate advantage over second-placed England and third-placed Australia. New Zealand's semi-final berth will almost certainly be confirmed later on Friday with the result of the Australia-Afghanistan match at the same venue.

Balbirnie reserved special praise for his team's left-arm pacer Little, who dismissed captain Williamson for 61, then trapped both James Neesham and Mitchell Santner lbw for no score in the 19th over to bring up Ireland's second hat-trick in T20 internationals.

"We're quite happy with what we achieved (in the tournament), compared to where we were in the last 12 months, we have improved a lot, especially against good teams and we are looking forward to meeting these sides once again. (On Josh Little) He's a class operator and showed it today," Balbirnie added.
