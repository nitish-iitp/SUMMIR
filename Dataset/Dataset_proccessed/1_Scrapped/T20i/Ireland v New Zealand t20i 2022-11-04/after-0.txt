ICC T20 World Cup 2022: New Zealand Secure Semi Final Spot With Dominating Victory Over Ireland in Super 12 Encounter
It was a must win game for New Zealand to seal their spot in the semi-finals. Riding on Kane Williamson's bat and inspired performance from the bowling unit, New Zealand defeated Ireland by 35 runs and became the first team to enter semi finals in this T20 World Cup 2022.

After winning the toss and electing to field, Ireland displayed tight bowling performance initially. Kane Williamson, who looked in a really bad touch throughout the Super-12 stage, finally showed his class as his 35-ball 61 took New Zealand to a solid total of 185-6. Josh Little was the pick of the Ireland bowlers as he bagged a hat-trick while bowling in the death overs and also dismissed the dangerous looking Kane Williamson. Like the bowling, Ireland had a good start to the batting too as they cruised to 68-0 in 8 overs. Just when they were looking to step on the accelerator, wickets started to tumble, and the chase fell off the tracks. Mitchell Santner (2-26), Lockie Ferguson (3-22) and Tim Southee (2-29) chipped in wickets at regular interval. Ireland ended up with 150-9, handing New Zealand a big victory by 35 runs and a sure shot spot in the semi-finals.
