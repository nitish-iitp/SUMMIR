That's all from this game. But don't go anywhere as the crunch contest between Australia and Afghanistan is about to begin at 1.30 pm IST (8 am GMT). The latest news from the Australian camp is that Aaron Finch has been ruled out and Matthew Wade will be leading the Aussies. You can switch tabs and catch all the updates. Cheers!

!

Kane Williamson, the skipper of New Zealand, says that it was a really good team performance. Mentions that they knew Ireland are a good start and will come hard at them. He is happy with the way his team performed. Shares that the surface was on the slower side and feels that they batted well in the Powerplay which was the key. Kane is satisfied with the way they executed their plans.

!

Andy Balbirnie, the captain of Ireland,  says that they got a good start with the bat but failed to capitalize. Mentions that they dropped a few catches but overall, they had a good tournament. States that the trend has been to not go too hard at the start of the Powerplay and they did that part well but failed to carry on. Tells that they are playing better cricket than they were 12 months back and praises Josh Little for showing his class with the ball.

!

Player of the Match is Kane Williamson for his 35-ball 61. He starts by saying that the batters at the top provided them with a good start and they reached a competitive total. Praises the bowlers, especially the spinners. On his personal form, Kane replies that it's nice to get a bit of momentum and time a few balls. Calls it a team effort but at the same time, he praises Ireland for playing some good cricket.

!

Stay tuned for the presentation...

!

Earlier, the star of the first innings was Josh Little who stole the limelight with his hat-trick. His efforts stopped New Zealand from charging towards 200 but in the end, Ireland didn't show enough fight with the bat. Kane Williamson's arrival to form was a big boost for the Kiwis and they did most of the things right in this match.

!

It was a stiff target for Ireland but the way Paul Stirling and Andy Balbirnie approached, it made things look settled for them. They were cautious in the Powerplay overs and then pressed on the accelerator as soon as Mitchell Santner and Ish Sodhi were brought into the attack. Both the bowlers were put to the sword in their first over but then the pendulum swung. Santner bounced back and so did Sodhi. They combined forces to snap four wickets together and removed the cream of the Irish batting. Lockie Ferguson made sure there was no comeback from the lower-middle order by picking three wickets and altogether New Zealand registered a comfortable win.

!

An easy win in the end for the Black Caps and they have almost sealed their spot in the semi-finals. Ireland gave them a real scare with their opening stand but once both the openers were dismissed, the Irish team lost the plot. Quite convincing from New Zealand.
