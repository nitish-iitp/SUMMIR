That’s it from me. While we wait for a more considered take from Geoff Lemon in Bridgetown, here’s an initial match report. Thanks for your company, goodbye!

A word or two from loveable Mitch Marsh:

It was a pretty close one in the end, but good to get a win first up. Everyone’s going to have to play a little bit different this tournament I think… Davy delivered tonight.

On Stoinis:

It was pretty special from him, he took his time and then got going through the end of the innings.

On Starc limping off:

Just a cramp, we just took him off as a precaution but he says he’s fine.

Things may look a little different on these sort of wickets, but I think that’s exciting. We go on to England now and hopefully that’ll be a good game with a good crowd.”

Oman Captain – Aqib Ilyas: “Playing against a top side today was a great experience especially following on from the Super Over last game. Australia played really well but credit goes to our bowlers. They can do really well on turning tracks.”

They did indeed look a handful, if Stoinis’ edge had been snaffled by the keeper in the 14th over then it could well have been a different story. C’est la vie.

Australia go top of Group B with that win, they’ve got two points as have Namibia but at an inferior run rate. England and Scotland have one apiece and poor old Oman perhaps deserve to be on more than a rotund zero.

Marcus Stoinis is indeed Player of the Match:

He hit a 36-ball 67 and then followed up with figures of 3 for 19 with the ball:

It was a nice start, there were maybe a few cobwebs for us but we’re better for it and we got the win. I got to spend some time in the middle and have a bit of a bowl.”

On facing Oman’s bowling attack:

A couple were keeping low, a couple spinning and then not spinning. With the new ball the quicks looked tough as well.

On the 15th over that he blasted for 26 runs and turned the game:

Davey (Warner) and I spoke about targeting the first couple of balls of that next over and then you know, you get the first few away and you think to try and turn it into a big over.”

Australia win by 39 runs!

A decent test for Australia in the end, it was hard fought at times – especially in the first 12 overs of Oman’s bowling effort. Marcus Stoinis’ six hitting got them a decent score and despite some plucky batting throughout, Oman were never really in contention.

They think it’s all over…

06.17 CEST

19th over: Oman 109-7 Shakeel 3, Kaleemullah) The fiery Kaleemullah is the new batter. He picks up a couple of twos off Stoinis. One over left – snookers 44 needed for Oman.

WICKET! Mehran Khan c David b Stoinis 27 (Oman 117-8)

Excellent from Tim David on the boundary rope, nifty footwork and a razor sharp mind sees him pull off a juggling catch on both sides of the rope. Mehran’s entertaining innings comes to an end.

18th over: Oman 109-7 (M Khan 27, Shakeel 3) More humpty from Mehran Khan! Nathan Ellis is smashed over midwicket for SIX! 100 up for Oman. They’ve not fallen away too badly in the end, credit to them.

06.10 CEST

17th over: Oman 96-7 (M Khan 17, Shakeel 1) Hazlewood is pulled for four in some style by Mehran Khan and the big fast bowler responds by clonking him on the helmet with a short ball. A brief pause for a concussion check but we’re all good to continue.

Share

05.58 CEST

16th over: Oman 89-7 (M Khan 12, Shakeel 0) Zampa very nearly cleans Shakeel up with a beauty first ball, a spitting googly that narrowly misses the edge of the blade and the off peg. Lovely bowling.

WICKET! Ayaan Khan c Hazlewood b Zampa 36 (89-7)

Zampa is smeared for two huge sixes over the leg side fence by Ayaan Khan but gets his man at the last – a top edged sweep ends the entertaining cameo.

05.50 CEST

15th over: Oman 75-6 (A Khan 23, M Khan 11) Worrying times for Mitchell Starc and Australia as the bowler pulls up after his second delivery of the over and the stump mic picks up a load groan. Has he tweaked his calf? The physio team are out en masse to asses the damage. Surely they just take him off here, even if it turns out to be cramp? Yep, Starc is going off after taking on a few gulps of fluid which might suggest it is cramp but definitely one to keep an eye on. Glenn Maxwell is summoned to finish the over and there’s seven off it.

05.41 CEST

14th over: Oman 68-6 (A Khan 20, M Khan 9) Hazelwood returns. Hold up – Mehran Khan deposits him for a beautiful straight six down the ground! Stand and deliver!

05.38 CEST

13th over: Oman 57-6 (A Khan 17, M Khan) Mehran Khan is the new man. Oman giving up the ghost a little bit after such a promising start to this game.

05.36 CEST
WICKET! Shoaib Khan b Zampa 0 (Oman 57-6)

Another overturned decision… Zampa is certain he has his man caught behind and Umpire Wilson thinks so too but the DRS shows no edge. That’s out! Zampa yorks the advancing Shoaib two balls later and that’s his 300th T20 wicket.

Share
6 Jun 2024
05.29 CEST

12th over: Oman 56-5 (A Khan 17, S Khan 0) Is Starc on a hat-trick?! Ah. Nope. Ayaan Khan was given out on the field but the ball was sliding past the stumps on review. Shoaib Khan joins his namesake in the middle.

WICKET! Khalid Kail c Maxwell b Starc 8 (Oman 56-5)

Maxwell doesn’t drop those – an uppish drive is safely pouched at deep point.

Share
6 Jun 2024
05.26 CEST

11th over: Oman 54-4 (Kail 8, Khan 16) Zampa continues after drinks. I think I’m right in saying this is his first match in over three months. A few signs of rust perhaps as he’s worked away for a single off each ball. Six off the over. Oman need a lot and are running out of balls. (111 from 54 if you must know.)

Share
6 Jun 2024
05.23 CEST

10th over: Oman 48-4 (Kail 5, Khan 13) Nathan Ellis once again. He has a curious action – running in with the ball held aloft and clasped in both hands – as if he’s rushing to the vets with a broken winged chaffinch.

Shot! Ayaan Khan guides/edges a full ball through the vacant slip region for four and then follows up with a thunderous drive on the up through extra cover!

That’ll do the beleaguered chaffinch no good at all waitwhatamItalkingabout?

9th over: Oman 38-4 (Kail 4, Khan 4) Zampa goes for just three runs. This is all over bar the ELEVEN OVERS LEFT.

8th over: Oman 35-4 (Kail 4, Khan 1) Ayaan Khan joins Kail and gets off the mark with a drop and run into the off side. I thought it looked well judged but the replays show David Warner would have run out Kail with a direct hit. What do I know. Nuthin.

Here comes the trendily bespectacled Adam Zampa.

“Lynne – are those your mum’s cataract glasses?”

WICKET! Maqsood c Wade b Stoinis 1 (Oman 34-4)

I reckon Marcus Stoinis has got the player of the match award in the bag. Just an inkling.

05.03 CEST

7th over: Oman 34-3 (Maqsood 1, Kail 4) Maxwell drops short and is swivelled away to the fence by Kail. Just five off the over though, Oman need a whole lot more.

Share
6 Jun 2024
05.02 CEST

6th over: Oman 29-3 (Maqsood 0) Khalid Kail is the new batter. Glenn Maxwell is being summoned, it’ll be the first look at spin in the innings for Oman.

04.59 CEST
WICKET! Aqib Ilyas c Wade b Stoinis 18 (Oman 29-3)

Marcus Stoinis - chest like a Smeg freezer – is coming on to bowl. I’d venture he knows his way around a bench press. Three dots and then… have it! Aqib deposits a pull shot into the hot tub on the other side of the boundary for SIX.

Gone! Stoinis has the last laugh though, nicking off Aqib with the final ball of the over, Matthew Wade taking a nifty catch behind the stumps.

6 Jun 2024
04.55 CEST

5th over: Oman 23-2 (Ilyas 11, Maqsood 0) Zeeshan Maqsood is the new batter and he blocks out his first ball to end the over.

WICKET! Kashyap Prajapati lbw b Ellis 7 (Oman 23-2)

Nathan Ellis replaces Starc. He’s mixing up 140KPH zingers with deceptive slower balls. A quicker one slides into the pads and is given out! The review confirms it was knocking out leg stump. Oman lose their second.

Uganda win their first World Cup game!

Uganda have won their first game at a World Cup. Strolling to 78 with only the seven nervy wickets and 18.2 mad overs.

They were embarrassed in that first game. They won their second. They have given us quite the ride already. Job done.

If you missed it – Taha Hashim did a great piece on the Uganda team a few days ago.

4th over: Oman 22-1 (Prajapati 7, Ilyas 11) Hazelwood is miserly, just two singles eked from his second over.

04.45 CEST

3rd over: Oman 20-1 (Prajapati 6, Ilyas 11) Starc for another, he’s a smidge full and Ilyas drives him down the ground for four. A leg bye and a wide gift a couple of runs and there’s nearly a run out off the final ball but Travis Head threw to the wrong end and the chance went begging.

2nd over: Oman 14-1 (Prajapati 6, Ilyas 6) Josh Hazlewood from the opposite end and he does what he does – landing it on a handkerchief outside off and wobbling it both ways. Just two singles off the over.

1st over: Oman 12-1 (Prajapati 5, Ilyas 5) It all started so well for Oman with Prajapati driving the first ball from Starc square of the wicket for a beautiful four. A golden duck for Athavale brings Captain Aqib Ilyas to the middle, he bagged a gilded quacker in the first game courtesy of the fantastically named Ruben Trumplemann.

Close! Ilyas drives a full toss in the air that narrowly avoids the ring but lands safe and goes for four. Another wicket for Starc? Ilyas is given out LBW on the field but this looks very leg side-ish to me… Oman review and sure enough the ball pitched outside leg stump and was missing. A poor decision from the umpire. Eventful first over.

Starc pins Athavale LBW with an inswinging yorker!
