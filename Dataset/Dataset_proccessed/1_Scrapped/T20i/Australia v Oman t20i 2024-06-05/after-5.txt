Australia vs Oman - Stoinis stars for Australia after early wobble

Australia's campaign - and bid for titles across all three formats - was underway with what is ultimately a comfortable victory.

When Glenn Maxwell fell for a golden duck, continuing his horror run with the bat, they were 50 for 3 and thoughts briefly turned to what could unfold but Marcus Stoinis and David Warner added 102 off 64 balls to ensure Australia did not stumble early.

Stoinis was dropped on 9 then bludgeoned six sixes in his innings as he turned around a sluggish start with Oman’s bowlers keeping pressure on their big-name opponents for 14 overs. It was hard work for Warner, who became Australia’s leading run-scorer in men’s T20Is, but he used his experience to not throw the innings away.

Australia were then largely efficient with the ball as Mitchell Starc struck in the opening over with a toe-crushing yorker – although he was later unable to complete his spell as he left the field but it was confirmed as cramp - and Stoinis’ fine day continue as he added three wickets. Nathan Ellis, who had been selected ahead of the rested Pat Cummins, struck in his first over to claim a maiden World Cup wicket.

It might just be cramp, but it could be a concern for Australia. Mitchell Starc had to leave the field after one ball (a wide) at the start of his fourth over

From the moment he was given a life on 9 - and another near-miss on 13 - Marcus Stoinis hasn't put a foot wrong. He has now added two wickets in his first two overs to the vital runs, finding bounce and movement out of the pitch, as things start to look comfortable for Australia

Ellis strike in his first

Nathan Ellis' selection over Pat Cummins created some chatter, although it was largely to give the Test and ODI captain a few extra days rest/preparation. However, Ellis is worthy of consideration as a first-choice pick anyway and it will be interesting to see how he is used during the tournament on a slower, tricky pitches that could suit him. Here he removed Kashyap Prajapati in his first over when opener swung across the line, although it was only just clipping leg stump

Strong finish from Australia

It was tough early on, and at 50 for 3 Australia were under pressure, but they have played very well in the second half of the innings to make 108 runs off the latter 10 overs. That was led by Marcus Stoinis with David Warner working hard for his fifty then Tim David added a few boundaries late on. The total of 164 feels very good on a tricky surface and you will back Australia to defend it. But Oman certainly had their moments.

'A natural winner'

Ricky Ponting talked up the value of David Warner yesterday and his experience has come to the fore in tricky conditions with a 46-ball half-century while Stoinis has provided the power. Warner hasn't found it easy going but hasn't given it away, although there may be a debate about the deliveries he has eaten up with Tim David in the sheds.

Marcus Stoinis making the most of a life when he was dropped by the keeper off an edge against Aqib Ilyas. He's cleared the rope four times in an over to bring some life to the innings.

From Sampath: Stoinis is only the second Australia batter to hit four sixes in a over at the men's T20 World Cup, after David Hussey off Mohammad Sami in 2010

Here's Mel Farrell from Barbados

Reputation, shreputation. Oman’s players have cared not a jot for Australia’s status. Sure, the pitch may be tricky but that should take nothing away from Oman’s bowling attack, which has teased and probed. Nor should it overshadow Prathik Athavale’s constant pressure behind the stumps. And conditions have naught to do with the gusto of their fielding. When Aqib Ilyas, fielding at cover, hurled his body at a Mitch Marsh drive to save a certain four, Ayaan Khan ran all the way in from the boundary rope for a high five. But it was just a taster. Glenn Maxwell made the mistake of testing the skipper when he drove his first ball from Mehran Khan hard to Aqib’s left. Was the full stretch diving catch a blinder, a screamer, a pearler, an abso-freaking-lute cracker? Pick your superlative. It was stupendous.

What a moment (or two of them) for Oman. Mehran Khan has given himself a memory for a lifetime by claiming Mitchell Marsh and Glenn Maxwell in consecutive balls. Maxwell's wicket came courtesy of a wonderful catch at cover by captain Aqib Ilyas who had talked a good game yesterday. He said his players could be heroes. His catch is one worth framing. For Maxwell, it continues his horror run with the bat after a miserable IPL. Marcus Stoinis survived the hat-trick ball. Is something special brewing?

Record for Warner

David Warner has ticked off a record as his international career begins its final stage by becoming Australia's leading men's run-scorer in T20Is, overtaking former captain Aaron Finch. Moments before, he survived a close stumping appeal as he just managed to keep his toe ground behind the line

Australia's powerplay

Oman have kept a pretty tight leash on Australia during the fielding restrictions although David Warner and Mitchell Marsh have found the boundary towards the end of the six overs to release some of the pressure. The signs are that this pitch will not be easy for free-scoring.

Early blow for Oman!

Australia have not had it all their own way in the opening exchanges. There has been some early nibble with the new ball for Oman and Travis Head has picked out mid-off with a lofted drive against Bilal Khan which will be a huge boost for the experienced left-arm quick after the expensive Super Over against Namibia.

Some Ellis numbers

Nathan Ellis has rarely not performed for Australia when given the chance. A quirky stat is that only one of his international appearances have come at home. Here's some numbers to show how well he has performed in all T20 since 2020.

Ellis over Cummins!

It's perhaps too strong to call it a shock, but Australia have pulled their first notable selection of the tournament by opting for Nathan Ellis ahead of Pat Cummins. He warmed up as normal, so there's no injury issue. Likely a case of managing him after the IPL, although Ellis does have a strong case for selection. Ashton Agar isn't in the XI, so it's the three-quick balance for them. On Around The Wicket last week, Tim Paine said that Ellis should be in the first-choice XI. Oman have won the toss and will bowl

Australia: 1 David Warner, 2 Travis Head, 3 Mitchell Marsh (capt), 4 Glenn Maxwell, 5 Marcus Stoinis, 6 Tim David, 7 Matthew Wade (wk), 8 Nathan Ellis, 9 Mitchell Starc, 10 Adam Zampa, 11 Josh Hazlewood

Oman: 1 Kashyap Prajapati, 2 Pratik Athavale (wk), 3 Aqib llyas (capt), 4 Zeesham Maqsood, 5 Khalid Kail, 6 Ayaan Khan, 7 Shoaib Khan, 8 Mehran Khan, 9 Shakeel Ahmed, 10 Kaleemullah, 11 Bilal Khan

Mitch Marsh's journey to the captaincy
Captain Marsh•Cricket Australia

It's been a notable 12 months for Mitchell Marsh and now he is leading Australia at this World Cup. Captaincy has always been in his blood, but for a while his career path suggested it wouldn't happen at the top level.

Ahead of the tournament, Alex Malcolm traced the latest chapter of the Marsh comeback story.

The relationship of Cummins and Marsh as Australia's two modern leaders is at the heart how the current Australian team functions.


The pair have a friendship that dates back to their ODI debut together as teenagers in 2011. They spent time together during Cummins' brief spell at Perth Scorchers as he was working his way through his back injuries. They rode the bench together in the 2015 World Cup.


Those within the Australian team will tell you that they share the same values towards cricket and life despite being slightly different characters. They play cricket for fun. It is their profession, and a handsomely paid one at that. They are both incredibly good at it, but it doesn't define them.

Australia get going

It's time for another of the powerhouse teams to get their T20 World Cup campaign underway with Australia starting against Oman. Led by Mitchell Marsh, they have a chance to hold silverware across all three formats following last year's World Test Championship and ODI successes. It would be quite the haul.

There have been some challenges to their build-up with players arriving later after the IPL, but they have a very strong-looking squad with plenty of options.

For Oman, this is their second game of the tournament after their Super Over defeat against Namibia. Their captain, Aqib Ilyas, was in excellent form at his pre-match press conference.
