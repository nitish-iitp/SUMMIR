JUNE 06, 2024 09:44

OMA 125/9 in 20 overs

Ellis to bowl the last over. Kaleemullah is late on his swipe, falls just past Marcus Stoinis at third man. WICKET!! Ellis goes short, Shakeel cuts it through point where Warner takes a comfortable catch.

Shakeel Ahmed c Warner b Nathan Ellis 11(10)

Bilal is the last man in. Attempts a big slog first ball but misses. Yorker length, driven to long on for a single. Kaleemullah survives the last ball. Australia beats Oman by 39 runs.

JUNE 06, 2024 09:35
OMA 121/8 in 19 overs

Stoinis returns. Shakeel gets a couple after pushing one to deep square. Four!! Short and wide, carved away for four through square third. WICKET!! Attempted yorker goes awry but not enough contact and Tim David does well in the boundary to keep the ball within bounds. 

Mehran Khan c Tim David b Stoinis 27(16)
Another low full toss that is mistimed, falls in the gap at midwicket. Mistimed again, Mitch Marsh cannot reach it running backwards.


JUNE 06, 2024 09:30
OMA 109/7 in 18 overs

Nathan Ellis into the attack. Two singles down the ground off the first two balls. Mehran lofts one down the ground, no timing at all, will get only a single. 100 up for Oman with a single to long on. SIX!! Length ball outside off, Mehran picks it up and deposits over midwicket for six.

Ayaan Khan c Hazlewood b Zampa 36(30)

JUNE 06, 2024 09:10
OMA 75/6 in 15 overs

Starc from the other end. Looks like he’s done some damage to his calf. He’s down stretching his legs at the moment. Looks like he’s going off.

Maxwell to complete the over. Maxwell fires one down leg, Wade takes the bails off in a flash. Umpire sends it upstairs. Looks like he has grounded it just in the nick of time. Nine runs from the over. 

JUNE 06, 2024 09:06
OMA 68/6 in 14 overs

Hazlewood back into the attack. Short ball, Mehran crunches the pull to deep square to get off the mark. In the air, but past the infield, falls in no man’s land and the batters get a couple. Six!! Length ball, lofted straight down the ground for six. 

JUNE 06, 2024 09:00
W
OMA 57/6 in 13 overs

Zampa returns. Appeals for lbw but looks like it was sliding down leg. Full again, slog swept to deep mid for a single. Shoaib looks to flick one to the leg side, takes the edge and Wade completes the catch. Batter opts for review again. He survives again!! WICKET!! No need of a review there, a fast ball at yorker length, cleans up Shoaib. 

Shoaib Khan b Zampa 0(4)

JUNE 06, 2024 08:56

JUNE 06, 2024 08:49
OMA 54/4 in 11 overs

Zampa continues. Kail brings out the sweep to get a single. In the blockhole, Kail paddles it to deep fine for one. Six singles from the over. 

JUNE 06, 2024 08:46
OMA 48/4 in 10 overs

Ellis returns and he beats Ayaan Khan’s outside edge from around the wicket. Another one outside off. This time Ayaan manages a thick outside edge and it runs away for a four. Full outside off and Ayaan drives it on the up. Another four.

Zeeshan Maqsood c †Wade b Stoinis 1 (7b 0x4 0x6)

OMA 35/4 in 8 overs

JUNE 06, 2024 08:32
OMA 34/3 in 7 overs

Spin on for Australia. Maxwell with his off spin. Slower one and it spins in. Khalid plays it off the back foot and splices it past short third. FOUR!!! Just a single other than that. 

JUNE 06, 2024 08:25
W
Aqib departs!

Marcus Stoinis gets a crack in the PowerPlay. Three dot balls and Aqib Ilyas has had enough. Steps across the stumps and whacks it away for a six. Almost lands in the on-ground pool. 

But Stoinis has the last laugh. Keeps it in the channel and Aqib edges it for Wade to take a good catch. 

Aqib Ilyas c †Wade b Stoinis 18 (18b 2x4 1x6)

OMA 29/3 in 6 overs

JUNE 06, 2024 08:18

Ellis strikes!

Nathan Ellis replaces Starc. Starts with a back-of-the-hand slower ball. Diverted for a single by Aqib. Holds Kashyap down to three dots with a variety of slow balls. 

Now Ellis fires a quicker one in. Full and hits Kashyap plumb on the pad. Oman reviews unsuccessfully.

JUNE 06, 2024 08:08
OMA 20/1 in 3 overs

Starc continues, as expected. A leg bye brings Aqib back on strike. Scything inswinger from Starc. Aqib does well to jam his bat under it. Low full toss and Aqib goes after it. Good stop by Warner. Fuller one now. Easy straight drive for four from Aqib. 

Comedy of errors. Aqib dabs one off his pads and sets off for a non existent run. Head has all the time in the world to hit the stumps with Aqib in a different postal code. Head somehow gets his head mixed up and misses the stump and the keeper. By the time Maxwell gets the stumps down, Aqib makes his way back. 

JUNE 06, 2024 08:04
AUS 14/1 in 2 overs

Hazlewood from the other end. Aqib nudges one to deep third to get off strike. Sharp line and length from Hazlewood. No room for error for the Oman batters. Just two singles from the over.

OMA 12/1 in 1 over

Low full toss from Starc and Aqib Ilyas slices it just past the cover fielder. FOUR!! Wide now from Starc. The left-arm pacer brings the line in now. Hits Aqib square on the front pad. Given out by the umpire and Oman takes a review. Pitching outside leg and Aqib survives. Eventful first over. 

JUNE 06, 2024 07:55
W
Starc strikes early!

Elegant shot from Kashyap Prajapathi to start with. Full from Starc and it is square driven for a four. A leg side wide next up and then a single. Starc with a booming inswinger against Athavale. Australia thinks it is pad first. Review taken. Pad first it is. Three reds. Golden duck for Athavale.

Pratik Athavale lbw b Starc 0 (1b 0x4 0x6)

JUNE 06, 2024 07:39
W
AUS 164/5 in 20 overs

Bilal to finish the innings. Full slower ball, driven to long on. Dropped!! David looks to go down the ground, doesn’t get the connection but long off makes a mess of it. Full on the stumps, lofted to deep midwicket, goes to the fielder on the bounce. Four!! Slower length ball, David waits for it and turns it through fine leg for a boundary. WICKET!! David is runout looking for a second run. Good over from Bilal. Australia finishes on 164/5.

AUS 130/3 in 17 overs

Bilal back into the attack. Four!! Full toss outside off, Stoinis moves across and gets it in the gap through square leg for a boundary. Warner looks for another reverse hit, misses the swipe, the keeper does well to dive and prevent four byes. Slower short ball, Warner mistimes the pull to long on for a single. Six!! Waist high full toss and dispatched over midwicket for six. Stoinis brings up his fifty in just 27 balls.

JUNE 06, 2024 07:14
AUS 114/3 in 16 overs

Shakeel back into the attack. Starts with a front foot no ball. Stoinis doesn’t get the required contact, just a single to long on. Full and wide, Warner gets a single to deep cover.

Mehran returns to complete his spell. Stoinis gets a top edge on his shot but it falls safely in front of the offside sweeper.

More control this time, lofted over long on for a big six. Six!! Third six off the over, Australia get the much needed impetus it was looking for. Six!! Make that four sixes. 26 runs from the over. 

JUNE 06, 2024 07:05

Slightly overpitched and wide, driven through covers for the second four of the over. 

JUNE 06, 2024 06:57
AUS 63/3 in 12 overs

Aqib Ilyas back into the attack. Googly outside off, driven to long off for a single by Stoinis. Warner gets a single off the next ball. Stoinis beaten on the outside edge by a slow looping leggie. Googly to finish the over, just the three runs from it. 

JUNE 06, 2024 06:54
AUS 60/3 in 11 overs

Mehran returns. Stoinis mistimes his waft outside offstump, drives the next one to long off for a single. Appeals for lbw as Warner misses his attempted reverse scoop. Looks like it was off the bat. Four from the over.

JUNE 06, 2024 06:47

Stunning catch!

Aqib Ilyas with what could be the catch of the tournament. Maxwell nails an uppish cover drive. Ilyas is in no mind to let it go past him as he puts in a full-length dive to his left to get both his hands on it.

JUNE 06, 2024 06:37
AUS 50/1 in 8 overs

JUNE 06, 2024 06:31
AUS 43/1 in 7 overs

Mehran Khan gets his first over of the day. The right-arm medium pacer begins with two dots, partly thanks to some good fielding and at short extra cover by Aqib Ilyas. Marsh squeezes the next one to deep fine to get off strike. Oh wait. The siren goes off and it is a no ball. Free hit for Warner. Low full toss and lobbed away for a four over covers. Mehran entices Warner with a fuller one, which moves away just enough to beat the batter. Sharp stumping from Athavale, but Warner never left the crease. 

JUNE 06, 2024 06:27
