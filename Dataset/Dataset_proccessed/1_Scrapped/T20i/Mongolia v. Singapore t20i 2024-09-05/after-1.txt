10 Overs, 10 Runs, 10 Wickets | Records Aplenty As Singapore Beat Mongolia In A T20I With 115 Balls Remaining
Singapore Beat Mongolia, T20 World Cup 2024 Asia Qualifier: The scorecard from the T20I has gone viral on social media.

Plenty of records were broken during Singapore vs Mongolia T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier 2024.

A record-breaking T20I was played betweeen Singapore and Mongolia in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier A in Bangi in Malaysia on Thursday (September 5). Plenty of records were shattered in this fixture as Singapore won the toss and chose to field first. However, it was a dismal batting performance from Mongolia who were bowled out for 10 runs in 10 overs.

Historic Low in T20I Cricket 🚨

Mongolia 🇲🇳 has equaled the record for the lowest total in men's T20I history, scoring just 10 runs against Singapore 🇸🇬 in the 2026 T20 World Cup qualifier.

Singapore's Harsha Bharadwaj was the pick of the bowlers for the team, scalping 6 wickets for 3 runs in his 4 overs. 2 overs of his 4-over spell were maidens while he conceded only 3 runs overall. None of the Mongolia batters could breach the double-digit mark with 2 being the highest individual score at which two Mongolia batters were tied. 2 was precisely the number of extras that Singapore bowlers gave away while 5 Mongolian batters were dismissed for ducks.

Singapore Chase Down The Target In 5 Balls

It was all too easy for Singapore who chased the target of 11 runs within the first over itself. It only took them 5 balls to finish off the match with William Simpson scoring a boundary and Raoul Sharma smashing a six. However, perhaps Mongolia's only major positve from the match was when they managed to dismiss Manpreet Singh on the very first ball of Singapore's run-chase with Enkhbat Batkhuyag getting the wicket.

However, that hardly made any difference in the eventual result as Singapore beat Malaysia by 9 wickets and 115 balls remaining. Harsha Bharadwaj was adjudged the Player Of The Match but Akshay Puri (2 for 4), Rahul Sheshadri (1 for 1) also deserve credit.
