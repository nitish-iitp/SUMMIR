Mongolia equalled the record for the lowest team score in the history of men’s T20Is when they were skittled for a mere 10 runs against Singapore during a ICC T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier A 2024 match in Bangi (Malaysia) on Thursday.

After being put in to bat first at the YSD-UKM Cricket Oval, Mongolian innings lasted an exact 10 overs with 17-year-old legspinner Harsha Bharadwaj taking 6/3 in four overs. As many as five batters registered ducks and none scored more than 2 runs.

The batting collapse kickstarted from the first ball itself when Mohan Vivekanandan fell to Bharadwaj for a golden duck. In the same over, no. 3 batter Davaasuren Jamyansuren was sent back for a three-ball duck.

Besides Bharadwaj, Akshay Puri (2/4) chipped in with a couple of wickets while Rahul Sheshadri and Ramesh Kalimuthu took a wicket each.

Chasing 11 runs, Singapore’s innings also began on a poor note with their captain Manpreet Singh falling for a first-ball duck. However, Raoul Sharma (7*)  and William Simpson (6*) didn’t wait long to chase down the total as Singapore overhauled the target in five deliveries for a nine-wicket win.

Rank	Team	Total	Overs	Innings 	Opposition
1	Mongolia	10	10	1	Singapore
2	Isle of Man	10	8.4	1	Spain
3	Mongolia	12	8.2	2	Japan
4	Mongolia	17	14.2	1	Hong Kong
5	Turkey	21	8.3	2	Czech Republic

10	China	26	10.5	1	Thailand

Top-10 lowest team total in Men’s T20I History (Till September 5, 2024)

Mongolia now jointly hold the record for the lowest T20I team total alongside Isle of Man. Playing against Spain in February 2023, Isle of Man were shot out for 10 runs in 8.4 overs with a whopping seven players failing to score a single run.

Joseph Burrows was the top-scorer with four runs while Mohammad Kamran (4/4) and Atif Mehmood (4/6) shared eight wickets between them and Lorne Burns took two. Spain completed the formality in mere two deliveries with opener Awais Ahmed hitting two sixes.
