Mongolia men's cricket team are back in the news this time for another unwanted record. In the T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier A in Bangi, they were facing Singapore. In a huge surprise, Mongolia could score just 10 runs in their innings.

It was an embarrassing day for the Mongolian cricket team as their batters just could not get going on the day. The highest score recorded by their batters was just 2 runs by wicketkeeper Gandemberel Ganbold and Zoljavkhlan Shurentsetseg.

Mongolia dismissed for the joint-lowest total in men's T20I history

Mongolia's score of 10 runs is the joint-lowest total in a men's T20. Their score read 10-10 in 10 overs at the end of their innings. Previously, the Isle of Man had also recorded 10 runs in 8.4 overs against Spain last year. Mongolia also have three out of four lowest totals in men's T20Is and all of these totals have been recorded in 2024.

Singapore's 17-year-old legspinner Harsha Bhardwaj starred with 6-3 in four overs which left Mongolia in dire straits. Harsha picked up a couple of wickets in the opening over of the match. He went on to take five of the six wickets Mongolia lost in the powerplay. Mongolia played exactly 10 overs and five of their batters recorded ducks.

Meanwhile, chasing just 11 runs to win, Singapore chased down the target in the first over itself after losing the wicket of captain Manpreet Singh in the first ball of the innings. Raoul Sharma hit a six off his first ball after coming in to bat at No. 3. Other opener William Simpson hit the winning runs with a four off the fifth ball of the opening over.

Mongolia's 10 runs in 10 overs is also the lowest run rate ever recorded in men's T20Is. They now have four out of five scores of the lowest run rates recorded in a men's T20 innings.

With this defeat, Mongolia remain at the bottom of the points table, having lost all four matches they have played so far. As expected, they have the worst run rate among all the teams which stands at -7.051. Their remaining matches will be against Maldives and Malaysia.

Apart from these records, Mongolia have another unwanted record to their name. Last year, they conceded 314-3 in the Asian Games against Nepal. This is the highest total in overall T20 cricket to date. Mongolia were all out for just 41 runs in this match, thus giving Nepal a massive victory by 273 runs. This is the highest margin of defeat in T20 cricket.
