Mongolia were all out for a total of 10 during their T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier A match against Singapore in Bangi. 

Mongolia were skittled out for 10 against Singapore, thanks to 17-year-old wrist-spinner Harsha Bharadwaj, who took six wickets for just three runs. As a result, they recorded the joint-lowest score in men’s T20Is, matching the Isle of Man’s total during their tour to Spain last year.

In response, Singapore gunned down the target in five balls after losing a wicket off the first. Mongolia are now reeling at the bottom of the table with four consecutive defeats.

Bharadwaj’s 6-3 in four overs is second-best figures in the format. He surpassed Nigeria’s Peter Aho’s 6-5 against Sierra Leone in 2021. The list is headed by Malaysian Right-arm pacer Syazrul Idrus, who took 7-8 against China in the 2024 T20 World Cup Asia B Qualifier.

Bowling in the match, Bharadwaj removed Mohan Vivekanandan and Davaasuren Jamiyansuren for ducks in his first over. He was instrumental in eliminating five out of six batters Mongolia lost in the powerplay.

Mongolia set another unwanted record

Mongolia’s scorecard was full of binary digits, with as many as five batters failing to trouble the scorers, while four scoring ones and a couple of them doubles. Overall, eight came off the bat and two in extras. They now have the unwanted record of owning three out of the top four lowest-totals in men’s T20Is, all coming this year.

You can check the live score of the match here.

During the chase, Raoul Sharma parked the ball over the boundary off the first ball before William Simpson got Singapore over the line with a four of the penultimate ball of the first over. The match only lasted 65 balls.
