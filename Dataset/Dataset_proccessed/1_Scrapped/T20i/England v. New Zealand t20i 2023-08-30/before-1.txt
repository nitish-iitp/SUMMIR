I hope CWI sees this.

The world has become an increasingly difficult and different place for many.

This is akin to folks seeking visas to anywhere that's willing to have them!

RTN and Akeal are the only two retained.

Nope he can't.
He couldn't even wait until Bim players abandon West Indies cricket selection to play franchise cricket. But that is our musician for you

In reply to Baje



wait until Bim players abandon West Indies cricket selection

Like when Bim players got selected for a tour of Pakistan after Pakistan was isolated from cricket and refused to play bawling bout safety concerns?

Like when Jason Holder now simply doesn’t play against Bangladesh, either home or away?

Or when Brooks, Roston Chase dem tell the selectors they not “available” to play against Bangladesh after the tour of New Zealand due to Covid “fatigue”?

Always answer the call? Pure fiction that.

The pioneers have led the way to financial independence in WI cricket. They have been lambasted mercilessly on this board. The light has been shone to guide others, best of luck to them all. In the future we will be discussing the leadership shown by the pioneers in the face of adversity.

That must be a typo.

Those guys only withdraw from WI team……not franchises.

The author of the article must be dyslexic

Maybe Sarge wrote the article for him, at a cost
