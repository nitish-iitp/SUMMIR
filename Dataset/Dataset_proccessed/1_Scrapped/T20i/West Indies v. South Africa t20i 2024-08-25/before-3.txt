The upcoming two-match Test series between Pakistan and Bangladesh in Rawalpindi is set to be a crucial fixture for both teams in the ongoing ICC World Test Championship 2023-25 cycle. Pakistan, currently ranked sixth with a points percentage of 36.7, will be looking to improve their standing after a challenging series in Australia. On the other hand, Bangladesh, ranked eighth with just one win, will be eager to make a mark.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has moved both Tests to Rawalpindi due to ongoing renovations at Karachi's National Bank Stadium, a key venue for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. This decision was taken to avoid disruptions and health risks related to construction activities.

Pakistan's squad for the series, led by Shan Masood, includes a mix of experienced players and emerging talents. The team will feature key players like Babar Azam, Shaheen Afridi, and Mohammad Rizwan, with a strong bowling attack headlined by Naseem Shah.

This series presents an important opportunity for both teams to gain momentum in the World Test Championship and refine their strategies for future matches.

Pakistan squad for Bangladesh Test series: Shan Masood (c), Saud Shakeel (vc), Abdullah Shafique, Babar Azam, Khurram Shahzad, Mir Hamza, Mohammad Ali, Mohammad Huraira, Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Sarfaraz Ahmed (wk), Shaheen Afridi
