West Indies vs South Africa 2nd T20I Highlights: West Indies smashed 13 sixes in its innings to beat South Africa by 30 runs on Sunday and secure the Twenty20 international series with a game to spare.

West Indies scored 179-6 after being asked to bat first in the second T20, accelerating from 111-4 after 14 overs. Shai Hope hit a 22-ball 41 with two fours and four sixes. Captain Rovman Powell contributed 35 runs, also in 22 balls, with three sixes.

South Africa was all out for 149 with two balls remaining despite a strong start of 57-0 after just four overs. But the chase faltered and, at 138-6, South Africa needed 42 runs off the last four overs. Opener Reeza Hendricks top-scored with an 18-ball 44 which included two of his team’s six sixes before he was bowled by Romario Shepherd, who took 3-15 in four overs. Shamar Joseph returned 3-31.

West Indies was unchanged from the team that also hit 13 sixes to win the opening T20 by seven wickets at the same ground last Friday. South Africa replaced fast medium left-armer Nandre Burger with Lizaad Williams, who took 3-36.

The series-concluding T20 is on Tuesday, also at Tarouba.

South Africa prevailed in the preceding two-match test series against West Indies, winning the second test at Providence, Guyana, after a rain-hit drawn opener at Port of Spain, Trinidad.

… THE RUN CHASE …

Right then, South Africa need 180 runs to win and their challenge will be to dominate the powerplay which they have struggled to do so recently.

Lizaad Williams is down for a quick chat. He says that personally he summed the conditions up quickly and was trying to break the momentum of the swing. Adds that he has played just a handful of games and wants to make the most of the opportunity. Mentions that the celebration comes from Lebron James who is his idol and plays in the NBA (basketball league). Adds that limiting damage in the Powerplay and taking the game deep should be the way their batters should go.

The bowlers adapted by mixing up their speeds, with Kruger finally cracking the code. This strategic shift swung the momentum back to the Proteas, triggering a cascade of four swift dismissals. Kruger’s impressive spell was instrumental in stemming the run flow, while Lizaad Williams delivered a stellar performance, executing his role flawlessly and claiming a spectacular three-wicket haul.

South Africa’s decision to bowl first likely considered the potential dew factor under lights. Although they initially struggled to contain the West Indian batters, Lizaad Williams managed to get that breakthrough. The new ball although skidded through and curved back and forth but the success rate was minimal for the Proteas which reflected the lack of experience in the bowling. As a result, Markram had to keep rotating the bowlers to unsettle the batters.

The hosts hit a rough patch, slipping from a comfortable 83/1 to a precarious 108/4, with even the typically explosive Pooran unable to spark. This stumble halted their momentum, challenging the middle order to steady the ship and show their mettle. Rising to the occasion, Rutherford and Powell dug deep, crafting a tenacious 47-run partnership for the fifth wicket. Rutherford’s quickfire 29 and Powell’s measured 35 proved crucial, propelling the Windies to a competitive total of 179.

The West Indies openers started strongly yet again, with Athanaze taking an aggressive approach while Hope played a supporting role, maintaining a steady run rate. Athanaze, continuing his good form, capitalized on the fielding restrictions but unfortunately couldn’t convert his promising start into a substantial innings. With the batting conditions really dear for the batters, Shai Hope adjusted as the aggressor and counterpunched to prevent pressure from creeping in. Hope’s fireworks laid a solid foundation before he fell, seemingly setting the stage for a batting feast.

West Indies finish on a high by snagging 15 off the final over of the first innings and just about managed to post a challenging total on a decent batting track. South Africa on the other hand, came out a bit improved with the ball in pockets but might feel that they gave away some extra runs in the death overs.
