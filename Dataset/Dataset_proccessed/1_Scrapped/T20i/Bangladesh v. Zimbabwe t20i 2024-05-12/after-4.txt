Stay tuned for the presentation...
Earlier in the game, Bangladesh were off to a sloppy start with a couple of wicket maidens and the side being pinned back after being 3 down for just 15. Mahmudullah and Najmul Hossain Shanto played well to negate the threat of a below-par total on board. Shakib Al Hasan played a good hand as well but it was a quick-fire cameo from Jaker Ali that helped the side get past 150. Bowling from Zimbabwe was top-notch for the majority of the game with Blessing Muzarabani and Brian Bennett being the best bowlers by picking up a couple each.
Bowling from Bangladesh wasn't good as the bowlers leaked runs all around the park. The track got better to bat on as the game progressed and the bowlers had no assistance from the surface. Shakib Al Hasan and Mohammad Saifuddin took a wicket each and nothing more happened in favor of them. Bangladesh will be happy with the overall result of the series but will need to address a few areas before flying for the mega event.
Chasing down a tricky total on this track, Zimbabwe were off to a flying start thanks to a brilliant display of counterattack by Brian Bennett. Tadiwanashe Marumani struggled to even rotate the strike and eventually fell on 1. The side scored 41 in the powerplay out of which 37 were scored by Brian Bennett. Sikandar Raza took his time in the beginning and then exploded on the Bangladesh bowlers. Brian Bennett and Sikandar Raza added a crucial 75 for the second wicket. After the dismissal of Brian Bennett it was Raza along with Johnathan Campbell, finishing the game with a partnership of 45 in just 20 deliveries. Brian Bennett played a solid knock of 70. Sikandar Raza played a captain's knock and was unbeaten on 72 despite not being fully fit physically. Zimbabwe will be pleased to end the tour on a high.
Zimbabwe finally shows up and wins this game by 8 wickets and stops Bangladesh from inflicting a series sweep on them.
