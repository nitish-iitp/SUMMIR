Match 10 : Kenya v Uganda | Squads | Players to watch | Fantasy Playing XI | Live streaming

Uganda are riding high on their spirits as they are comfortably placed at the number one spot on the points table. While Kenya are still looking to get into match-day rhythm whilst they are placed in the bottom half of the table.

Squads:

Kenya – Esther Wachira (C), Melvin Khagoitsa (VC), Queentor Abel, Judith Ajiambo, Lavendah Idambo, Marion Juma, Charity Muthoni (WK), Mary Mwangi, Lynz Nabwire, Monicah Ndhambi, Flavia Odhiambo, Kelvia Ogola, Venasa Ooko, Ann Wanjira.

Players to watch out:
Venasa Ooko

25-year-old batter, Ooko has an improving average on the international stage. Recently her top knock of 57*(55) came against Rwanda which tells volumes about her skillset. The right-handed batter is yet to bring her ‘A’ game as she still has not fired in the tournament so far, the outing against Uganda will be crucial to get some runs.

Gisele Ishimwe

18-year-old prodigy, Gisele has a ton of experience. Having turned the game with both bat and ball for her side, she’ll be a key player going into the contest. The right-hander has scored over 800 runs on the international stage, including a comprehensive 114*. She has had exemplary starts in the tournament so far, with three 30+ scores. Kenya will look forward to her valuable contributions.

Irene Alumo

Alumo has a great knack for picking wickets and denting the opposition’s batting order. With a comprehensive average of just 11.76, Uganda will bank on her in this tournament. She’s been among the top wicket takers so far in this edition, her stand-out performances came against Botswana and Namibia where she scalped (3/9) and (2/8) respectively.

Immaculate Nakisuuyi

With over 500 runs and 25 wickets on the international platform, Immaculate will look to add to that tally by seeing Uganda home in the coming match. The 27-year-old has not quite hit it off with the bat as she only has one 30+ score against her name. Uganda will hope to get the best out of her all-around abilities and assert dominance going ahead.

Pitch:

A well-balanced track with a slight advantage for the batters. But it’s only a matter of hitting the right areas for the bowlers and restricting their counterparts to a lower total.

Weather:

Comfortable playing conditions are forecasted ahead of the first game, with temperatures hovering around mid-20 degrees, the skies will be overcast with possible chances of rain.

Fantasy Playing XI:

Kevin Awino, Immaculate Nakisuuyi, Venasa Ooko, Prosscovia Alako, Monica Ndhambi, Queentor Abel, Stephanie Nampiina, Esther Wachira, Janet Mbabazi, Irene Alumo, Evelyn Anyipo.
