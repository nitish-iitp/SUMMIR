SUI vs ITA Dream11 Team News  & Match Preview
Switzerland :

Switzerland remains a resilient team, having drawn five of their ten Euro 2024 qualifiers and staying unbeaten in their last four friendlies. Under Murat Yakin’s leadership, they have showcased strong defensive capabilities. Notable recent results include a 0-0 draw against Denmark, a 1-0 win in Ireland, a 4-0 win against Estonia, and a 1-1 draw with Austria. The Swiss haven’t lost at the European Championship, opening with a 3-1 win against Hungary where they had a dominant 7-2 shots on target. Xherdan Shaqiri has been pivotal, scoring in a 1-1 draw against Scotland and contributing to their 1-1 draw against Germany with Dan Ndoye’s goal.

Switzerland faces some squad adjustments, with Kevin Mbabu and Andi Zeqiri left out after being named in the preliminary squad. Silvan Widmer is suspended, allowing Leonidas Stergiou to start at right-wing back. There are also doubts over Denis Zakaria and Steven Zuber, who have yet to feature at Euro 2024. Kwadwo Duah may reclaim his spot up front after scoring the opening goal against Hungary. Xherdan Shaqiri, with 32 goals in 124 internationals, remains a key player for the Swiss.

Switzerland Probable XI

Yann Sommer; Ricardo Rodriguez, Manuel Akanji, Fabian Schar, Michel Aebischer, Granit Xhaka, Remo Freuler, Leonidas Stergiou, Dan Ndoye, Ruben Vargas, Kwadwo Duah

Italy:

Italy finished second in Group C behind England in their Euro 2024 qualifiers, winning four of their eight matches. Luciano Spalletti’s side had a mixed performance in recent friendlies, starting with wins against Venezuela and Ecuador in March, followed by a 0-0 draw against Turkey and a 1-0 win against Bosnia & Herzegovina in June. In their Euro 2024 opener, Italy fell behind early against Albania but recovered with goals from Alessandro Bastoni and Nicolo Barella to secure a 2-1 win. However, they struggled in a 1-0 defeat to Spain and narrowly avoided elimination against Croatia with Mattia Zaccagni’s last-minute goal to advance to the Round of 16.

Italy will be without several key players due to injuries, including defenders Francesco Acerbi, Giorgio Scalvini, Rafael Toloi, and Davide Calabria. Midfielders Destiny Udogie, Manuel Locatelli, Giacomo Bonaventura, and Nicolo Zaniolo also miss out after being called up in March. Nicolo Barella, the top scorer in the squad with 10 goals in 56 appearances, will be crucial for Italy’s attacking efforts. Riccardo Calafiori is suspended, allowing Gianluca Mancini to start at center-back. Mattia Zaccagni, after his dramatic goal against Croatia, could be rewarded with a starting position.

Italy Probable XI

Gianluigi Donnarumma; Federico Dimarco, Alessandro Bastoni, Gianluca Mancini, Giovanni Di Lorenzo, Nicolo Barella, Jorginho, Davide Frattesi, Mattia Zaccagni, Gianluca Scamacca, Federico Chiesa
