COMMENTRY
Right then, that is it from this game and we have just one more game remaining in the group stage of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024. Co-hosts West Indies take on Afghanistan in a battle for supremacy in Group C at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, Gros Islet, St Lucia. That game will take place on Tuesday, 18 June and will begin at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT) but you can join us a lot sooner for the build-up. Till then, take care and goodbye!
The victorious skipper of New Zealand, Kane Williamson is up for a quick chat and says they were looking to execute their plans on this surface and the boys did well. Adds they were looking to start strong and they came across two very strong teams first up in challenging conditions and that did not work in their favor. Mentions that after every tournament there is a bit of reflection and they’ll be doing that again. Adds that playing with Trent has been really special throughout the years and his experience will be missed. Adds that the appetite of Trent Boult is hard to match as he trains really hard and operates in the perfect channels and he has always set the tone, puffed his chest out and performed well for the side.
Assad Vala, the captain of Papua New Guinea says that they can take a lot of learnings, especially in the batting aspect of the game. Adds that it was challenging for them but they gave it their best. Mentions that there was a bit of juice in the wicket early on and tried to be positive. Adds that it has been a couple of weeks since they have been here and they know a lot of fans have been watching the game back home. Ends by saying that they will look to better their game in the future.
Lockie Ferguson is the Player Of The Match for his scintillating bowling spell of 4 overs 3 for nothing. He is up for a quick chat and says the wicket was tough to bat on and it felt good to bowl on such a track. Adds that there are not many games in T20 cricket where they can bowl seam up throughout but this was the plan today and it worked. Mentions that it is hard to know what is a good total on this track and they will be looking behind to those losses they had against Windies and Afghanistan and come up good in the future. Closes by acknowledging the crowd.
The Presentation ceremony…
Earlier in the game, it was a delayed start due to rain and even after the toss, there was a slight delay due to the weather. Kane Williamson put Papua New Guinea into bat as the likes of Tim Southee and Lockie Ferguson picked up early wickets. There was some resistance from Charles Amini and Sese Bau but Ferguson came back in and delivered a dream spell where he picked up 3 wickets without giving away a single run in his four overs. In the latter half of the innings, Trent Boult and the two spinners also joined the party and kept PNG down to just 78 runs. In reply, New Zealand managed to gun down the target in 12.2 overs losing three wickets in doing so.
Papua New Guinea will feel that if they had put 100 plus on the board, they could have had a real shot in this game but still, they had more than a decent outing with the ball. Kabua Morea bowled really well upfront picking up a couple of wickets and was well supported by the rest of the pack. They just didn’t have many runs to play with and one good partnership in the middle took them out of the game.
New Zealand sign off the 2024 Men’s T20I World Cup with a win but it isn’t enough to take them through to the Super Eight stage. They will go home empty-handed but on a positive note nonetheless, whereas Papua New Guinea bow out without a single win but they have pushed a couple of big teams. Requiring 79 for the win, the Black Caps lost Finn Allen in the very first over and the frustration could be seen on his face as he walked off. After that, neither Devon Conway nor Rachin Ravindra could really stamp their authority on the game and the latter soon got out. Skipper Kane Williamson came in and looked to keep the scoreboard ticking as Conway started to fire and broke the back of the run chase before getting out. Kane stayed on and along with Daryl Mitchell took his side home in the 13th over.
