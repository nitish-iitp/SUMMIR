West Indies vs Afghanistan Commentary
4:11 AM IST Rovman Powell, the victorious skipper of West Indies says that it feels very good to finish unbeaten. Says the hard work they have been putting in for the last year or so is paying off. Adds that the guys are always excited to play in the Caribbean and St. Lucia is one of the best batting surfaces in the tournament. He appreciates Pooran saying that he has worked very hard and he set a solid foundation for them in the game. Adds that they started the tournament with a little advantage of the home conditions. Mentions that when he started his journey as the captain, they were ranked 8th and now they are 3rd in the world. Says the support has been incredible wherever they have gone. Also thanks his head coach, Darren Sammy for being the driving force in his journey as the skipper.
4:08 AM IST Right then, that is it from this one-sided affair and the group stages as well. Next up in the World Cup is the Super-8 stages. In the first match, it will be the co-hosts, USA taking on South Africa on 19th June, Wednesday. That will begin at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT), but as you know, you can always join us early for all the build-up to the game. Until then, cheers and goodbye!
4:06 AM IST Rashid Khan, the captain of Afghanistan says that West Indies batted really well in the Powerplay and it is hard to come back when you conceded 90 runs in the first six overs. Adds that they still bowled well in the middle overs to restrict them under 220 considering the start they got. Mentions that it is important how they execute their plans with the ball and they will take a lot of learnings from this game. Says that it is good that it has happened at this stage of the tournament and it will help them understand how to play in the upcoming matches. Further adds that the strong breeze was a factor and as a bowler, you need to consider which side to bowl and keep the overs under 10 runs. Ends by saying that, they still had a lot of positives from this match.
3:59 AM IST Nicholas Pooran is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his scintillating knock of 98. He begins by saying that you don't want to get run out after being on 97 but says in the end, you need to take your team to a good total. Says they assessed the conditions properly and he felt that it was his day and just made it big. Says in T20 cricket everyone wants to see fours and sixes but states it is not that easy to get it done in each and every game. Ends by saying that they have been really consistent not only in this World Cup, but in the last 13-14 months and also climbed to the 3rd spot in the ICC rankings. Ends up appreciating Sherfane Rutherford and says that his knock in the last game really inspired them.
3:55 AM IST Earlier in the game, West Indies post a record-breaking total on the board courtesy of a swash-buckling 98 from Nicholas Pooran along with some quick-fire knocks from Johnson Charles, Shai Hope, and Rovman Powell. Afghanistan were pretty ordinary with the ball and they wouldn't have hoped for a performance like this just before the Super 8s. Gulbadin Naib was the pick of the bowlers with a couple of wickets while Noor Ahmad was economical as well. Naveen-ul-Haq and Azmatullah Omarzai chipped in with one each but were very expensive while Rashid Khan also had an off day in this game. While chasing, the Afghans were never really in it and in the end fell short by 104 runs.
3:54 AM IST West Indies, on the other hand, were brilliant with the ball right from the start. Akeal Hosein once again got an early breakthrough and set the tone for them. The Afghans built up a little partnership that was broken by Gudakesh Motie. Obed McCoy was excellent as well who played his first match of the World Cup and picked up three wickets including two in the same over. Hosein added one more to his tally while Alzarri Joseph also got one. It was just a matter of time before it was Andre Russell who wrapped things up for the Windies.
