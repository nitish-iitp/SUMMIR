India continued their winning run by handing Afghanistan a 47-run defeat in their first Super 8 match of the T20 World Cup 2024 which was played at the Kensington Oval Barbados on Thursday.

India’s bowling attack consisting of Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav and others made sure that Afghanistan failed to chase the 182-run target set by their batters.

Jasprit Bumrah, once again, starred for Rohit Sharma’s side with the ball as he bowled an economical and crucial spell of 3-7 in four overs while Suryakumar Yadav was named the Player of the Match for his quick 28-ball 53-run innings.
