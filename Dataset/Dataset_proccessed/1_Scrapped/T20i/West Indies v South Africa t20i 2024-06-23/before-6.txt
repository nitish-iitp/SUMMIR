South Africa continued their winning streak and defeated the United States by 16 runs in their T20 World Cup 2024 Super 8 match at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium on Wednesday.

South African bowlers managed to stop the USA batters from chasing the 195-run target and Kagiso Rabada was their star with the ball with his economical spell of 3/18 in four overs.

With South Africa’s win over the USA, this how the World Cup Super 8 points table looks like.
