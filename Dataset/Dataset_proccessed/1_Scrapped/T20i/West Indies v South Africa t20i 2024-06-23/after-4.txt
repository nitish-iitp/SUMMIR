West Indies vs South Africa Commentary
5:23 AM IST Right then, the two semifinalists from Group 2 are confirmed as South Africa and England make it through to the final four. There are still a couple of semifinal spots left in Group 1 and next up is probably the most anticipated clash of the tournament so far. It will be Australia taking on India at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in Gros Islet, St Lucia which will also be the penultimate match of the Super Eight stage. That game will be played on Monday, 24 June at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT) but as usual, you can join us a lot sooner for the build-up. Till then, take care and goodbye!
5:22 AM IST The victorious skipper of South Africa, Aiden Markram is up for a quick chat. He says that such has been the course of the tournament for them where they have to dig deep to extract a victory and they are happy to have won those close games throughout. He says he is feeling relieved to get through to the semis but they wouldn't get relaxed just by this as they are aiming much higher. Adds that they bowled well to start with and assessed the condition well and restricted the Windies to a below-par total. Mentions that they will take the learnings from this game and do well in the coming games. Also says that they identified that the spin would be a trouble for them and they stuck to it and the surface helped them too. Says Kagiso Rabada bowling just two overs speaks volumes on how the surface was acting and they feel happy to have executed their plans to perfection. Closes by saying that they were looking to take the game on and act smartly looking at the conditions that were in front of them and they managed to do it successfully.
5:17 AM IST Rovman Powell, the captain of West Indies says that the credit must be given to the boys who fought till the end and it was with the bat that they lost the game. adds that the wicket wasn't easy to bat on and they just lost wickets in clusters in the middle phase which was decisive. Mentions that they wanted to give their all in the field and he is proud of the boys. Adds that looking on the outside, they aren't in the semis but they have gone from number 9 in the world to number 3 in the last year or so and it is now important to continue the good work and make their people proud. Ends by saying that the crowd and the support have been fantastic wherever they have played and it is good to see that the cricketing spirit hasn't died down in the Caribbean.
5:16 AM IST Tabraiz Shamsi is the Player of the Match for his stellar showing with the ball early on. He says that he was sweating at the end but it's been the theme of the tournament for them and they have been finding a way to win as a team no matter what the situation is. Adds that they had confidence in Marco and he delivered. Mentions that the fans like bigger wins but such victories of close margins are what gets a team going even more. Also says that the last time he played on this ground he went for a few but he had a good chat with the coaching staff and they helped him. Credits the other bowlers and says they set the tone up front and together as a unit they performed to their best level. Closes by saying it is always a one-sided love affair between rain, South Africa and chasing but luckily it did not hinder their progress today.
5:15 AM IST The Presentation ceremony...
5:11 AM IST Earlier in the game, Aiden Markram won the toss and put West Indies into bat first on a track that looked to be offering something for everyone. Markram picked up something early on from the pitch and was very smart to use a lot of spin in the first 10 overs. Markram even bowled a four-over spell himself upfront and they managed to pick up early wickets as well. Then came the 81-run stand between Kyle Mayers and Roston Chase that got the hosts into a position of promise but with overs running out and the run rate not quite where they would have wanted it to be, the batters had to push. South Africa took advantage of this and kept pressing as the wickets started to tumble and restricted them to just 135 runs with Chase being the star with a well-compiled half-century. In reply, it was a stop-start chase with rain impeding play but South Africa managed to hit enough boundaries in the middle phase than allowed them to get over the line when things got tight.
