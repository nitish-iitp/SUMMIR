For the fans outside Australia and for whom it's not possible to go and watch it live, Getting an HD connection with a nice pizza by the side would be the best way.

Whereas if going to the stadium is possible there is no better experience than those huge Australian ground with humungous stands and the great smell of Victoria beer everywhere.

I don’t think there are any. Not that are legal anyway. If England reach the final, the Beeb may try to negotiate for coverage with Sky in the UK I suppose.
