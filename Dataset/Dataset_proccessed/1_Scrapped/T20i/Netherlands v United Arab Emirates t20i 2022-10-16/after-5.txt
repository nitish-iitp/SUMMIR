Netherlands have so far managed to contain United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the 2nd match of T20 World Cup Qualifiers. UAE have so far lost 2 wickets with 68 on board. However, it could have been one more if Netherlands fielder Vikramjit Singh had managed to hold onto a simple catch.

In the 8th over, Van Beek bowled a length ball and batter Muhammad Waseem tried to go uppish and sliced straight to deep third but Vikramjit lost the ball in the lights at the last moment, and dropped a dolly. The bowler and the team members were not pleased with Vikramjit’s effort.
