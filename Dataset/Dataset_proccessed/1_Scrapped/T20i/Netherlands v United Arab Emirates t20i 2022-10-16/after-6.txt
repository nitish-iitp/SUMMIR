That is it from this game! Action from the World Cup continues as there are two games coming your way on the 17th of this month. The first one is between West Indies and Scotland and that begins at 0930 IST (0400 GMT). The build-up though begins a lot earlier. Till then, take care and goodbye!

!

Scott Edwards says it was always nervy but he is pleased they got over the line. States they wanted to make most of the Powerplay as it was going to get tough later on. Mentions it was just about being busy and just take it deep. Creidts to the bowlers for the way they bowled. Ends by saying he is relieved they won this game.

!

Chundangapoyil Rizwan says it is a heartbreaking loss but had he grabbed the chance he got, things could have been different. Mentions they knew it was not going to be easy to chase and they believed and they almost pulled it off. Ends by saying he is happy with the effort by the boys.

!

Bas de Leede is the MAN OF THE MATCH for his effort with the ball.

!

... TIME FOR THE PRESENTATION ...

!

Earlier in the day, after electing to bat, United Arab Emirates's innings just never got going! Despite a good knock from Muhammad Waseem they ended with only 111 as the others failed to contribute. It was not easy going for Netherlands too but they managed to chase it down in the last over.

!

The start was not the best for United Arab Emirates but they came back strongly later on courtesy Junaid Siddique, Zahoor Khan and Karthik Meiyappan! The three of them bowled brilliantly. However, Zawar Farid's spell was a tad expensive when you keep the equation of the game in mind and also, the fielding did not help the cause towards the end. They were sloppy, a vital dropped catch and a few misfields just saw them end on the losing side. They though can be pleased with the effort they showed.

!

When the chase began though, it seemed like the Netherlands will knock this off in no time! Max O'Dowd was dealing in boundaries and for the first few overs or so, they were going at around 10 per over. As the ball got old, runs scoring got very difficult and Netherlands just kept losing wickets at regular intervals. After the 10th over, they lost wickets in heaps and the game was in the balance when Roelof van der Merwe fell. It could have been worse had Chundangapoyil Rizwan held onto the chance given by Tim Pringle. That though was not the case and Tim along with Scott Edwards got it down to 10 needed in the last. Tim Pringle fell with 9 needed in 9 but Scott Edwards and Logan van Beek played sensibly and got their side over the line.

!

PHEW! What a game of cricket! Never really thought it would go down to the wire but credit to United Arab Emirates for pushing Netherlands till they did! Brilliant from Scott Edwards! The skipper has played a knock full of responsibility and has taken his side over the line. Yes, he has scored just the 16 but those were 16 vital runs and under a lot of pressure. On the other hand, have to say, Chundangapoyil Rizwan has nobody but himself to blame in this innings. He dropped a vital catch and had that been taken, things could have been a lot different. However, it is the Dutch who have prevailed and have taken the important two points.

ZAWAR FARID TO SCOTT EDWARDS

A single and that is it! Logan van Beek punches the air in joy! A tight win for Netherlands as they win by 3 wickets with one ball to spare! Poor from United Arab Emirates. The fielders should have been a lot closer. This is on a length and on off, it is pushed towards cover for one.

ZAWAR FARID TO SCOTT EDWARDS

SCORES ARE LEVEL! Keeper, keeper was the call from the keeper but the throw went to the other end, it was a direct hit but Logan van Beek was in! Shorter and on middle, this is pulled towards the left of deep square leg. Longer part of the ground and they take on the arm. They complete the two with ease.

ZAWAR FARID TO LOGAN VAN BEEK

Another one! That is all they need in this over. A run off every ball! A full toss on the pads, this is worked down to fine leg for one.

ZAWAR FARID TO SCOTT EDWARDS

Direct hit and Edwards was a goner! A full delivery on off, this is pushed towards cover and Edwards goes for the single. The fielder fields and has a shy a the bowler's end but misses.

ZAWAR FARID TO LOGAN VAN BEEK

Needed a better effort from Zawar Farid there! Fuller and on middle, this is driven back to the bowler who does not stop it cleanly. A run taken. 5 in 5 now.

ZAHOOR KHAN TO LOGAN VAN BEEK

A single to end! A lovely nut but Logan van Beek does well. 6 needed 6. A yorker on off, this is jammed down to third man for one.

!

A huge appeal for an LBW but turned down! It is taken upstairs. The impact seems outside off.

ZAHOOR KHAN TO SCOTT EDWARDS

NOT OUT! It is well outside off. This was probably a review in hope! Scott Edwards looks for that killer blow. He walks across looking to hit it on the leg side. Zahoor Khan bowls a slower one outside off. Scott swings but misses. It hits the pad and goes towards third man for one. Leg bye. United Arab Emirates review but in vain.

ZAHOOR KHAN TO LOGAN VAN BEEK

8 in 8 now! Fuller and on off, this is driven to the left of over for one.

ZAHOOR KHAN TO TIM PRINGLE

OUT! PLAYS IT ON! Once again, just as the game seemed like it is drifting away, United Arab Emirates strike! Zahoor Khan does the trick. As we said, fuller length is the ideal one on this wicket and Zahoor Khan bowls it there. On off. Tim Pringle looks to drive but with no foot movement. It goes off the inside edge and onto the stumps. 9 in 9 now.

ZAHOOR KHAN TO TIM PRINGLE

A dot! Need to bowl full, short is not the length here. This one is full and outside off, Pringle looks to drive but misses.
