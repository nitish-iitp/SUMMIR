India's World Cup-winning former coach Gary Kirtsten and Australia's Dan Christian have joined the Netherlands cricket team as consultants for the upcoming T20 World Cup in Australia. Having qualified for the T20 World Cup in July, the Dutch will take on the United Arab Emirates, Namibia and Sri Lanka in the Group stage matches on October 16, 18 and 20 respectively. Top two teams from the Group stage will qualify for the Super 12s.

"We are very excited to welcome both Gary Kirsten and Dan Christian to our coaching staff for the T20 World Cup," Royal Dutch Cricket Federation (KNCB) high performance manager Roland Lefebvre said in a statement.

"They bring in a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table which will be of great help in the lead-up to and during the World Cup." The Dutch team underwent a training camp with Kirsten and his coaching staff at the Gary Kirsten Cricket Academy in Cape Town in late September before leaving for Australia along with head coach Ryan Cook, who has worked closely with the South African in the past.

"I really enjoyed working with the Dutch team in Cape Town and I look forward to joining them as a consultant in the T20 World Cup," Kirsten, who won the IPL with Gujarat Titans in their debut season this year, said.

Kirsten has previously worked with the Dutch team in 2021 during the Super League series against Ireland.

"I was impressed with the level of skill and professionalism during the camp. They will be ready and determined to make a big impact at the T20 World Cup," added the 54-year-old, who coached India to the 2011 ODI World Cup title.

Former Australia all-rounder Christian, who has 393 T20 caps to his name and joined the Dutch team in Adelaide, will look to impart his deep knowledge of the local conditions. "I've had a great couple of weeks getting to know the guys, and I've been extremely impressed with everyone's work ethic at practice. I'm looking forward to seeing them have some well-deserved success on the field," Christian said.
