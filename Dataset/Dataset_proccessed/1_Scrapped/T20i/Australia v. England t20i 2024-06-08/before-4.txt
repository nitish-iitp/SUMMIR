Australia and England will face off in a crucial Group B fixture of the 2024 T20 World Cup at the Kensington Oval in Barbados on Saturday – here’s the latest weather forecast and update for the AUS vs ENG match, including chances of rain.

This clash between the two oldest cricketing powerhouses is set to get underway at 1:00 pm local time on Saturday, June 8. A few matches of this T20 World Cup have been affected by rain: Papua New Guinea vs West Indies in Guyana was interrupted; Nepal vs Netherlands in Dallas started late; and Scotland vs England in Barbados was eventually abandoned due to inclement weather.

This will be the fifth match in Barbados and the third afternoon game. Both Australia and England have already had a look at the ground during their matches against Scotland and Oman respectively.

AccuWeather forecast for Bridgetown, Barbados on June 8th, 2024

The Weather Channel forecast for Bridgetown, Barbados on June 8th, 2024

According to The Weather Channel, there is a higher chance of rain throughout the day in Barbados, at 24 percent. This is subject to further change but is still a relatively low probability.

What happens if the AUS vs ENG game is washed out?

In case of a washout, both Australia and England will be awarded one point each. So far, only one match at the 2024 men’s T20 World Cup has been washed out; England vs Scotland on June 4. However, there have been delays due to rain in other matches.
