Right then, this wraps up this exciting T20I Ashes clash! With this victory, Australia secures those two crucial points and claims the top spot in Pool B whereas, things are getting more serious for the defending champions with this loss and just a couple of games to spare. However, the action in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, 2024 continues as next up is another exciting contest in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup where the hosts West Indies will face a challenge from the associates Uganda. This match will began on Sunday, 9th June and the first ball will be bowled at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT). But do join us for the pre-match build-up. Cheers, and take care!

!

Mitchell Marsh, the captain of Australia says that he is very pleased with that effort and their all-round play was phenomenal with experienced players stepping up as well. Adds that they learned a few lessons from their first game and got off to a brilliant start. Mentions that the bowlers know their job well and he didn't try to change too much. Reckons that Pat Cummins was outstanding and bowled really well from the hard end. Mentions that they want to keep learning and want to stick to their game plan going into future games.

!

Jos Buttler, the skipper of England, says they came up with a lot of intent and also bowled really well in the mid-overs phase. Adds that the conditions were quite extreme with the shorter boundary on one side. On being asked about Jofra Archer's performance, Buttler says it is great to have him back in the ranks and he is bowling at good lines and lengths and says he has a great variety and skill set.  Says that Zampa bowled really well and credits Australia's overall performance. Ends up by saying that they need to dust themselves out and head on for their remaining games.

!

Adam Zampa is the Player of the Match for his fine bowling effort. He says that they play against England a lot and know the players well and also they had prepared well, with the breeze and the long boundary on one side. Adds that he is trying to sum up the conditions and it was hard to play cross-bat shots. Mentions that some of the wickets in West Indies are such that you need to sum up on the spot and got some useful information from how Adil Rashid bowled as well. Reckons that they have great depth in the bowling attack and they'll play their roles well.

The presentation ceremony...

!

Earlier in the game, Australia was invited to set the total, and boy, did they start strong! Right from the first ball, Travis Head and David Warner went all guns blazing, making the most of the fielding restrictions. They smashed boundaries effortlessly and totally dominated the Powerplay. Then, Mitchell Marsh stepped in and compounded the strong foundation laid by the openers. Despite the English pacers trying to slow things down, they couldn't take wickets when needed. Marsh played a solid captain's innings, scoring 35 runs. Australia hovered above 10 runs per over, with key contributions from Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis, pushing them past 200. In the chase, despite a strong start laid by the openers, England lost their momentum during the mid-overs phase, as wickets tumbled in quick succession, and unfortunately, they couldn't recover from that collapse.

!

Australia, on the other hand, struggled to get the desired start as their bowlers were hammered by the English openers. Despite using four seamers, they couldn't manage a breakthrough in the first six overs and were instead taken to the cleaners. As soon as the fielding restrictions were lifted, Marsh handed the ball to Adam Zampa, who delivered a couple of quick wickets in the span of just a few deliveries, thanks to some crafty bowling. Marcus Stoinis was quick enough to remove Will Jacks as well. Pat Cummins was brought back for his second spell and proved to be a game-changer. He conceded just four runs and also claimed the crucial wicket of the dangerous-looking Moeen. Mitchell Marsh rotated his bowlers to perfection and the bowlers exploited the conditions very well. Adam Zampa finished up with sensational figures of 4 overs and 28 runs with a couple of wickets. The Australian quicks also reaped the benefits of bowling cutters and varying the pace as Pat Cummins got two, while Marcus Stoinis and Josh Hazlewood finished up with one each.

!

AUSTRALIA WIN BY 36 RUNS AND REGISTER THEIR SECOND WIN OF THE GROUP STAGE IN A DOMINATING FASHION! Wheras, it is now getting a bit more worrisome for England for their journey ahead. Chasing a challenging total of 202, England got off to a solid start. Openers Jos Buttler and Phil Salt showed great intent, finding boundaries right from the beginning. They successfully navigated the first six overs and capitalized on every poor delivery, making their intentions clear while also keeping up with the asking rate. Phil Salt was the first to go, scoring a solid 37 that gave England a strong foundation of 73 runs. Jos Buttler, despite his great start, couldn't turn it into a big score and got out soon after. Will Jacks didn't make much of an impact, and Jonny Bairstow's struggle at the crease ended without causing much damage. Those two quick wickets really hit England hard, causing the asking rate to skyrocket. Moeen's departure after a brisk 25 added to their woes, and they found themselves completely cornered. Consequently, finding boundaries became a real challenge, and England literally crawled in the backend, eventually falling short by 36 runs.
