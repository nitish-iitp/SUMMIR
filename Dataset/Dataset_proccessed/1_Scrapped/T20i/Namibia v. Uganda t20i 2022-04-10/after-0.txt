Brendon McCullum is a cricketer who plays for the New Zealand national cricket team. He has been part of the team since 2002 and has enjoyed a successful period with the team. Brendon McCullum was born on September 27, 1981 in Dunedin, Otago. Brendon McCullum made his debut with the New Zealand national cricket team in 2002 in the ODI format.

Background

He played cricket for many clubs such as Otago Cricket Team, Canterbury, Glamorgan, New South Wales, Sussex, Brisbane Heat, Warwickshire, Middlesex, Lahore Qalandars, Rangpur Riders.

He has also been part of Kolkata Knight Riders, Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Chennai Super Kings and Gujarat Lions in the Indian Premier League.

Domestic Career

On 3 March 2008, before taking on England for the Test series, McCullum was involved in the State Shield Final against the Auckland Aces, scoring 170 runs for the Otago Volts to beat the Aces at Eden Park's outer oval and helping , chasing a scary 7 for 310 total, he broke multiple State Shield batting records. He hit the fastest LA hundred with 52 balls, including 14 fours and 5 sixes. With 170 runs in the match, McCullum had the highest scoring of any player in a one-day national match (shell or state competitions), surpassing Blair Hartland's previous record.

McCullum played for Glamorgan in 2006 and scored 160 goals as he opened batting against Leicestershire in the County Championship. On January 24, 2009, he represented New South Wales in the final of Australia's KFC Twenty20 Big Bash. This was practice to allow him to play for them in the Twenty20 Champions League. However, this drew criticism despite the opinion that states are allowed to have a foreign player in their roster. McCullum also donated his playing fee from the game to Otago Junior Cricket.

On January 16, 2010 during the 2009–10 HRV Cup against Auckland Aces at University Oval, McCullum failed to hit 108 from 67 deliveries, including 10 fours and four sixes, to lead Otago Volts to three-ball to victory. McCullum achieved his 50 from 32 deliveries and his century from 65 deliveries.

In September 2016, he signed with the Lahore Qalandars for the 2017 Pakistan Super League season and becomes the team's captain.

At the first Indian Premier League tournament in 2008 he played for the Kolkata Knight Riders. On April 18, 2008, in the first-ever IPL match, he equaled Twenty20's highest individual score in one innings, 158* against RCB. That eclipsed Australia's Cameron White's previous record of 141. Coincidentally, McCullum faced an over from White during the game and scored 24 points from it. it was only over for White in this match. That record was eventually broken by Chris Gayle when he put up 175 runs in IPL 2013. In the same match, he also claimed the record for most sixes (13) in a twenty-20 innings, later surpassed by England's Graham Napier (16).

He was bought by Kochi Tuskers Kerala at the 2011 IPL auctions. In 2012 he returned to the Knight Riders. At the 2014 IPL auctions, McCullum was bought by Chennai Super Kings. He was given the role of opening the innings alongside West Indian Dwayne Smith, and the pair was considered the most dangerous opening pair in league history.

He was sacked by CSK in 2018 and bought by Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2018.

He reached 9000 runs in all forms of T20 cricket in RCB's season opener against Kolkata Knight Riders during the 2018 IPL season, becoming only the second player after Chris Gayle to reach that milestone.

International Career

In 2004, he played against England in a Test series and recorded his highest score at the time, a 96 inning at Lord's. His first Test century came a few months later when he scored 143 against Bangladesh. He fell just short of his second Test hundred in a game against Sri Lanka when he was dismissed with a narrow of his hundred. His second century would later come with a run a ball 111 against Zimbabwe.

He was selected to the 20-man ICC World XI roster for the ICC Super Series in July 2005. On 20 February 2007, he scored 86 goals as New Zealand became the first team to whitewash Australia in a three-game ODI series since 1997. During the innings, he teamed with Craig McMillan to score 165 points, setting the world record for a 6th wicket partnership.

On December 31, 2007, he scored 50 of just 19 balls against Bangladesh. He finished his innings on 80 carries from just 28 balls, including 9 fours and 6 sixes, with a batting average of 285.71.

On 22 December 2015, McCullum announced his intention to retire from international cricket at the end of the Southern Summer in his home Test against Australia, rather than after the 2016 ICC World Twenty20. He played his last ODI game against Australia on 8 February 2016 in which he scored 47 from 27 and New Zealand beat Australia by 55 runs to win the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy 2–1.

On February 22, 2016, McCullum played his final innings in a friendly against Australia. He scored 25 out of 27 when he was released a ball by Josh Hazlewood after hitting it for a 6. McCullum received an honor guard upon entering the field and a standing ovation upon his discharge. Brendon McCullum said of his retirement that the time was right to leave international cricket, saying that hopefully he's gone and in the time he's had as captain some fun and enjoyment and some real culture back into the line-up brought.

Record Breaking Performances

On July 1, 2008, McCullum scored his first ODI Century, a 135-ball 166, against Ireland in the Associates Tri-Series in Scotland. His century, along with James Marshall's 161, (his first ODI century in his last appearance, in which he shared an opening 266 with McCullum, which was the highest ODI partnership for a wicket in Black Caps history and the second highest opening partnership in is all ODIs.) and Ross Taylor's 59, lifted New Zealand to 402, the highest and only over 400 score for their team to date, and they won by 290 runs and set a world record for largest margin of victory by runs.

On November 6, 2009, against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi, McCullum scored his second ODI century of 131 to take New Zealand to 303 and win the match to even the streak. On 16 February 2010, during the only Test match against Bangladesh, he scored 185 which is the highest score ever by a New Zealand wicket-keeper in Test cricket. He was also involved in the record-highest sixth wicket partnership for New Zealand of 339 carries with Martin Guptill, missing the world record by just 12 carries.

On February 27, 2010, McCullum became the second player to hit a T20I hundred, failing to finish 116, one run behind Chris Gayle's record of 117. On May 4, 2010, McCullum became the first player to hit 1,000 T20 international runs . He achieved this feat while playing against Zimbabwe at the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 in Guyana.

On 28 June 2010, McCullum announced he would not be keeping a wicket for New Zealand in Test matches. However, he stated that he would continue to play in 50-overs and T20-over games. He's done well in his first innings since relinquishing wicketkeeping duties. He hit 65 runs and was engaged in a 104-run partnership with Ross Taylor. He was promoted to the opener's position in Tests, rather than his usual No. 5 position. However, McCullum had experience opening the innings because he opens for New Zealand in limited-overs cricket.

On September 21, 2012, at the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 tournament in Sri Lanka, McCullum scored 123 runs against Bangladesh in Pallekele, setting a new record for Twenty20 International's highest innings and becoming the first player to score two centuries from Twenty20 International. That record was broken by Aaron Finch against England when he scored 156 goals. However, McCullum is one of the two players who scored two centuries from Twenty20 International along with West Indian Chris Gayle.

He was named T20 Player of the Year by NZC for the 2012–13 season

Captaincy

McCullum has been lauded for his captaincy and ability to inspire a nation and lift New Zealand to unprecedented heights, for which he has also accomplished many great things bat in hand.

Since taking over as captain from Ross Taylor in December 2012, McCullum has led the Black Caps to 11 wins, nine losses and 11 draws in friendly games. His 37.93% win rate is the best of any New Zealand captain and his 59.43% win rate from 56 ODIs as captain is also the best of any New Zealander with 30+ games as captain.

He is also the captain's top runs scorer in his Farewell Test and the first captain to score a century in his Farewell Test.

Late Career

McCullum also led New Zealand at the 2015 Cricket World Cup co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia. On 20 February 2015, in New Zealand's third Pool A game against England, McCullum hit 77 runs of 25 balls, recording the fastest 50 in World Cup history (51 runs of 18 balls) and the fourth-fastest fifty of all time.

McCullum led the New Zealand team to their maiden World Cup final, scoring on-time innings in the semi-final group stage match against Australia and South Africa. The semi-final victory was New Zealand's first after six semi-final defeats in the past. In the final against Australia, McCullum was bowled for a duck by Mitchell Starc in the first over of the game while New Zealand lost to Australia by 7 wickets.

As the tournament progressed, McCullum was particularly aggressive in both batting and captaincy, helping New Zealand reach the final. His aggressive starts against opposing team strike bowlers like James Anderson, Mitchell Johnson and Dale Steyn favored the rest of the players to play their natural game.

On May 21, 2015, McCullum started in his 93rd consecutive Test, entering his preferred spot at No. 1. 5. On 13 December 2015, in McCullum's 98th consecutive Test start, he scored his 100th six in Test cricket, equaling Adam Gilchrist's record. On February 12, 2016, McCullum started his 100th straight Test but was sacked in both innings by Mitchell Marsh, making Marsh the second person since Jason Gillespie to sack him in both innings of two Test games.

In September 2018, he was named an icon player for Kandahar's squad at the first edition of the Afghanistan Premier League tournament.

In July 2019 he was selected to play for the Glasgow Giants in the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament. However, he retired from all forms of cricket in August 2019.

He retired from all forms of international cricket on 24 February 2016. Following his retirement, he has confirmed to return to the Brisbane Heat for the Big Bash League.
