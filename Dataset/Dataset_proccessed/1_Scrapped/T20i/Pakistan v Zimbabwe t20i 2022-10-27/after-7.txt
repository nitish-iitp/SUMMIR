Over Comparison
ZIM 130/8 (20.0)
PAK 129/8 (20.0)
That's it from this game! A low-scoring thriller! The World Cup keeps on giving surprises. On 28th October, Afghanistan will take on Ireland at 9.30 am IST (4 am GMT) and later, England will face Australia at 1.30 pm IST (8 am GMT). Do join us for the build up. Cheers!
Craig Ervine, the skipper of Zimbabwe says it is a special win. They worked hard to get in this round. Says they felt 20-25 runs short at the start but they bowled brilliantly and applauds the performance of Raza. Ends by appreciating the support they are getting.
Babar Azam, the captain of Pakistan says they should had definitely chased this down but are disappointed as they are not upto the mark with the bat. Adds he and Rizwan have responsibility but they got out. Reckons they need to use the new ball well. Shares that they are looking forward to the next match.
Sikandar Raza is the Player of the Match. He says he is lost for words and is proud of these players. Adds it is unbelievable but they kept believing until the end. Ends by saying that he recieved a clip of Ricky Ponting in the morning and that gave him extra motivation. He would like to thank Ricky Ponting for that.
...Presentation coming up...
Earlier in the day, after being asked to field, courtesy Wasim, Rauf and Shadab, Pakistan kept Zimbabwe to a very low score. However, what we thought was an under par score proved to be enough as Zimbabwe fought till the very last ball and won the game by the slightest of margins.
What can be said about Pakistan batting! When you have names like Babar, Rizwan and Masood you have to chase 131 down but yet again they just invited pressure on themselves. They took a cautious approach and went about things slowly. They lost wickets in the process and that always kept Zimbabwe in the hunt. Masood played brilliantly, he held one end up but he fell at the wrong time. Nawaz down the order played really well but when it mattered, he could not provide the goods. Twice in a row, he has turned as a villain. This is really heart breaking loss for them.
What a bowling effort this was from them. Right from the word go, their bowlers made it extremely tough for their batters. Evans, Blessing Muzarabani and Richard Ngarava were brilliant with the new ball. Raza was exceptional in the middle overs. Whenever, the game seemed to be slipping away, they managed to grab a wicket. Despite all of it, this was still Pakistan's game to win but it is Zimbabwe who kept their nerve and have emerged victorious.
3 in 3 is what they needed! Forget that, 131 is what they needed to chase and they have failed to do so. Zimbabwe are on cloud 9, they are elated. What a massive win this is, one that will go down jn history. Zimbabwe are celebrating it with the fans. Absolutely wonderful.
What a win! What a win this is! Pakistan, what have you done? Twice in a row, they have lost games they should have won and this loss may have just seen their chances of getting ahead into the tournament dented big time.

The keeper fumbles a bit but had enough time as he caught Shaheen Afridi well short of his crease. ZIMBABWE WIN BY 1 RUN. YES, 1 RUN.

Brad Evans To Iftikhar Ahmed
Iftikhar Ahmed misses out! A dot to end the 6th. A really good effort with the ball by Zimbabwe in the Powerplay! This is short and outside off, it is cut but to point.

Brad Evans To Iftikhar Ahmed
FOUR! That was not good from Wesley Madhevere! He should have been a lot more aware there. Nevertheless, a welcome boundary for Pakistan. This is shorter and on middle, it is pulled past the mid on fielder. Luke Jongwe runs after it, dives and stops it. He pushes the rope behind. Wesley Madhevere picks the ball up but steps on where the ropes originally would have been. They go upstairs to check and it is a boundary. He could have avoided that but might have forgotten about it.

Blessing Muzarabani To Mohammad Rizwan OUT!
OUT! RIZWAN GOES! Zimbabwe have got two big wickets! Just what they wanted at an early stage! Blessing Muzarabani is pumped up! On a length and outside off, Mohammad Rizwan looks to dab it to third man but the ball is too close to play the shot. Rizwan couches a bit but ends up getting an inside edge and the ball hits the off stump.

OUT! TAKEN! Brad Evans gets the big wicket! The captain was struggling and now he departs! On a length and around off, the ball sticks in the surface a bit and seams away as well. Babar Azam looks to work on the leg side but gets a leading edge and it flies to backward point where Ryan Burl holds onto it. A good start by Zimbabwe.
