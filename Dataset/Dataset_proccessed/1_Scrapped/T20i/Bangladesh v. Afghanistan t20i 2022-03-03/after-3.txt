This was the third highest win for Bangladesh in T20Is in terms of runs. They looked a confident side and did not let Afghanistan get away with big powerplay runs. The visitors have a couple of days to review their performance and make amends. You can catch all the action here on ESPNcricinfo. For now, this is Ekanth, signing off on behalf of Himanshu Agrawal, my fellow commentator and K Vairavan, our scorer. Cheers.

Mahmudullah, Bangladesh Captain: Pleasing to see how the boys fought in the middle with the bat, ball. The energy was good too. We thought the total was defendable. Nasum bowled really well, it was a match-changing spell. Litton was superb with the bat, once he gets going it's eye-pleasing. We are happy to win against Afghanistan, who have a good T20 side. But we can't sit back after one win and will look to do it again in the next game.

Nasum Ahmed is the Player of the Match for his 4-0-10-4 - Says his plan was to restrict the runs, pile on the pressure, and take early wickets which came off.

Mohammad Nabi, Afghanistan Captain: The boys bowled really well and restricted them to 150. We thought we could chase it but threw away our wickets in the powerplay which cost us the game. We will try our best in the next game to fight back.

6:16 pm The 50-50 game turned into a one-sider after Nasum took four in the powerplay. The batters taking him on gifted him wickets and the odd missed opportunity or two did not matter as the wickets bogged down the innings. Shakib broke the steady partnership between Nabi and Zadran, brought up his 400th LOI wicket. The procession then continued to the end as the visitors could not get to the three-figure mark.

Sajid: "Very colorful last over!!"

Shoriful Islam to Mujeeb, OUT

Pulled straight to deep mid-wicket It was into the pitch just wide of off, he pulled it and got a decent hit but not enough to clear the fielder who took it over his left shoulder without having to move much

Mujeeb Ur Rahman c Afif Hossain b Shoriful Islam 4 (4b 1x4 0x6 5m) SR: 100

Tasmeem: "One thing is in subcontinent, finger spin rules. The pitches generally aid spin, so traditional spinners do better in all competitions. Teams look for control, which maximum leg spinners fail to provide. So, people tend to want to be the sort of bowlers that get to play, without trying to bring about the change themselves."

Ahasan: "@tinura, most of the pitches in bd is slow and turing, so even finger spinners are pretty hard to play. So teams don't take risk on wrist spinners, because they sometime leak runs. So they never get the opportunity and hence could not come to next stage"
