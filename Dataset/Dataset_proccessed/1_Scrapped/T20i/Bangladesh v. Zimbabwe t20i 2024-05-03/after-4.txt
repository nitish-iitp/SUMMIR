KKR had a tricky start to their innings at the Wankhede, and slipped to 43-4 when Sunil Narine was bowled by Hardik Pandya. A 70 off 52 balls from Venkatesh Iyer and 42 off 31 from Manish Pandey underpinned the innings, as Kolkata continued to lose wickets cheaply. Andre Russell hit a six off his first ball was run out after a misunderstanding between him and Iyer, before Bumrah bowled a destructive 18th over.

Conceding two and then two dots off his first three balls, Ramandeep Singh attempted to cut a ball bowled outside off behind square. Gerald Coetzee was waiting in the deep and pouched a simple catch. Starc came in and was dealt a yorker first up from round the wicket which he somehow managed to keep out. He was so lucky from the next ball however. Bumrah bowled another inswinging yorker which jagged back in from off stump and knocked over Starc’s middle stump.

The imagery was significant give Starc’s struggles in the tournament. Coming into the match Starc had picked up seven wickets from nine matches at an economy of 11.78. KKR fears heightened when he was hit for a four and then a six off consecutive balls of his first over in the chase. However, he hit back with a stunning yorker of his own to dismiss Ishan Kishan with his next ball.
