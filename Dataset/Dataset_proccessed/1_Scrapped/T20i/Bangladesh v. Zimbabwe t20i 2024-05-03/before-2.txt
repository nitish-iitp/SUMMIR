In an exclusive interview with Star Sports, Shahrukh Khan spoke on his relationship with Kohli, “I spent a lot of time with him, I just love him. We say that he is our son-in-law, he is our fraternity's ‘Daamad’. I have known him the most compared to other players. I have known Virat and Anushka for a long time, spent a lot of time with them.

Shah Rukh Khan has worked with Virat’s wife and actress Anushka Sharma in many films like ‘Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi’, ‘Jab Tak Hai Jaan’ among others. He had also attended their wedding back in 2017. But it's not just on-screen magic that binds these two; their off-screen encounters are equally enchanting.

Khan reminisces in an exclusive interview with Star Sports “So, I taught him the Pathan movie title song dance steps. I saw him in the one of the India matches, he tried to do the dance with Ravindra Jadeja in the match. They were trying to do that dance step, I was very sad that they are doing it so badly! I told them that let me make you learn the steps so that in the next World Cup and other Championships, whenever you dance at least you will call me and ask how to do the steps.”

Shah Rukh Khan's endearing remarks, offers insights into their cherished friendship and playful exchanges, with the King of Bollywood and the King of Cricket sharing wholesome moments on and off the field.
