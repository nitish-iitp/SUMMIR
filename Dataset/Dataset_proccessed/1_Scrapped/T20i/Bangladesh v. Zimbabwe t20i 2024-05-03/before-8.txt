The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) revealed on April 28 that at least two members of the national women’s team were involved in a serious road accident earlier this month. The incident concerned Ghulam Fatima and Bismah Maroof who recently suffered “minor injuries” in a car accident while they were training in Karachi for the ongoing white-ball series against the West Indies. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has acknowledged that the incident happened on April 5 in the evening.

PCB Discloses Women’s Cricket Team Mishap, Players Injured in Road Accident During West Indies Series

This incident occurred when the players breached curfew regulations during the ongoing series against the West Indies. PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi informed the media that at least two players sustained significant injuries as a result.

According to Naqvi, five to six players left the camp without informing the management during the April 2-8 training session in Karachi. Their unauthorized outing resulted in a road accident, causing injuries to two players who are currently receiving medical treatment. The PCB has taken disciplinary action against the players involved, although Naqvi acknowledged that the incident involving half of the team, was initially kept private.

He mentioned, “They ended up getting involved in a road accident with at least two players getting intense injuries and they are now under treatment.”

Recognizing the gravity of the situation, the PCB has appointed a senior security police officer to ensure strict adherence to camp rules and curfew timings. Naqvi expressed concern that the incident had a detrimental impact on the team’s performance in the ODI series against the West Indies, particularly due to the injury sustained by key player Fatima Sana.

He further mentioned, “What they did was wrong and as a result, we have now appointed a full-time senior rank security police officer to be with the team round the clock and enforce proper timings.”

Naqvi did not elaborate on the extent of Fatima Sana’s injury, although she surprisingly participated in all three matches of the ODI series, which Pakistan ultimately lost 0-3. Sana also played in the first T20I match on April 26 and notably, was sidelined from the 2nd T20I.

In an official statement, the PCB provided an update on the condition of two players, Bismah Maroof and Ghulam Fatima, who were involved in a minor car accident. Both players received immediate medical attention and are under the care of the PCB medical team. Despite sustaining minor injuries, precautionary CT scans showed no serious damage. Maroof, now retired, and Fatima were part of the training camp for the upcoming series against the West Indies.

The PCB press release mentioned, “Despite sustaining minor injuries, both players received immediate first aid and are currently under the care of the PCB medical team.”

Additionally, Naqvi mentioned that the PCB is in talks with a prominent foreign coach for the position of head coach of the Pakistan women’s team, emphasizing the board’s commitment to enhancing the team’s coaching staff.

He mentioned, “We are talking to a high-profile foreign coach.”

In the ongoing white-ball series, running from April 18 to May 3, 2024, the three ODIs have concluded, with Hayley Matthews leading the West Indies to victory in all three matches against Pakistan. Following the ODI leg, the series of five T20Is has the West Indies leading 2-0, with three matches remaining to be played.
