PREVIEW

With the T20 World Cup around the corner, Bangladesh is set to play a short series at home against Zimbabwe. It will serve as a good warm up for the home team as they are in the same group as South Africa and Sri Lanka with Nepal and Netherlands rounding of the group.

Bangladesh (BAN) have been a force to be reckoned with in their own home conditions. The series against Zimbabwe will allow the hosts to get their players back in rhythm for the huge tournament ahead.

Zimbabwe (ZIM), on the other hand, will not be playing in the tournament but will want to make a statement. Sikandar Raza and his men will be looking to not only put the hosts under pressure but also make a statement with their performances during the series.

PITCH REPORT

Considering the hot and humid conditions being witnessed in the subcontinent, the pitch could help the team batting second. The best time to bat will be when the ball is hard and new as there will be good carry on the wicket. The spinners will come into play towards the latter half of the game. There could be a bit of dew in the second half aiding the chasing team.

Litton Das BAN | WK

One of the best batters and wicketkeepers for Bangladesh in the last few years, Liton Das is known to provide rousing starts with the bat. The 29-year-old will want to keep his good batting form going ahead of the T20I World Cup and play a key role during the series.

Sikandar Raza ZIM | ALL

The veteran Zimbabwean has been playing IPL for Punjab Kings and has been one of the best players for his national side. The 37-year-old has the ability to bat well and also bowl with variations to outfox the opposition.

Jaker Ali

BAN | WK

Despite having good talent with the bat, Jaker Ali hasn't been in good nick with the bat in recent times. The 26-year-old will want to change this when he will be playing against Zimbabwe and look to find his lost touch.

7.5

Wellington Masakadza

ZIM | BOWL

Just two wickets from the last five games doesn't make good reading for a bowler of the quality of Wellington Masakadza. The veteran spinner though should relish bowling in the Bangladeshi conditions where there will be help for the slower bowlers.
