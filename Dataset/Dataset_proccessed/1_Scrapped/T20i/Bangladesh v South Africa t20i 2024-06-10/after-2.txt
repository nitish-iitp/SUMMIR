The dead-ball rule is in the spotlight again after a controversial call in the match

South Africa marched ever so closer to the Super 8s stage of the T20 World Cup after their last-over thriller against Bangladesh in New York on Monday, June 10. South Africa successfully defended 113 to deny Bangladesh a famous win as the Proteas broke the hearts of the thousands of Bangladeshi fans at the Nassau County Cricket Ground.

113 became the lowest total defended by South Africa in men's T20 World Cup history. South Africa also extended their unbeaten record over Banngladesh, taking their head-to-head record to 9-0.

South Africa are all but through to the Super 8s after having won their first three matches. They are on top of Group D table with 6 points, 4 more than second-placed Bangladesh. South Africa only have Nepal to face in their last group stage game on June 14.

Bangladesh's near-miss in their chase came a day after a timid Pakistan side failed in their chase of 120 against their arch-rivals India at the same venue. In fact, the game was played on the same pitch and Bangladesh got the chase done on a pitch that was slowing down as the match progressed.

Despite the defeat, the highlight of Bangladesh's chase was 23-year-old Towhid Hridoy, who came up with a brave effort, making sure he released the pressure with boundaries whenever the team needed them. Towhid hit 2 boundaries and as many sixes for his 34-ball 37. Towhid Hridoy was crucial to Bangladesh's win over Sri Lanka in their T20 World Cup opener at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas last week. Hridoy was at his aggressive best against the islanders as he had smashed 40 off 20, including 4 sixes, in their successful chase of 128.

Bangladesh needed the experience of Mahmadullah once again in the end overs as the senior campaigner held his nerves after Towhid was dismissed in the 18th over by Kagiso Rabada. Mahmadullah held fort with Jaker Ali to take the game deep. Bangladesh needed 11 runs in the last over and South Africa was tasked with the responsibility of bowling the high-pressure over to the left-arm spinner.

However, Mahmadullah was not able to deliver the knockout punch in the end, missing an opportunity to hit a full toss into the stand when Bangladesh needed six runs in the last two balls.

DEAD BALL RULE UNDER SCANNER, AGAIN!

The controversial dead-ball rule over DRS calls sparked another controversy. In the 17th over, Ottneil Baartman appealed for an LBW against Mahamadullah and the decision was given in favour of the South Africa pacer by the on-field umpire. However, upon review, the decision was overturned. Bangladesh were robbed four runs as the ball had gone to the boundary for a 4 leg-bye. However, the extra runs were not given as the decision by on-field umpire to adjudge Mahmadullah LBW was given before the ball went to the boundary.

Mahmudullah was wrongly given out LBW, the ball went for four leg byes. The decision was reversed on DRS. Bangladesh didn't get the 4 runs as ball is dead once batter given out, even if wrongly. And SA ended up winning the game by 4 runs. Feel for Bangladesh fans. #SAvBAN #T20WC — Wasim Jaffer (@WasimJaffer14) June 10, 2024

Questions were asked about the rule once again. Former India cricketer Wasim Jaffer did not hold back as he blamed the rule for Bangladesh's heartbreaking loss to South Africa.

BANGLADESH PACERS IMPRESS

Earlier in the day, Tanzim Sakib picked 3 wickets in the powerplay, rattling the South African top-order after Aiden Markram won the toss and opted to bat on a used pitch in New York. In the first over, Tanzim got the wicket of Reeza Hendricks for 0. He then returned to get Quinton de Kock for 18 in his second over. It was revenge time for the right-arm pacer as he managed to disturb the woodwork of the left-handed opener after the South Africa star smashed him for a couple of sixes.

Tanzim also got the wicket of Tristan Stubbs for 0 as he finished with figures of 3 for 18. His partner in crime on Monday was Taskin Ahmed, who got the wickets of Aiden Markram and Heinrich Klaasen.

Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller stitched a 79-run stand for the 5th wicket -- a record for South Africa in men's T20 World Cup 2024. Barring that partnership, South Africa struggled to get any sort of momentum into their innings and were restricted to 113 for 6 in their quota of 20 overs.
