Goodbye for now

That’s it from our live coverage of Bangladesh against South Africa.

It was another thriller at the T20 World Cup 2024, which is truly serving up some treats.

The Proteas hold their nerve on another low-scoring pitch in New York and are on the verge of qualification for the Super Eights. But Bangladesh will remain confident after a strong showing.

Do join us for Pakistan against Canada on Tuesday if you can.

For now, though – from me, Kevin Hand – it’s goodbye!

South Africa captain Markram ‘nervous and tired’

“You’re always going to be pretty nervous in a final over finish. It has you on edge and leaves you quite tired, but makes for good entertainment for those watching and hopefully they enjoyed it,” Markram said at the post-match ceremony.

“Exceptional showing [from Miller and Klaasen] and we put them under quite a bit of pressure and Miller has done it in back-to-back games now and fantastic for Klaasen to get the runs and get some form back.”

Bangladesh captain Najmul says his side ‘should have won’

“Everyone was a bit nervous. We thought they would get the big shots and we would win, but it was just not happening,” Najmul told the post-match ceremony.

“This is the match that we should have won, that’s what we said, but they bowled very well as well and that’s cricket.

“Rishad is very good and the way he bowled in the last couple of series has been fantastic. I hope he can continue his form.

“The support is very entertaining and they always come to watch us. I hope they will come to the West Indies as well.”

South Africa’s Klaasen is Player of the Match

“That was not nice on the heart, but great that the boys got it over the line,” Klaasen said on being awarded Player of the Match after his 46 off 44.

“The wicket is not too great for stroke play on it, but we had some good preparation and applied it nicely today. Luckily we have a lot of experience in the changing room.

“We’ve had three pressurised games now, and I think we are through. So hopefully, we can keep going in the next stage.”

South Africa have one foot in the Super Eights

That’s three from three to begin for the Proteas, who have one more game to play, and they are as good as qualified. Bangladesh may need to win both their remaining games.

The lowest total defended in a T20 by South Africa

And that’s 9-0 to South Africa in the head-to-head between the sides.

It’s also the lowest target Bangladesh have failed to chase in a T20.

So close and so much drama

It’s another low-scoring thriller in New York. For as much criticism as the pitch is receiving, it is serving up some cracking matches.

Bangladesh won’t feel so, though.
