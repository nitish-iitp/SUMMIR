Indian all-rounder Krishnappa Gowtham has found it very emotional to see himself as the most expensive uncapped Indian player in the IPL history to be picked up at 9.25 crores. The Chennai Super Kings in search of an off-spin all-rounder went all out for Gowtham in the recently concluded auction and the 32-year-old just played two games in last year’s IPL before being released by the Punjab team.

Krishnappa Gowtham broke into the scene in the 2018 auction where he was picked up by Rajasthan Royals for a good price and did show his all-round skills in the edition. He won the game for Royals single-handedly against Mumbai and also stitched a useful partnership in a run chase against CSK in 2018. However owing to some average outings in the next season, he was traded to Punjab in the 2020 transfer window.

“I Never Had Any Kind Of Numbers In My Mind” – K Gowtham

Krishnappa Gowtham told that he did not fancy this happening in the auction and was surprised to bag a huge sum of money. He explained the emotions that were going through with his family, his wife and added that he enjoyed every moment of the day.

“I never had any kind of numbers in my mind. I never believed even when the auction was happening that this would actually happen. When it all got over, I was literally shivering but at the same time I was very happy. My family was also very happy. I was constantly talking to my wife; a lot of emotions were running through. I enjoyed every bit of it,” Krishnappa Gowtham told IANS from Ahmedabad.

You Can’t Go Out There With A Price Tag On Your Mind – K Gowtham

The IPL has seen a lot of players bagging a lot of money in the auction and not performing up to the price tag. Gowtham was keen to get the price tag out of his head which could be an added pressure during the game. He told me that he wants to go out there and play the way he knows at best to get the best performances.

“It doesn’t put any pressure on me. I have played so many domestic matches. It is all about the experience, about domestic experience. It is about how you turn it into energy. You can’t go out there with a price tag on your mind.

“You can’t really give it all when you are constantly thinking about the price tag. I don’t think you can ever perform or be the way you want to be with price tag [on your mind]. You have to go out there and play the way you have to. That is how I am going to think and approach the game [IPL],” he explained.

K Gowtham has a lot of experience in the domestic circuit with 166 wickets in 42 first-class games.
