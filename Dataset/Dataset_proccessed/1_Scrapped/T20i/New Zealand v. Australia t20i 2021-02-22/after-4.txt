KEY HIGHLIGHTS
Glenn Maxwell joined Virat Kohli's Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) for Rs 14.25 crore at the IPL 2021 auction
Maxwell played his first international match against New Zealand after signing for RCB ahead of IPL 2021
Maxwell was trolled for his horror show against the Black Caps

"Can't wait to put everything I have into helping us lift the trophy," Glenn Maxwell had shared a special message for Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) fans after the Australian all-rounder signed a mammoth deal with the Virat Kohli-led side at the recently concluded Indian Premier League (IPL) 2021 auction in Chennai on Thursday. Playing his first international game for Australia after joining RCB ahead of IPL 2021, Maxwell was expected to showcase his batting heroics against New Zealand in the series opener on Monday. 

However, Maxwell failed to deliver the goods against the Black Caps as the explosive batsman showcased a rare batting failure in the 1s T20I at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch. Maxwell lasted for five deliveries and the flamboyant batsman only scored a solitary run against the Black Caps. Taking cognisance of Maxwell's horror show against the Kane Williamson-led side, fans of the gentlemen's game were quick to mock RCB's marquee signing on social media. 

"Glenn Maxwell missed his century by 99 runs," one user wrote on the microblogging site. "Before #IPL auction, #GlennMaxwell #KyleJamieson were in great form. Then #RCB bought them for ₹ 14.25 cr and ₹ 15 cr respectively, and rest is history," another user poked fun at the RCB superstars after the conclusion of the 1st T20I between Australia and hosts New Zealand. 

Before #IPL auction, #GlennMaxwell #KyleJamieson were in great form. Then #RCB bought them for ₹ 14.25 cr and ₹ 15 cr respectively, and rest is history.

Maxwell : 1 run (5 balls)
Jamieson: 3 overs - 32 runs

Maxwell was bought by the Kohli-led side for Rs 14.25 crore at the IPL 2021 auction. Maxwell, who was released by Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) on retention day, triggered a bidding war between RCB, Chennai Super Kings (CSK), and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) at the Chennai event.
