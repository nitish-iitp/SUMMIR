RCB Trolled Heavily ONCE AGAIN After Kane Richardson, Daniel Sams & Glenn Maxwell Jointly Concede 91 Runs During NZ vs AUS 1st T20I 2021 (Read Tweets)
If one were, to sum up, Australia’s day on the field today, mediocre would be still a better word to describe their performance in the 1st T20I game against New Zealand. The two teams locked horns against each other at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch. They were outplayed by the Kiwis in every department of the match.

If one were, to sum up, Australia’s day on the field today, mediocre would be still a better word to describe their performance in the 1st T20I game against New Zealand. The two teams locked horns against each other at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch. They were outplayed by the Kiwis in every department of the match. When it comes to bowling, Kane Richardson, Daniel Sams and Glenn Maxwell jointly conceded 91 runs and this caused a worry for all the fans of the Royal Challengers Bangalore.  Reason? Cause all the three players will be donning the RCB colours for IPL 2021. Wasim Jaffer Has a Hilarious Take on Australia’s Playing XI Against New Zealand, 1st T20I 2021, Says, ‘#NZvAUS or #NZvRCB?”

No sooner the fans saw the scorecard, they trolled RCB as the franchise had picked up all three for quite a whopping sum. Kane Richardson was picked for Rs 14 crore. Daniel Sams also joined the RCB from Delhi Capitals. For Glenn Maxwell, the franchise paid Rs. 14.25 crore. Now the performances of these cricketers in the first T20I against New Zealand was disastrous. During the match, Daniel Sams gave away 40 runs from four overs bagging a couple of wickets whereas Richardson got no wicket and conceded 42 runs from four overs. Glenn Maxwell couldn’t do much with the bat or the ball. He bowled only for one over and gave away nine runs and with the bat, he just contributed with a run from five balls. Josh Phillippe also made his way to the pavilion on a score of 2.

Thus, RCB once again bore the brunt and were roasted by the fans. Check out the tweets below:

Needless to say, it was quite a bad outing for RCB overseas contingent. But sadly RCB once again had to bear the brunt.  The fans must be hoping to have a better outcome in the next T20I match which will be held on February 25, 2021.
