Australia vs Afghanistan Live Cricket Score, T20 WC 2022, 38th Match, Super 12 Group 1: Australia have beaten Afghanistan in a nailbiting contest by the slimmest of the margins. Rashid Khan right at the end produced some fireworks with his blistering 48 of just 23 balls. However, They fell short by four runs. On the other hand, Australia had other things in their mind like the mere matter of qualifying for the World Cup Semifinals. The pressure showed throughout the game. During their batting innings, they looked like they will be able to make 200 runs when Glenn Maxwell 54(32) and Marcus Stoinis 25(21) were batting together but they collapsed because of some brilliant death bowling by Naveen-ul-Haq whose four overs went for 21 runs and he picked three for. In their bowling innings, after a substantial partnership between Gulbadin Naib 39(23) and Ibrahim Zaidan 26(33), Australia bought themselves back into the game at one stage Afghanistan was 101/5. However, the pendulum swung again when Rashid tonked a few. All in all another timid performance by the Aussies has put their semis chances in Jeopardy. Sri Lanka has to beat England tomorrow at SCG for Australia to go through or else that’s that for the defending champions.

Australia: 168/8 Glen Maxwell 54(32), Mitchell Marsh 45(30) Naveen-ul-Haq 3-21(4)

Afghanistan: 164-7 Rashid Khan 48(23), Gulbadin Naib 39(23) Adam Zampa 2-22(4)

Player of the match: Glenn Maxwell

AUS vs AFG LIVE: Australia: 168/8

Australia trying to make a big total on the board lost the plot completely at the death. What looked like 180 was a definite possibility while Stoinis and Maxwell were batting together was curtailed to 168 due to the fall of wickets at regular intervals. Afghanistan on the other hand like Australia had a mixed day. They dropped Mitchel Marsh early on his innings he then went on to make a decent 45. Other than that they kept bowling tight lines and lengths and kept picking wickets. Naveen-Ul-Haq had a brilliant spell picking three wickets for 21 runs. Maxwell was the top scorer of the innings with 54 runs.

Australia have set Afghanistan a target of 169 ?

AUS vs AFG LIVE: Attack!!

The mantra that the Aussies have opted for today. They have come out with all guns blazing right from the word go.

It hasn't been completely fruitfully but guess what they are scoring at nine runes per over so who cares how many wickets are down?

Marcus Stoinus and Glenn Maxwell have kept ?? going to take them to 112/4 after 13 overs. @imnaveenulhaq picked 2 whereas @fazalfarooqi10 and @Mujeeb_R88 bagged one wicket each. #AfghanAtalan | #T20WorldCup | #SuperCola | #AFGvAUS pic.twitter.com/HGIB4RqxgN
