Minecraft 1.21 Update Lighten Up Advancement Details, Guide

One of the several new innovations Mojang Studios plans to release with the next version of Minecraft, 1.21, is Lighten Up. The majority of these improvements are related to the new features that the release will provide. 

In particular, Lighten Up is linked to the new copper bulb blocks that the developers want to install in the near future. 

Interacting with the new light-emitting block is exciting due to its unique characteristic. 

Minecraft 1.21 Lighten Up

You need to locate or make a new block first since the Lighten Up advancement is connected on the new copper light. Three copper blocks, one flame rod, and one redstone dust make up the crafting recipe.

As an alternative, the new trial chamber building included in the Minecraft 1.21 update has organically produced copper bulbs. 

Deep under the Overworld realm, the chamber will create anywhere from Y level 0 to -40. The majority of trial chamber lighting will come from copper bulbs, which will make finding them easier.

A unique oxidation effect was introduced to copper by Mojang Studios when it was originally shown as a new material and block. 

This implied that any copper block will eventually turn green in color and texture from orange. Because copper bulbs are formed of the same metal, this also applies to them. 

Because these blocks in Minecraft shed light, the creators gave oxidation a special effect. The block will progressively lose light as the copper bulb oxidizes.

You must either wait for the freshly constructed copper bulb to oxidize or locate an already-oxidized block in the trial chambers in order to obtain the Lighten Up improvement.

Take your axe and strike the oxidised copper block that is radiating a faint glow after you have located it. In essence, this will let you scrape the oxidized portions off the copper bulb in Minecraft and restore the block’s brightness. 

Since you’ve managed to light up the copper bulb, this will enable the Lighten Up advancement.
