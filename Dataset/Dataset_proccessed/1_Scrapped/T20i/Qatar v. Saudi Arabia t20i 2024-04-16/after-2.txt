Boston Marathon Update

Sisay Lemma scorched the first half of the Boston Marathon course on Monday, setting a record pace to build a lead of more than half of a mile.

Then the weather heated up, and the 34-year-old Ethiopian slowed down.

Rupinder Pal Singh On India's 0-5 Drubbing In Australia

"Australia's hard press can be countered, high level of coordination is required for that, defender-to-defender ball transfer, quick passes from defenders to the mid-field, overhead passes would be useful in countering such a style of play," the 33-year-old Rupinder Pal Singh suggested.

He sees no fault in India's reliance on penalty corners for scoring.

"...all international teams, all are dependent on penalty corners -- the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Australia. Defences have become stronger, here PC conversion is such an important tool that in every match about 1-2 goals have to be scored from them," he pointed out. (PTI)

Even without the help of Apollo, the flame that is to burn at the Paris Olympics was kindled Tuesday at the site of the ancient games in southern Greece.

Cloudy skies prevented the traditional lighting, when an actress dressed as an ancient Greek priestess uses the sun to ignite a silver torch — after offering up a symbolic prayer to Apollo, the ancient Greek sun god.

Game Of Sixes Not Batsmanship: Finch On RCB Vs SRH

"It was never going to be a game where you talk about batsmanship. It's a game where you talk about who hit the most sixes and that was the difference," Aaron Finch said on Star Sports.

Finch said the Hyderabad side used the Powerplay segment well.

"They (SRH) were getting lucky in the first powerplay and they needed those sixes and Travis Head was the difference there."

Paris Olympics: Grand Opening Ceremony Squeezed By Security And Transport Issues
