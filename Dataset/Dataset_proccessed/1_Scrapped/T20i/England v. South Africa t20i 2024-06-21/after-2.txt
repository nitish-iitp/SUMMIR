England vs South Africa Commentary
6:30 PM IST Right then, this is it from this action-packed marquee clash where South Africa took the game away from England. South Africa are now the table-toppers in Group B maintaining a clean sheet, and England on the other hand will be gutted as they were too close yet too far in the end. Well, the clash lived up to its billing, and the fans were treated with an absolute humdinger. The action continues and things are spicing up in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, 2024 as next up in the Super 8 phase is an exciting clash between both the hosts of this prestigious competition going up against each other. West Indies will be taking on the USA in another highly anticipated clash of Group B. This game will begin on Saturday, 22nd June and the first ball will be bowled at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT). But you can surely join us for the pre-match build-up. Till then, take care and cheers.
6:29 PM IST Aiden Markram, the captain of South Africa says that specifically today when it got to the final three overs, the odds were against them but the bowlers held their nerves. Adds that Quinton de Kock and Reeza Hendricks took on the Powerplay well for them and they knew they needed to squeeze in the middle and save runs in the field and are on the right track. Mentions that every match is going to be a challenge and applauds a few of the players who have stepped up and he doesn't want to dig too deep and just trusts the guys and their abilities. Adds that you need to give the bowler the freedom to bowl his best delivery first and then take the pitch into consideration and goes on to laud Harry Brook and Liam Livingstone for their efforts. He ends by reflecting on the crucial catch he took and says that it was one of his most important ones.
6:27 PM IST Jos Buttler, the skipper of England starts by appreciating Quinton de Kock as says he came in with a lot of intent and they couldn't match up with the bat, and also mentions that they were 20 runs behind in the Powerplay. Adds they did well with the ball and came in brilliantly. He appreciates Liam Livingstone and Harry Brook for putting up a good fight and almost taking away the game from South Africa. Ends up by saying they are still very much in the competition and they have played really good brand of cricket but just couldn't get across the line and that they still believe
6:10 PM IST Quinton de Kock is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his brilliant innings early in the game. De Kock starts by saying that a couple of night games early on have led everyone to believe that it is a very high-scoring pitch but it is quite different in the day game. Adds that his plan was just to bat and score heavily and the wicket was good early on and had a nice bounce too. Mentions that he takes it game by game and starts off from scratch. Reckons that they bowled well, especially in the Powerplay which was the best time to score runs and to defend 160 on a decent wicket was a good effort from them.
6:10 PM IST The Presentation ceremony...
6:08 PM IST Earlier in the game, South Africa started off steady, but then Quinton de Kock shifted gears and gave the pacers a rough time. They sailed through the powerplay without any hiccups. Once the fielding restrictions were lifted, and spinners came on, runs were at a premium as they squeezed and stemmed the flow of runs. No batter barring Quinton de Kock was at ease at the crease and wickets kept falling with QDK too perishing eventually on 65. Jofra Archer, expensive in his first over, picked a brilliant 3-fer and the others too chipped in big time and didn't give away too many. Jos Buttler in particular, was sensational behind the wickets and made a solid impact. David Miller and Tristan Stubbs played crucial clutch cameos in the backend, propelling South Africa to get 160. Into the chase, as they call it a game of two halves, the momentum swung in favor of both sides but eventually, it was the South Africans who held their nerves of steel and won this cracker of a game.
