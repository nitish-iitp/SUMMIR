The 28th match of the T20 World Cup 2022 will witness Bangladesh and Zimbabwe squaring off at The Gabba in Brisbane. While Bangladesh have won a game and lost one, Zimbabwe are still unbeaten in the tournament as their first game was washed out due to rains, and they beat Pakistan in their second match.

Bangladesh bagged a win off their first game against the Netherlands but were handed a disappointing defeat in the second clash against South Africa. They will be looking for a win to keep their hopes high in the tournament, whereas Zimbabwe would be looking to repeat the heroics from their previous game and bag their second consecutive victory.

Match Details
Bangladesh vs Zimbabwe, Match 28, T20 World Cup 2022

Venue: The Gabba, Brisbane

Date and Time: October 30, 2022, 8:30 AM IST

Telecast & Live Streaming: Star Sports Network

Pitch Report

The Gabba pitch is a venue where pacers frequently enjoy rolling their arms because it provides them with good, consistent bounce and carry, particularly in the opening phase. The batters enjoy this location for the same reason—they can trust the bounce and play the shots, and the superb outfield adds excellent value to their hitting.

Probable Playing XIs for BAN vs ZIM
Bangladesh:

Najmul Hossain Shanto, Soumya Sarkar, Litton Das, Shakib Al Hasan (c), Afif Hossain, Yasir Ali, Nurul Hasan (w), Mosaddek Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Hasan Mahmud

Zimbabwe:

Wesley Madhevere, Craig Ervine (c), Milton Shumba, Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Regis Chakabva (wk), Ryan Burl, Luke Jongwe, Brad Evans, Richard Ngarava, Blessing Muzarabani

Probable Top Performers from BAN vs ZIM
Probable best batter: Sikandar Raza

The prolific middle-order batter, and one of the senior players of the Zimbabwean team, Sikandar Raza has helped his team bag some crucial wins of late, and his contributions have been very helpful for the team. He has managed to anchor the innings and take the game deep, and will play an important role in the upcoming match.

Probable best bowler: Blessing Muzarabani

The young pacer has proved to be promising in the tournament and will be the one to look out for in the upcoming game. The pitch is pacer-friendly, and Muzarabani will be able to use it to his advantage, thereby providing his side with breakthroughs.
