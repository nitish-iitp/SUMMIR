Bangladesh have sealed victory over Zimbabwe by three runs in the T20 World Cup after a dramatic final delivery at the Gabba had to be rebowled.

Key points:
Blessing Muzarabani got a second chance to snatch a win for Zimbabwe, but couldn't cash in
Muzarabani was stumped from the final ball of the match, but the keeper had taken the ball ahead of the stumps
The umpires called players back on the field to rebowl the last delivery

With Zimbabwe requiring five runs to win off the last ball, tailender Blessing Muzarabani appeared to be stumped off the bowling of spinner Mosaddek Hossain.

But wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan was found to have gloved the ball in front of the stumps before taking off the bails, a no-ball under the rules.

The players had left the field but, following a DRS review, were recalled for the last ball with four runs now required.

Muzarabani had a free hit but missed the ball.

Bangladesh opener Najmul Hossain Shanto (71 off 55 balls) had powered his team to 7-150 batting first.

Bangladesh appeared in control for most of the chase but with 16 needed from the last over Zimbabwe tailender Richard Ngarava hit a four and huge six from the third and fourth deliveries to leave just five required.

Ngarava was then stumped before the final dramatic delivery.

A blistering spell by Bangladesh paceman Taskin Ahmed (3-19) inspired the win that kept his side's semi-final hopes alive.

It took a wonderful run out by skipper Shakib Al Hasan to get Bangladesh home in the end after a superb fightback by Zimbabwe.

Zimbabwe needed 82 off the final eight overs and veteran Sean Williams (62 off 42 ) and Ryan Burl (27 off 25) whittled that down to 19 off nine balls when Al Hasan ran out Williams with a turn and throw in one motion from his own bowling to seal the deal.

The win took Bangladesh to four points in Group Two but they are still to play India and Pakistan.

The loss was a dent to Zimbabwe's finals chances and they remain on three points.

Ahmed's haul made him the leading wicket taker in the Super 12 segment of the tournament to date, with eight.

Earlier Shanto posted his highest international score in the format after suffering hamstring issues earlier in his innings.

Shanto lost his opening partner Soumya Sarkar in the second over but combined with Al Hasan (23) in a 54-run stand for the third wicket that ensured their bowlers had something to defend.
