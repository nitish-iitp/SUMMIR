10.36pm The Super 12s are done. It's time for the semis. It's New Zealand vs Pakistan on Wednesday in Sydney, and India s England on Thursday in Adelaide. We look forward to your company for those games, but don't go anywhere just yet, because we'll have plenty of post-match content going up very soon. We hope you've enjoyed our coverage. Until next time, it's goodbye from me, Andrew and Thilak.

Rohit Sharma: "A very good all-round performance, something we were looking for. We had qualified, but we wanted to come out and play the way we wanted to play, which we achieved. What SKY is doing for the team is remarkable, just coming out there, playing that way, taking the pressure off the others. We know his ability, and it allows the guy at the other end to take his time. The dugout can really be at ease when he bats, and he's shown a lot of composure when he's batted. We expected this from him, and he's gone from strength to strength. The key for us will be to adjust quickly to the conditions. We have played a game there, but we need to adjust quickly. England are a good team, and it will be a great contest. We should take pride in qualifying, firstly, and if we play that semi-final well, we have another big game as well. It's about understanding the lines and lengths - the square boundaries are shorter - and executing well. The fans have been brilliant all this while, almost everywhere we have gone we've got a full house, and we expect the same in the semi-finals as well. On behalf of the team I'd really like to thank them."

Craig Ervine: "I think maybe we could have changed up a couple of other plans. Suryakumar was brilliant at the end, negated Richey's wide yorkers, which was our main plan. We could maybe have changed our pace a bit more there. Leading up to the tournament, we went in looking to be positive at the top, but the last 2-3 games we kind of went away from there. The ball was swinging, but to counter that we probably could have moved around a little bit, been more proactive. We mustn't forget the work we did to get into the Super 12s. We'll look to build on that. Our catching wasn't so good in the last few games, but I know the boys worked really hard on that."

Suryakumar Yadav is the Player of the Match. "I think the plan was very clear when me and Hardik were batting. He said let's take the positive route and see where we end up. We started hitting the ball well and never stopped till the 20th over. The atmosphere in the team is very nice, and the build-up to the knockouts has been very nice. My plan is always clear. I'm not trying anything different. I bat the same way in the nets as well. [On his 2022:] Feels really good, but coming out and starting from zero is what I always think when I come out to bat, and I'll keep doing that. It's good to see people come out and support us like this even after we've qualified."

"I don't take much pressure because I know I've faced bigger problems" - From losing both parents early in his life to now being ready to take over the reins from Indian hockey legend, PR Sreejesh, in goal, Krishan Pathak has come a long way. Read more, here.

Meanwhile, in Indian badminton, Sankar Muthusamy's silver at the BWF Jr. World Championships put him in the company of the likes of Aparna Popat and Saina Nehwal, but he has his sights aimed higher - success in the senior circuit. Read more, here.

Afeef: "Sikandar Raza had a phenomenal tournament. Deserves to be Player of the Tournament."

Moti Prakash: "The biggest news is Ned qualified for the next WT20 whereas Zim, Ban, Ire, and Afg have to play qualifiers."

Arun: "India simply has to pick Chahal for the semi-final with Axar in miserable form. Has not scored any runs, and has not found a way to take wickets or be economical." -- India would be compromising their batting depth in a big way if they did that, though.

10.20pm The semi-finals line-up has been decided now. It'll be New Zealand vs Pakistan at the SCG, and India vs England at Adelaide Oval. India top Group 2, not only with more points than anyone else, but they've also lifted their net run rate above Pakistan's. A thumping win today, set up by another brilliant innings from Suryakumar Yadav, and finished off by the fast bowlers, who reduced Zimbabwe to 36 for 5 before Sikandar Raza and Ryan Burl saved some face.

Jayeshds: "What a competitive super 12,the lower half giving good fight to upper half in group and each team won at least a game. "

karguvel: "Initially I was thinking group 2 is weaker group and India must win matches against SA and PAK to qualify. Finally it turned out to be more entertaining group "

Axar Patel to Chatara, OUT

And that is that. Ball holds up on the pitch slightly as Axar bowls back of a length. Looks to make room, possibly to hit into the off side, but the ball stops and keeps going with the angle. Ends up playing a half-flick, half-punch, and Axar moves smartly to his right to take a shoulder-high return catch

Tendai Chatara c & b Patel 4 (4b 1x4 0x6 11m) SR: 100

Axar Patel to Chatara, FOUR runs

Full on leg stump, and Chatara picks up a boundary. Clears his front leg and drives flat and cleanly down the ground, beating long-on to his left

Well, here's Axar again. Can he finish this quickly? Slip in place. Left-arm round.

Mukesh Kumar: "Axar looked India's best bowler in last home series against Aussies, now he looks like the weakest link in this bowling line up." -- Tells you how much conditions and match-ups matter.

16.5
•
Hardik to Muzarabani, no run

Does well to miss that. Back of a length in the corridor, nips away off the deck, and he's beaten trying to defend

In walks Blessing Muzarabani. How much further can he and Chatara stretch this innings?

FahadMQ : "Can Zim borrow SKY for the last 3 overs to make the game exciting "

Hawk: "What is this variation of Ashwin where both balls have a lot of overspin but one stays low and the other one bounces high?" -- The first one had to have hit some sort of odd spot on the pitch. No way was it deliberate! Ashwin looked quite sheepish after getting that wicket.

16.4
W
Hardik to Raza, OUT

Shortish offcutter, angling into leg stump, and Raza takes on the pull and takes on the two leg-side boundary riders. Doesn't really get hold of it, and SKY moves a few steps to his right and takes a simple catch at deep midwicket

Sikandar Raza c Yadav b Pandya 34 (24b 3x4 0x6 53m) SR: 141.66

1w
Hardik to Raza, 1 wide

Sees Raza looking to make room, tries to follow him, and concedes a wide as Raza steps out of the way smartly, a la Ashwin vs Nawaz

Samrat Ahuja: "For a moment, read Tendai Chatara at 10, as Tendulkar walks in!!"

•
Ashwin to Chatara, no run

Loopy offbreak with a lot of overspin, pitching outside off and ripping in with lots of bounce. Looks to drive against the turn and he's beaten and smacked on the side of his stomach

Tendai Chatara is Zimbabwe's No. 10. Over the wicket. Slip in place for the right-hander.

15.5
W
Ashwin to Ngarava, OUT

Keeps low, and Ashwin bags his third. Back of a length offbreak, bowled with a lot of overspin, and that would normally mean extra bounce, but it ends up sliding through at below knee height, and Ngarava, attempting to swipe it to long-on, ends up losing his off stump

Richard Ngarava b Ashwin 1 (2b 0x4 0x6 4m) SR: 50

Back round the wicket to Ngarava.

15.4
1
Ashwin to Raza, 1 run

Flatter, turning in towards middle and off, makes room and punches to long-off

15.3
•
Ashwin to Raza, no run

Slow offbreak pitching on leg stump, turns past the attempted slog-sweep and Pant completes another excellent leg-side take

Over the wicket to Raza.

15.2
1
Ashwin to Ngarava, 1 run

Flighted offbreak outside off, whipped against the turn to deep square leg

Ashwin's pulled things back nicely after that expensive first over. Richard Ngarava is the new man. Another left-hander. Slip in place.

15.1
W
Ashwin to Masakadza, OUT

Got him there, proper offspinner's dismissal. Steps out, and the in-drift makes the left-hander look to work it leg side. But he doesn't get to the pitch of the ball, and it turns to take the leading edge and pop straight to Rohit at short extra-cover

Wellington Masakadza c Sharma b Ashwin 1 (7b 0x4 0x6 8m) SR: 14.28

Ashwin continues. Round the wicket to Masakadza.

Axar Patel to Raza, FOUR runs

Ooh, just clears the deep square leg fielder. Great footwork from Raza to get all the way across to sweep this from well outside off, hits it in the air to the right of SKY, who makes a terrific sprinting effort, but it just eludes his dive

14.2
•
Axar Patel to Raza, no run

Appeal for a stumping after some terrific work from Pant. Quick, fired in flat, angling down leg, and Raza, who was stepping away from leg stump to create room, swipes and misses. Pant had to take that quite a way down the leg side, and then he's so quick to get the bails off. Raza's back toe was down, but the heel was lifted, so the doubt is whether the rest of the foot was behind the line. He's managed to press his foot down just in time
