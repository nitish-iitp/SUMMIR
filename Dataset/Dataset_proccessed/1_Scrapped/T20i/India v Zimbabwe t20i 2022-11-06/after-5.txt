India ends on top of the Group 2, will take England in semi-finals

India ended up on the top of the table of Group 2, with a fantastic win against Zimbabwe by 71 runs. India and Pakistan are the two semi-finalists from Group 2 and will take on England and New Zealand.

India's batting today was top-notch with KL Rahul and Virat Kohli stabilizing the innings after the early dismissal of Rohit Sharma. Zimbabwe bowlers bounced back with three consecutive wickets of KL Rahul, Virat Kohli, and Rishabh Pant. But then, the sun was on the top again with Suryakumar Yadav playing a brilliant knock of 61 runs in just 25 balls and taking India's total to 186.

In bowling, Bhuvneshwar Kumar started with a bang with a wicket on the first ball, and similarly, Arshdeep, Shami, and Pandya also got wickets in their first overs. Zimbabwe lost the first five wickets very early in the game, with Sikandar Raza and Ryan Burl attempting to build a partnership until Ravichandran Ashwin bowled Burl to break that partnership. Zimbabwe had a free fall after that and India won the match by 71 runs.

Rain remains a concern

Only the first of the five World Cup games played in Melbourne so far was untouched by rain. The previous one, between England and Ireland, was shortened, and the previous three were washed out. Expect some assistance for seamers because the pitch will be fresh, but batters should enjoy the ball as it approaches the bat.

India vs Zimbabwe: Weather update

The weather is predicted to cause delays because it is likely to rain all day in Melbourne for this final Super 12s game. There is a 50% probability of rain in Melbourne's northern and northeastern areas, which are close to the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), where the match will be played, according to forecasts by the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology. Thunderstorms have also been forecast by the Bureau for Melbourne's northeastern region in the late afternoon and evening. They might also disrupt the game, which is scheduled to begin at 7 o'clock local time.

India openers looking for form

The half-century Rohit Sharma scored against the Netherlands was shaky. KL Rahul scored 50 off 32 balls against Bangladesh. However, Indian openers have generally failed to offer the team strong beginnings. India has averaged 13 opening stands at a run rate of 4.27 throughout the course of four games. In the competition, only Pakistan and Namibia have had worse beginnings. The India openers will be put to the test once more by Zimbabwe's fast bowlers, especially if they bat first.
