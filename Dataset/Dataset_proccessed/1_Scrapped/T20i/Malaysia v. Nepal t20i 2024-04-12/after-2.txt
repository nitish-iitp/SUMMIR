Nepal, a formidable contender for the title, aims to kick off its ACC Premier Cup campaign with a decisive win over Malaysia today. The highly anticipated match is scheduled to begin at 4:15 PM Nepal Time at Al Amerat Stadium in Oman.

Match Details

Teams: Nepal vs Malaysia
Tournament: ACC Premier Cup
Date: April 12, 2024
Start Time: 4:15 PM Nepal Time
Venue: Al Amerat Stadium, Oman

Tournament Format

The tournament features two groups. Nepal finds itself in a competitive Group ‘A’, alongside Hong Kong, Qatar, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia. Group ‘B’ consists of Oman, UAE, Cambodia, Bahrain, and Kuwait. The ultimate winner of this exciting tournament will earn a coveted spot in the T20 Asia Cup, set to take place after the T20 World Cup.

Nepal’s hopes hinge on the star power of Dipendra Singh Airee, Kushal Malla, and Kushal Bhurtel. The performance of these three key batsmen will be crucial for Nepal’s success.

Malaysia boasts talented batsmen Virandeep Singh, Sharvin Muniandy, and Syed Aziz. If Nepal can dismiss these three quickly, they have a strong chance to control the game. Malaysia’s main bowling weapon is spinner Pawandeep Singh.

Head-to-Head

Nepal holds a significant advantage in the head-to-head record, having won 8 out of 9 T20I matches against Malaysia. Their only loss came in the ACC Eastern Region 2020, where they fell short by 22 runs.

The stage is set for an exciting contest as Nepal seeks to continue its dominance and begin its ACC Premier Cup journey on a winning note.
