Australia vs Ireland live cricket score T20 World Cup 2022

Highlights AUS vs IRE T20 World Cup 2022: Mitchell Starc and Glenn Maxwell reduced Ireland to 25/5 in four overs before Lorcan Tucker stood tall with a fighting half-century to ensure his team won’t give up easily. Ireland were bowled out for 137 in 18.1 overs in chase of 180 as Australia won by 42 runs – their second of the Super 12 stage. Pat Cummins, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Starc and Adam Zampa took a couple of wickets each while Marcus Stoinis chipped in with a wicket as well.

Australia captain Aaron Finch returned to form with a brisk half-century to top-score with 63 off 44  and take his team to 179/5 against Ireland on Monday. Ireland did well in the Powerplay and then middle overs to keep Aussie in checks but the hosts managed to get the big runs in short bursts that got them to a challenging total in the end. For Ireland, Barry McCarthy was the pick of the bowlers with figures of 3/29.

Ireland captain Andrew Balbirnie called it correctly at the coin toss and decided to bowl first against Australia in the Super 12 clash to be played at The Gabba in Brisbane today. Both the teams have won a game each, lost once and saw one being washed out. They have three points each but Ireland are ahead on the table on the basis of a better net run-rate. Balbirine has gone with the same eleven that defeated England in a ran-affected match while Australia have included a fit-again Adam Zampa in place of Ashton Agar.

The Group 1 or Group of Death is living up to the billing with some help from the weather. The washout of the Melbourne double header last week has kept all six teams mathematically alive in the semifinals race although New Zealand seem to be the firm favourites to seal one of the two spots up for grabs. The rest of the pack seems to be in a dogfight for the second spot and Monday’s lone match of the T20 World Cup will help the winner shore up its prospects but it’s quite possible that net run-rate could have the final say with three teams – England, Ireland and Australia – locked on three points each with NRR being the only factor right now that separates them on the points table. This is the first time in 10 years that Australia and Ireland will be squaring off in a T20 clash having last played at the 2012 T20 World Cup.

Australia Climb to Second Spot

A fine display from Australian team as they defeated Ireland by 42 runs for their second win of the Super 12 stage on Monday. Ireland captain Andrew Balbirnie opted to bat first and his opposite number Aaron Finch returned to form with a well-compiled fifty – 63 off 44 – to push them to 179/5 in 20 overs. Ireland bowled well in patches but also allowed Australia to break free in between. Barry McCarthy was the pick of their bowlers who finished with 3/29 from four overs. In reply, Ireland were staring down the barrel after slumping to 25/5 in just four overs with Mitchell Starc and Glenn Maxwell taking a couple of wickets each after Pat Cummins landed the first breakthrough. Thanks to Lorcan Tucker, Ireland avoided the ignominy of a huge defeat. He made an unbeaten 71 off 48 but ran out of partners with Ireland being bowled out for 137 in 18.1 overs. The victory took Australia’s points tally to five and pushed them to the second spot in Group 1. They will next take on Afghanistan in their final Super 12 match on Friday while Ireland face New Zealand on the same day.
