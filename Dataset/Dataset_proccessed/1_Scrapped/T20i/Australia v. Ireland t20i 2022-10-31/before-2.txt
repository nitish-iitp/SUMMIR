Ireland vs England, T20 World Cup 2022 highlights: The match was called off after a rain delay in the 15th over and Ireland ended up recording a stunning win over the star-studded England. 
Ireland vs England, T20 World Cup 2022 highlights

Ireland vs England, T20 World Cup 2022 highlights: England were hardly able to get any momentum going during the chase and rains in the 15th overs sounded the death knell for them. Alex Hales, Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes all fell without scoring too much in the first four overs. Dawid Malan and Harry Brook also could not get the England innings going and while Moeen Ali looked capable of triggering an improbable fightback, it was not enough when it came down to the DLS that was applied when rains came in. Ireland have thus recorded a famous win, their first in the Super 12 stage of a T20 World Cup, and the result now throws Group 1 wide open with five of the six teams now on two points.

T20 World Cup live score: THAT'S THAT! THEY SHAKE HANDS, BIG BIG WIN FOR IRELAND!

Ireland have won by five runs. What a massive win this is. Not only does this seal a first-ever T20 World Cup Super 12 win for them, this also throws the group wide open. This win is no accident, Ireland have been absolutely brilliant throughout this match. Balbirnie, Adair and McCarthy have gone over to the tiny but significant Irish crowd where they are showered with hugs and kisses. Apart from that period where they collapsed in the last five overs of their innings, Ireland have been on top and England just could not get out of jail. Their star-studded batting lineup are yet to do anything significant in this tournament and there is a very good chance that this defeat might just be a death knell for their semi-final spot.

Well would you believe it, just as it looked like England might have a good over, the skies open up and it is pouring.
