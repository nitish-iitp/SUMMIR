Australia has secured a 3-0 clean sweep in their Twenty20 games against South Africa after a Travis Head onslaught inspired them to a five-wicket win in the series finale in Durban.

In reply to South Africa's 8-190 on Sunday at Kingsmead, Head thumped a career-high 91 off 48 balls to help lift Australia to victory with 13 balls to spare.

Josh Inglis (42 off 22 balls) and Marcus Stoinis (37* off 21) joined in on the fun, but Head was an unstoppable force for most of the innings.

Head, whose previous highest score in a T20I was 48 not out, cracked six sixes and eight fours in his blistering knock.

He was given a life on 55 when Temba Bavuma dropped a tough diving attempt.

Bavuma eventually got his man with a catch in the deep, but Australia only needed five more runs for victory by that stage.

Head had posted scores of just 18 and 6 in the first two matches, and his display on Sunday is an ominous warning for South Africa ahead of the upcoming five-match ODI series, starting on September 7.

"It's nice to be back and contributing," Head said.

"There's been limited opportunities in this format for a while. I'd been struggling a little bit to find my tempo and how I wanted to go about it at the top."

Mitch Marsh was named man-of-the-series after plundering 186 runs from 100 balls across his three innings in a stunning start to his reign as captain.

"I'm really proud of a pretty young group coming over here and winning the series 3-0," Marsh said.

"We had a great team effort. We prepared really well, and we took the game on.

"We had a bit of luck at times, but as a team we had the mentality of being really positive."

Handy knocks from Proteas captain Aiden Markram (41 off 23 balls), Reeza Hendricks (42 off 30) and Tristan Stubbs (25 off 16) helped them recover from 2-12 in the third over, and Donovan Ferreira (48 off 21) provided the late fireworks.

But Sean Abbott claimed a double-wicket maiden to inspire the middle-order rot of 3-6, while Stoinis (2-39) did the early damage before being pummelled late.

Abbott finished with career-best figures of 4-31 to restrict South Africa to a total under 200.
