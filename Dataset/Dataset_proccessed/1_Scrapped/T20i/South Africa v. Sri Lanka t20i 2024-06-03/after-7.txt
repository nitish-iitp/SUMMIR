‘Practicing on these drop-in wickets is hard’: Anrich Nortje

South Africa paceman Anrich Nortje was named Player of the Match for his four-fer as he talked about his performance after the match-winning performance.

"Definitely, this will get some momentum going. Tough few days, we've worked hard and it's nice to get some momentum. Very happy, I've been feeling good from the last few games, finally great to have a good game and get a few wickets. The guys did well to restrict them to a low score. Been a while since I got many wickets and was happy to be helpful in the team's win," Nortje said.

The Proteas paceman further talked about the pitch and said that it was a tricky one and admitted that practising on drop-in wickets is hard.

"We needed to assess as quickly as possible (on the conditions), it was up and down at times (on the wicket), I needed to hit my straps, hit the wicket hard, it was important that we got some early wickets. It was a tough one, practicing on these drop-in wickets is hard, we weren't able to bowl on the pitch on the pre-match day, the plans were simple, that helped me, I just need to get my rhythm better in the next few games," he concluded.
