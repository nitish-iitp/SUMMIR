Right then. That's it from the coverage of this game. Sri Lanka still has a game in hand to take a consolation win in the final T20I game of the series. India will be surely eyeing to complete another whitewash in 2022. The final game will be played on 27th at 1900 IST (1330 GMT). But as you all know you can join us early for the build-up. Till then take care and goodbye!

Shreyas Iyer wins the MAN OF THE MATCH AWARD for his exceptional effort with the blade. He says he loves to shuffle across in the crease but sometimes the bowler are smart enough to bowl a yorker. Adds that it was really important to time the ball. Kishan fell but Samson and Jadeja helped to build the partnership. Asked about Kumara bowling his third over, he wasn't thinking much about it. Mentions that the ball wasn't turning much so he started going big and it went with the flow.

Rohit Sharma, the victorious skipper, is in for a chat. On being asked about the tricky start, he says, seeing the middle order step up is really good to see. The guys are taking the responsibilities and completing the game with ease. Says, he does not want to blame the bowlers, the first 15 overs were really good but they need to work on their death bowling. Mentions, all the guys possess a lot of talent, and the side will make sure to give them ample opportunities. Adds, the kind of form Shreyas Iyer is in, it couldn't get any better for the side. On being asked if he will make any changes for the final game. He jokingly replies and says that they will have a word tomorrow and come to a decision. Mentions they have a lot of players in their squad and they need to take care of every individual.

Dasun Shanaka, the Sri Lankan skipper says looking at the conditions, the score was a good one but they should have done better in the Powerply. Adds they have a plan in bowling. Tells the game was set nicely for him to go guns-blazing in the death overs..

Stay tuned for the presentation...

Sanju Samson is in for a chat. He says the wicket was playing nicely and the boundaries were short. He didn't feel the score was a huge one and Shreyas Iyer helped him to get his rhythm. Tells that it's been a long time he played cricket so he needed to get used to the conditions. Informs it was cold out there. They are always told to keep their standards. The condition were difficult but they have enough experience. Ends by saying it is a big day for him as he made his debut 7 years ago today and he is grateful to help his team.

Sri Lanka could not continue the domination with the ball throughout the innings. Sri Lanka were off to a bright start as they sent back the Indian opening pair within the Powerplay. But once the spinners came into the attack. Shreyas Iyer took the bowlers for a ride. The bowlers could not keep things tight in the middle and ended up leaking away aplenty. By the end of the innings, it also looked like Sri Lanka dropped shoulders in the field. In the end, they could not falter the Indian batting attack. Lahiru Kumara picked up a brace.

What a brilliant show with the blade by Shreyas Iyer. He held the key for India during the chase and got his side over the line with the help of some knocks by Samson and Jadeja from the other end. India lost two wickets inside the Powerplay. One would've thought India would be in a lot of trouble with the ball swinging ferociously. But Shreyas Iyer applied himself really well and it looked like as if he was batting on some other deck. First, he built a solid stand with Sanju Samson to steady the ship and later, stitched another solid stand with Ravindra Jadeja to take a 2-nil lead in the series.

OH MY GOD! What an incredible chase by the Indian batters. At one point, it looked like India would slip out but a stand of 58 runs off 26 deliveries for the fourth wicket, made sure to seal the series for the hosts. Sri Lanka could not control the game even after taking quick wickets at the top. This is India's eleventh consecutive T20I victory.
