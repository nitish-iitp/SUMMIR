About Italy Events
Italy Sports Events

Italians are famous for being passionate, and that is especially true when it comes to sports. Football (soccer) is hands-down the most popular sport, with the Serie A league being the pinnacle of Italian football, featuring teams like Juventus, AC Milan, and Inter Milan. The Coppa Italia and the Supercoppa Italiana are other significant football events. On an international level, Italy owns multiple World Cup titles.

Basketball maintains a strong presence, with the Lega Basket Serie A (LBA) serving as the top-tier league. Olimpia Milano and Virtus Bologna are notable teams. In addition, Italy hosts the Italian Basketball Super Cup and the Italian Basketball Cup.

Motorsports are highlighted by events such as the Italian Grand Prix, held at the historic Monza circuit, and the Smilia Romagna Grand Prix, both part of the Formula One World Championship. MotoGP fans follow the Italian motorcycle Grand Prix at Mugello and San Marino MotoGP at Misano World Circuit, which also hosts the Misano E-Prix.

Tennis enjoys significant attention, especially with the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome, attracting top global players.

Cycling fans look forward to the Giro d'Italia, one of the three Grand Tours, offering a challenging course through diverse Italian landscapes.

Italy Ticket Prices

Adult ticket prices including fees for events in Italy start from as low as EUR €6 for basic tickets to EUR €5,717 for the most premium tickets; with the average starting ticket price at EUR €75. The price depends on a range of factors including the type of event, performers, venue, and ticket category.

Visiting Italy

Italy is a wonderland of romantic rolling landscapes, delectable food & wine, and enthralling regions rich with cultural treasure and local pride.

The north is crowned by the Dolomites and includes alpine villages, glamorous lakes, canal-latticed Venice, and fashionable cities like Milan & Turin. Tuscany captures travellers' imaginations like no other region in the country, with its capital Florence - the birthplace of the Renaissance - and scattering of hill towns & vineyards serving up a quintessential slice of “La Dolce Vita”. In capital Rome, you will see scooters speeding past ancient sights like the Colosseum, offering a dizzying mix of past and present. The sun-soaked south is home to Naples, the Amalfi Coast, the ruins of Pompeii, and lesser-visited regions full of beautiful beaches & enchanting labyrinthine towns in addition to serving as the gateway to the island of Sicily. Regardless of where you are in the country, stopping to sip espresso or local wine on a pastel-painted piazza will prove a dream come true.

Italian Open presented by Regione Emilia-Romagna, Adriatic Golf Club Cervia

It has always been a great pleasure to attend the Italian Open, starting when located at Garda lake, as far as we are concerned. We had a fantastic experience at Marco Simone Golf course. We enjoy the spirit of the Italian Open , every time we have attended, its managing organization, shuttle buses, not to forget, free entrance and last but not least, the dolce vita spirit..

European Athletics Championships, Stadio Olimpico

Excellent well run games. The only issue that I have at such games is the fact that medals are no longer presented in the stadium. Whilst I understand that this can be disruptive to the smooth running of the event, there was definitely more than adequate time in the events programme to have allowed medal presentations in the stadium. I frankly think that it is disrespectful to any athlete to receive a medal at almost midnight.

European Athletics Championships, Stadio Olimpico

Athletics fabulous, stadium great except toilets a disgrace, public transport to stadium diabolical, left stranded had to walk 7km back to hotel at midnight, day after had to leave early to make sure we got back safely. Taxi 30 euros!! Also no access to merchandise, couldn’t get all the way round the stadium, been to Germany twice had none of these problems would not go back to Rome.

European Athletics Championships, Stadio Olimpico

European athletics championships was very good with various WL, CR, ER, PB, SB and NR by many athletes.

Entrance into stadium could have been made better with more gates being open. The final night was extremely bad and major delays getting in.

Getting taxis after the event was extremely difficult where perhaps an area dedicated to taxis would have helped.

However a thoroughly enjoyable week spent in a fantastic City

European Athletics Championships, Stadio Olimpico

Poor organisation with regards to entry to the venue. Wouldn’t allow drinks bottles in so had to purchase single use water bottles from concessions which were, as usual, overpriced so despite the use of hybrid Toyota vehicles to ferry the numerous hangers on around it was not eco friendly or green. Sound system within the stadium was not clear, very muffled. Poorly attended unlike UK events which would be sold out.
