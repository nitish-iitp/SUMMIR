About Rome Events
Rome Sports Events

Sports fans will feel right at home in Rome as the locals are passionate about sport, especially their two major football clubs A.S. Roma and S.S. Lazio. While the derby between the two clubs is always one of the most talked-about events of the year, the city is also home to Virtus Roma professional basketball club in addition to S.S. Lazio rugby side and a professional volleyball team.

Rome Ticket Prices

Adult ticket prices including fees for events in Rome start from as low as EUR €6 for basic tickets to EUR €4,586 for the most premium tickets; with the average starting ticket price at EUR €55. The price depends on a range of factors including the type of event, performers, venue, and ticket category.

Visiting Rome

Rome - the capital of Italy - is a feast of ancient sights, stimulating modern cultural delights, and foodie dreams brought to life. First things first: the city of Rome holds more antiquity within its borders than some entire countries. Heavyweight ancient wonders like the Colosseum, Pantheon, Palatine Hill, and the Forum fight for your attention here with a bevvy of grand Baroque churches and fountains. This is to say nothing of Vatican City, the seat of the papacy, which is spilling with history. Throw into this mix a vibrant 21st-century city full of buzzing shopping districts, nightlife, and street food that serves as the cultural centre of the nation and you have a European city like no other. While you will be surrounded by plenty of other visitors at the main attractions, rest assured that there are still winding alleys and hidden piazzas waiting to be discovered, offering a slice of romantic Rome to call your own.

European Athletics Championships, Stadio Olimpico

Excellent well run games. The only issue that I have at such games is the fact that medals are no longer presented in the stadium. Whilst I understand that this can be disruptive to the smooth running of the event, there was definitely more than adequate time in the events programme to have allowed medal presentations in the stadium. I frankly think that it is disrespectful to any athlete to receive a medal at almost midnight.

European Athletics Championships, Stadio Olimpico

Athletics fabulous, stadium great except toilets a disgrace, public transport to stadium diabolical, left stranded had to walk 7km back to hotel at midnight, day after had to leave early to make sure we got back safely. Taxi 30 euros!! Also no access to merchandise, couldn’t get all the way round the stadium, been to Germany twice had none of these problems would not go back to Rome.

European Athletics Championships, Stadio Olimpico

European athletics championships was very good with various WL, CR, ER, PB, SB and NR by many athletes.

Entrance into stadium could have been made better with more gates being open. The final night was extremely bad and major delays getting in.

Getting taxis after the event was extremely difficult where perhaps an area dedicated to taxis would have helped.

However a thoroughly enjoyable week spent in a fantastic City

European Athletics Championships, Stadio Olimpico

Poor organisation with regards to entry to the venue. Wouldn’t allow drinks bottles in so had to purchase single use water bottles from concessions which were, as usual, overpriced so despite the use of hybrid Toyota vehicles to ferry the numerous hangers on around it was not eco friendly or green. Sound system within the stadium was not clear, very muffled. Poorly attended unlike UK events which would be sold out.

European Athletics Championships, Stadio Olimpico

Attended on 3 evenings. Lack of atmosphere due to numbers!

Should have thought about closing higher up do all spectators together

One evening seats by the raised jumping area- couldn’t see the track!
