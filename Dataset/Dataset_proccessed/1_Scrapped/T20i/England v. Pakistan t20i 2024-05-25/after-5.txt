England vs Pakistan Commentary
5:11 PM IST Right then, that wraps up this second T20I where England emerged as the dominant force over the visiting Pakistan! Next up is the third T20I, scheduled for the 28th of May, Tuesday at 11pm IST (5.30pm GMT). Be sure to join us early for all the pre-match build-up! Until then, cheers and goodbye!
5:09 PM IST Jos Buttler is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his outstanding knock of 84 off 51 balls. He says the team was focused on winning the game and there were great performances from everybody. Appreciates Jofra Archer and says that it was a really positive performance from him and is glad that he is back. Further adds that they have to give him games but also be mindful about resting him. Concludes by appreciating Chris Jordan for the way he bowled the last two overs and says it was exceptional stuff.
5:09 PM IST Babar Azam, the skipper of Pakistan, says that they bowled well but lacked in batting. Adds that they failed in stitching partnerships and lauds Fakhar Zaman's efforts. Shares that their top four are flexible and the order changes depending on the form.  Further says that the way Fakhar batted was impressive. Feels that if his partnership with Fakhar had lasted a few overs more, things would have been different. Lauds the bowling effort of Imad Wasim and adds that he is a very clever bowler and has improved a lot in batting too. Tells that they are not much concerned with the form of Shadab Khan. Ends by saying that their team is more or less settled ahead of the World Cup.
5:07 PM IST Time for the Presentation Ceremony..
5:00 PM IST Earlier in the game, Pakistan began strongly with Mohammad Amir and Imad Wasim exerting control over the initial overs, resulting in the early dismissal of Phil Salt. However, the rest of the bowlers struggled to find their marks, allowing Jos Buttler to dominate with a masterclass in batting. Shadab Khan, in particular, couldn't find his rhythm and conceded lots of runs. At the halfway mark in the innings, the dismissal of Will Jacks brought Jonny Bairstow to the crease, who launched a blistering attack with a quickfire cameo. Despite the onslaught, Pakistan staged a remarkable comeback in the death overs, chipping 5 English wickets for just 25 runs and bringing the game back into balance. Jos Buttler's 84 off 51 balls was a display of pure class, anchoring England's innings. For Pakistan, Shaheen Afridi was the standout bowler with 3 wickets, while Imad Wasim was exceptional too, taking 2 wickets for just 19 runs in his 4 overs.
4:59 PM IST Pakistan got off to a disastrous start, with Mohammad Rizwan falling in the very first over, quickly followed by Saim Ayub, leaving them at a precarious 14/2. However, Fakhar Zaman arrived with a counter-attacking mindset, smashing four boundaries in his first four balls to settle the nerves and stabilise the innings which proved to be a change of fortune for the visitors. Babar Azam soon found his rhythm as well, and the boundaries began to flow at ease. Together, Fakhar and Babar led Pakistan to a strong recovery, reaching 55/2 by the end of the Powerplay. Unfortunately, Babar couldn't capitalize on his promising start and was dismissed a couple of overs later. This triggered a collapse, with three more wickets falling in quick succession, causing Pakistan to slip further in their chase. Despite Iftikhar Ahmed and Imad Wasim's efforts to take the game deep, the asking rate proved too high to get a grasp off, and the visitors were bundled out for 160 runs, ultimately losing the game by 23 runs.
