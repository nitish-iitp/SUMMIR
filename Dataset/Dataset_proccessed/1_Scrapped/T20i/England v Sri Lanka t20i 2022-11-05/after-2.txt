Sri Lanka vs England, T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights: ENG qualify for semis after tense 4-wicket win over SL

Sri Lanka vs England, T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights: Ben Stokes calmly led England to victory after a collapse threatened a stunning exit from the tournament despite Alex Hales giving the side a fiery start to the chase.
Ben Stokes ended the match unbeaten on 42 off 36

Sri Lanka vs England, T20 World Cup 2022 Highlights: It was Ben Stokes the batter who took England over the line in the end. It initially looked like the 142-run chase would be a cakewalk for them after Alex Hales got them off to a flying start. Hales and captain Jos Buttler put up a 75 runs in just 44 balls but England lost their way in the middle overs, collapsing to 129/6 in the 18th over. Stokes then knocked off the remaining runs with Chris Woakes taking England over the line with a four in the final over. England are through to the semi-finals and this also means that hosts and defending champions Australia have been knocked out.

Sri Lanka vs England Live score: England beat Sri Lanka by 4 wickets, qualify for semi-finals

Defending champions and hosts Australia have been knocked out. Woakes cuts the fourth ball of the last over past backward point and roars in delight. England have gotten over the line at last. Ben Stokes ends the game unbeaten on 42 off 36. There may be question marks over his place in this batting lineup but whenever England need an escape of some sorts, it is Stokes who provides it. He played the situation perfectly in the last two overs, knocking the ball to empty areas of the field and running hard to convert the singles into doubles. If Dawid Malan is not able to turn up for England in the semi-finals, there is no doubt that Stokes has to take up that No.3 spot.

Stokes will be on strike, maybe England can breath easy now. A dot ball and a single to end that over.

SL vs ENG T20 World Cup live score: Fantastic running from Stokes

The target comes down to six, Stokes timing the ball beautifully, judging it perfectly when the third ball of the over went wide. There have been runs off all four balls of the over thus far.

Sri Lanka vs England Live score: Stokes and Woakes

Ben Stokes is on 33 off 29, Chris Woakes walks in. Dawid Malan is still in the hut, remember but he is injured. It means he won't be able to run around and taking those singles would be England's preferred mode of scoring. They need 13 to win off 12.

T20 World Cup live score: OUT! Curran falls, game on!

Another excellent catch, Sri Lanka have been impeccable in the field today, England are sliding. Slow bouncer from Lahiru Kumara, Curran pulls away and Rajitha takes a sharp catch right at the ropes up at fine leg. Now then, are England really going to make a mess of this?

Curran c Rajitha b Kumara 6 (11), England 129/6 in 18 overs

SL vs ENG T20 World Cup live score: England 121/5 in 16 overs

Well, it looked like this will be a cakewalk for England, especially after that opening stand. It has turned out to be anything but that. All eyes are now on Ben Stokes and Sam Curran. They don't need to bash it here, England need just 21 to win from 24 balls.

Sri Lanka vs England Live score: GONE! FIVE down now!

How about that! England are falling in a heap! Moeen takes a poke at this fullish length ball that gripped in the pitch a little. Hits it straight to extra cover. 

Moeen Ali c Shanaka b DM de Silva 1 (5), England 111/5 in 14.3 overs

T20 World Cup live score: GONE! Livingstone now

Now England are just throwing it away. Livingstone tries to smash it over the bowler's head, ends up coming off the toe end of the bat and he is caught at long-on. 

Livingstone c Dhananjaya b Lahiru 4 (6), England 106/4 in 13.1 overs

SL vs ENG T20 World Cup live score: OUT! Good catch from the bowler!

That is sharp work from Dhananjaya de Silva. He goes full on leg stump and Brook chops it low back to the bowler. Dhananjaya goes down in his follow through and clings on to a brilliant low catch.  

Brook c & b Dhananjaya 4 (5), England 93/3 in 11 overs

Nov 5, 2022 4:05 PM IST
Sri Lanka vs England Live score: England 86/2 in 10 overs 

Stokes in the middle with Harry Brook. No better chance than this for Stokes to reverse this poor run of form with the bat. England need 56 to win from 60.
