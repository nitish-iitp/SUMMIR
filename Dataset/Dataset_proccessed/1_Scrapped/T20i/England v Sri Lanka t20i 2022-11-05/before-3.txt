Pakistan's express pacer Shaheen Afridi has not been able to regain his full match fitness after sustaining a knee injury. To note, the left-arm pacer was not seen in action for almost three months after he sustained a right knee ligament injury during the first Test against Sri Lanka in July. 

The star Pakistani pacer had to undergo rehab in England as he also missed the last concluded Asia Cup. The left-arm pacer has now spoken about his comeback from the injury and stated that it was not easy at all. 

It is not easy to come back from such an injury after three months: Shaheen Afridi

"It is not easy to come back from such an injury after three months," Afridi said after Pakistan beat Netherlands in a T20 World Cup match. "May god never put anyone through this injury but those who pick up this injury obviously know how difficult it is.

"I am trying to give my 100 percent. I think my pace was similar earlier too. The average pace was around 135-140 kph; I am trying to get back to full fitness. Match fitness is different. When you come back after three months, it is difficult to put in full effort (immediately)," he added.

Meanwhile, the Men in Green registered their first victory in the T20 World Cup 2022 after they defeated the Netherlands in their third group stage encounter of the tournament. Pakistan started its campaign on a poor note after they lost to arch-rivals India in the opening encounter. 

Pakistan suffered another huge blow after they suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Zimbabwe in their second group-stage encounter. However, the Men in Green came out strong against the Dutch side as they completed a comprehensive victory over the Netherlands on Sunday. The former T20 champions will now take on South Africa in their next Super 12 encounter of the World Cup on November 3.
