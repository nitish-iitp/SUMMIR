T20 World Cup Super 12 Live Updates, AFG vs IRE: In the 25th match of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2022, Afghanistan will take on Ireland at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Friday. Ireland recorded a stunning win over England in their second match of the Super 12 that has left the Group 1 wide open.

Ireland’s win meant Afghanistan have been pushed to the last spot in the group and they need to win this contest to keep their hopes of making it to the last-four alive.

AFG vs IRE, T20 World Cup: Match Abandoned Due to Rain

Well, the match has been called off due to incessant rains at MCG. Both, Afghanistan and Ireland share a point each. But, visible disappointments on the faces of Afghanistan players as it’s the second time here when they haven’t been able to even step on the field.

But, perhaps that’s on the cards for them in this tournament.
