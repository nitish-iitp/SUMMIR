Japan in the lead-up to the event played a warmup game against a sister team, Japan XI and their last international appearance dates back to the 3rd place play-off of the same tournament that the side had played against South Korea back in 2019.

On the other hand, Hong Kong had a busy few months having toured the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for a 4-match T20I series that they eventually lost 0-4. The side then featured in the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) Women’s T20 Championship and registered 4 straight wins in their group-stage games, but lost to Malaysia in their Semi-Final.
