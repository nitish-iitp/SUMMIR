Preview:

New Zealand and Sri Lanka are set to go head-to-head in another Group 1 match of the Super 12 stage. Both teams enter this fixture after varied results as the New Zealand team registered a clinical win over Australia in their opening game but didn’t get a chance to play in their second game against Afghanistan which was called off. Whereas the Lankans were comprehensively defeated by Australia in their second Super 12 game.

Analysis:

New Zealand didn’t play their previous game against Afghanistan as the game was abandoned due to rain. But in the opening game, the Blackcaps showed a dominant performance against Australia as they handed the hosts their biggest defeat in T20Is. Their batting led by Devon Conway posted a massive 200-run total whereas their bowlers bundled out the Aussies for just 111. 




Sri Lanka had a great start to the Super 12s after defeating Ireland by nine wickets. But in the second game they were humbled by Australia as the hosts registered a seven-wicket win. Their top-order had some decent performances, but the lower-order batters couldn’t have a strong finish. Similarly, their bowlers had moments of brilliance but failed to build on the advantages they had in the game.
