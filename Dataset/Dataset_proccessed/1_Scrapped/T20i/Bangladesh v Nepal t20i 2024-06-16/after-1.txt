That’s it then from this game! Bangladesh have sealed their progression which means the Netherlands have been knocked out. Just the two games from the Group Stage left before the Super 8s begin. Until then, goodbye and take care.

!

The skipper of Bangladesh, Najmul Hossain Shanto says that they are very happy with how they played the group stage. Hopes to continue this bowling performance. Shares that the belief was there that they could defend the total if they picked early wickets. Adds that they have a good variety in their bowling unit and that is why they have excelled in this format. Feels that momentum is important in T20s and hopes to build on it.

!

The captain of Nepal, Rohit Paudel says the bowlers did really well. Batting could have been better but Bangladesh bowled really well. Admits they lost too many wickets in the first 6 overs but they fought back well. Ends by saying they need to step up as a batting unit and assess the wicket a lot better. Also says the team has great potential and he hopes to do better going ahead.

!

Tanzim Hasan Sakib is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his stellar showing with the ball. He says they just wanted to bowl in the good areas and just wanted to defend this total. Adds everyone bowled well and hence, they managed to defend this. Says he was only focusing on his plan and it came well. Also adds they are confident heading into the Super 8s. Ends by saying the widket is not easy, you just have to bowl the right lines and lengths.

!

Time for the presentation ceremony...

!

Nepal then fought back courtesy of Kushal Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee. They really got their side back into the game. It came down to them needing 30 in 24. However, the Fizz yet again came to the fore for his side. He gave away just the 1 run in the 17th and got the wicket of Malla and in the 19th, it was even better, he got Airee and bowled a maiden. Shakib Al Hasan then bowled the last over and picked two in two to seal the game.

!

Yet another nail-biter of a game! Bangladesh in the end have prevailed and have sealed their progress into the Super 8s. Tanzim Hasan Sakib at the start and Mustafizur Rahman at the end were absolutely brilliant. Tanzim ran through the top order as he got 4 in no time. He bowled 4 in a row and got 4 massive wickets.

SHAKIB AL HASAN TO ABINASH BOHARA

OUT! PLUMB IN FRONT! Two in two for Shakib Al Hasan to finish things off! Bangladesh are through to the Super 8s. Pushes it through, on a nagging length and it skids through, on middle, Abinash Bohara gets on the back foot and gets inside the line to work it away with the angle. He fails to get any bat on it and it goes through to trap him right in front of the stumps. Up goes the finger but Abinash Bohara takes the review, more in hope than anything else. There is nothing on UltraEdge and it is three reds on Ball Tracking. Nepal have been bowled out for 85 and this is the lowest total ever defended by a team in Men's T20 World Cups.

SHAKIB AL HASAN TO SOMPAL KAMI

OUT! STUMPED! Believe it or not, this is the first wicket of this World Cup for Shakib Al Hasan. Offers flight and attacks the stumps, on middle, Sompal Kami skips down the track to go back over the bowler's head but gets done in the flight. He misses to connect and Litton Das does the rest by taking the bails off. Abinash Bohara is the last man in for Nepal.

MUSTAFIZUR RAHMAN TO DIPENDRA SINGH AIREE

OUT! EDGED AND GONE! End of Dipendra Singh Airee's struggles against the Fizz and that should be the game for Bangladesh. Angling across, on a back of a length, on off, Dipendra Singh Airee shapes up to work it fine on the off side with an open bat face but only manages a feather on it and Litton Das takes it low near his ankles. A wicket-maiden from Mustafizur Rahman. Nepal need 22 runs off the final over. Sandeep Lamichhane comes in at number 10.

MUSTAFIZUR RAHMAN TO DIPENDRA SINGH AIREE

Would you believe it? Five straight dots in the 19th over. Keeps it near the wide guideline on off, fuller and slower, Dipendra Singh Airee frees his arms but fails to connect once again as he swings.

MUSTAFIZUR RAHMAN TO DIPENDRA SINGH AIREE

Make that four dots on the trot. Sensational stuff by Mustafizur Rahman. Delivers it wide of the batter's arc, slower and near the tramline on off, Dipendra Singh Airee reaches out to go big on the off side but fails to put bat to ball.

MUSTAFIZUR RAHMAN TO DIPENDRA SINGH AIREE

Three dots in a row. Digs it in short, over middle and leg, Dipendra Singh Airee gets beaten for pace this time as he goes for the pull as the ball sails over his bat.

MUSTAFIZUR RAHMAN TO DIPENDRA SINGH AIREE

And again! Going across the batter, slower and on a length, Dipendra Singh Airee gets undone by the slowness of the delivery and connects with thin air.

MUSTAFIZUR RAHMAN TO DIPENDRA SINGH AIREE

Takes pace off and goes full, on off, Dipendra Singh Airee shapes up to go down the ground but misses as the ball grips in the surface and goes past the bat.

TASKIN AHMED TO SOMPAL KAMI

Good shot but equally well fielded. Serves it on a good length, outside off, Sompal Kami plays it late and cuts it towards backward point where Rishad Hossain is in really close but dives to his left to make the stop. 22 runs needed off the last 2 overs. A make or break over coming up for Nepal.

TASKIN AHMED TO GULSHAN JHA

OUT! A soft dismissal and Taskin Ahmed finally has his first wicket of the night! Taskin hits the deck hard and it hurries the batter as well, on off, Gulshan Jha sets deep in his crease and goes for a swipe across the line. The ball gets big on him and it lobs tamely off the splice of the bat towards short cover where Towhid Hridoy makes no mistake. Sompal Kami is the new batter.

TASKIN AHMED TO GULSHAN JHA

Beaten! Angling away, on a hard length and skidding through, on off, Gulshan Jha tries to use the pace but the ball climbs onto him and zips past the shoulder of the bat.

TASKIN AHMED TO DIPENDRA SINGH AIREE

Goes short again, over middle, Dipendra Singh Airee rolls his wrists nicely on the ball and pulls it through square leg for one. 7 runs off the first 3 balls. How much more can Nepal get off this over?

TASKIN AHMED TO DIPENDRA SINGH AIREE

Honing in at the stumps now, on a good length, Dipendra Singh Airee gets right behind the line to defend but gets it off the outer half to point.
