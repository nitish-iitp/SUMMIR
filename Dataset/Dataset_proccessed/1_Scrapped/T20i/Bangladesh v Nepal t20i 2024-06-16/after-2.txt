On the other hand, Nepal were in a good position to qualify to the Super 8s but their loss in the last fixture against South Africa by one run pushed them out of the tournament. However, they will look to end their campaign on a high note with a win in their last fixture and give minor scare to Bangladesh’s qualification chances.

In the second match of the day, Sri Lanka and Netherlands will be seen locking horns at Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, Gros Islet, St Lucia. Sri Lanka have been knocked out of the tournament after their last game against Nepal got washed out. The Wanindu Hasaranga-led side faced major setback with back to back losses against South Africa and Bangladesh and will aim to end the tournament on a high with a win.

Meanwhile, Netherlands still have an outside chance of making it to the playoffs if they beat Sri Lanka by a huge margin and Bangladesh lose against Nepal. The Scott Edwards-led side has two points from three matches having with a net run rate of -0.408 and will need to hope for a massive victory along with a massive loss for Bangladesh to bring their net run rate of -0.408 down.

Head to Head

There have been just one match played between Bangladesh and Nepal where Bangladesh emerged victorious. On the other hand, there have been three matches played between Sri Lanka and Netherlands in the tournament so far where Sri Lanka have emerged victorious in all three occasions.

Team News

All players are available for selection across four teams.

Pitch Report

Out of the two matches played at Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown in the tournament so far, teams batting first have won both games. The average first innings score has been 137 and spinners have enjoyed their outing in both matches.
