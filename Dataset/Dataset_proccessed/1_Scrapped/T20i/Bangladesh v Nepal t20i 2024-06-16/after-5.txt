11:15pm Bangladesh have won three in a row, and will probably have to win at least two more in the Super Eight to get to the semi-final. They have momentum on their side, and will have two very familiar teams (Afghanistan and India) in their group, alongside Australia. Nepal will return home slightly disappointed but with their head held high. They gave it a proper rattle, especially in the last two matches and if they had controlled the fine margins better, we might have been aweing over a different sort of story.

That will be all from us for this game. Over in St. Lucia, Sri Lanka are on the brink of registering their first win at this year's T20 World Cup, with the Netherlands needing more than 115 in eight overs. Hop over for all the action. Until next time, this is goodbye from me, Raghav and Sudeep. Take care, folks!

Najmul Hossain Shanto, Bangladesh captain: Very happy the way we played this round. I hope we can continue our bowling performance, not our batting. Hope our batting performance will be fine in the next round. We are not scoring much but we know we can defend totals, if we can pick up early wickets. That is what we told the bowlers and they are very good in the field also. (On the bowling attack) We have everything. All the fast bowlers have worked really hard in the last two or three years. In this format, the bowling unit is very important and I hope they continue their form. (On going into the Super Eight on the back of three consecutive wins) In T20Is, momentum is always important. We have to plan for the next round and execute our plans.

Rohit Paudel, Nepal captain: As a bowling unit, we bowled really well. As a batting unit, we could have done better, especially the top order batters. We could have batted tighter. Bangladesh bowled really well with the new ball and we were under pressure after that. They were asking us challenging questions. We built a little partnership after that, but top order batters could have done better and taken more responsibility. We need to step up, need to know where to score runs and how to assess conditions. In the field and with the ball, we are up to the mark, we need to improve with the bat. This team has great potential. We need to back each and every player and in the upcoming World Cup, we hope to do better. (On their fans) We are as disappointed as them. We could have crossed (the line) in a few matches. It was heart-breaking for all of us, and we will try to make them happy in the coming years.

Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Player of the Match: (Discussion at the interval) We just wanted to keep things simple. We wanted to bowl in good areas and did not want to panic. We knew we could defend this score. Everybody bowled well. As a bowling attack, we bowled well and that is why we defended the score. I just want to be aggressive and execute my plans. We are really excited for the Super Eight. We are very confident about it and hopefully (we can do well). Spin-bowling was tough, and it was not easy to get those runs. We held our lines and lengths, and it worked.

10:55pm Wow. What a bowling display by Bangladesh to make the Super Eight. They were not dead and buried at the half-way stage but they needed something special to turn things around. And they did get something special in the form of Tanzim's spell. He was breathing fire with the new ball, bowled 21 dots, gave away just seven runs and picked up three vital wickets inside the powerplay.

That was the cue for the other bowlers to follow. Mustafizur then did what he does, with Shakib and Rishad also keeping things tight at different junctures. Shakib ended up with two wickets, with Mustafizur scalping three, and Bangladesh made a middling total seem an overwhelming one, courtesy of their bowling exploits.

Nepal, on the other hand, will be gutted. This seemed a very makeable chase but they committed the same mistakes they did against South Africa, although tonight, things started going downhill a lot sooner. Their powerplay batting was not great, and their strike rotation was not much better. That meant the required run-rate crept up and by the time they started taking risks, it was probably too late, especially against bowlers of the class of Mustafizur.

They will go back home with positives, but also with a feeling of how differently things could have panned out, had they been slightly more clinical and game-aware with the bat.

Shakib to Bohara, OUT

There it is! Bangladesh march into the Super Eight, and they get to right where they want to be! A momentous day for Bangladesh, and it has come courtesy a classy bowling display in Kingstown! Back of a length on middle and leg. Skids on with the arm and traps Bohara on the thigh. He had walked across to work it to leg, and the umpire feels that is enough to give him out. Bohara has reviewed but this could be more in hope than anticipation. No bat involved, and Ball Tracking has the ball crushing leg stump!

Abinash Bohara lbw b Shakib Al Hasan 0 (1b 0x4 0x6 1m) SR: 0

Bohara is the last batter in

19.1
W
Shakib to Sompal Kami, OUT

Stumped by a country mile! Tossed up deliciously on a length on off. Kami hares down the track, aiming for the moon. Loses all shape and makes no sort of contact. Litton collects cleanly and then effects the stumping, with Kami well out of his crease. Nepal falling like a pack of cards now!

Sompal Kami st †Litton Das b Shakib Al Hasan 0 (2b 0x4 0x6 6m) SR: 0

Shakib to bowl the last over. Kami on strike. Shakib to bowl. 22 needed

Mustafizur to Airee, OUT

Looks for the single, and nicks it through to Litton! A wicket-maiden. In the 19th over, and that could be that for Nepal! Sublime cutter on a length outside off. Airee has only one thing on his mind and that is a single. Tries to help it past the keeper but ends up giving Litton some catching practice. Bangladesh almost there!

Dipendra Singh Airee c †Litton Das b Mustafizur Rahman 25 (31b 2x4 1x6 52m) SR: 80.64

Surely Airee looks for a single now? The last over could be bowled by a spinner. Nepal still need 22

18.5
•
Mustafizur to Airee, no run

Another off-cutter on a back of a length outside off, and Airee is not learning. Swings like a rusty gate and misses

Airee needs to hold his shape and get bat to ball for starters

18.4
•
Mustafizur to Airee, no run

Another slower ball hung up on a length outside off. Airee has a wild slog at it, almost swinging himself off his feet but can only swat away a few flies

18.3
•
Mustafizur to Airee, no run

Sharp bumper on middle and leg. Airee seemed to suggest he was lining up the scoop before trying to pull it. Very late on the stroke, though, and the ball whizzes past his ear

18.2
•
Mustafizur to Airee, no run

Cutter pushed across the batter outside off. Airee continues swinging and misses for the second ball running

18.1
•
Mustafizur to Airee, no run

Slower delivery on a length just outside off. Airee has an airy swish at it and gets nowhere close to the ball

Mustafizur to bowl. This could be the game here

Taskin to Sompal Kami, no run

Length outside off. Kami presses half forward and laces his square drive, only to be thwarted by Rishad at backward point

Kami joins Airee. Nepal need 22 off 13

17.5
W
Taskin to Gulsan Jha, OUT

Tame dismissal, and there will be no redemption for Jha tonight! Hard length, slanted across the batter outside off. Jha has a massive swipe across the line but the ball gets onto him much quicker than he expects. Spoons it up off the splice and Hridoy, stationed very close at extra cover, does the rest!

Gulsan Jha c Towhid Hridoy b Taskin Ahmed 0 (4b 0x4 0x6 5m) SR: 0

Kp: "9.5 runs an over on this pitch can be a difficult task" -- Especially with one over of Mustafizur left

17.4
•
Taskin to Gulsan Jha, no run

Back of a length just outside off. Whistles off the surface and Jha cannot lay bat on ball

17.3

Taskin to Airee, 1 run

Dug into the track again, this time on middle and off. Airee swivels and pulls it towards deep square leg

17.2

Taskin to Airee, no run

Fullish and angling into off. Airee is squared up a touch and pokes it towards backward point

17.1

Taskin to Airee, SIX runs

Airee keeps fighting! Banged in short outside off. Airee, having advanced, jumps up onto his toes and carves it over the deep point fence. Eerily reminiscent of a stroke Airee's cricketing idol played back in the 2011 World Cup final!

Taskin to bowl out. Nepal need 29 off 18

Mustafizur to Gulsan Jha, no run

Back of a length just outside off. Skids off the surface and beats Jha for pace as he looks to cut

16.5
•
Mustafizur to Gulsan Jha, no run

Oh! Length just outside off. Cuts back into Jha and he gets the faintest of inside-edges onto his pads

Jha, who was on strike for the last ball of Nepal's game against South Africa, strides out. He will be out for redemption. Nepal need 29 off 20

Jawad: "I've got school in 5 hours and I'm staying up just hoping Bangladesh win. The nerves are getting higher and higher ball by ball."

16.4
W
Mustafizur to Kushal Malla, OUT

Goes straight up, and Shanto holds on! Excellently-disguised cutter on a back of a length just outside off. Malla looks to go downtown but the lack of pace does for him. Shanks it and Shanto, running back from mid off, gobbles up a smart chance in front of his face. This is a massive moment in the game!

Kushal Malla c Najmul Hossain Shanto b Mustafizur Rahman 27 (40b 1x4 1x6 48m) SR: 67.5
16.3
•
Mustafizur to Kushal Malla, no run

Hard length just outside off. Tucks up Malla and he can only prod it towards extra cover

16.2
1
Mustafizur to Airee, 1 run

Just short! Hard length on middle and leg. Airee looks to pull but is cramped for room. Splices it towards deep square leg, where Tanzid comes hurtling in but just cannot get there

16.1
•
Mustafizur to Airee, no run

Cutter on a length outside off. Airee has a huge waft at it but does not make any contact. Not sure he picked the variation either

30 off 24 now. This is getting edgy and nervy. Mustafizur returns for his third over. How Nepal play him could determine the outcome of this contest
