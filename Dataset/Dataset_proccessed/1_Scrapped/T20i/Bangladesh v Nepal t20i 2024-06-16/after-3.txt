Goodbye for now!

Saint Vincent always promised a lot of drama with its spin-friendly track.

We certainly had that today as Bangladesh held off Nepal to finish their group stage campaign with a win, and more importantly, gain entry into the Super Eights.

Nepal, who could have had South Africa and Bangladesh as prized scalps, will head home with visions of what could have been.

Bangladesh will next play Australia on June 20 in the Super Eights, followed by India on June 22 and Afghanistan on June 24.

There is still some group-stage action left, so make sure to stay tuned to Al Jazeera as we continue to cover select matches throughout this tournament.

Till then, and on behalf of Kevin Hand, this is Rohan Sharma signing off.

‘We believed we could defend our score’

Victorious Bangladesh captain Shanto had this to say after his team secured qualification: “Very happy with how we played this qualifying round. We hope our batting will be fine in the next round.

“We didn’t score much but we believed we could defend our score.

“The way we bowled in this tournament – if we take early wickets, it is in our hands.

“Last couple of years, all the fast bowlers worked really hard. That is why we played some good cricket in this format. I hope they continue their form.

“Momentum is always important in T20s, But now we have to plan for the next round and execute our plans.”

‘As a batting unit we could have done better, especially the top order’

Losing Nepal skipper Paudel had this to say at the post-match presentation: “As a bowling unit, we bowled really well. As a batting unit, we could have done better, especially the top-order batters.

“We could have batted a little tighter. Bangladesh bowled really well with the new ball. After that, we were under pressure,” he said.

“In the first six overs, we lost four wickets. After that, we built a partnership, but the top order could have done better, and they should have shown more responsibility.

“As a batting unit, we need to step up. We need to know when to score runs and how to assess the wicket.

“As a bowling and fielding unit, we are up to the mark – our only concern is the batting.

“This team has great potential. We have to back each and every player. Every future World Cup we will do better.”

With the first halve of the innings done we are 5 wickets down with 42 runs on the board 🏏

‘I just wanted to be aggressive and execute my plans’

Tanzim, who started things off with his 4 for 7, is adjudged player of the match.

“We just wanted to keep things simple, bowl in the good areas and not panic. We knew we could defend this score,” he said.

“Everyone bowled well. As a bowling attack, we were able to defend our score.”

“I just wanted to be aggressive and execute my plans. That was my focus and I did it.”

“We are excited to be in the Super Eights. We hope for the best.”

With this result, Bangladesh ensure qualification into the Super Eights.

They will go into Group 1, which includes India, Afghanistan and Australia.

WICKET! Bohara lbw. Nepal 85 all out

Shakib bowls one on the pads, which Bohara misses.

He was right in front when the ball hit the pads.

The bowler appeals, with the umpire raising his finger right away.

Nepal call for a review, though, since they still have one left.

Replays confirm he was struck in front.
