ICC T20 World Cup 2024 POINTS TABLE
The T20 World Cup 2024 will see a record high of 20 teams competing for the ultimate prize in the shortest format. This time the T20 World Cup has been expanded to 20 teams, four more that the 2022 edition. All eyes will be on the Indian cricket team, which will be aiming for its second T20 World Cup title. Three teams - USA, Canada and Uganda - are making their debut in the event. The tournament has been divided in four phases - Group stage, Super Eight, Semi-finals, Final. A team will get two points for a win, one for a no result and zero for a loss. There's no tie in T20 cricket and the match will be decided in Super Over in case the scores are level. This time the tournament will be held in the USA and the Caribbean Islands. The T20 World Cup 2024 starts from June 1 and the final will be held on June 29. This is the first time that USA is hosting such a big global cricket event. England are the defending T20 World Cup champions. They beat Pakistan in the 2022 final, clinching their second title. It also made the England side, the first men's team to hold both limited-overs World Cups (T20 and ODI) simultaneously. The teams made it to the T20 World Cup 2024 as per the following qualification process - two hosts (automatic qualification), top eight teams at the 2022 T20 World Cup, the next two teams in the ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings, and eight teams determined by regional qualifiers. The 20 competing teams have been divided into four groups of five teams. The top two teams from each group will enter Super Eight stage.
