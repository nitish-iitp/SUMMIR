The national women’s squad of Samoa and Papua New Guinea are slated to go head-to-head in Match No. 6 of the forthcoming 2024 edition of the Twenty20 (T20) Women’s Pacific Cup. The game is scheduled for the 17th of January 2024, at Lloyd Elsmore Park 3, Auckland, at 7:30 AM Indian Standard Time (IST).

Match 6: Samoa vs Papua New Guinea | Squads | Players to watch | Fantasy Playing XI | Live Streaming | Pitch Report
Squads:

Samoa – Regina Lili’i (C), Carol Agafili, Ailaoa Aoina, Luella Bracey, Tualili Iosefo, Olive Lefaga, Leitu Leong, Avetia Mapu, Francesca Nafanua, Norah Salima, Jacinta Sanele, Tuaolao Semau, Fa’aiuga Sisifo, Jane Taliilagi, Lagi Telea, Eleni Vaaetasi

Papua New Guinea – Brenda Tau (C), Sibona Jimmy (VC), Vicky Araa, Kaia Arua, Vicky Buruka, Kevau Frank, Dika Lohia, Erani Pokana, Tanya Ruma, Pauke Siaka, Henao Thomas, Geua Tom (WK), Isabel Toua, Naoani Vare

Players to watch out:
Lagi Telea

The 27-year-old all-rounder in T20Is, from 18 outings, has chipped in scoring 161 runs while also bagging 30 wickets from 21 outings, with the best bowling figures being 3/8. Lagi has been a consistent performer for the team, especially with the ball, but can also be trusted to add late runs to the tally. She’ll be counted on for the goods.

Tualili Iosefo

The 31-year-old all-rounder has added 133 runs to the tally from 16 outings and scalped 27 wickets, including the best of 3/15, from 22 outings. In her most recent series, early last year, Tualili consistently notched up handy cameos while also being amongst the wickets. It’ll be expected of her to bring her all-round abilities to the fore.

Tanya Ruma

The 30-year-old top-order batter, averaging 31.43, has piled on 1006 runs from 42 T20I outings and registered the highest of an unbeaten 69. Tanya, in the T20 World Cup East Asia-Pacific Qualifier late last year, displayed consistency, registering successive scores of 16*, 15*, 24*, and 21. The team will rely on their seasoned player to lead the scoring.

Kaia Arua

The 33-year-old has taken 51 wickets from 38 outings and produced the best of 5/7, while also accumulating 324 runs, including the highest of 43*, from 28 outings. In her previous couple of batting outings, Kaia registered scores of 43* and 28*, while also picking up 11 wickets from 5 outings. It’ll be hoped she replicates the same success yet again.

Pitch:

The center wicket at Lloyd Elsmore Park 2 offers a balanced playing surface that slightly favors the bowlers. While it is conducive for batting, the average score in the 130s suggests there’s assistance for bowlers, pacers in particular.

Weather:

With the temperature expected to hover around 25°C and no chance of rain, we are in for a complete game of cricket. The overhead will be partly cloudy, light winds are expected, and the humidity will be at 83%.

Fantasy playing XI:

Brenda Tau, Naoani Vare, Regina Lili’i, Sibona Jimmy, Tanya Ruma, Carol Agafili, Kaia Arua, Tualili Iosefo, Lagi Telea, Vicky Araa, Isabel Toua

Date – January 17, 2024
