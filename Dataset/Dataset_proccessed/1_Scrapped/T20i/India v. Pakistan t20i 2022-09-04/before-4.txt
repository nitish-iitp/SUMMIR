NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra is all set to commission India's first indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant in Kochi today at 9:30am.
During the event, the Prime Minister will also unveil the new Naval Ensign (Nishaan), doing away with the colonial past and befitting the rich Indian maritime heritage.
The giant warship, housing state-of-the-art automation features, will contribute significantly towards enhancing India's maritime capabilities.

The commissioning of Vikrant is being seen as a significant step towards India's self-reliance in the defence sector.
On the cusp of a landmark event in India's naval history, here are 10 key points about INS Vikrant:

INS Vikrant is the largest ship ever built in India's maritime history, built at a cost of Rs 20,000 crore
It has been named after India's first aircraft carrier (which was in service from 1961 to 1997) that played a vital role in the 1971 war with Pakistan
INS Vikrant vital stats: 262m long, 62m wide; displaces approximately 43,000 tonnes when fully loaded; maximum designed speed of 28 knots with endurance of 7500 nautical miles
With its commissioning, India joins an elite league with US, UK, Russia, China and France- countries capabilities to indigenously design and build an aircraft carrier
INS Vikrant designed by Indian Navy's Warship Design Bureau, built by Cochin Shipyard Limited
Warship built using indigenous equipment and machinery supplied by India's major industrial houses as well as over 100 MSMEs
Capable of supporting 30 aircraft; MiG-29K fighter jets, Kamov-31 and MH-60R multi-role helicopters, Advanced Light Helicopters and Light Combat Aircraft to be deployed on ship
Has around 2,200 compartments, designed for a crew of around 1,600 that include specialised cabins to accommodate women officers and sailors
Also has a full-fledged medical complex with latest equipment including physiotherapy clinic, ICU, laboratories and isolation ward
Aircraft landing trials will begin in November, to be completed by mid-2023

we shouldn't post the intrinsic details on the media forum about the carrier as it might compromise our strength.
