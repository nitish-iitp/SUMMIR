India star all-rounder Hardik Pandya departed for zero against Pakistan in the Super Four clash at the Asia Cup, exactly a week after his all-round heroics against the same opposition in the continental tournament.

In the rematch between India and Pakistan, Mohammad Hasnain bowled a cross-seam delivery around the off side, to which Pandya ended up hitting towards the short mid-wicket, where Mohammad Nawaz dived forward to complete a catch with both hands.

The zero against Pakistan is Pandya's first duck since 2017, when he was caught behind off the bowling of New Zealand's Ish Sodhi in the first T20I match in Delhi. Earlier on August 28, Pandya's inspiring and quickfire knock of 33 not out off 17 balls helped India to beat Pakistan by five wickets in their opening match of the Asia Cup.
