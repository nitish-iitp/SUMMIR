As determined by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), the marquee event is being played between six Asian nations which include India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Hong Kong. The six teams have been divided into two groups; Group A which includes India, Pakistan, Hong Kong and Group B consisting of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan.

The Asia Cup T20 2022 tournament will be played in two rounds; group stage and Super 4 before the final. Each team will play against the other two teams of their respective group once in round one. Every win in the group stage will earn two points for the team. In an abandoned match, both the teams will get one point each. After the group stage round concludes, the top two teams with most points from both the groups will advance into Super 4s. And in that fashion, the top two teams from Super 4 will progress into the final of the Asia Cup 2022. In case, teams are tied at points then Net Run Rate will come into play.

Asia Cup 2022 Group A Points Table Updated

Teams	Played	Won	Lost	Points	NRR
India (Q)	2	2	0	4	 +1.096
Pakistan (Q)	2	1	1	2	+3.811
Hong Kong	2	0	2	0	-4.875

Asia Cup 2022 Group B Points Table Updated

Teams	Played	Won	Lost	Points	NRR
Afghanistan (Q)	2	2	0	4	 2.467
Sri Lanka (Q)	2	1	1	2	-2.223
Bangladesh	2	0	2	0	 -0.576

Excluding Hong Kong, the remaining five teams are the Test playing members, hence their entry into the Asia Cup 2022 was confirmed directly. However, Hong Kong could register their spot in the main event only after topping the Asia Cup Qualifiers 2022 points table earlier this month. It is for the second time in the history of the Asia Cup that the continental championship will be played in the T20 format. It was in 2016 only when the coveted event was played in the game's shortest format. Sri Lanka was originally scheduled to host the Asia Cup 2022. However, due to political turmoil and economical instability in the island nation, Sri Lanka was released from the responsibility. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) was henceforth confirmed the new venue even though Sri Lanka retains the hosting rights.
