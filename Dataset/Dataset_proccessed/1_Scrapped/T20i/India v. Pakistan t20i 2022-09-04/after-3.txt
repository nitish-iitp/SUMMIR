It's time for another India vs Pakistan clash. The two sub-continental heavyweights will clash tonight for a second time in the ongoing Asia Cup. This time it will be in the crucial Super 4s stage.
India and Pakistan are the favourites also to play each other in the final. The rivalry is a storied one and has produced some of the most unforgettable cricket action over the decades.

But often, especially in recent times, an India vs Pakistan clash hasn't lived up to the hype that it generates, producing almost one-sided affairs. The league stage match in the Asia Cup this time though was a reminder of just how exciting this contest can be, with India pulling off a 5 wicket win, with 2 balls left.

The fans will be hoping to witness another nail-biting contest this evening, when the two sides go toe to toe in Dubai.

Ahead of the next chapter of the India vs Pakistan rivalry, here's a quick look at some very interesting statistical trivia:
# India have won nine and lost five (NR 1) out of 15 Asia Cup matches played against Pakistan.
# Since losing by one wicket to Pakistan in the ODI at Mirpur on March 2, 2014, India have won the next four Asia Cup matches against them - by 5 wickets at Mirpur on February 27, 2016 (T20I); by 8 wickets on September 19, 2018, by 9 wickets on September 23, 2018 - both at Dubai in the ODI format and by 5 wickets at Dubai on August 28, 2022 in the T20I format.

# For the first time, India have won four Asia Cup fixtures in succession against Pakistan between 2016 and 2022.
# Pakistan's largest win in terms of runs against India in the Asia Cup was by 97 runs at Sharjah on April 7, 1995. In response to Pakistan's 266 for nine off 50 overs, India were dismissed for 169 off 42.4 overs.
# In Pakistan's 97-run win, Wasim Akram had scored 50 off 46 balls - his only fifty in the Asia Cup.

# Pakistan suffered their biggest Asia Cup loss in terms of wickets by 9 wickets was against India in the Super 4 stage of the Asia Cup in Dubai in the 2018 edition of the tournament, which India went on to win to clinch their 7th Asia Cup title.
# Bhuvneshwar Kumar (4/26), Hardik Pandya (3/25), Arshdeep Singh (2/33) and Avesh Khan (1/19) provided the first instance of Indian pacers capturing all ten wickets in a Twenty20 International, accomplishing the feat against Pakistan at Dubai on August 28. Before this, in the Asia Cup Indian pacers had not taken more than five wickets in a match against Pakistan.
# The above instance (all 10 wickets by pacers) is the only one by any team in the history of Asia Cup - 50-over and 20-over formats combined.


How India and Pakistan have fared at the Asia Cup


# Aaqib Javed (5/19), Wasim Akram (1/23) and Zafar Iqbal Chaudhry (1/34) had captured seven wickets in the Asia Cup (50-over format) at Sharjah on April 7, 1995 - the most by Pakistani pacers in an Asia Cup game against India.
# Mohammad Rizwan (79 not out) and captain Babar Azam (68 not out) were involved in an unbroken stand of 152 for the first wicket in the ICC's Men's T20 World Cup - Pakistan's highest partnership for any wicket against India in T20Is.
# Mohammad Hafeez (105) and Nasir Jamshed (112) had put on 224 for the first wicket against India at Mirpur on March 18, 2012 - Pakistan's highest for any wicket against any opponent in the Asia Cup.
#Yuvraj Singh (72) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (33) were associated in a partnership of 97 for the fourth wicket at Ahmedabad on December 28, 2012 - India's highest stand for any wicket against Pakistan in T20Is.
# Shikhar Dhawan (114) and Rohit Sharma (111 not out) had put on 210 for the first wicket against Pakistan at Dubai on September 23, 2018 - India's highest opening stand for the first wicket against any opponent in the Asia Cup.
# Hardik Pandya's strike rate of 8.1 while claiming seven wickets in four matches at an average of 8.28 is the best among the bowlers taking five wickets or more in T20Is involving India and Pakistan.
# Irfan Pathan's economy rate of 6.0 while capturing six wickets in three matches at an average of 11.00 is the best among the bowlers taking five wickets or more in T20Is involving India and Pakistan.

# Bhuvneshwar Kumar's figures of 4-0-46-1 in the Ahmedabad T20I on December 28, 2012 are the most expensive in a four-over spell in T20Is involving India and Pakistan.
# India's score of 330 for four in 47.5 overs against Pakistan at Mirpur on March 18, 2012 remains the highest by any team in a successful chase in the Asia Cup.
# Hardik Pandya (33 not out and 3 for 25), with his marvellous performance against Pakistan at Dubai on August 28, became the fifth Indian all-rounder after Sachin Tendulkar (twice - once each against Pakistan and Bangladesh in 2004), Kapil Dev (vs Sri Lanka in 1990), Irfan Pathan (vs Pakistan in 2004) and Virender Sehwag (vs Sri Lanka in 2004) to achieve the double of posting 30-plus and capturing 3 wickets in an Asia Cup match.

# Virat Kohli holds the record for posting the highest individual innings in a successful chase in the Asia Cup - 183 vs Pakistan at Mirpur on March 18, 2012.
# Younis Khan holds a Pakistan record for posting the highest individual innings in a successful chase in the Asia Cup - 123 not out off 117 balls against India at Karachi on July 2, 2008.
# Aaqib Javed holds a Pakistan record for producing the best figures in the Asia Cup - 5 for 19 against India at Sharjah on April 7, 1995. He remains the only Pakistani bowler to produce a five-wicket haul against India in the Asia Cup.

# Arshad Ayub's career-best ODI figures of 5 for 21 were accomplished in the Asia Cup vs Pakistan at Dhaka on October 31, 1988.
# Ayub's figures of 5 for 21 remain the best by an Indian bowler in the Asia Cup.
# Venkatesh Prasad's excellent performance of 4 for 17 at Colombo (SSC) on July 20, 1997 was produced by him in the Asia Cup.
# Indian fielders took seven catches in the Dubai match on August 28, 2022 - their best performance in an Asia Cup match against Pakistan.
# Mahendra Singh Dhoni had effected 43 dismissals (31 catches plus 12 stumpings) in 24 matches - a record in the Asia Cup. His tally includes nine dismissals (eight catches plus one stumping) in seven matches - a record by any wicket-keeper - against Pakistan in the Asia Cup.
# Suresh Raina took five catches in five matches - a record by any fielder against Pakistan in the Asia Cup.
