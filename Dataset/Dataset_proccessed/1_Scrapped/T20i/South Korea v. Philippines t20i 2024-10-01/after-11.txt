National Team (Men)Japan Top Following Victory Over Indonesia
Japan Top Following Victory Over Indonesia
2024-10-01 Important news News & Articles National Team (Men)

Captain Kendel Kadowaki-Fleming marked a special personal landmark as he led his team to a convincing win over Indonesia and three wins out of three at the halfway mark of the ICC Men’s T20WC East Asia Pacific – Sub-Regional ‘B’ 2024.

Kadowaki-Fleming struck his seventh T20 International half century, to go with two centuries, and in doing so became the leading run scorer in the history of the Japan National Teams. 

He passed his predecessor as captain, Masaomi (Amigo) Kobayashi with his first six of the day and went on to make 57 from just 29 balls in a game reduced to 13 overs per side. 

Japan’s total of 121 for four always looked imposing and although the Indonesia batters made a reasonable start, the end of the powerplay slowed the scoring and wickets soon followed. 

The spin attack grabbed four wickets for six runs in just 12 balls to effectively end the game as a contest, and Indonesia eventually ended the chase on 68 for five as Japan earned a win by 53 runs.  

When asked after the game what the record meant to him, Kadowaki-Fleming said: “Records are nice but right now I am happier about the win and the performance. I’ve only been playing international cricket for a couple of years and I hope to go on and contribute as much to the sport in Japan as Amigo-San did during his time. His record may have gone but his legacy certainly hasn’t.”

Japan will take on the Philippines in their fourth match of the tournament on Wednesday 2nd October at 10:00.
