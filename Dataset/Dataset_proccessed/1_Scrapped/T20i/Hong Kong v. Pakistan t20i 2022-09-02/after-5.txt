In Short
Pakistan will open their Asia Cup Super 4 campaign vs India
The two arch-rivals will meet in Dubai on Sunday
Pakistan decimated Hong Kong by 155 runs on Friday

The cricket fraternity is assured of a second India vs Pakistan match in the ongoing Asia Cup 2022 after Babar Azam's men decimated Hong Kong in their must-win Group A match on Friday, September 2. The two arch-rivals will meet in their first Super Four match on Sunday, September 4 in Dubai.

Pakistan headed into a must-win match against Hong Kong after losing their opening match against India on Sunday. However, after a slow start, Pakistan rode on Mohammad Rizwan and Fakhar Zaman's fifties to post an above--par total of 193 on the board.

Later in the day, spinners Shadab Khan and Mohammad Nawaz picked up 7 wickets between them as they helped Pakistan bowl Hong Kong out for 38, the lowest-ever total in Asia Cup T20I history. Pakistan proved a point by winning their second Group A match by a mammoth margin of 155 runs.

India and Pakistan have not been playing bilateral cricket since 2012-13 season but their meetings in International Cricket Council tournaments and continental tournaments have generated a lot of buzz over the years. When the Asia Cup 2022 was announced before the T20 World Cup in the UAE, the prospect of 3 potential India vs Pakistan matches came as an exciting prospect for cricket fans, especially from either side of the border.

At the end of the group stages of Asia Cup 2022 on Friday, India finished on top of Group A and Pakistan finished second. Afghanistan and Sri Lanka were the other two teams to qualify for the Super Four from Group B.

Pakistan will look to avenge their defeat to India from last Sunday when the two sides meet in Dubai in the Super Four stage of the tournament.
