Pakistan and Hong Kong will face off against each other in a group stage match at Asia Cup 2022. The match will be played at Sharjah Cricket Stadium on September 2 and is scheduled to start at 7:30 PM IST. It will be a do-or-die match for both Pakistan and Hong Kong as they both need a win out of this game to qualify for the Super 4 stage of the tournament. Babar Azam's side will be under tremendous pressure before heading into this game after suffering a five-wicket defeat against arch-rivals India in their opening game. The Green Shirts, who are one of the favourites to win the Asia Cup 2022, now find themselves at the edge of the corner as a loss against Hong Kong will show them the exit door. On the other hand, Nizakat Khan-led Hong Kong would look to beat Pakistan and progress into the competition. They faced a 40-run loss against the Men in Blue in their last match. However, it is expected that the two teams will give their all to edge each other in this seemingly much-anticipated match. Pakistan vs Hong Kong Dream11 Team Prediction: Tips To Pick Best Fantasy Playing XI for PAK vs HK Asia Cup 2022 Match in Dubai

Babar Azam would like to go with an aggressive approach against the minnows Hong Kong. It is expected that Naseem Shah, the pace sensation, who got a leg injury against India, might be rested along side Haris Rauf who also felt discomfort last Sunday. Hasan Ali and Muhammad Hasnain could make a return to the playing XI. All the eyes will be on Babar Azam, who failed big time against Rohit Sharma's side. For Hong Kong, they will once again depend on their batting strength. Skipper Nizakat Khan would bank on Babar Hayat, Yasim Murtaza and Ayush Shukla to deliver against the Pak side.
