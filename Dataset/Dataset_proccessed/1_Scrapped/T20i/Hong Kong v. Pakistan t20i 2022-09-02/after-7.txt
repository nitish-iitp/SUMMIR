Mohammad Rizwan, on Friday, September 2, became only the seventh Pakistan batter to score 5000 runs in T20 cricket. The right-handed batter accomplished the feat during his team’s second Group A match in the Asia Cup 2022 against Nizakat Khan’s Hong Kong at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium.

Rizwan joined a list that consisted of Shoaib Malik, Babar Azam, Mohammad Hafeez, Kamran Akmal, Umar Akmal and Ahmed Shehzad.

Rizwan scored in the 40s against India, but failed to step on the gas. After quite a bit of struggle, he got out to Hardik Pandya, who bagged the Player of the Match award at Dubai International Cricket Stadium.

However, against Hong Kong, Rizwan found his fluency after he scored his half-century off 42 balls. After Ehsan Khan got rid of skipper Babar Azam, Rizwan put his head down and steadied the ship. He got a supportive partner in Fakhar Zaman, who got to his half-century off 38 balls.

Rizwan and Fakhar stitched together a partnership of 116 runs off 80 balls to inject momentum into the Pakistan innings. At the halfway-mark of the innings, Pakistan were ambling along at 64 for the loss of one wicket.

But Rizwan and Fakhar upped the ante and put pressure on the Hong Kong bowlers. Rizwan, in the end, went on to score 78 runs off 57 balls with the help of six fours and one six.

Pakistan, after being put in to bat first, scored 193 for the loss of two wickets. Ehsan Khan picked up two wickets and was the standout bowler for Hong Kong in the must-win clash.
