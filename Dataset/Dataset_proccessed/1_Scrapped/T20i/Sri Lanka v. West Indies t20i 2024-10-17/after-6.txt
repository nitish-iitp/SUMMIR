Rupee or domestic credit by the banking and monetary sectors to the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) and public corporations continued to overshadow credit to the private sector for the seventh consecutive month to February 2022, a phenomenon last seen nearly 33 years ago in 1989, Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) data of Friday’s (8 April) showed. 

For instance, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,331 billion in February 2022, while credit to the private sector amounted to a mere Rs 7,051 billion in that month, the former being more by Rs 280 billion over the latter. And in the previous month January 2022, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,236 billion, while credit to the private sector amounted to a mere Rs 7,017 billion that month, the former being more by Rs 219 billion over the latter.

Meanwhile, in December 2021, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,467.9 billion, while credit to the private sector amounted to a mere Rs 6,981.4 billion, the former being more by Rs 486.5 billion over the latter. In November 2021, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,259 billion and credit to the private sector Rs 6,920.1 billion, an increase of Rs 338.9 billion. 

Similarly, in the months of October, September and August 2021 these respective figures were Rs 7,116.8 billion and Rs 6,859.6 billion, Rs 6,915.2 billion and Rs 6,824.6 billion and Rs 6,819 billion and Rs 6,795.5 billion, increases of Rs 257.2 billion, Rs 90.6 billion and Rs 23.5 billion, respectively.   Previously, such a phenomenon occurred for 10 consecutive months, from January 1989 to October 1989, CBSL data showed. 

Three matters of political interest, coinciding with those developments took place during that earlier period. They were President Ranasinghe Premadasa being elected to power at the Presidential Poll of 19 December 1988 and taking over from President J.R. Jayewardene who went into retirement on 31 December 1988, the IPKF fighting the LTTE in the North and East of the country and the JVP fighting the GoSL in the rest of the country. 

However, coinciding with the killing of JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera by the Army on 13 November 1989, private sector credit once more overtook credit to both the GoSL and public corporations together beginning from that month, before its collapse nearly 32 years later  in August 2021 and continuing to play second fiddle to the GoSL and public corporations till February 2022, according to latest CBSL data.

Half centuries from Kusal Mendis and Kusal Perera propelled Sri Lanka to a historic 9-wicket victory over the West Indies in the third and final T20I held at Dambulla International Cricket Stadium on Thursday.  

With this triumph Sri Lanka clinched the series 2-1, marking the nation’s first bilateral T20I series win against the West Indies. 

Batting first, the West Indies managed to score 162 runs for the loss of 8 wickets in their allotted 20 overs, and in response, Sri Lanka successfully chased down the target in just 18 overs, thanks to the contributions of Mendis and Perera.

Choosing to bat first, the West Indies encountered a disastrous beginning, finding themselves at 5-62 within just 11 overs. In a challenging situation, a partnership of 54 runs for the sixth wicket between Rovmen Powell and Gudakesh Motie allowed them to recover to some extent. 

Captain Rovman Powell spearheaded the resurgence, scoring 37 runs off 21 balls, which included one boundary and three sixes. Meanwhile, Gudakesh Motie contributed a rapid 32 runs off 15 deliveries, helping the team reach a respectable total by the end of 20 overs.

Despite their earlier struggles, the West Indies shifted gears and demonstrated their renowned power-hitting ability, amassing 76 runs in the final five overs. They took full advantage of the Sri Lankan bowlers, notably scoring 25 runs in the 15th over bowled by Dunith Wellalage.

The late innings surge, which also featured a brisk 18 runs from Romario Shepherd, enabled the West Indies to finish with a commendable 162-8.

On the bowling front, Sri Lanka performed admirably for the first 12 overs, but began to bowl slightly shorter as the innings progressed. 

Maheesh Theekshana and Wanindu Hasaranga were economical while claiming two wickets each, while Dunith Wellalage, who performed well in the second T20I, had a disappointing outing, conceding 36 runs in his four overs.

During the chase, Sri Lanka were provided a flying start with Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis adding a 60 run partnership for the first wicket.

Pathum Nissanka did the early damage with an aggressive approach as he smashed 22 ball 39 runs before being castled by Gudakesh Motie in the 6th over. Despite the wicket Sri Lanka reached 67 at the end of the powerplay.

With Kusal Mendis and Kusal Perera in the middle the duo continued the Sri Lanka domination, particularly Kusal Mendis, who reached his 15th T20I half century in the process. 

The 29-year-old went onto score an unbeaten 68 runs off 50 balls laced with 5 boundaries and 3 sixes. Mendis also now has the most T20I 50s for Sri Lanka.

Veteran Kusal Perera also smashed his 14th half century and remained unbeaten on 55 runs to highlight Sri Lanka’s win. The duo also shared a match winning unbeaten 106 run partnership for the second wicket and were together at the end when the target was reached with 12 balls to spare.

Brief scores: 

West Indies: 162-8 (20) (Rovman Powell 37, Gudakesh Motie 32, Maheesh Theekshana 2-19, Wanindu Hasaranga 2-24)

Sri Lanka: 166-1 (18) (Kusal Mendis 68*, Kusal Perera 55*, Gudakesh Motie 1-31)
