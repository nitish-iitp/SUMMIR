Charith Asalanka, the victorious skipper of Sri Lanka says that the top-order batters batted brilliantly and that helped the team win the series. Mentions that throughout the series he kept reminding his side that they did well against India as well and if they just win those close moments they could be a hard team to beat and it reflected in this series. Reckons that that the aggressive start at the top is something that the two at the top decided by themselves and thanks to them for that solid start at the top.

Rovman Powell the losing skipper of West Indies says they had enough runs on the board on such a tricky track but credit goes to Sri Lanka as they batted well. Mentions that as a bowling group, they failed to make a game of it and the game went away from them in the PP itself. Reckons that the quality of spinners on both sides was the difference but they will learn from this. Closes by saying that these were unfamiliar conditions for them but acknowledges that his side did well and they have a lot of positives from this series. Thanks to the Sri Lankan crowd for the love and support they have shown towards them.

Kusal Mendis is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH. Mendis is up for a chat and says he played well and the inning from Pathum Nissanka helped as that allowed him time at the top. Mentions that they are familiar with these conditions and his partnership with Kusal Perera in the middle was a good one as well as they kept rotating strike.

Earlier in the game, the West Indies batted first after winning the toss and scored 162 runs for the loss of 8 wickets. Despite a shaky start where they lost key wickets early, particularly with Evin Lewis falling for a golden duck and struggling performances from Shai Hope and Roston Chase, Rovman Powell and Gudakesh Motie stabilized the innings. Motie contributed aggressively with 32 runs off 15 balls, while Powell added 37 runs off 27 balls. The Sri Lankan bowlers Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana each took 2 wickets, helping keep the West Indian score in check.

West Indian bowling attack failed to make an impact, leaving Rovman Powell disappointed. Despite the pitch offering ample assistance to spinners, the Caribbean spinners couldn’t capitalize, while the seamers also struggled to make inroads

Chasing down a ticky total of 162 looked a massive ask with the way the pitch was behaving while the visitors were batting but it all went away in the Powerplay itself. The Sri Lankan side took full use of the fielding restrictions and scored 66 in the first 6 overs.
