Broadcast and Live Streaming details

The Women’s T20 World Cup 2024 has reached its climax, with the four semi-finalists confirmed following the final group stage match on October 15 at Dubai International Cricket Stadium.

The West Indies delivered a powerful performance, defeating England by six wickets. Chasing a competitive target of 142 runs, they completed their task in just 18 overs, ensuring their spot in the semi-finals and eliminating England in the process. This high-stakes encounter set the stage for a compelling finish to the tournament, with the strongest teams now gearing up for the next big challenge.

Group A: Australia’s clean sweep and New Zealand’s resilience

Australia dominated Group A, maintaining a perfect record with four consecutive wins. Their last group stage match, a close nine-run win over India, showcased their determination and skill. Topping the group was a testament to their consistency and all-around performances. Meanwhile, New Zealand demonstrated resilience, bouncing back after a tough loss to Australia to secure a 54-run victory over Pakistan in their final group match. With a net run rate of +0.879, New Zealand ensured they advanced as the second semi-finalist from Group A, solidifying their position as strong contenders in the tournament.

Group B: West Indies and South Africa’s path to success

West Indies, under the dynamic leadership of Hayley Matthews, topped Group B with an impressive record, winning three of their four matches and finishing with six points. Their NRR of +1.504 underscored their dominance. South Africa, too, displayed excellent form, also securing three wins with six points, and their NRR of +1.382 earned them the second semi-final spot from the group. England, despite equaling both teams in points, fell short with a +1.117 NRR, which was insufficient to push them past the West Indies or South Africa. The West Indies’ win over England was a critical moment that shaped the final standings.

Grand finale and historic prize money: Women’s T20 World Cup 2024

The winners of the semi-finals will meet in the grand final on Sunday, October 20, at Dubai International Cricket Stadium. This year’s tournament final will be historic, not only for the caliber of cricket expected but also for the unprecedented prize money on offer. The champions will receive the largest financial reward in the tournament’s history, with all four semi-finalists also benefiting from increased monetary prizes compared to previous editions. The final promises to be a spectacular event, with both the prestige and prize adding to the intensity of the contest.
