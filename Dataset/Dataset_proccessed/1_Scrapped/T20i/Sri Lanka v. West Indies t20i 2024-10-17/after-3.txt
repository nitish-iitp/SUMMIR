Venue Details
Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium
Good, pleasant conditions out in the middle. It is a dry pitch. The grass on the pitch is present to hold the pitch together, with the cracks opening up. The hardness will allow the batters to hit boundaries early on. 145-150 is what Powell thinks is a good sore, should you get that batting first, it should be enough
