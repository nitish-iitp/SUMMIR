Bangladesh Vs Sri Lanka, T20 World Cup Highlights: BAN Withstand Batting Collapse, Win Cliffhanger By 2 Wickets

The 15th match of ICC T20 World Cup 2024 was a low-scoring thriller in which Bangladesh trumped Sri Lanka by two wickets at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas on Saturday, June 8. The Najmul Hossain Shanto-led Bangla Tigers restricted the Lankans to 124 runs in the first innings. They began the chase well but nearly made a royal mess of it, losing five wickets for just 24 runs. But Towhid Hridoy (40 off 20), Litton Das (38 off 36) and Mahmudullah (16 not out off 13 balls) helped Bangladesh get over the line in the 19th over.

What Captains Said At Toss

Wanindu Hasaranga: We don't mind batting first. We are going with two genuine fast bowlers and two genuine spinners, two seam bowling all rounders. It depends on the match situation on where I come out to bat.

Najmul Hossain Shanto: We expect some seam and swing early on. The top four have been doing a lot of hard work in the last few days. It (the pitch) looks a bit dry.

 8 Jun 2024, 06:07:55 am IST
Nissanka Away With Boundary 

Play gets underway, and Pathum Nissanka is off the mark in breezy fashion with a pick-up towards midwicket for a one-bounce four. Tanzim Hasan Sakib has the ball.

SL End Up With Below-Par 124 For Nine

Tanzim Hasan Sakib concedes just seven runs and sees the back of Angelo Mathews in the 20th over, as Bangladesh limit to a 124-run total. Looks like an eminently achievable target; we will find out soon.

 8 Jun 2024, 08:04:40 am IST

It's All Happening!

 8 Jun 2024, 09:58:58 am IST
What Losing Captain Wanindu Hasaranga Said

Wanindu Hasaranga: "We started really well in the first 10 overs but in the middle overs we batted badly. Bowling is our strength. If we had got 150-160 we could have won with our bowling attack. The batters let us down in both games. We still have two games and we will try to do our best. Maheesh (Theekshana) and myself are the two main spinners and we have to attack."

 8 Jun 2024, 10:00:22 am IST
What Winning Captain Najmul Hossain Shanto Said

Najmul Hossain Shanto: "Happy with the way everyone played. Run chase wasn't easy but we didn't bat well to be honest. Pitch was pretty good. Litton (Das) showed his skill today. (Towhid) Hridoy the way he played that over it helped us. Happy for the crowd and I hope they will come again and support us."
