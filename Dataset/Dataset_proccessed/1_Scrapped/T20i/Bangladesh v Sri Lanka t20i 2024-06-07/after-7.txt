Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh Highlights: Rishad Hossain's spell, followed by a quick knock from Towhid Hridoy helped Bangladesh beat Sri Lanka by two wickets in a thrilling, low-scoring T20 World Cup 2024 match on Saturday. Chasing 125, Bangladesh lost early wickets but Hridoy's knock of 40 off 20 balls, brought them back into the game. Apart from him, Litton Das also scored 36 runs. For SL, pacer Nuwan Thushara registered a brilliant four-wicket haul. Earlier in the match, Hossain and Mustafizur Rahman scalped three wickets each while Taskin Ahmed scalped two wickets for Bangladesh.  (UPDATES | Points Table)

The Presentation ceremony…

!

Earlier in the innings, we saw Sri Lanka get off to a flying start and taking on the bowlers. However, Bangladesh bounced back strongly and looked lethal after the first 6 overs. They managed to stop the runs and took timely wickets. Their catching was right there at the top and they didn’t bowl many extras which helped them restrict Sri Lanka to a low score of 124. Rishad Hossain and Mustafizur Rahman were the pick of the bowlers with their 3 wickets each. Pathum Nissanka was the top scorer for Sri Lanka with 47 runs to his name.

!

Bangladesh had an absolute disaster for a start. Soumya Sarkar and Tanzid Hasan, their openers were sent back in the first two over itself. As Litton Das and Najmul Hossain Shanto tried to build a partnership, a sharp catch brought an end to the latter’s innings. The process of building a stand began again with Das and Towhid Hridoy. They executed the plan well and played simple cricket avoiding any risky shots. Automatically, the boundaries started coming and they managed to put some pressure on the bowlers. Towhid Hridoy took on Hasaranga and got them back in control of the game. Das also was trapped infront of the stumps by the opposition skipper. With his wicket, the batters again went back to batting cautiously. With the wickets falling at timely intervals, they started to loose their control over the game. Thushara spoiled their party in the 18th over and got the tail end out to bat. Mahmadullah acted as their saviour and secured their win. With a win in their first game of the tournament, they are off to a good start.

!

Sri Lanka were off to a dream start. Dhananjaya de Silva gave them a breakthrough in the first over as he sent back Soumya Sarkar. Nuwan Thushara followed it up in the next over as he castled Tanzid Hasan. He continued his lethal bowling and made Najmul Hossain Shanto as his second prey. After that, the bowlers struggled to take wickets and also bowled some loose deliveries. They also bowled a lot of extras which didn’t make the scenario better. Wanindu Hasaranga got the wicket of Towhid Hridoy and Litton Das but the batters had already dealt a lot of damage to the Lankans. However, the scoring rate decreased but the pressure remained on the Lankans. Matheesha Pathirana got the wicket of Shakib Al Hasan courtesy of a brilliant catch by Maheesh Theekshana which gave them some confidence. Thushara got two more wickets at a very crucial time as he got rid of Rishad Hossain and Taskin Ahmed. They have now both their games and in order to move up the table, Sri Lanka, cannot afford to lose any more games. They will need to work on their performance espescially in the batting department.

!

WOW! We have witnessed a nail-biting encounter as two rivals from Asia put up a great fight in terms of bat and ball. There were a lot of ups and downs for both teams throughout the match but in the end Bangladesh emerged victorious. Mahmadullah made sure that he stays on the crease till the last run and secured their victory. However, they will not be too happy with their batting performance but will happily take those two points in their first match of the tournament.

DASUN SHANAKA TO MAHMUDULLAH

WHAT A FINISH! Mahmudullah takes Bangladesh home! Slower and fuller at the stumps. Mahmudullah skips down and drills it toward mid-off. The fielder has a shy at the stumps and poor backing up allows the second run. That will be it for Bangladesh as they complete two runs and win by 2 wickets with an over to spare.
