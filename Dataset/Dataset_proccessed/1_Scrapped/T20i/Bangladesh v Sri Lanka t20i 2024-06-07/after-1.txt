Mahmudullah takes Bangladesh home

It wasn't all plain sailing. Bangladesh were pushed in the end, largely because of Nuwan Thushara's excellent bowling.

But Mahmudullah kept them ticking and even though he took a risky run at the end of the 19th over, in his attempts to keep strike, the shy at the stumps missed (Mahmudullah would have been out by miles if he'd hit), and they ran an overthrow to complete the victory.

Sri Lanka's bowlers battled hard here, but their batters just didn't give them enough to play with. Even a score of 150 could have been testing, given the quality Sri Lanka have among their bowlers.

They now have to depend on some insane upsets in Group D to have a shot at qualifying for the Super Eights.

Thushara double strike

Uuuuhhhm, hold on. What seemed like it would be an amble to the finish has turned hairy now, because in his last over, Nuwan Thushara has taken two wickets in two balls, first bowling Rishad Hossain who tried to crash him inside out, before nailing Taskin Ahmed first ball with a swinging, toe-crushing yorker.

This was the over. It's left Bangladesh eight down but Mahmudullah is still there.

Theekshana takes a stunner

Is there some hope for Sri Lanka here? If anything can lift them, it's a catch like that. Maheesh Theekshana, often among the worse catchers and fielders in the Sri Lanka team, has surged forward at deep third, put in a full length dive and got his hands under a ramp shot off the bat of Shakib Al Hasan.

That's got to be one of the catches of the tournament so far. Matheesha Pathirana is the bowler who gets that wicket. Shakib had tried to deflect a short ball for four.

Are Sri Lanka out if they lose this?
Are Sri Lanka out if they lose here?•ICC/Getty Images

If Sri Lanka lose this, which looks overwhelmingly likely at the moment, they might become the first high-profile team to make an exit.

They are not officially out, of course. It's possible that Nepal or Netherlands will pull off some upsets (in this World Cup, you wouldn't bet against it). But if Bangladesh beat those two teams, and South Africa do too, Sri Lanka are done for in this tournament.

In any case, it's been a rough start to Hasaranga's captaincy in World Cups.

Hridoy takes flight, but Hasaranga gets him

Having consolidated for a bit, Bangladesh are flying towards the target now, with Towhid Hridoy hitting big blows against Hasaranga.

He'd hit a thundering slog sweep against the same bowler earlier in the innings.

This time, in the 12th over, he pumps him for a six over deep midwicket to start, then one over deep square leg (both off slog sweeps), and a third one over cover, having made room and gone inside out.

He goes for a fourth big shot, but Hasaranga gets the better of him this time, bowling a fast slider and pinning him in front of the stumps. The umpire says not out initiall, but ball tracker suggests it would have crashed into middle.

Still, Hridoy's 40 off 20 should be plenty. Bangladesh only need to cruise from here.

Litton keeps Bangladesh on track

After a few wicket-less overs, the Bangladesh chase is firmly on track. A lot of this has to do with Litton, who is playing a slow innings by T20 standards, but it's exactly the kind Bangladesh need in a chase of 130.

Towhid Hridoy is playing a slightly more aggressive innings - he's struck a nice six off Wanindu Hasaranga and a beautifully-timed straight drive for four off Matheesha Pathirana.

Thushara keeps picking up Bangladesh wickets

Number of wickets Nuwan Thushara has taken in his first seven T20I overs against Bangladesh

In the last match he played against Bangladesh, Nuwan Thushara claimed a hat-trick and took 5 for 20. That spell helped launch his IPL career, and got him into this World Cup XI.

He's picked up where he's left off against Bangladesh, Najmul Hossain Shanto his latest victim, caught at cover. It looked like Shanto was looking for inswing, but got a straight one that he poked to the right of Asalanka, who completed a nice diving catch.

Thushara's three powerplay overs brought two wickets and cost only 12.

Are Sri Lanka still in this? They have to believe it, now they've got a wicket in each of the first two overs.

First, Dhananjaya de SIlva had Soumya Sarkar hitting one to mid on off the leading edge. And then Nuwan Thushara swung one through the defences of Tanzid.

Bangladesh are yet to find the boundary, but they won't panic yet. This is a small target they are chasing.

The Fizz is back
Mustafizur Rahman took 3 for 17 from his four overs•AFP/Getty Images

It's been a while since we've seen Mustafizur dominate an innings on the international stage, but that's exactly what he did in this game. He took the wicket of Nissanka with a cutter early on, having earlier removed Kamindu Mendis.

In his last over, he got Maheesh Theekshana out as well. The cutters were cutting today - he often went short of a length and asked the batters to hit him square, and they were frequently unable to make contact.

He's the main reason Bangladesh are chasing a modest target.

That is all the balls Sri Lanka faced since the 12th over. Notice how many boundaries there are. And how many wickets.

Sri Lanka lost more wickets in this period that runs scored in boundaries. And in between, it's not like they were rotating the strike either. This has been a truly abysmal batting performance outside of Pathum Nissanka.

Bangladesh have been excellent with the ball, and kept Sri Lanka pinned once they lost momentum following Nissanka's dismissal.

This is some outstanding tight bowling from Bangladesh, who have varied their speeds and lengths beautifully, with Mustafizur in particular having produced a wonderful exemplar of T20 bowling.

But Sri Lanka's hitting has gone completely missing since the end of Pathum Nissanka's innings. Only Charith Asalanka has hit a six since Nissanka was out. They lost five wickets between the ninth and nineteenth over.

Rishad Hossain bossing it for Bangladesh

Rishad Hossain has been outstanding with his legspin in this match, and has been the biggest reason Bangladesh have dominated the middle overs.

You'll see that in the 14th over he made a double strike, dismissing the set Charith Asalanka (caught at deep square leg) and Wanindu Hasaranga (caught at slip) first ball.

He also dragged Dhananjaya de Silva out of his crease and had him stumped in his last over.

He flighted the ball beautifully, got some turn off the surface, and was incredibly accurate throughout. Brave and effective bowling from Rishad, and he takes home figures of 3 for 22 for those efforts. Outstanding.

Sri Lanka's run rate since the fall of Pathum Nissanka

Nissanka had kept the scoring rate booming while he was at the crease, but the remaining batters have been much quieter. In the 25 balls since his dismissal (up to the end of the 13th over), Sri Lanka have made only 25.

Pathum Nissanka was looking good for a very big score in Dallas, having hit eight spectacular boundaries, and made 47 of Sri Lanka's first 70 runs.

But Mustafizur bowls a fullish cutter that Nissanka tries to smoke over mid off, but ends up only spooning to the fielder there.

The Fizz is carrying forward his IPL form, by the way. He has taken a wicket in each of his two overs so far. Wonderfully deceptive bowling.

Althougb they've lost two wickets, Pathum Nissanka's boundary-hitting in the powerplay has brought Sri Lanka 53 runs in the powerplay. Nissanka hit four fours and a six down the ground so far, and is looking especially confident through the leg side here.

Taskin Ahmed, coming back from injury, bowls two short balls first up that see Kusal Mendis crash him to the deep midwicket boundary, then the deep third boundary first up.

But then Taskin comes back with a length ball tight into the stumps that Mendis was on the back foot for, and ends up chopping back on to his stumps.

Kamindu Mendis is the new batter and he carves Taskin away through deep third first ball as well, so it's not a terrible over for Sri Lanka despite the wicket.

Sri Lanka have batting down to Wanindu Hasaranga, who is trying to prove himself a proper allrounder these days. Bangladesh legspinner Rishad Hossain can bat a bit too, and has a T20I high score of 53 after seven innings.

Number of wins SL have over Bangladesh in T20 World Cups. They've only played twice in this tournament.

If you look at T20I history, Sri Lanka have had the better of Bangladesh, not only in bilaterals, but in the World Cup as well, having beaten them in 2007 and 2021.

Bangladesh have taken Sri Lanka down in multi-team tournaments before though, most recently in the ODI World Cup, when they won to help ensure Sri Lanka did not qualify for the Champions Trophy next year

Must win (?) game for Sri Lanka

Hey folks. Welcome to our Live Report on Sri Lanka v Bangladesh.

Bangladesh have won the toss and opted to bowl first, which seems like the move to make in this World Cup. Sri Lanka have made one change to their side from their match against South Africa - They've dropped Sadeera Samarawickrama and brought in Dhananjaya de Silva, who also provides a spin option.
