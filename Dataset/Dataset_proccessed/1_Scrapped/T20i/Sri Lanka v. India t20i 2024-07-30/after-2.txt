India vs Sri Lanka, 3rd T20I Highlights:

India vs Sri Lanka, 3rd T20I Highlights: Sri Lanka needed just 30 to win off the last five overs but then collapsed in the most extraordinary fashion to end up only tying the scores. India, who bowled Rinku Singh and captain Suryakumar Yadav in the last two overs of the innings, somehow pushed the match into a Super Over, which they won in a jiffy. Washington Sundar picked both Sri Lankan wickets off consecutive balls with just two runs on the board after which Suryakumar hit a four off the first ball and won it. India thus secured a 3-0 clean sweep in Gautam Gambhir's first series as head coach and Suryakumar's first as the team's full-time T20I captain....Read More

Washington Sundar was player of the match, having scored 25 in 18 balls before returning figures of 2/23 and taking two more wickets for two runs in the Super Over. Charith Asalanka berates his middle and lower middle order for the way they collapsed in all thee of the games that was played in this series. Sri Lanka batted with just three wickets. SKY hands the trophy to Rinku and Parag as India celebrate the victory. Thanks for joining us, see you all in the first ODI between these two sides that will be played in Colombo on Friday. Oh, and also see around for that little event which is taking place in Paris.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20I, IND vs SL: Suryakumar Yadav ends it with the first ball, India win the Super Over

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20I, IND vs SL: Well, the Sri Lankan batters, particularly the ones that walked in for this series after the top three, need to take a long hard look at themselves in the mirror for losing that one. Theekshana bowls the Super Over for the hosts, fires the first ball flat and quick and SKY sweeps it past short fine leg to win the match off the first ball of the Super Over. India win their first series with him as full-time captain and Gautam Gambhir as head coach 3-0.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20I, IND vs SL: INDIA NEED 3 RUNS TO WIN IN THE SUPER OVER

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20I, IND vs SL: Sundar takes back to back wickets for the second time tonight and Sri Lanka walk off with just 2 runs on the board in the Super Over. India need to score 3 to win this. Just the most extraordinary turnaround here. Sri Lanka had this in the bag, it was almost impossible to see them losing it during the 15th over. Anyhow, here are Suryakumar yadav and Shubman Gill, the former is on strike.

July 30, 2024 11:46 PM IST
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20I, IND vs SL: OUT! Perera falls

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20I, IND vs SL: The players walk back out

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20I, IND vs SL: Kusal Perera and Kusal Mendis, seemingly two of three Sri Lankan batters who can stay in the crease for more than three balls, walk out for the hosts. Washington Sundar bowling the Super Over for India. Sri Lanka lost as many as seven wickets for 29 runs in the last five overs of their innings. India just can't lose it seems.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20I, IND vs SL: IT'S A SUPER OVER!

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20I, IND vs SL: Oh the Sri Lankans run two after Wickramasinghe pushes it down the ground. The batters somehow run two and the scores are tied! We have a Super Over!

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20I, IND vs SL: Wickramasinghe, who did so well with the ball on his international debut, now faces the last ball of the match with his team needing three to win off it. Two runs for a super over. Here we go!

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20I, IND vs SL: GONE! 2 IN 2 FOR SKY!

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20I, IND vs SL: Sri Lanka are imploding and how! They are somehow falling apart in the most extraordinary way imaginable. SKY sends it in from wide of the crease down the leg side, Theekshana goes for the sweep, Samson appeals and the umpire shakes his head. SKY takes the review and there was a glove on it.

Theekshana c Samson b Suryakumar Yadav 0 (1)

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20I, IND vs SL: OUT! SKY GETS HIS MAIDEN INTERNATIONAL WICKET!

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20I, IND vs SL: This is quite extraordinary. Kamindu Mendis goes for the reverse sweep and finds the fielder in the deep. Sri Lanka need six to win off the last four!

July 30, 2024 11:28 PM IST
India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20I, IND vs SL: Suryakumar Yadav to bowl the last over!

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, 3rd T20I, IND vs SL: Well that is a bit strange. SKY wants to stick to spinners but then he could have handed the ball to Yashasvi Jaiswal who is a genuine part-time spinner. But it seems he has decided to take up that responsibility himself. A rare over coming up from Suryakumar Yadav and it is the last over of the match itself with Sri Lanka needing six runs to win.
