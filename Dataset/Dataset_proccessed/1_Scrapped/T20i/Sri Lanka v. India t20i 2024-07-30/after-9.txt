Sri Lanka vs India Commentary
6:57 PM IST As for now, the focus shifts to a bigger format, the ODIs. With all these T20s going around, it is hard for fans to stay patient for a 50-over game, but if there is the excitement to see the likes of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Kuldeep Yadav and a score of the World Cup stars returning, there would be very few to take a risk of choosing to miss them in action. So you don't take the risk either! Sri Lanka will have to pull up their socks if they have to put on a better show. The first ball will be bowled at 2.30 PM IST (0900 GMT) on Friday, 2nd August, 2024, but our build-up will begin much earlier than usual. So please tune in. Until then, you can catch action from the Hundred and a couple of other T20 Leagues by switching our tabs. ADIOS! TAKE CARE!
6:54 PM IST Congratulations to Gautam Gambhir and Suryakumar Yadav for putting their stepping stone correctly. Knowing Gambhir, for now, he will take 3-0 and allow the players to celebrate, but once the celebrations die down, he will have a quiet word with the team. By no means would the batting department be happy with the batting on show and it was more due to poor shots by Indians than due to better bowling by Sri Lanka. In the bowling, he would hope that the Parags and Suryas become the Rainas and Sehwags of the future. Remember, Jaiswal can bowl leggies too. But that's for sometime later.
6:54 PM IST The Indian skipper, SURYAKUMAR YADAV, HAS BEEN NAMED AS THE PLAYER OF THE SERIES. He says that he feels that when they were 30/4, the boys showed great character and the way they batted was great. He says that 140 was a par score and says that he told if they put their heart in, they could pull it off. Mentions that the amount of skills they have, it makes his job easy as the skipper. Says that after the first game, he told the boys to be rested and they were ready to sit out. Ends by saying, he doesn't want to be the captain, but a leader.
6:48 PM IST The captain of Sri Lanka, CHARITH ASALANKA, expresses disappointment with the way the middle order and the lower middle order batted. Feels that the shot selection let them down. On the thinking behind sending Hasaranga up the order, he replies that they promoted him because the spinners were bowling and gave him the licence to play the big shots. Opines that shot selection needs to be spot on such surfaces. On what he looks forward to in the ODI series, he says that he hopes to see good batting performances in that series.
6:48 PM IST As expected, WASHINGTON SUNDAR HAS BEEN NAMED AS THE PLAYER OF THE MATCH, for his all-round show. He says he tried to stay calm and thanks Suryakumar Yadav for throwing the ball to him in the Super Over. Says he is grateful to get an opportunity to play for India. Adds he just tries to work hard daily and God has been kind to him. Mentions that they did a bit of homework against the opposition batters. Tells that there was some purchase from the surface and the ball was gripping nicely. Adds he just had to hit the right lines and lengths. He ends up with a broad smile and says he is delighted to see that things worked in their favour.
