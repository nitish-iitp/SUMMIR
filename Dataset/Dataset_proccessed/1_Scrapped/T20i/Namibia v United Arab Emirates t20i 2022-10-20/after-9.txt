NAM vs UAE, T20 World Cup Highlights: David Weise's 55 off 36 went in vain as UAE restricted Namibia to 141 for 8 while defending their 148 for 3 in the final Group A match of the first round of the ongoing T20 World Cup at Simonds Stadium, Geelong on Thursday. Earlier, Muhammad Waseem scored 50 runs off 41 balls while skipper Chundangapoyil Rizwan hit 43 not out off 29 balls as UAE posted a competitive total on the board after opting to bat first. UAE's win over Namibia kept both the sides to two points each and thus Netherlands, having four points in kitty, marched into the Super 12s, following table-topper Sri Lanka in Group A. (SCORECARD)

Here are the Highlights of the T20 World Cup Group A match between Namibia and UAE:

So, UAE’s win means that it will be Netherlands that go through from Group A along with the Asia Cup champions, Sri Lanka who book their spots in the Super 12s. However, there are still two seats up for grabs. The 2022 T20 World Cup action will continue on 21 October, Friday when we will get a clear picture how the Super 12 will look like. It is another double-header coming your way with much higher stakes this time. First, it will be Ireland locking horns with West Indies at 9.30 am IST (4 am GMT). Followed by a game between Scotland and Zimbabwe. The first ball will be at 1.30 pm IST (8 am GMT). But you can join us early for the build-up. Until then, take care and goodbye!

!

Chundangapoyil Rizwan, the victorious skipper is in for a chat. He starts by thanking the almighty for the win. Adds that as this is the first win they are happy and they did well as a team. Further says that they did well in patches in their previous games but the confidence was great in this game and the decision of giving Waseem the last over was instinctive. Ends by saying that they are here to tell the world that they play good cricket and they have done it.

!

Gerhard Erasmus, the Namibian captain says that they did well to restrict UAE. Also says that post their win against Sri Lanka, they didn’t play good cricket in the next two matches. Applauds David Wiese for his brilliant knock. Ends by adding that they didn’t have enough in them to go through.

!

Muhammad Waseem wins the Man of the Match award for his complete performance. He says that it was difficult to bowl the death overs as he was bowling for the first time in the tournament. Adds that though it was his first game he planned well and was successful. Further says that the way Zahoor Khan bowled was excellent as well. Ends by saying that he is happy with the win but they should have done well in their previous games as well.

!

Stay tuned for the presentation...

!

Earlier in the evening, UAE were off to a slow start having decided to bat first. With the innings going nowhere till the 18th over, Basil Hameed’s lusty blows towards the end helped UAE reach a respectable total. Namibia were listless with the ball earlier and could not threaten the batting department much. Later, UAE were able to defend a below-par target.

!

United Arab Emirates had nothing to lose in this game and they came up with their best bowling performance tonight against Namibia. Having put Namibia in all sorts of trouble after 13 overs, UAE let it slip and Wiese put them in a worrying situation. Muhammad Waseem though bowled an exceptional final over against Wiese to knock Namibia out of the tournament. UAE will certainly head back home with their heads held high.

!

Namibia were dealt some early blows in their chase of 149. Their middle order too failed to step up and as a result, Namibia never got going while chasing in this must-win game. At 69-7, Namibia were on the cusp of a defeat. Then the pair of David Wiese and Ruben Trumpelmann resurrected the Namibian innings and put their side back in a commanding position with their stand of 70 runs, the highest ever 8th wicket stand in the history of the T20 World Cup. Namibia gave it their all but in the end it wasn’t meant to be.

!

A historic win for United Arab Emirates. They have recorded their first even win the T20 World Cup. David Wiese fought till the very end but could not sneak his side into the Super 12s. So near yet so far. Namibia unfortunately will be heading back home here.

MUHAMMAD WASEEM TO DAVID WIESE

OUT! CAUGHT! Muhammad Waseem is delighted but so are a few Dutch fans in the crowd. This should be the final nail in the coffin. It is full, outside off. Wiese gets under it and lofts it towards long on. It could've been six but Alishan Sharafu had other ideas. He leaps in the deep and takes a sharp catch. Bernard Scholtz is the new man in.

MUHAMMAD WASEEM TO RUBEN TRUMPELMANN

MUHAMMAD WASEEM TO DAVID WIESE

Waseem fires in a yorker yet again, on leg. David Wiese digs it out to the leg side and gets a single.

MUHAMMAD WASEEM TO DAVID WIESE

It is right in the blockhole, on middle and leg. Wiese flicks it to deep mid-wicket. The call is for two and they get two.

!

Looks like UAE need to put an extra fielder inside the circle, as they go past the cut-off time. Yes, they can only have 4 fielders outside the circle. So, 14 needed of 6 balls now. Who will get over the line?
