On Thursday night, Match 10 of the 2022 T20 World Cup will feature Namibia vs. UAE. Tuesday’s match saw Namibia lose to Netherlands by five wickets after defeating Sri Lanka in their initial match. UAE has participated in two games so far and has lost both. The match gets underway at Kardinia Park in Geelong at 19:00 local time.

After beating Sri Lanka, Namibia was feeling confident, but the Netherlands on Tuesday dragged them back to reality. They should, however, have more than enough talent to upset UAE.

In their first encounter, UAE came close to defeating the Netherlands, but in their second match, they were easily defeated by Sri Lanka. If UAE is to defeat Namibia, a strong showing with both bat and ball will be necessary.

NAM vs UAE Weather Report

With humidity of about 83%, Saturday’s weather seems good.

NAM vs UAE Match Toss Prediction

Both teams will be motivated to select their side at the toss, bowl first, and limit the opposition to less than 125 runs. Around 120 runs are scored in this league’s first inning at Geelong.

Namibia Team News & Probable Playing XIs

Namibia expected to start the game against the Netherlands unchanged after their remarkable 55-run victory against Sri Lanka on Sunday. Although Tuesday’s performance as a whole was subpar, we anticipate the same starting lineup for this game.

Recent form – L W W W L

Namibia’s Probable XI

Gerhard Erasmus (c), Zane Green (wk), Divan la Cock, Michael van Lingen, Jan Nicol Loftie-Eaton, Stephan Baard, David Wiese, Jan Frylinck, Bernard Scholtz, JJ Smit, Ben Shikongo 

United Arab Emirates Team News & Probable Playing XIs

Prior to their encounter against Sri Lanka in the T20 World Cup 2022, the UAE XI’s top order batter Aryan Lakra took fast bowler Zawar Farid’s position. Despite the fact that Lakra only managed one run from three balls, we anticipate that he will remain in the lineup for this match against Nambia.
