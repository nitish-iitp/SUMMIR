India vs Bangladesh Asian Games 2023 semi-final live score: IND vs BAN Live Updates

India vs Bangladesh Highlights, Asian Games 2023: The Indian men's cricket team has guaranteed a medal at the Asian Games by beating Bangladesh by 9 wickets in the first semifinal and entering the gold medal match. After keeping Bangladesh to a lowly 96/9, India were jolted early in their chase as Yashasvi Jaiswal, the centurion from the previous game, fell in the first over. But it was smooth sailing for India ever since, as Tilak Varma and captain Ruturaj Gaikwad unleashed on the Bangladesh bowlers with a flurry of fours and sixes and knocked off the target in just 9.2 overs....Read More

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: MATCH SUMMARY!

India made short work of the Asian Games men's cricket semifinal by defeating Bangladesh with a resounding 9-wicket margin. India's captain, Ruturaj Gaikwad, set the tone for the match by winning the toss and electing to bowl, a decision that proved crucial. Shahbaz Ahmed, making his debut for the Indian team in place of Avesh Khan, picked up his maiden international wicket while R Sai Kishore's remarkable performance was pivotal in restricting Bangladesh to a mere 96/9, as he claimed 3 wickets for just 12 runs. While India faced an early setback with Yashasvi Jaiswal's dismissal for a duck, Tilak Varma rose to the occasion with an outstanding fifty, putting an end to his recent struggles. His unbeaten 55 off 26 balls, combined with Ruturaj Gaikwad's 40 off 26, powered India to victory. The duo's unbroken 97-run partnership not only secured a medal for India, but set the stage for a gold medal finish tomorrow.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: Tilak Varma explains his celebration

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: The youngster dedicated this knock – an unbeaten half-century to his mother. He made a promise to his mum that he's score runs in this match after going through, and in his words, 'a rough patch'. After that splendid series against West Indies, Tilak endured a few low scores – 0 and 1 against Ireland, 5 against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup and 2 in the previous match, and what a way to brush it off. Played, young man!

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: VICTORY! IND win by 9 wickets

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: Ruturaj Gaikwad knocks off the remaining runs. A boundary followed by a single and India are into the gold medal match. Absolute annihilation of Bangladesh this by India, handing the Asian neighbours a convincing 9-wicket thrashing. With the win they have assured a medal. Team India will walk away with at least a silver but they would settle for nothing less than a gold.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: SIX! FIFTY for Tilak Varma

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: A second T20I half-century for Tilak Varma and he gets there with a banger of a shot. Clears the ropes comfortably for his 6th six. This has been utter domination from this young Indian team. A fan of tattoos, Tilak points towards a big one on his abdomen after getting to the landmark. India just 5 away from a place in the gold medal match.

Oct 6, 2023 9:07 AM IST
India vs Bangladesh Live Score: A SIX on one knee!

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: Not stopping Tilak Varma as he bludgeons his 5th SIX of the innings. Goes down on one knee but the connection is spot on as another ball flies over the boundary and thuds into one of the trees. He goes to 47 as India progress to 82/1 in 8 overs. Just 15 more needed. It could finish in this over itself.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: Spinner's pitch? What's that?

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: Given how the first innings panned out, the Indian batting was expected to be out under a bit of pump by the Bangladesh spinners, but it's been anything but that as Gaikwad and Tilak have grabbed this bowling attack by the scruff of its neck and pummelled them with some exquisite strokeplay. India 74/1 in 7 overs and it's only a matter of time now.

Oct 6, 2023 8:57 AM IST
India vs Bangladesh Live Score: Only FOURS and SIXES now

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: Another over starts with a six as Tilak nails his third six – this time down the ground – and then plays a switch hit for FOUR. It's that easy for India; they're treating this as net practice. The over ends with a third six as Gaikwad clears the sweeper cover boundary with ease. India 67/1, need just 30 more off 90 balls.

Oct 6, 2023 8:53 AM IST
India vs Bangladesh Live Score: CRUNCHED! Tilak launches the ball for another biggie

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: Raining boundaries and sixes for India. After Gaikwad in the previous over, it's Tilak's turn to up the ante. Two similar deliveries in the slot from left-arm quick Mrittunjoy Chowdhury, and on both occasions, Tilak connects a wristy flick brilliantly. All the way for six. India bring up their 50 in absolutely no time.

Oct 6, 2023 8:48 AM IST
India vs Bangladesh Live Score: And now consecutive FOURS

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: Gaikwad in the mood. After clobbering two sixes, Gaikwad drills a couple more boundaries through the off-side to make it a handsome over for India. 21 off Ripun Mondol's second as India breeze away to 36/1 after 3 overs. Clearly, pace isn't working for Bangladesh so they might need to turn to something different.

Oct 6, 2023 8:44 AM IST
India vs Bangladesh Live Score: PULLED! Back-to-back SIXES

India vs Bangladesh Live Score: That's more the Gaikwad the world is accustomed to seeing. No more defending today, no more being circumspect. He takes Mondol on. Drops it short, not much pace and Gaikwad gets into position in a nano-second and pulls it over cow corner for a SIX. Dishes out the same treatment next ball as Mondol doesn't learn his lesson. This one a lot more conventional as the ball lands over square leg boundary. India racing away.
