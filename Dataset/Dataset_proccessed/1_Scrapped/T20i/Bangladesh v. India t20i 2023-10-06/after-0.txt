Bangladesh struggled right from the start, and at the end of the powerplay, they were 21/3 in six overs.
The Indian spinners, including Sai Kishore, Washington Sundar, and Tilak Varma, kept the pressure on, and Bangladesh was reduced to 40/4 in ten overs. Pavez Hossain Emon was the top contributor for Bangladesh with 23 runs from 32 balls.

Chasing a target of 97 runs, India lost opener Yashasvi Jaiswal early for a four-ball duck. However, captain Ruturaj Gaikwad and Tilak Varma launched a rapid counter-attack, taking India to 68/1 in just six overs. India successfully chased down the target in 9.2 overs, with Gaikwad remaining unbeaten on 40 runs from 26 balls and Varma scoring an explosive 55 not out from 26 balls.
With this win, India advanced to the final of the cricket tournament at the Asian Games, where they will face either Afghanistan or Pakistan in the gold medal match on October 7th.
