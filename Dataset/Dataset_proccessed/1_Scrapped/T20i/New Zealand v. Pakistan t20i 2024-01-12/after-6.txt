In Santner’s absence, Ish Sodhi remains the only specialist spin-bowling option for the Black Caps in the series opener.

The Kiwis recently played in the T20I series against Bangladesh that was tied 1-1. For the first time, New Zealand lost to the Tigers in a T20I at home.

In the meantime, earlier on Friday, Pakistan named their playing XI for their opening T20I against the Kiwis. Abbas Afridi was handed his maiden international cap as he gets set to partner Haris Rauf and Shaheen Shah Afridi in the fast-bowling department.

Babar Azam will bat at No.3 with Mohammad Rizwan and the talented Saim Ayub to open the batting for the Men in Green.

In 34 T20Is, New Zealand have won only 13 while Pakistan finished on the winning side 20 times. One match back in April 2023 at the Rawalpindi Stadium was called off due to rain.
