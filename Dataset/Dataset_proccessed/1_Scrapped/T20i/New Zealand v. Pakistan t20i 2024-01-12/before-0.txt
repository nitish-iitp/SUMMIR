Actor Vijay Sethupathi

Vijay Sethupathi has clearly found huge fandom in Hindi cinema audiences, thanks to Shah Rukh Khan’s ‘Jawan’ and Shahid Kapoor’s ‘Farzi’, and now the actor is awaiting the release of the Sriram Raghavan film ‘Merry Christmas’ opposite Katrina Kaif. While he enjoys huge appreciation in South films as well, Vijay is still getting used to all the attention that’s coming his way.

Confessing how he’s now said to break the set template of how a Hindi film actor looks, Vijay Sethupathi remembers the time when he was body-shamed due to his habit of showing up in “chappals” at functions, and meetings.

Speaking to Indian Express, Vijay said, “Main aisa hi tha, body shaming bohot kiya tha mujhe (I have faced a lot of body-shaming for the way I look). Wahaan bhi kiya tha (they also did it). It happened, but the good thing is that people accept you for who you are. Today wherever I go, I am accepted, it is a blessing. (It’s all) thanks to my audience that I am happy being myself. I didn’t expect this, I didn’t…”

Considering the love he receives from his fans, it has now given him a validation that he is moving in the “right direction.” He added, “I believe fans are fans and their love is so true. Receiving love from fans is like an energy drink. When people love you, it gives you hope that your work has reached people and they have understood and they really like your work. That’s what I understood from the fan clubs. That always gives me energy.”

Of course, it cannot be ruled out that apart from his acting talent, there’s always chatter about the way he dresses up in simple casuals. Talking about it, the actor said that it does impact him, and he gets conscious about his fashion choices.

“Sometimes I am conscious about my costumes because I believe in wearing what I am comfortable in. Sometimes people say I am showing off, sometimes they say I am too simple. Chappal pehnega toh simple matlab kya (how is wearing slippers equal to bring simple?). But sometimes I am conscious about that also. If I go to functions, I see people dressed up really well, and I get really conscious. So mostly I try to avoid going for get-togethers and meetings generally, otherwise I am comfortable,” he said.

'Merry Christmas' is a romantic thriller film made simultaneously in Hindi and Tamil. The film is scheduled to release in theatres on January 12, 2024.
