PAK vs NZ T20 series 2023: The New Zealand cricket team’s tour of Pakistan will kick off on 14 April and end in early May. In this tour, the two teams will compete with each other in five One Day International (ODI) matches and five T20 International (T20I) matches. The tour is making up for the series that was postponed in September 2021. The ODI series is not part of the Super League. However, it will form part of both teams’ preparations for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.

All the T20 matches will be held across different venues in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi in Pakistan. In April last year, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed that the series would be taking place. In May 2022, New Zealand Cricket confirmed that they would compensate the PCB for the postponed series, as well as playing extra matches on the tour. 

In October 2022, the PCB announced the fixtures for the tour. In April 2023, the PCB finally announced the revised fixtures for the tour. Before this tour, New Zealand toured Pakistan in December last year and in January 2023 to play two Test matches and three ODIs.
