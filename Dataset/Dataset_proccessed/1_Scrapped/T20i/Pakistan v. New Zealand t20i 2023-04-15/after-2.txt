Watch: Babar Azam went to a scintillating century in Lahore with a lofted four off the final ball of the innings.

Playing the second T20I of a five-match series against New Zealand, Babar Azam scored a fantastic ton off just 58 balls, a milestone he brought up in what was an electric atmosphere in Lahore, as he went from 85 to 101 off the final four deliveries of the innings to reach the landmark in dramatic fashion.

Babar’s innings consisted of 11 fours and three sixes for a total of 14 boundaries, three of which came in the final over to take the Pakistan captain to three figures.

The final over started with Babar on 84 and the chances of a century in front of a packed Gaddafi stadium looking slim. Two singles started the over which meant the equation was now 15 needed off four balls for Babar to send those in attendance wild.

The first ball Babar slapped over long-off for six the bowling of Jimmy Neesham to take him into the 90s and make the Lahore crowd believe that something special could be about to happen.

A two was then taken into the leg-side as Babar found a pocket of space meaning he now required seven off the last two. With the pressure ramping up along with the volume in the stadium, Babar managed to drive the penultimate delivery over long-off to take himself to 97 and send the crowd into a frenzy. He was now just a hit away.

Neesham ran in once more and bowled wide to Babar who threw everything he could at the ball and connected. The ball went over cover and flew towards the boundary, almost going for six, but it didn’t matter. Three figures had been reached and Babar, along with thousands in the stadium, roared in celebration.

It was Babar’s ninth T20 century in total, taking him to second place in terms of record number of T20 hundreds, but he is still a long way from Chris Gayle’s record of 22.
