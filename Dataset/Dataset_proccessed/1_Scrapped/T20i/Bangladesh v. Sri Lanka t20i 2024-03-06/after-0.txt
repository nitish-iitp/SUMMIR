WATCH: Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka throws up another controversy, batter nicks the ball yet given not out by third umpire
Upon Bangladesh's review, the UltraEdge would confirm there was an edge but much to the surprise of the Sri Lankan players, the third umpire deemed Sarkar not out.

Screengrab: The UltraEdge shows a clear spike as the ball passes Soumya Sarkar's bat, Angelo Mathews reacts to the third umpire deeming the Bangladesh opener not out. (FanCode)

It’s now become somewhat of a cheatcode. Bangladesh play Sri Lanka, one thing leads to another and voila, we have a controversy.

The latest surfaced during the second T20I between the two teams at Sylhet in the three-match series. With Sri Lanka leading 1-0, and Bangladesh needing 166 to win, Binura Fernando would manage to find a nick off Soumya Sarkar’s bat leading to a caught behind appeal. The on-field umpire deemed it out but Bangladesh would go upstairs for a check.

The UltraEdge would confirm there was indeed an edge but much to the surprise of the Sri Lankan players, the third umpire deemed Sarkar not out. Watch the entire incident develop here:

DRAMA! Clear noise &gt; on-field umpire signals out > review taken > 3rd umpire rules not out despite UltraEdge!

Bangladesh-Sri Lanka always throws up a controversy 😶

Heated discussions took place between the visitors and the two sets of umpires as the Bangladesh opener got an early lifeline. Even though Sarkar only went on to score 26, his first wicket partnership with Litton Das – 68 – led the foundation for an eight wicket win as the hosts levelled the series going into the decider.

One can only expect for a riveting series finale come Saturday. The two teams have had a fierce rivalry in the recent years. During last year’s ODI World Cup in India, the league stage match between the two, with little stake in the semifinal qualification, had led to another hotly debated moment – Angelo Mathews’ timed out dismissal. It was weirdly poetic that as the on-field umpire confirmed that Sarkar had been deemed not out by the third umpire, the cameras panned to the veteran Sri Lankan all-rounder, who offered nothing but a wry smile.

One would be remiss to forget that this is also the rivalry which gave cricket the infamous Naagin dance celebration during the 2018 Nidahas Trophy in Sri Lanka.
