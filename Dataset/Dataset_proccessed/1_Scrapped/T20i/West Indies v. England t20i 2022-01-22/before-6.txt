COMMENTRY
Right then! That is it from the coverage of this game! The action from the U-19 World Cup 2022 continues and we have a lot of exciting games lined up. Although, you can join us for India's next game in the U-19 World Cup to catch all the live coverage. India Under-19 will face Uganda Under-19 on Saturday, 22nd January 2022. The first ball of this clash will be bowled at 6.30 pm IST (1 pm GMT). But as you all know, the buildup will begin well in advance. So please tune in early. Till then, Adios!
Nishant Sindhu, the skipper of India Under-19, says that he is very happy, and the team is performing well and they will continue to do the same. On being asked about how things were after the covid scenario in their camp, he mentions that it was not easy with everything happening, but they were focused which helped them win the game. Adds that all the support staff and the coaches have been very supportive and have backed them throughout.
Tim Tector, the skipper of Ireland Under-19, credits India Under-19, he says that India put pressure on them straightaway. He adds that they did not bowl pretty well and they pulled things back later on by picking up some wickets and were happy to restrict India Under-19 to just over 300 runs, only because it was a good surface to bat on. Mentions that they were put on the back foot straightaway, maybe they could have been more proactive. Concludes by saying that they are playing South Africa Under-19 next and are looking forward to that game.
Harnoor Singh is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH. He says that the wicket was quite slow. Adds that the wicket was flat and good to bat on. Tells that they played well as a unit and he was playing according to the situation. Mentions that Rajvardhan Hangargekar was unbelievable with the bat at the end overs and they are very happy with his batting. Says that they have the backing of VVS Laxman and are looking forward to the next game.
...THE PRESENTATION...
India Under-19 bowlers were brilliant with the ball right from the word go and they never let the Irish batters settle in. All the bowlers chipped in when needed and this has been a comprehensive performance from them. The new ball bowlers set the tone up front and picked crucial wickets. Spinners came to bowl later on and they kept things tight in the middle. The Indian bowlers did not give any freebies whatsoever to the Irish batters and that resulted in them picking up wickets at regular intervals. A total of 8 bowlers were used by captain Nishant Sindhu and none of the bowlers disappointed him. All in all, it was a comprehensive performance from India Under-19 as Ireland Under-19 were blown away by the Men in Blue.
Ireland batters had their task cut out, chasing a target of over 300 and one would think that they will go hard in the Powerplay. But, the Irish batters did now show any intent whatsoever in the first 10 overs and also lost 3 key wickets in the process. Their innings never really got going and nothing went their way. Joshua Cox held one end but he struggled to rotate the strike and as a result, he too perished. Scott MacBeth came in to bat later on and he was the only batter who showed some intent but it was too late for Ireland Under-19. They kept losing wickets at regular intervals and fell short by a huge margin in the end.
What a dominant display this has been from India Under-19! They secure their second consecutive win of the tournament and are through to the Super League Quarter Finals! Ireland Under-19 were completely outplayed in this game and they would be very disappointed with their performance.
