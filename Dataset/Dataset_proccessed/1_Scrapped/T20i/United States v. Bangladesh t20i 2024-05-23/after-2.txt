IPL 2025

‘Yatra Pratibha Avsara Prapnotihi’ means ‘where talent meets opportunity’ and it is the soul of the Indian Premier League (IPL). Over the years, a vast number of cricketers have benefited from the cash-rich tournament and 2025 is going to be no exception. Every year, IPL is getting bigger, better and more entertaining and it also promises to nourish the young talents and make them the champions of tomorrow.

Since its inception in 2008, IPL has only made cricket more competitive than ever. Each ball matters in the tournament and interestingly, the fistfight begins much before the toss as it starts with the auction. Ahead of IPL 2025, BCCI will be hosting a mega-auction, which will see various cricketers switching sides and it will most likely change the fortune of teams for the next few years.

IPL 2024 saw the same thing. Sunrisers Hyderabad broke the bank for Pat Cummins as they signed him for INR 20.50 crore. They added Travis Head as well and eventually, SRH qualified for the final. Kolkata Knight Riders, the champions, also broke the bank as they signed Mitchell Starc for INR 24.75. The Shreyas Iyer-led side added Ramandeep Singh and Phil Salt, as they proved to be a very important addition to the squad.

In short, auction plays a major part but no one can predict if the players can step up under pressure situations. Some do, and many fail. Playing under lights and against international cricketers is never an easy task. Only the consistent cricketers survive, while others fade away quickly. So, ahead of the new season, players would hope to be more consistent with bat and bowl and make significant contributions to help their teams get closer to the title.
