PREVIEW

The United States (USA) and Bangladesh (BAN) are set to clash in the second T20I of the 2024 Bangladesh tour of the USA. The three-match series is currently poised at an intriguing phase, with the USA taking a 1-0 lead with their five-wicket win in the first match.

The hosts scripted history with a five-wicket win, recording their first win in a T20I against a Test-playing nation. Batting first, Bangladesh could post only a modest total of 153 runs despite Towhid Hridoy scoring a half-century. A collective effort by the USA batters saw them successfully hit the target with three balls to spare.

An exciting match is expected at the Prairie View Cricket Complex on Thursday, May 23, as it is a must-win game for the visitors. One more win would seal the series for the USA, something Najmul Hossain Shanto and Co. can't afford with the 2024 T20 World Cup around the corner.

PITCH REPORT

The pitch at the Prairie View Cricket Complex in Houston offers assistance to batters. Batters will have to be a little patient in the beginning as the pace bowlers are likely to get some help in the early stages. The chasing side has a slight advantage at this venue.

Harmeet Singh USA | BOWL

Harmeet Singh was adjudged Player of the Match for his heroism with the bat. The USA bowling all-rounder scored an unbeaten 33 of just 13 balls and steered his team to a historic win. He was also impressive with the ball, conceding an economy of 6.80 in his four overs.

Litton Das

BAN | WK

Litton Das hasn't had a good time with the bat in T20Is of late. In his previous 10 T20I innings, the keeper-batter has managed only 188 runs at a poor average of 20.89. He was dismissed for 14 runs of 15 balls in the first match.

8

Aaron Jones

USA | BAT

Aaron James struggled to find resistance in the previous match and was eventually dismissed for four runs off 12 balls. He seems to be in a lean patch and it would be wise to keep him off your fantasy teams.
