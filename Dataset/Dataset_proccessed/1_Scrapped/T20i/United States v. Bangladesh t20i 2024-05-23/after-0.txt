USA vs BAN (United States of America vs Bangladesh), 2nd T20I Match Preview

After their surprising win in the first match on Tuesday, which was easier than expected, the USA team will come back to the same place with a lot of confidence on Thursday. No USA players were injured in Tuesday’s victory.

The Bangladesh team will have many discussions before this match after their very embarrassing defeat in the first game of the series. However, they still have enough good players to win the series.

We predict that Bangladesh will win.
