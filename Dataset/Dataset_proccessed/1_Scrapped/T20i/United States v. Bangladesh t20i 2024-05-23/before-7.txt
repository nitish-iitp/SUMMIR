Why is May's Full Moon a Flower Moon?

Some northern Native American tribes referred to the May full moon as the "Budding Moon" or "Leaf Budding Moon" to celebrate the new blooms of spring. Others called it the "Planting Moon" because it signalled the time to plant seeds for the upcoming farming season.
