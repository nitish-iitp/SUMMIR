Namibia’s Jan Nicol Loftie-Eaton scored a record ton as the visitors set a target of 207 runs for Nepal in the inaugural match of the Nepal Tri-Nation T20I Series being played at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Tuesday.


Choosing to bat first after winning the toss, Loftie-Eaton cracked the fastest men’s T20I century as the visitors posted a total of 206 runs in the stipulated 20 overs.

Opener Michael van Lingen smashed two hits to the fences and a six as he put 20 runs on the scoreboard before being caught by Gushan Jha off Karan KC in 5.6 overs.

JP Kotze and Jan Frylinck were next to go, contributing 11 and 5 runs each, facing 9 and 7 deliveries respectively.

Loftie-Eaton muscled 11 boundaries and eight sixes as he scored 101 runs in just 36 balls. He broke the record for the fastest men’s T20I century, scoring the ton in just 33 deliveries, smashing the earlier record of 34-ball century held by Nepal’s Kushal Malla.

The left-handed batter also shared a 135-run partnership for the fourth wicket with ODI debutant Malan Kruger who fired six hits to the fences and two sixes of his own.

Loftie-Eaton was dismissed in 19.2 overs after Nepal’s Abhinash Bohara had him caught off Jha, while Kruger remained unbeaten for 59 runs in his 48-knock play

For the Rhinos, captain Rohit Paudel grabbed two Namibian scalps while Karan KC and Abhinash Bohara also managed to take a wicket apiece.
