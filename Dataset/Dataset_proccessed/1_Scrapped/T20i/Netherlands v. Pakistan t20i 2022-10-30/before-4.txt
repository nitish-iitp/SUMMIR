It's not rocket science. In other group, Australia is better team on paper, NZ is our bogey team. Facing any of these, we are expected to lose.

 

Semifinal exit was the most likely scenario and many predicted it in one of my earlier post. (Though gut feeling says we can beat these two, England will be more challenging).

These guys are obsessed with India...  Apni team ka janaza uth raha hai..  But he is passing comments on Indian team. 

Expand  

Not just obsessed.....they have jealousy to the core that they are more interested in our run in wc than their team thrashing out.

I'm sorry to say OP but you just like the many of the ICF posters are obsessed with what Pakistani posters/players say about India and its players.

 

It works both ways man.

noticed  this obsession with Pak more in ppl from north /west of India than others

Pakistan former cricketers have been very toxic this T20 World Cup towards their own team. No wonder they're equally toxic towards India.

I kinda agree with him. We are going to be greeted with a road where our slow ball specialists will be exposed. So far in both the matches swinging conditions helped us. Also pitch aided us.  We are far from perfect. 31/4? 120/7 then let tail wag. Later against Netherlands we couldn't get going until the end.

India is the best team in the world.

No team can stop India from winning this world cup and the 2023 WC as well.

It's written in the bars
