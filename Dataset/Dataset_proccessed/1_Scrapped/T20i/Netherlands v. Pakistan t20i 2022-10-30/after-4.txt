Pakistan finally registered their first win of the 2022 T20 World Cup and defeated Netherlands in their 3rd game of the tournament. After the defeats against India and Zimbabwe, a defeat at the hands of Netherlands would have almost pushed Pakistan out of the tournament. But they have kept their chances alive with a win over the Dutch side.
After the bowlers did their job, Mohammad Rizwan stepped up for his team and scored 49 off 39 balls. The wicketkeeper-batsman stayed at the crease till the 13th over and only departed after taking his team to the cusp of a win.
Apart from Rizwan's knock, there was another thing that hogged much limelight. The senior batsman was wearing a badge on his Pakistan shirt. The fans quickly noticed it and were left wondering why Rizwan was wearing it. Here, we give tell you the reason behind Mohammad Rizwan wearing the special badge -

Rizwan, who scored 553 runs in only 10 T20Is in September, pipped the two all-rounders to win the prestigious award. While it isn't known when he received his badge, Rizwan decided to wear it against Netherlands.
“I want to give my high appreciation to all my teammates as they made things easy for me. These achievements boost your confidence. I am happy with my performance and I would like to take this momentum forward in Australia. I would like to dedicate this award to the people in Pakistan who are affected by the floods and climate change. Hopefully this will bring smiles on their faces," Rizwan told ICC after winning the award.
India captain Harmanpreet Kaur won the Player of the Month award in the women's division. Smriti Mandhana was among the players nominated for the award.
