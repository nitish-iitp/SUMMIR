Preview:


India will take on South Africa in a crunch Group 2 encounter at the Perth Stadium on Sunday. While an India win would more or less help India cement their position in the semifinal after wins over Pakistan and The Netherlands, a defeat would extend their wait for a guaranteed spot in the semis. South Africa, meanwhile, would feel that they were unlucky to miss out on a point when their game against Zimbabwe ended without a result due to rain but did put on a dominating show against Bangladesh in their second fixture. With both teams eyeing 2 points from this match, this match has the ingredients of being a thriller.

Analysis:


It would be criminal to leave out Virat Kohli in this form from your Fantasy teams. He not only walks into the Fantasy team with 144 runs from 2 innings but does not have an average yet as he is yet to be dismissed in the competition which makes him a great contender to be a captain or a vice-captain. Suryakumar Yadav and Rohit Sharma look like the other sure-shot selections from among the India batters. From the Proteas, Rilee Rossouw and David Miller can be considered among the batters.


Giving both Quinton de Kock (South Africa) and Dinesh Karthik (India) a chance in the Fantasy XI may not be a bad option but if the team combination allows only one keeper, go for De Kock who open the innings unlike DK who may only get a handful of balls to make an impact with the bat.

There are some great all-round options from both teams in this match. A combination of Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel and R Ashwin from India while Wayne Parnell and Aiden Markram from the Proteas can be picked. Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Arshdeep Singh, Anrich Nortje and Kagiso Rabada are the bowling options who can be considered for this match.
