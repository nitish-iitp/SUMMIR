Synopsis
India began a new T20 era against Sri Lanka in Pallekele, marked by leadership shifts. Suryakumar Yadav debuted as captain after the retirements of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. India's squad featured fresh faces like Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal. Gautam Gambhir faced a wicketkeeper choice between Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson. Sri Lanka also appointed Charith Asalanka as captain.
Suryakumar Yadav-led India takes on Sri Lanka on Saturday in the first match of the 3-match series.
As India prepares to face Sri Lanka in the first T20I of their three-match series on Saturday at Pallekele, the game marks a significant transition in Indian cricket. This series will be the first for India following the retirements of key players Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, and it signals the beginning of a new era in the shortest format of the game.

Leadership Transition: Suryakumar Yadav's New Role

Suryakumar Yadav, who has taken over the T20I captaincy from Rohit Sharma, will lead India in this series. Yadav, 33, assumed the role this month after Sharma's retirement post-World Cup victory in June. Yadav edged out all-rounder Hardik Pandya for the position due to concerns over Pandya’s injury issues. With Kohli also retiring from T20Is, Yadav will have the freedom to experiment with the team’s top order. Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal are expected to anchor the batting lineup, offering Yadav a chance to reshape the team’s dynamics.

Sri Lanka’s Leadership Change
Sri Lanka, too, has undergone a leadership change. After a disappointing early exit from the World Cup, which led to Wanindu Hasaranga’s resignation, Charith Asalanka has been appointed as the new T20I captain. Asalanka, who recently led Jaffna Kings to a title in the Lanka Premier League, is enthusiastic about the challenge ahead.

Weather and Pitch Conditions


The weather in Pallekele for the series opener is expected to be cloudy and humid on Saturday, with a high probability of thunderstorms, according to AccuWeather. The pitch at Pallekele traditionally favors batsmen, particularly in the evening when the ball travels more easily off the bat, according to news reports. The presence of dew in evening matches often makes chasing a preferred option due to the added difficulty in bowling later in the game.

India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20 - Where to watch


Fans can catch the live coverage of the India Tour of Sri Lanka starting at 7 PM on July 27, 2024. The match will be broadcast on Sony Sports Ten 5 and Sony Sports Ten 1 in English, Sony Sports Ten 3 in Hindi, and Sony Sports Ten 4 in Tamil and Telugu. Online streaming of India vs Sri Lanka will be available on Sony LIV app.


Gambhir’s Tough Decision: Pant vs. Samson
The series also presents a challenge for India’s new head coach, Gautam Gambhir. One of the key decisions Gambhir must make is choosing between Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson for the wicketkeeper-batter role. Despite the presence of several key players from the T20 World Cup-winning squad, including those not retiring, the choice between Pant and Samson is a significant one. Pant, with 171 runs, was the third-highest run-scorer for India in the T20 World Cup held in the Americas. In contrast, Samson, despite being part of the squad, did not get any game time. This choice is further complicated by the fact that only one can fit into the lineup, as both are renowned for their explosive batting styles.


A bilateral series against Sri Lanka might usually be considered low-stakes, but it has gained importance with Gambhir's appointment and the recent changes in leadership. Gambhir’s role will be crucial in shaping the team’s future strategy leading up to the next T20 World Cup.

Squads

India: Suryakumar Yadav (capt), Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rinku Singh, Riyan Parag, Rishabh Pant (wk), Sanju Samson (wk), Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Ravi Bishnoi, Arshdeep Singh, Khaleel Ahmed, Mohammad Siraj.

Sri Lanka: Pathum Nissanka, Chamindu Wickramasinghe, Avishka Fernando, Charith Asalanka (capt), Kamindu Mendis, Dasun Shanaka, Wanindu Hasaranga, Dunith Wellalage, Kusal Perera, Kusal Mendis (wk), Dinesh Chandimal (wk), Maheesh Theekshana, Matheesha Pathirana, Binura Fernando, Asitha Fernando, Dilshan Madushanka.
