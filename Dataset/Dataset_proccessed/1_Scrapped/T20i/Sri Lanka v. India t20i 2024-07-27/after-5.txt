India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: IND beat SL by 43 runs in Pallekele

Well, the score in the end might be flatter to deceive the Indian side. While it looks comprehensive it wasn't when Nissanka was batting however kudos to the way they have fought back and kept Sri Lanka at arm's length in the end. It is Riyan Parag who did the last rites. Plenty of positives and things to ponder upon for the leadership group going forward in the tournament. 

22:42 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 19.1 overs SL 170/9

Unless the bowler starts to bowl no-balls the game is done and dusted mathematically India takes the lead in the series. It is Riyan Parag with a slip who starts the final over and picks a wicket as well. This is good captaincy from Surya.

22:36 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 18 overs SL 164/7

India has turned this game on its head since the Axar Patel double-wicket over. That is what chasing big totals is all about. No matter how good the start is it will still require a substantial effort at a brisk pace from middle or lower-order batter to get close to the target.

22:31 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 17 overs SL 163/7

Riyan Parag bowled the 17th over and what an over it turned out to be from him. India further picked up a couple of wickets in that one. First, it was Shanaka who got himself run out and then Parag picked up Kamindu Mendis. As we update Arshdeep Singh picks Hasaranga.

22:23 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 16 overs SL 158/4

Well, Bishnoi starts the over by dropping the catch and getting himself hurt and finishes the over by picking Sri Lankan skipper Asalanka. Sri Lanka has now lost three wickets in the space of 12 balls hence here begins their challenge. Shanka has walked into the middle.

22:16 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 15.1 overs SL 149/3

Like it happens when chasing big totals there tends to be one over where two set batters get out leaving a blistering cameo needed from one of the lower orders batters to take the side across the line and Axar Patel produced the over picking both Nissanka and Kusal Perera. Crucial passage of play for Sri Lanka.

22:10 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 14.1 overs SL 140/2

Well, well Bishnoi drops a catch. It was a difficult one nevertheless a drop. Poor fielding from both sides continues in this game and Nissanka continues to fight. As we update Axar Patel picks up Nissanka what a cracking innings from the Sri Lanka opener though. 

22:04 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 13.1 overs SL 133/1

India needs a wicket here. What a game this is turning out to be here. To be honest none of the five bowlers looked like they are capable of picking wickets such has been the masterful elegance from Nissanka and Surya has decided to use Pandya for the fourth one in a row

22:00 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 12.2 overs SL 128/1

Nissanka has gone past his half-century. In the over of Hardik Pandya India also conceded an overthrow which cost them five runs. India is starting to feel the pressure here it has been fabulous innings from Nissanka he is doing it for Sri Lanka.

21:51 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 11 overs SL 106/1

Once again credit must go to how well Pathirana bowled in the final overs and India needs someone to do the same. Maybe not in terms of wickets but the way he was able to contain runs. As we update Hardik is given third over in a row here.

21:48 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 10.1 overs SL 100/1

We have reached the halfway mark and Sri Lanka has almost reached 100. It is an excellent response from Sri Lanka especially from Pathum Nissanka. However, they cannot get complacent they need to keep going and squeezing runs and stay in touch with the scoring rate.

21:44 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 9.2 overs SL 94/1

Arshdeep Singh gets the first wicket it is Kushal Mendis who tries to pull and gets caught at mid-wicket. While India did pick up a wicket it is Perera who has come into the middle and he is a very attacking batter if he gets away India will struggle big time in this game.

21:37 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 8.1 overs SL 77/0

Hardik has come into the attack and unfortunately for India, it did not bore fruits it was another expensive over. While everything went India's way with the bat everything is going against them with the ball. Sri Lanka has a solid chance of winning this game from here on.

21:32 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 7.1 overs SL 69/0

Both batters are in and they are batting nicely here. They have adjusted to the pace of the surface here. However, the nature of this chase is that they need to decide here and now which batter is going to play through and which one will keep attacking. 

21:27 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 6.2 overs SL 60/0

Sri Lanka has laid a solid base here in the Powerplay. They have scored 50 runs in this Powerplay. They need one of these two players to keep batting till the end and score about 90-100 runs. That's the only way they can get to the Indian total.

21:24 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 5.1 overs SL 50/0

Bishnoi has come into the attack and he too has been expensive. Surya has used all four main bowlers but none of them looked threatening. It will be interesting to see how the ball reacts after the Powerplay once it gets a bit softer. 

21:20 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 4.1 overs SL 38/0

This is cracking innings from Nissanka. he looks in sublime form does the Sri Lankan opener. Usually, his issue has been strike rate but today he has come all guns blazing. India is underway here in the Powerplay Suryakumar Yadav has something to ponder upon here. 

21:15 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 3.1 overs SL 25/0

Nissanka is looking in good touch here he is middling the ball nicely. Axar too has been taken for boundaries here. One thing Indian spinners need to make note of here is the slower Hasaranga bowled more purchase he got out of the surface. 

21:11 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 2.1 overs SL 17/0

Siraj has been right on the money here. The bowler has a memorable spell against Sri Lanka although in a different format, many of the batters who are in the middle would remember the scars inflicted by the Indian new-ball bowler as we update Axar comes into attack.

21:06 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 1.1 overs SL 9/0

Sri Lanka started their chase well thanks to a couple of sumptuous boundaries from Pathum Nissanka the lack of swing on the ball helped him to drive Arshdeep Singh. India needs to be slightly careful here as Sri Lanka might come all guns blazing in this Powerplay.

20:53 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 20 overs IND 213/7

India ended up at 213/7 in 20 overs. Ashita Fernando did manage to pick up Rinku in the final over but India seems to have got 20-25 runs too many mainly thanks to poor fielding from Sri Lanka and poor bowling early on. However, they got better as the innings went on, and will hope it continues into their batting we will be right back with second innings action.

20:45 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 19.1 overs IND 203/6

Pathirana gets both Riyan Parag and Pant in his final over. He has come in late into the attack but he has done the damage. He and Hasaranga have been by far top bowlers for Sri Lanka. As we update Sri Lanka has been penalized for a slow over rate which means they only have four fielders outside the ring for the final over.

20:38 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 18 overs IND 192/4

Sri Lanka has fought back well in the second half of this game is it enough is hard to say because it is already a massive total and if the dew won't come into play the wicket might further slow down. As we update Pathirana picks up Riyan Parag. 

20:34 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 17.2 overs IND 186/4

Pathirana's searing yorker got rid of Hardik Pandya. This is top-class spell from Pathirana he is getting his yorkers spot on which the batters are struggling to get away. Interesting move from Asalanka he has brought in Theekshana into the attack. 

20:28 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 16.1 overs IND 172/3

Ashita came into bowl the 16th over which was an over of two halves. First Ashita deceived the batter with knuckle balls and then in the second half, Pant got hold of the bowler and smacked a couple of boundaries which Pant will hope will give some momentum to his innings. 

20:21 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 15 overs IND 160/3

An exceptional spell from Hasaranga here. Apart from that one over where Surya swept almost every delivery in one over which went for boundaries he has bowled well. He decoded how to ball on this surface and executed it to perfection. Only if he could have had a bit more support on field his figures would have looked lot better.

20:17 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 14.1 overs IND 153/3

Pathirana answers the call for skipper Asalanka and gets the wicket of Suryakumar Yadav. It was a full one on the off-stump which came back because of the angle Surya trying to flick the ball on the leg-side missed and was trapped in front of the wicket.

20:09 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 13 overs IND 146/2

Sri Lanka has been sloppy so far on the field. They did not bowl well with the new ball and neither are they fielding well. They have dropped a couple of catches and let a few cheap boundaries away. India is looking good for 210 from here on.

20:05 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 12.1 overs IND 139/2

Even Pathirana looked ineffective in his first over. Both batters are well set and they have got their eye in. Asalanka might have missed the trick not bringing Pathirana a touch earlier. Having said that Pant needs to get a move on here. As we update Surya gets to his fifty.

19:59 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 11.1 overs IND 122/2

Sri Lanka exhausted their two reviews it is Pant this time who was not given out against Hasaranga which Asalanka sent upstairs to find out the ball was pitching outside the leg-stump. Finally, Pathirana comes into the attack and how much can he restrict India will be interesting to see.

19:52 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 10.1 overs IND 112/2

Kamindu Mendis came into the attack and bowled a decent over. While Hasarnga bowled it slower through the air Mendis continued to fire in which was not the ideal situation given how the wicket was playing. Meanwhile, Surya is looking good in the middle.

19:48 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 9.1 overs IND 106/2

Hasaranga has been one bowler who has been able to make the ball talk. He is bowling slower through the air and let the ball grip and turn. It is good from him his spell might be a blueprint for Sri Lanka on how to bowl for the remainder of the innings. 

19:44 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 8.1 overs IND 98/2

Asalanka stuck to Madhusanka for another over however, the bowler drifted his lines on the leg side which Surya cashed on. Having said that Surya miss-timed one which almost carried to fine-leg who was finer however, he misjudged the catch, and the ball trickled for a boundary. 

19:39 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 7.2 overs IND 83/2

Exceptional over from Hasaranga. The wrong one from the leggy outdid Jaiswal. He was beaten in the air, stretched forward to face the ball, and lost his balance and the keeper took the bails off. The ball did turn for Hasaranga in that opening over. 

19:31 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 6 overs IND 74/1

Shubman Gill departs, It is Madhushanka who picks the opening wicket. The batter tried to loft one and the ball went very high in the air but Ashita fielding at mid-on ran back and took his eye off it a bit still managed to take a brilliant catch. Finally much needed wicket for Sri Lanka. 

19:25 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 5.1 overs IND 60/0

Jaiswal has been ruthless here with his ball striking while Gill has been more of a soft touch Jaiswal just has blasted the Sri Lankan attack out of this Powerplay—baptism with fire for Sri Lanka's new skipper Asalanka here. 

19:23 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 4.2 overs IND 53/0

This is turning bad to ugly for Sri Lanka. It is a nightmarish start for new Sri Lankan skipper Asalanka. The crowd has gone silent early in the piece here. While the wicket looks excellent for batting, the Sri Lankan seamers have not hit their areas accurately. 

19:18 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 3.1 overs IND 40/0

Sri Lanka exhausted their first review when Jaiswal tried to sweep the ball and missed completely it was not given out on-field hence Asalanka sent it upstairs however, the ball tracking showed the ball missed the off-stump. This is an excellent start for India. 

19:11 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 2.1 overs IND 28/0

Fernando took the second over again not much of a moment and the bowler sprayed the ball all over, resulting in another productive over for India. As we update Theekshana has been brought into the attack to put the breaks on. 

19:06 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: After 1.1 overs IND 17/0

We are done with the opening over and Madhushanka who has been added late to the squad looked like one in that opening over. With Gill and Jaiswal being right and left respectively Madhushanka struggled with his line and sprayed the ball all over in that opening over. 

18:59 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: let's go!

27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: Saba Karim and Farvez Mahroof

"The weather looks pleasant. There's a cool breeze blowing across the ground. The wicket looks good. We had 3 LPL games here and that surface looked different. We see cracks. It might get slower once the ball loses its hardness but come evening it should be good for batting. We expect a lot of runs here,"

India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: Suryakumar Yadav at toss

It (the pitch) looks good and it is fine to bat first. The brand of cricket remains the same. The relationship me and him (Gambhir) have had for so many years is special. Dube, Samson, Khaleel and Washington are the four players to miss out. That (World Cup) is history, we start from scratch and it is a new challenge.

18:34 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: Charith Asalanka at toss

We are going to bowl first. It looks like a pretty good pitch and we want to see how it goes. We are going with 6-5 combination. I want to give every player a specific roles and that;s why we are going with 5 bowlers.

18:24 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: Bowling concerns for Sri Lanka

In less than a week, Sri Lanka has lost three key seamers in Dushmantha Chameera, Nuwan Thushara and Binura Feranando who has been hospitalized due to a chest infection. The Lankans, also in transition, will hope lead bowlers Matheesha Pathirana, Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana will come good in Pallekele.

18:20 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: Pant over Samson?

Though his form in the T20 World Cup knockouts were found wanting, Rishabh Pant is likely to continue as the primary wicket-keeper in T20Is, keeping Samson on the bench for now.

18:15 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: Ravi Bishnoi to lead wrist-spin attack

With the exclusion of Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav being rested, Ravi Bishnoi will be drafted in to lead the wrist-spin attack for India. Bishnoi had a fruitful series in Zimbabwe and is likely to form a nagging combo along with Axar Patel.

18:09 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: Surya on Rohit

“As a captain, Rohit has shown the pathway as to how to play T20s and win a tournament. It is what I learnt from him and I want to take this train forward. Only the engine has been changed, but the train remains the same. So the brand of cricket remains the same. What I’ve been doing remains the same. It is just an added responsibility. It is good, I can now walk the talk,” Suryakumar said.

18:06 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: Focus on attacking brand of cricket

At the moment, India’s focus firmly remains on continuing the momentum they have gained in the T20s. They are now playing a brand of aggressive cricket that most attacks will struggle to stop and have an attack that can win games on its own. During his stint with KKR, Gambhir’s methods were along similar lines, if not better. That in Surya, Gambhir has a captain, who too believes in a similar style of play means, there are more reasons to be excited.

17:59 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: MS Dhoni's luxury

During the big transition that happened when MS Dhoni took charge as captain, India had the luxury to groom the youngsters in the ODIs before they made it to the Test side. A similar approach is what the current bunch of selectors and Gambhir are understood to be focussing on as the transition would then be seamless. There are a few tough calls that need to be taken with the ODI side, but the India team management will resist those and check how the young crop goes about in T20s.

17:55 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: Transition starts

All things point out that India has pressed for a transition in white-ball cricket by starting with the T20I side. Though having different players for different formats has been a subject of discussion, Gambhir’s entry puts a full-stop to those. It is the reason why even India have put their faith in Shubman Gill to crack the code in T20s by handing him the vice-captaincy and overlooking the likes of Abhishek Sharma and Ruturaj Gaikwad.

With Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja retiring from the T20s, Gambhir gets a chance to build the white-ball squad from the T20 set-up. With just 6 ODIs remaining ahead of the Champions Trophy in February-March, India will persist with the trio in ODIs. But post that event, The Indian Express understands that the transition button will be pressed in ODIs as well, but the T20s will be used to gauge how the youngsters have progressed. The plan is to gradually phase out the seniors one by one rather than being thin on experience at one go.

17:49 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: Suryakumar Yadav, on whether captaincy will affect his batting approach

"Nothing changes. The brand of cricket remains the same. What I've been playing, what I've been doing for the team, it doesn't change. It has given me an added responsibility. Now I've to walk the talk"

India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: weather report

It is monsoon in Sri Lanka hence rain might play a factor throughout the series. However, the Accuweather app predicts rain in the morning and clear skies in the evening with a maximum temperature of 29 degrees centigrade and a minimum temperature of 21 degrees centigrade. The captain winning the toss might opt to field first because of probable rain interruptions and if not dew may play a role in the 2nd innings.

17:34 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: Pitch report

Pallekele has traditionally been a good batting wicket with a balance slightly tilted towards pacers. Under the lights, the new ball might swing a little which the opening batters might need to be wary of. However, once the batters get their eye in the trustable bounce and pace of the wicket will make scoring easy.

India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: SL's player to watch out for

Player to watch out for Charith Asalanka has been earmarked as one of the batting pillars of Sri Lankan cricket going forward and he has shown glimpses of what he can do regularly. Though he has led the side from time to time captaining the side full time will present him with a different challenge. Can he handle the pressures of leadership without affecting his batting will be something to be seen.

17:19 (IST)
27 JUL 2024
India vs Sri Lanka 1st T20I Live Score: IND's player to watch out for

Player to watch out for Shubman Gill has been in and out of the T20I side since he made his debut. However, despite his ordinary record in the format he has led the side in Zimbabwe to a 4-1 series win and will be deputy to Suryakumar Yadav in the T20I leg of the series against Sri Lanka. His performance will be under scrutiny throughout the tour and the onus is on him to justify his spot and promotion as vice-captain in the side.

Focus shifts to coach Gautam Gambhir’s approach as he begins partnership with captain Suryakumar Yadav

Pallekele: Indian head coach Gautam Gambhir during a practice session at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, in Pallekele, Thursday, July 25, 2024. (PTI Photo/Kunal Patil)

Almost a month after winning the T20 World Cup, and having already done and dusted a victorious tour of Zimbabwe, beginning with the first T20I on Saturday, India will take baby steps under a new captain and head coach. The series against Zimbabwe earlier this month provided ample indications as to where this team is headed, at least from the selectors’ point of view. The majority of the personnel who are in Pallekele are the same as the touring party in Harare, but this is now Suryakumar Yadav’s team. The new captain unites with head coach Gautam Gambhir, who was amongst the earliest to forecast Surya’s greatness in the format during their stint together at Kolkata Knight Riders. (READ MORE)
