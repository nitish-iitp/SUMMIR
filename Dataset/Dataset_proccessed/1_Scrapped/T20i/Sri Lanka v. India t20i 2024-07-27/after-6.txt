Sri Lanka vs India Commentary
5:36 PM IST Phew, aren't you entertained? There couldn't be a more perfect initiation to this crackerjack of a series than this for sure! This defeat might surely sting Sri Lanka as they were in a very strong position but just couldn't cope with that dramatic collapse wreaked by the Indian bowlers. Sri Lanka would like to go back to the drawing board and analyze where things went enormously wrong for them. India would look to compound on this momentum and extend their lead further in the series. Just like how rapidly the T20 format proceeds, it’s a quick turnaround as both sides will meet in less than 24 hours at the same venue in Kandy. The 2nd T20I will begin at 7 pm IST (1.30 pm GMT) on Sunday, 28th July. But as always, you can join us a lot sooner for the pre-match build-up. Take care, ADIOS!
5:35 PM IST Suryakumar Yadav, the Indian skipper is up for a chat now. He is all smiles and why not? He is also adjudged as the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his 58 off just 26 deliveries that included 8 fours and 2 towering sixes. He says, Sri Lanka played a good brand of cricket and credits them for batting aggressively even when wickets were falling regularly. Says they practiced here three days back so they knew how it would play. He tells that they took the inspiration from the World Cup and that it is not over until it is over.
5:34 PM IST The captain of Sri Lanka, Charith Asalanka says that they were not up to the mark in the Powerplay but came back strongly with the ball. Tells that at one stage, they felt that India might get to 240, but his bowlers did well to restrict them. Feels that it was a bit disappointing with the way the middle order batted and could have done better. When asked if they are going to continue playing 6 batters and 5 bowlers, he says that it is an experiment and feels that it is the way they should go in the future.
5:25 PM IST THE PRESENTATION CEREMONY...
5:25 PM IST Shubman Gill is in for a chat. He starts by saying that when you are chasing 214 and need more than 14 runs per over, it is a matter of a couple of wickets and you are always in the game. Tells that he enjoyed batting with Yashasvi and they both complement each other well. Further says that the communication is simple and they went about their business after assessing the conditions. Feels that in T20s, it is important to score quickly and you need to assess the track and play accordingly.
5:24 PM IST Earlier in the game, India began strongly with Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal getting quick runs, cashing the benefits of the field restrictions. With no visible swing, it got a bit easier for the batters to cultivate their shots. They did not attack, they bludgeoned through the bowling. A slight blip with two quick wickets didn't bother Suryakumar Yadav. He kept boundaries coming at a regular pace and notched a 26-ball 58. When the others were being tonked all over the park, it was young gun Matheesha Pathirana, though, who brought in a slight slowdown in the run rate. Sticking to his guns, the slinger unleashed a masterclass, bagging a brilliant four-wicket haul and squeezing India in the backend to 213 of what looked like 230 kind of a score from the beginning.
