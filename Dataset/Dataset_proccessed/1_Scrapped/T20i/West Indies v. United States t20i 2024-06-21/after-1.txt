United States will take on West Indies in a Group 2 Super 8 match of the ICC Men's 2024 T20 World Cup at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados, on Friday, June 21. The game will get underway at 8:30 PM local time [June 21] and 6:00 AM IST [June 22].

After making a surprise entry into the Super 8 round of the T20 World Cup at the expense of Pakistan, the USA showed that they deserved the berth with a fighting performance against South Africa. Chasing a challenging target of 195 in Antigua, they finished on 176-6 as Andries Gous clobbered 80* off 47 balls. Briefly, United States gave the Proteas a scare, but South Africa pulled through.

On the other hand, West Indies suffered an eight-wicket hammering at the hands of defending champions England in their first Super 8 match in St Lucia. Batting first, the Windies put up a competitive 180-4 on the board. However, the Englishmen chased down the score in 17.3 overs as Phil Salt slammed 87* off 47.
