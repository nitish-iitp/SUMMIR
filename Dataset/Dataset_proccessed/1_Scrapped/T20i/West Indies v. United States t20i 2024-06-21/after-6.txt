USA vs West Indies Commentary
3:38 AM IST Right then, that is it from this one-sided affair where West Indies thrashed the USA to stay alive in the World Cup. Next up, it is another big clash as two Asian rivals, India and Bangladesh go against each other. That will begin at 8 pm IST (2.30 pm GMT), but as you know, you can always join us early for all the build-up. Until then, cheers and goodbye!
3:36 AM IST Rovman Powell, the victorious skipper of West Indies says that it’s a special win for them and to get it at the Mecca of cricket in the Caribbean makes it even better. Adds that Roston Chase plays a critical role for them with the ball. Lauds Shai Hope who has been fantastic for them and adds to the strength of the team. Shares that South Africa should be a very good game. Ends by adding that it’s special to play cricket in Barbados as the fans always turn up to support them.
3:36 AM IST Aaron Jones, the captain of the USA says that it was a tough game for them. Adds that they thought 170-180 would have been a good score against West Indies. Mentions that losing wickets in the middle overs didn't help them and while defending, they tried to pick up early wickets but it didn't happen. Says that they will reflect on this and then come back stronger in the next match against England and reckons that will be a good game. Ends by saying that the fans have been fantastic, and it was good to see a lot of support for them here.
3:27 AM IST Roston Chase is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his fine bowling spell. He says that he is happy to put in his best bowling effort in front of his home fans and with this family around. Adds that he tried to bowl wicket to wicket and it paid dividends. Mentions that he likes to field at point as it allows him to keep in the game. Shares that he enjoys playing in Barbados and it’s a lovely feeling to play at home. Ends by adding that their destiny and goal is to win the World Cup and they need to beat the teams that come their way.
3:27 AM IST Presentation Time...
3:26 AM IST Not much to say about the bowling effort of the USA as they have taken a pelting at the hands of the home team here. Harmeet Singh picked up the only wicket that fell, but they did not have any answer to the onslaught from Shai Hope who smashed it all around the park. Earlier in the game, the USA posted a below-par score. Andries Gous top-scored with 29 while a few batters chipped in with some cameos. Roston Chase and Andre Russell both picked up three wickets each while Alzarri Joseph got two and Gudakesh Motie chipped in with one as well.
