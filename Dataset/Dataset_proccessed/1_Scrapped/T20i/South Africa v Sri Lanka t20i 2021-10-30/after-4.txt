World T20: Hasaranga takes hat-trick, but South Africa win

South Africa pulled off a frantic four-wicket win in the final over against Sri Lanka in the Men’s T20 World Cup, despite Wanindu Hasaranga’s sublime hat-trick.

With the Proteas needing 16 from the final over, David Miller launched two towering sixes off Lahiru Kumara before Kagiso Rabada flayed the penultimate ball for four.

Leg-spinner Hasaranga had seemingly turned the tie in Sri Lanka’s favour by claiming a hat-trick across two overs to leave South Africa struggling on 112-6 in pursuit of 143 in Sharjah.

But Miller’s composure and impeccable timing carried the Proteas home with a ball to spare and secure a victory that boosts their chances of reaching the semi-finals.

Opener Pathum Nissanka earlier hit a fine 72 off 58 balls to help Sri Lanka post 142, despite South Africa spinner Tabraiz Shamsi’s superb 3-17.

Defeat does not eliminate Sri Lanka but a second defeat in three games leaves them very unlikely to progress. (BBC Sport)
