South Africa vs Sri Lanka Highlights T20 World Cup 2021 Live Updates: SA vs SL Updates from Sharjah
SA vs SL T20 World Cup 2021 Live Cricket Score

South Africa vs Sri Lanka Highlights T20 World Cup 2021 Live Updates: In a dramatic turnaround in the final two overs, South Africa held their nerves to go past Sri Lanka by six wickets and keep their chances intact for a place in the semi-final of the 2021 T20 World Cup. After SA faced the early setbacks – losing both openers to Dushmantha Chameera in the fourth over, Temba Bavuma (46) fetched partnership alongside Aiden Markram (19) before David Miller (23 off 13 deliveries) pulled off an incredible comeback victory. After Wanindu Hasaranga's hat-trick put Sri Lanka on the brink of win, Miller, alongside Kagiso Rabada (13* off 7  balls) steered the turnaround for SA. With 16 needed to win in the final over, Miller slammed two successive sixes before Rabada ended the run-chase with a four. Earlier, South Africa bowled Sri Lanka out on 142 after opting to bowl first against Sri Lanka in Sharjah.

WHAT A WIN!

Hasaranga's hat-trick had put Sri Lanka on the brink of victory, but it all changed in the final over when Lahiru Kumara, who had conceded 17 in his first-three overs, gave away more in the last five deliveries. South Africa pull off a dramatic victory.

Oct 30, 2021 7:01 PM IST
FINAL OVER

1st ball: 1 run, Rabada gets the bottom-edge and finds a single. 14 OFF 5 NEEDED

2nd ball: SIX! DAVID MILLER IT IS! He pulls it away magnificently! Poor length from Kumara. 8 off 4 NEEDED

3rd ball: SIX! David Miller does it again! 2 OFF 3 NEEDED

4th ball: 1 run, fails to find the connection this time as Kumara keeps it on yorker length. Field comes in to prevent a single. 1 OFF 2 NEEDED

5th ball: FOUR! SA WIN! A thick edge off Rabada's cut-shot races past the wicketkeeper

Lahiru Kumara for final over

Kumara has conceded 17 runs in three overs in this innings.

Oct 30, 2021 6:59 PM IST
Rabada's six keeps SA in the game!

Kagiso Rabada takes the aerial route and finds a maximum! Chameera's 19th over of the game fetches 10 runs as Rabada keeps strike. This is going down to the wire!

South Africa 128/6 in 19 overs; Target: 143

Oct 30, 2021 6:50 PM IST
HAT-TRICK!

WANINDU HASARANGA YOU BEAUTY! He sends Dwaine Pretorius packing on his first delivery! Hat-trick for the Sri Lankan spinner! Only the third bowler in T20 World Cup history to take three wickets in a row – and second in this edition!

List of hat-tricks in T20 World Cups:

Brett Lee vs Bangladesh, Cape Town 2007
Curtis Campher vs The Netherlands, Abu Dhabi 2021
Wanindu Hasaranga vs South Africa, Sharjah 2021

Oct 30, 2021 6:47 PM IST
BAVUMA GONE!

Who else but Hasaranga. The Sri Lankan spinner does it again!

Oct 30, 2021 6:45 PM IST
FIRST SIX OF THE INNINGS!

Temba Bavuma with South Africa's first six of the innings in the 17th over! A much-needed hit for the Proteas and they certainly need a few more of those. 10 runs off the over, which gives the batters something to build on.

South Africa 112/4 in 17 overs; Target: 143

Oct 30, 2021 6:39 PM IST
100 up for South Africa

The Proteas reach the 100-run mark in the 16th over of the innings. Both Bavuma and David Miller confined to singles on all six deliveries, which won't hurt Sri Lanka right now. The required rate jumps over 10.

South Africa 102/4 in 16 overs; Target: 143

Oct 30, 2021 6:37 PM IST
Hasaranga gets the breakthrough!

Just when Markram looked to shift gears, Hasaranga strikes! Markram steps behind inside the crease, making space for a cut shot. The spinner pitches it in line of the stumps and Markram fails to make a connection, as Hasaranga hits the timber.

South Africa 96/4 in 15 overs

Oct 30, 2021 6:32 PM IST
Time to pick pace

Lahiru Kumara's clever variation with pace on all six deliveries keeps the South African batters restricted. The required run-rate, however, has gone past 9. 

Time to shift gears.

South Africa 88/3 in 14 overs; Target: 143
