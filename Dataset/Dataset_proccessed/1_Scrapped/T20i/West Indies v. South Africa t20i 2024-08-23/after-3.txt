WI vs SA Scorecard
West Indies vs South Africa Commentary
11:29 PM IST Right then, the hosts, the West Indies have convincingly taken the lead by 1-0 in this three-match series. They were in command with the bat whereas the Proteas would like to go back to the drawing board and assess where things went wrong. However, the action in this 3-match T20I series on the Caribbean shores is far from over. The Brian Lara Cricket Academy of Tarouba will remain the exclusive venue for the remaining two T20Is as well. The second match will be played on Sunday, August 25th and the first ball will be bowled at 1900 GMT. But as you all know, our pre-match build-up starts way earlier. Do join us for that as well. Till then, take care, and cheers!
11:28 PM IST The captain of West Indies, Rovman Powell says that it is always good to take the lead in the series. Feels that some of the guys were rusty, which is unacceptable in a three-match series. Adds that they as a bowling and fielding group, should do better. Tells that the 2026 World Cup is too far away for them to think about. Further says that it is about taking one game at a time and having a look at different players.
11:27 PM IST Aiden Markram the skipper of South Africa is up for a chat. He says the ball was coming nicely when they batted and feels they fell around 10-15 runs short. Says the West Indian bowlers bowled really well. Adds the wicket was a bit tacky and got better to bat on as the game progressed. Appreciates Stubbs and Kruger for getting them to a good score. On being asked about Kwena Maphaka, he says that he has an X-Factor in him and is hungry to compete and feels that these are positive signs for the team.
11:25 PM IST Nicholas Pooran is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his explosive knock. He starts by thanking the Almighty. States that the openers did well to put the pressure on South Africa. Adds that his job was simpler and it was about keeping the momentum going. Shares that the wicket got better halfway through the South African innings but it was tricky at the start.
11:24 PM IST ... THE PRESENTATION CEREMONY ...
11:24 PM IST Earlier in the game, a rain delay lasting about an hour created favorable conditions for the bowlers. The added moisture caused the ball to swing and seam, making the West Indies' decision to bowl first after winning the toss a crucial advantage. Batters struggled to time their shots as the ball gripped the damp wicket. Matthew Forde and Shamar Joseph capitalized on these conditions, swiftly dismantling South Africa's top and middle order. As the pitch slowed, the West Indies adapted their strategy, introducing three spinners to further stifle the scoring rate. However, just as the innings seemed to be faltering, an explosive 71-run partnership between Stubbs and Kruger, injected new life into the South African effort. Stubbs, who initially played a supporting role, accelerated his scoring in the latter part of his innings, providing the Proteas with much-needed momentum helping them to notch up 71 off the last 30.
