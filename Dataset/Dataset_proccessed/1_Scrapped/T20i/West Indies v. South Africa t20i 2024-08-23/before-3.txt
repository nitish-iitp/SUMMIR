Cricket West Indies (CWI) Announces T20I Squad for Home Series vs South Africa 2024

The West Indies Men's squad has been chosen for the next T20 International (T20I) series against South Africa, which is set to take place in Trinidad from August 23–27, 2024. Cricket West Indies (CWI) is happy to announce this. 

The following is the chosen team for the T20I series:

Rovman Powell (Captain)  
Roston Chase (Vice-Captain)  
Alick Athanaze  
Fabian Allen 
Johnson Charles  
Matthew Forde  
Shimron Hetmyer  
Shai Hope  
Akeal Hosein  
Shamar Joseph  
Obed McCoy  
Gudakesh Motie  
Nicholas Pooran  
Sherfane Rutherford  
Romario Shepherd  

"Andre Russell, who played five back-to-back Test matches against South Africa and England, as well as Jason Holder, who requested a period of rest and recovery," said Miles Bascombe, Director of Cricket. Additionally, we decided to extend Alzarri Joseph's leave of absence. Furthermore, Brandon King is still recovering from an injury he suffered at the World Cup. They will all collaborate closely with the CWI research and medical staff throughout this time.

Head Coach Daren Sammy said, "Facing a strong South Africa side is an excellent opportunity for our team to reset and refocus with our game plan." Noting that South Africa's World Cup campaign ended in the Super 8, overturning the 3-0 result from the pre-World Cup series in Jamaica. This should be an intriguing and significant series because we have played them recently with varying degrees of success. With our sights set on the upcoming T20 World Cup in 2026, I have faith in the group we've put together, and I know the boys will be eager to demonstrate their competitive spirit."

The West Indies Men's T20 squad finished second in the recently concluded ICC Men's T20 World Cup, which was held in the Caribbean. They had won four of their previous five series. South Africa is ranked number five and the West Indies is ranked fourth in the ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings.

MATCH TIME:

South Africa vs. the West Indies T20I Series 2024

August 23: West Indies vs. South Africa, First Twenty20 International, Brian Lara Cricket Academy

August 25 at the Brian Lara Cricket Academy: West Indies vs. South Africa, second T20 International
