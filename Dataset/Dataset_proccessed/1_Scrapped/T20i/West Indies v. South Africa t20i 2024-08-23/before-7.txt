West Indies after losing the Test series against South Africa is now set to play a three-match T20I series in Trinidad. The matches will be played on August 23, 24 and 27.

Andre Russell is not a part of the 15-member squad announced by Cricket West Indies (CWI). The board said that the West Indian all-rounder has asked for rest after a grueling season of T20 cricket.

After being part of the West Indies team that missed out on the semifinal berth at the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup, Russell had then fulfilled his commitment to London Spirit in The Hundred 2024. The season was finally won by the Oval Invincibles who defedned 148 to win the match by 17 runs.

Andre Russell Requested For Rest: Miles Bascombe, Director of West Indies Cricket.

"Andre Russell requested a period of rest and recovery as well as Jason Holder who played five back-to-back five Tests against England and South Africa. During this period, they will work closely with the CWI science and medicine team," said Miles Bascombe, Director of Cricket.

Meanwhile, Roston Chase has been named Rovman Powell's deputy in the squad that has been announced. Alzarri Joseph and Jaso Holder who missed the T20 World Cup with an injury also have been rested. Meanwhile, Shimton Hetmyer who did not play a single match in the T20 World Cup has managed to retain his place.

Meanwhile, there are a few comebacks in the form of Fabian Allen and all-rounder Matthew Foirde who is eyeing up a spot for the T20 World Cup 2026. He has good attributes as a lower-order hitter and someone who can swing the new ball.

Coach Darren Sammy is looking forward to this series as an opportunity for the home side to hit the reset button after a forgetful T20 World Cup performance.

"Facing a strong South African side is an excellent opportunity for our team to reset and refocus with our game plan. We have played them recently and had mixed results, so this should be an exciting and important series. I'm confident in the squad we've selected, and with eyes already on the next T20 World Cup in 2026, I know the guys will be keen to show their hunger for success" said head coach Daren Sammy.

This is a much familiar format for the side and hence the Windies would like to make the most of it even in the absence of Russell and Holder. The spin attack is well sorted with Akeal Hosein and Gudakesh Motie.

Shamar Joseph retains his place in the T20I squad after his impressive performance in the Test series despite the Test series loss. West Indies have Sherfane Rutherford, and Romario Shepherd to make up for the power-hitting in the absence of Russell.

South Africa won the Test series 1-0 maintaining an unbeaten Test series run against the West Indies from the first-ever series meeting between the two teams since 1998/99. The recent Test series win came under Temba Bavuma one of the more underrated international captains of South Africa.

West Indies T20I Squad

Rovman Powell (capt), Roston Chase (vice-capt), Alick Athanaze, Fabian Allen, Johnson Charles, Matthew Forde, Shimron Hetmyer, Shai Hope, Akeal Hosein, Shamar Joseph, Obed McCoy, Gudakesh Motie, Nicholas Pooran, Sherfane Rutherford, Romario Shepherd
