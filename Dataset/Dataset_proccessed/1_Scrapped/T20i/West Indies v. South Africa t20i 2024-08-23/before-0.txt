A email drifts in. Hello Tim Maitland at (I think) North Marine Road.

”The spinners should get some nice drift at Scarborough this morning.

”This from Bridlington, 20 miles down the coast.


“As far as I can tell from G****e Maps, the pitch at North Marine Road seems to be aligned NNW-to-SSE, so the westerly winds should be cross winds from both ends.

“The Beeb weather forecast claims the 16C temperature at start of play will feel like 16C. Try telling that to the hardy souls desperately hugging their cups of Bovril for warmth.”

Flintoff Jr off the mark for Lancashire but Surrey make hay
Tanya Aldred

Rocky Flintoff, the 16-year-old son of Andrew, celebrated his GCSE results with a debut first-class innings for Lancashire.

Flintoff, batting at four, strolled out at 33 for two, Lancashire’s youngest first-class cricketer, all wonderfully familiar gait and rush of the bat. A juicy drive and a timely pull for four, plus a couple of lucky moments, were enough to get the juices flowing till he was caught at backward point for 32 to his first ball after lunch.

Surrey continued to run through an inexperienced Lancashire lineup, with half the team 23 or under, and they were bowled out for 204, with four wickets for Jordan Clark and three for Dan Worrall. Rory Burns and Dom Sibley then whisked Surrey to 83 without loss before rain stopped play. The day had started with a minute’s silence in memory of Surrey’s Graham Thorpe.

More youthful brilliance at Chester-le-Street, where 19-year-old Ben McKinney panned a gorgeous 121 in his just his second first-class match for Durham. McKinney, a former England Under-19s captain and part of the Lions team that beat Sri Lanka last week, was ruthless on the Nottinghamshire bowlers, reaching his hundred with a peachy cover drive and off just 117 balls. Once he had departed, Alex Lees picked up the baton, reaching a more pedestrian, but just as valuable, 145.

The seagulls swooped on breezy North Marine Road, where Tom Alsop’s 84 held the fort for Sussex in a crucial Division Two promotion battle. Australia’s Daniel Hughes collected 53. Jonny Bairstow was shipshape behind the stumps in his first Yorkshire Championship appearance of the season.

Derbyshire’s Zak Chappell ripped through Glamorgan with six for 47; Middlesex’s Toby Roland-Jones took three wickets as Northamptonshire struggled; Warwickshire’s Jacob Bethell and Michael Burgess made half-centuries against Somerset; Ian Holland built a hundred against Gloucestershire and Worcestershire’s Joe Leach’s six for 52 demolished Kent.
