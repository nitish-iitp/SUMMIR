Cricket enthusiasts are in for a treat as Pakistan and South Africa prepare to lock horns in a thrilling three-match Women’s T20 International series, kicking off on Friday, September 1st. The iconic National Stadium in Karachi will be the battleground for this exciting clash of the titans in the shortest format of the game.

Nida Dar will continue to lead the Pakistan Women’s team, while Laura Wolvaardt will take charge as the captain of the South African Women’s side. Both skippers are relatively new to the leadership of their respective teams, promising an engaging contest on the cricketing field.

The history between these two teams in T20Is adds an intriguing dimension to the series. Having faced each other 18 times in this format, South Africa hold the edge with eight victories, while Pakistan have emerged victorious on seven occasions.
