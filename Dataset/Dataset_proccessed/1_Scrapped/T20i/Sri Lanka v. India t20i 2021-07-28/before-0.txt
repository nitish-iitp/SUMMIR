India lead the three-match T20 series that Sri Lanka are hosting. Watch 2nd T20 live on Tuesday evening

ndia will look to seal the three-match T20 series at Colombo’s Premadasa Stadium on Tuesday evening. The Shikhar Dhawan-led Indian cricket team won the opening game on Sunday (July 25) by 38 runs. This will be the 21st T20 International match between the two teams and seventh on Sri Lankan soil.

India had earlier won the ODI series 2-1 and tonight Sri Lanka will have to produce something special to stay alive in the T20 series. With the T20 World Cup coming up, Sri Lanka are yet to qualify and a few wins under their belt will give them a lot of confidence. Their new skipper Dasun Shanaka has been struggling for form and that has not inspired the home team in the dressing room.
