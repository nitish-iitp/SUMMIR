England will be eager to turn things around after their dismal World Cup showings in the last two years and they will not get a better opportunity to test themselves than the upcoming white-ball tour of Australia. (More Cricket News)

Australia will be touring England for three T20Is and five ODIs starting September 11. After a long time, there will be a five-match ODI series but what is more interesting is that both the teams will be almost full strength barring forced exclusions.

The biggest forced exclusion remains of England white ball skipper Jos Buttler who is out due to an injury. Phil Salt will have the responsibility to lead England in T20Is as the team awaits on Buttler's injury update for the ODI series. With new coach Brendon McCullum at helm, England will look to start fresh against their arch rivals.
