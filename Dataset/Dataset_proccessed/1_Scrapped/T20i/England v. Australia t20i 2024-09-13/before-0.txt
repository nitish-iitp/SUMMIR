Broadcasting & Live Streaming Details

The historic rivalry between England and Australia is set to reignite as the two cricketing giants face off in a three-match T20I series. These arch-rivals clashed earlier this year in the T20 World Cup group stage, where Australia comfortably defeated England. Now, Phil Salt and his team will be looking for revenge in this exciting upcoming series.

England’s home advantage in T20Is against Australia

Historically, England have held a dominant position against Australia in T20Is on home soil. Out of nine matches played in England, the hosts have won six. Australia have never won a bilateral T20I series in England, and their last attempt, in 2020, ended in a 2-1 victory for England. With the home crowd and record in their favour, England will be eager to extend their winning run in this series.

Australia’s winning momentum and recent form

Australia will enter this series with momentum on their side, having recently swept Scotland 3-0 in a T20I series. Their dominant form and recent victory over England in the T20 World Cup 2024 group stage will boost their confidence. Australia will be keen to carry their winning streak into this series and break their winless streak in bilateral T20I series in England.

Venues and schedule for the series

The series will be hosted in three famous English venues, with the first two T20Is being night matches. Southampton and Cardiff will host the first two games, while the final T20I will take place in Manchester. England will look to make the most of home conditions as they aim to settle the score against their fierce rivals.
