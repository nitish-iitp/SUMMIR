West Indies vs Bangladesh T20 World Cup Highlights: West Indies hold their nerves and register a 3-run win over Bangladesh. With Bangladesh needing 13 to win off the last over, Andre Russell bowled a fabulous final over, giving away 10 and helping WI win a last-ball thriller in Sharjah. Mahmudullah and Liton Das were involved in a wonderful partnership as Bangladesh needed 30 off the final 3 overs. Russell and Jason Holder got West Indies their first two wickets as Bangladesh lost openers Shakib Al Hasan and Mohammad Naim. In the first innings, a cameo from Jason Holder and a fine knock from Nicholas Pooran propelled West Indies to 142/7 after struggling early on. Troubles mounted for West Indies as captain Kieron Pollard had to retire hurt and Andre Russell was run out at the non-striker's end without facing a ball, but from there Roston Chase and Pooran stitched a quickfire fifty-plus partnership to put the innings back on track. Previously, Mahedi Hasan got Shimron Hetmyer out caught at long off, which was after Mustafizur Rahman dismissed Evin Lewis in the third over to get his team an early breakthrough and Hasan clean bowled Chris Gayle to remove both openers. West Indies were asked to bat after Bangladesh won the toss and decided to bowl....Read More

And now it's a misfield. Bangladesh need 2 off the final ball

This is absolutely abysmal from West Indies. Jason Holder the man to misfield off all people. Mahmudullah back on strike. 4 needed off 1.

Dropped! Fletcher puts it down

Oh dear! What has Fletcher done here? That was Mahmudullah. Poor effort, and what more… he has given 2 more. 6 needed off 2.

Russell nails the yorker

And still, Bangladesh run two. Mahmudullah and Afif Hossain with a brilliant piece of running between the wicket. 8 needed off 3. Something has got to give.

13 needed off 6

That's what the equation is. 13 needed off the final over. It's Andre Russell who will bowl the crunch over. He begins well; just a couple of runs. 11 off 5.

GONE! Das out caught at long on

A slower one from Bravo and Das, going for the biggie, holes out at long on. Only one man could have taken that catch, Jason Holder. And thankfully for West Indies, Holder was the right man placed at that position.

Oct 29, 2021 7:11 PM IST
First ball of the 19th over: SIX

Smoked. Right out of the middle of the bat. Bravo pitches it in the slot and the bat made a crunching sound. Bangladesh bring the gap down with a six off the first ball.

Oct 29, 2021 7:09 PM IST
Great comeback from Rampaul

After getting hit for a four off the first ball of the over, Rampaul has pulled things back giving away four off the next five. 22 needed off the last 2 overs. It's going to be a tense finish alright.

Oct 29, 2021 7:07 PM IST
FOUR to start the over

Liton Das puts the pressure back on West Indies hitting the first ball of the over for a four. A really loose ball from Rampaul, who follows the batsman's movement and still bowls it into the batsman's pads. Glances it away and it ahs four written all over it.

Oct 29, 2021 7:03 PM IST
Interesting duel between Bravo and Mahmudullah

The T20 death bowler Dwayne Bravo in full display. He is mixing up those slower balls outside off, teasing Mahmudullah in a hide and seek game. Just 3 runs off the 17th over. This is getting very interesting.

Oct 29, 2021 6:58 PM IST
Cheeky… superb stuff from Mahmudullah

No nerves shown by Mahmudullah as he scoops one for four. 11 runs already off the over. Bangladesh need 33 off 24. Nine out of 10 times, you would back the team chasing to pull this one off.
