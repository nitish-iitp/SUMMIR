England won the toss and invited India to bat first. Team India opened with captain Virat Kohli (80 not out) and vice-captain Rohit Sharma (64) at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, and scored a huge score of 224 for 2 wickets. The English team fought on the back of Dawid Malan (68) and Jos Buttler (52), but the Indian bowlers, led by Bhuvneshwar Kumar (15/2), allowed them to reach 188 runs at the loss of 8 wickets.

For India, Shardul Thakur took three wickets for 45 and Bhuvneshwar Kumar took two wickets for 15 runs, while all-rounder Hardik Pandya took one wicket for 34 and T Natarajan took one wicket for 39 runs. Now the Indian team would like to continue this rhythm of victory (started with the Test series) against England in the ODI series, whose first match will be played in Pune on 23 March.

Rohit and Kohli gave a fast start

Jofra Archer and Mark Wood had troubled the Indians with their pace in the opening matches, but Rohit (four fours and five sixes in 34 balls) and Kohli (seven fours and two sixes in 52 balls) took an aggressive stand against them. Helped the team to score 60 runs in the powerplay. Between them, a 94-run partnership for 54 wickets was formed for the first wicket. Apart from these, Suryakumar Yadav (32 runs in 17 balls, three fours, two sixes) and Pandya (39 not out in 17 balls, four fours, two sixes) also contributed.

The hosts added 67 runs in the final five overs to give the opposition team a huge target for victory. Except for Ben Stokes and Adil Rashid, all the bowlers of England looted more than 10 runs per over, with Chris Jordan (no wicket for 57 runs) being the most expensive.

India decided to keep opener Lokesh Rahul out to include an additional bowling option in the playing XI in the form of fast bowler T Natarajan. With Rahul not playing, Kohli decided to start the innings with Rohit, which proved to be very good for the team.
