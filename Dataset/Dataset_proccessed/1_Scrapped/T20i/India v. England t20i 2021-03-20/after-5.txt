India clinch series in high-scoring finale

England lost their Twenty20 series decider to an India side that followed a batting masterclass with some wonderful bowling in Ahmedabad.

Virat Kohli anchored India with 80 not out from 52 balls, allowing Rohit Sharma (64 from 34), Hardik Pandya (39 not out from 17) and Suryakumar Yadav (32 from 17) to blaze around him.

The hosts’ 224-2 was their highest T20 score against England and set the tourists what would have been their second-highest successful chase in the shortest format.

They were on course at 127-1 after 12 overs, only for Bhuvneshwar Kumar to bowl a brilliant 13th, conceding three runs and crucially having Jos Buttler caught at long-off for 52.

Dawid Malan remained, but when he was bowled by the impressive Shardul Thakur for 68, 83 from the final five overs was a huge ask.

England ended on 188-8, losing by 36 runs, with India taking the series 3-2. A three-match one-day international series in Pune begins on Tuesday. (BBC Sport)
