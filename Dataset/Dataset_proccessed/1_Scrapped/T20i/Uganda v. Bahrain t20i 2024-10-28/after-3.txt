Bahrain are touring Uganda for a two-match T20I series, beginning on Monday, October 28. The Jinga Cricket Ground is the host venue for both these matches.

Ahead of this tour, Uganda took part in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024. It was a historic achievement for them to participate in the tournament. However, they had a disappointing run as they could not make it past the group stage with defeats against New Zealand, Afghanistan, and West Indies.

Uganda managed to register a solitary win at the showpiece event, where they beat Papua New Guinea by four wickets.

On the other hand, Bahrain recently participated in the ACC Premier Cup. Placed in Group B, they could only win one match and suffered three defeats. They lost to UAE, Oman, and Kuwait while their only win came against Cambodia.

This series presents an exciting opportunity for both teams to showcase their talent and gain exposure. Both nations will be keen to put up their best performance and aim to win the two-match series.

On that note, here is the schedule, squads, match timings, and live-streaming details for the Uganda vs Bahrain T20I Series 2024.
