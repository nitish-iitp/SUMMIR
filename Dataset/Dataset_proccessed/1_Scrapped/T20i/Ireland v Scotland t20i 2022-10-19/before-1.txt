The elephant in the room

While the WI batting failed and failed badly, I believe we are failing to see that the WI also failed in the field. This was mostly due to bad planning and bad captaincy. Scotland should never have made 160. Had Pooran attacked upfront maybe Holder or Alzarri would have made a difference in the power play and Scotland would not have gotten past 120.

Thus far in this first round no team has done well batting second. These are the scores batting second thus far:

Sri Lanka - 108 all out
NED - 112/7 in 19.5 overs
WI - 118 all out
Ireland - 143/9
NED - 122/5 in 19.3 overs
UAE - 73 all out

I also hear Phil Simmons in the press conference saying how players batted where they are strong. Brooks batted at number 5 for the FIRST TIME in his T20 career and Smith batted at number 10. How the hell he gonna say people batted where they are strong. We are at the World Cup and we don't have a settled team. We still experimenting and that is our problem. The players do not know their batting roles. King doesn't know whether he is an opener or number 3. Powell doesn't know whether he is a finisher or a middle order batsman. Pooran doesn't know anything at the moment. Brooks does not know where he will bat - all of a sudden in a world cup match he is batting at number 5 for the first time in his life. WI doing poorly because the management of the team has failed to prepare the players to be comfortable in their roles and to know exactly what role he is being asked to play for the team. This is a coaching and management issue.

Hear Hear! could it be that by delaying CPL to satisfy the IPL masters until so late, there was no time for proper analysis and planning based on performances there (which in any event are no indicator of anything)?

I have faith in Pooran's captaincy, bearing in mind our overall limitations. I think he did a fair to good job in the last match. I am a little more worried, but not overly, about his batting. I remember when Holder was made captain he failed many times in his batting early on that if he wasn't captain he surely would have deserved dropping because his bowling wasn't anything spectacular at that time too. Look at Holder today.

But I have noticed a little while now that certain players are showing signs of insubordination on instances to Pooran and he seems hesitant to put his foot down. Probably for fear of outright rebellion. This insubordination could be the cause of irregular batting and bowling order.

I'll have faith when he starts captaining with a plan and take control of the team.

I have not watched enough games to have a conclusive opinion on insubordination but I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s the case. I have never felt he is well respected as captain of the team. Plus, his poor returns with the bat doesn’t inspire confidence in his ability to lead.

Like I said - the management of the team and lack of good planning has been out downfall. What is Lewis doing at no 3? What is Brooks doing at no 6? How did Brooks make the team as a number 6 batsman ahead of Reifer who was picked ahead of him in the original squad? We are at a World Cup and still experimenting with our starting 11. Phil Simmons does not have a clue what his best 11 is. We saw that anyway when all of Cariah, Charles, Lewis, Cottrell and Reifer were picked in the 15 man squad after not playing any T20I for the WI immediately prior to the world cup. Now we have Smith picked in the team and pushed down the innings to face only 6 balls every innings. Let Smith bat at number 7 no matter what. If he gets out he gets out. If he gets going then it's a plus for the team. He cannot get going when he comes in to bat with 6 balls left!!

Joke ting

In which universe does Hosein bat before Smith

Good point made about Reifer, he's better choice at 6 than Brooks

Management crazy
