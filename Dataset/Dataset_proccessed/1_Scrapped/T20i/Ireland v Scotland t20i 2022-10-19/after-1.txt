Ireland kept alive their hopes of progressing at the Men’s T20 World Cup with a stunning comeback to beat Scotland by six wickets in Hobart.

After the Scots were lifted to 176-5 by 86 from Michael Jones, Ireland struggled to 61-4 by the 10th over.

But Curtis Campher (72*) and George Dockrell (39*) shared a blistering stand of 119 to get Ireland home with an over to spare.

The result means both teams will have a chance of reaching the main draw in Friday’s final first-round games.

West Indies beat Zimbabwe by 31 runs later on Wednesday to leave all four Group B sides on two points and set up two winner-takes-all ties.

Ireland face West Indies at on Friday, before Scotland take on Zimbabwe.

With rain forecast for Hobart on Friday, if both matches are washed out then Scotland and Zimbabwe will progress.

Scotland top the table courtesy of their superior net run-rate ahead of Zimbabwe, with West Indies third and Ireland fourth. (BBC Sport)
