Hobart

Curtis Campher and George Dockrell combined for a 119-run partnership to guide Ireland to an unlikely six-wicket victory over Scotland in Hobart on Wednesday.

Curtis Campher and George Dockrell may not yet have the accolades that Batman and Robin collected over the years, but the pair worked superbly in tandem to successfully guide Ireland’s run chase home.

The duo came to the crease with their side in a spot of bother at 61/4 and needing to score at greater than 10 runs per over to claim an unlikely victory.

But Campher (72* off 32 deliveries) and Dockrell (39* off 27) kept their cool, running hard between the wickets, finding the gap when required and even clearing the fence with some massive hitting to help Ireland to their first victory of the tournament.

Their 119-run stand was achieved from just 57 deliveries, with Campher – who was also the pick of the Ireland bowlers with figures of 2/9 - hitting a trio of consecutive boundaries from the penultimate over to clinch a famous triumph for the European side.

While Campher’s innings was his best so far of his T20I career, it was also the highest of any Ireland player in the history of the T20 World Cup. But that was just the beginning of a host of records that fell on a memorable day for Ireland.

The run chase was Ireland’s highest ever successful run chase in T20I cricket and Campher and Dockrell’s stand of 119 was the highest ever partnership by Ireland in T20 World Cup history.

It also comes in as the third highest T20I partnership ever for Ireland and one would expect the Guinness to be flowing deep into the night in Hobart.

Michael Jones’ scintillating knock earlier in the day seemed distant after Ireland’s memorable run chase, but the Scotland opener batted beautifully to help his side post a competitive total of 176/5.

The right-hander hit six fours and four sixes during an entertaining knock of 86 from just 55 deliveries as Scotland posted the then biggest score of the tournament at the time in perfect batting conditions at Bellerive Oval.

Jones found the middle of the bat throughout his innings, as the right-hander overcame the early loss of fellow opener George Munsey (1) to have valuable partnerships with Matthew Cross (28) and skipper Richie Berrington (37).

But it was all in vain as Campher and Dockrell combined to provide Ireland with one of their best wins of their cricketing journey.

Scores: Ireland 180 for 4 (Campher 72*, Dockrell 39*, Leask 1-16) beat Scotland 176 for 5 (Jones 86, Berrington 37, Campher 2-9) by six wkts.
