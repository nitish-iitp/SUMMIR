Easy - the world class T20 cricketers were from the previous generation, and have now moved on (or on the tail end of their careers). The next generation haven't been up to scratch. Plain and simple.

MMP....Man Made Problem.

a change of guards wouldn't automatically get that steep drop of team form, more to it than that.

The lack of a regional T20 CRICKET is one of the main reasons.

We signed the contract with the CPL PEOPLE that we cannot hold no T20 regional tournament. Tell me...which other cricket playing nation has done this?

Regional Teams would give the chance for MORE exposure for MORE players than the current Franchise Tournamemt where a good T20 player can be benched an entire season whereas in a regional season he would be playing the full season.

How easily could Scotland compete against our Test Team in the test format? We have a vibrant functioning FC tournament.

With WI locked into that deal, how can local players in the WI hone their craft and get the exposure they need, apart from competitions in their home country?

Can they partner with MLC perhaps? Can CWI try some kind of tri-series 'A' tournaments with either other Full Members or leading Associates?

All I know is the franchise tournament is NOT about development of players. WI look foolish competing against emerging minnows who will surpass them because of their (the WI) lack of development.

The problem is that t20 cricket has changed over the years, we haven't. We are still in this 6 hitting mode and don't seem to realise that you can build an innings in a t20. Evin Lewis for example should be playing much better than he is now. He has lost that confidence he used to have. He is not timing the ball like he used to. Also, our players are gifting their wickets to our opponents with rash shots. What happened to hitting straight down the ground? What about keeping the ball on the ground rather than these aerial shots? We are simply not up to scratch and recent form proves such.

I have an answer: Have a regional T25 competition. The end.

Our T20 batting was always 150ish. Our bowling had 2 top class spinners, plus two containing spinners, plus death bowling specialist Bravo. Other teams have improved. Our batting has stagnated. Our bowling lacks experience.
