Ian Healy has questioned Aaron Finch’s position in Australia’s T20 team, saying his numbers no longer “demand” selection.

Finch has been out of form in the shortest format, under performing for much of Australia’s T20 World Cup win before his struggles continued against Sri Lanka in five matches this month.

Since the start of the 2021 World Cup, Finch hasn’t made a half century in a T20 international while he’s scored 213 runs at 17.75 with a strike rate of 105.97.

Those numbers shrink to an average of 15.60 and strike rate of 91.76 against Sri Lanka.

Now the pressure is growing on the white ball captain with Australia’s T20 title defence later this year rapidly approaching.

“Finchy’s numbers do not demand him being in that team,” Healy said on SENQ. “It’s not good enough.”

Healy pointed out that it’s not just within the past few months that Finch has struggled, remembering a lengthy lean run Finch experienced in ODI cricket over the summer of 2018-19.

“The last three years he’s been through at least two really low periods where he can’t get a run,” he said.

“He’s much more conservative in his intentions now, and he’s not the all-out thrashing machine that Aaron Finch has always been.”

Finch wasn’t the only one to draw Healy’s attention.

The former Australian wicketkeeper said that Steve Smith is also under pressure for his spot in the side.

“I think Steve Smith has work to do to justify his position in the T20 team too,” he added.

“We’ve got to get fair dinkum about our T20 team.”
