The series could prove to be a solid dress rehearsal for Bangladesh, an opportunity for them to finalise their best playing combination ahead of the upcoming 9th edition of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup 2024, which is now shifted to the United Arab Emirates. The tournament will commence on 3rd October 2024 and conclude on 20th October 2024. The Nigar Sultana Joty-led side will be up against Scotland led by skipper Kathryn Bryce in the tournament opener at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on 3rd October 2024, from 3:30 PM IST.
