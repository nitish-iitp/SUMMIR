Pakistan vs South Africa Highlights, T20 WC 2022, 36th Match, Super 12 Group 2:: A comprehensive performance by Pakistan with the bat, ball and in the field. Babar’s men kept picking wickets at regular intervals throughout the innings. Shadab Khan both with the bat and ball was amazing today. He turned the game in both innings. In the ninth over the leg-spinner picked up two crucial wickets from Temba Bavuma 36(19) who was looking in good touch at the time along with Aiden Markram 20(14) who is in good form. This in turn affected the DLS score required of the side after the rain break. Earlier in batting Pakistan was in trouble with 47/4. Iftikhar Ahmed 51(35) first with Muhammad Nawaz 28(22) steadied the ship with a 52-run partnership for the fifth wicket. Then Shadab Khan 52(22) and Iftikhar took the South African bowling apart with an 81-run partnership for the sixth wicket in just 35 balls. The proteas kept dropping their chances which didn’t help either.

PAK vs SA Live: Shadab is player of the match

Shadab Khan: "I have played (batted) like this in PSL, but this is a World Cup match, so it's my best innings. The pitch was a bit slower compared to Perth. I tried to bowl at the stumps, and it paid off. I like to bat up the order, but it depends on the situation and what the team requires, so I am ready to bat anywhere."

18:40 (IST)

PAK vs SA Live: Babar speaks

Babar Azam: "Very happy the way team performed. We are not upto the mark - me and Rizwan. But the way Haris played - different player - set the momentum. And the way Shadab and Ifti finished the innings - outstanding. To be honest, everyone is my best player." 

18:39 (IST)

PAK vs SA Live: Proteas skipper on the mic

Temba Bavuma: " Quite disappointing the way we ended our bowling session. Getting them 5 down quickly and allowing them to get to a formidable score. Lots of questions we need to ask. Credit to them. We knew that weather was going to be a bit of an issue. I'm no bowler but the bowlers do practice for these conditions."

03 NOV 2022
PAK vs SA Live: Pakistan won by 33 runs

Brilliant batting, bowling, and fielding by Pakistan. The men in green completely outplayed South Africa in all departments. Shadab Khan has been in scintillating form with both bat and ball. The over where he picked Temba Bavuma and Aiden Markram in the same over is where the game has turned on its head. The rain followed, and the DLS method was calculated which made things even harder for South Africa all in all a nothing performance by the proteas. Pakistan keeps their chances alive for the semi-finals.

PAK vs SA Live: Death bowling master class

Brilliant piece of death bowling by Pakistan. Started off with Afridi backed brilliantly by Wasim Jr and now Naseem Shah. The bowlers bowled brilliant yorkers and slower balls. South Africa needs 41 off six balls.

PAK vs SA Live: 47 needed from 18 balls

It is looking highly unlikely for South Africa in this game after Klassen's departure. Wayne Parnell can hit the long ball but that needs to start happening right now.

17:10 (IST)
03 NOV 2022
PAK vs SA Live: South Africa need 73 runs from 30 balls

We are back folks! This is going to be entertaining. South Africa will need to come with all guns blazing. Pakistan on the other hand with a slippery outfield and damp ball is not going to be easy. Nevertheless, 73 from 30 is a huge task in Miller's absence but you never know it, Stubbs and Klassen are some serious ball strikers themselves. 

Update from Sydney ?

Revised target: South Africa require 73 runs from five overs.

The match will resume at 10:40 pm local time.#T20WorldCup | #PAKvSA | ?: https://t.co/3VVq7VAJLt pic.twitter.com/LWdvvSyYFk

Stranded at 95 at the loss of five wickets after 13 overs, Pakistan were rescued by Shadab Khan (52) and Iftikhar Ahmed (51), who inspired the first-innings finish at 185/9 against South Africa.

Playing a must-win game in order to keep their hopes for a semifinal berth alive, Pakistan opted to bat first after Babar Azam won the toss in Sydney. (read more)

PAK vs SA Live: Rain stops play

South Africa kept losing wickets consistently. They are 69/4 after nine overs with the DLS par score being 85. We hope the rain stops two of the brutal hitters of modern cricket in Klassen and Stubbs are in the middle.

PAK vs SA Live: Temba Bavuma goes

Shadab Khan cannot do anything wrong. Brilliant innings with the bat now pick two wickets in one over of Temba Bavuma and Aiden Markram. South Africa 66/4

PAK vs SA Live: Powerplay done 48/2

PAK vs SA Live: South Africa need 186 runs to win

After a brilliant start with the bowl, South Africa lost their way at the death Iftikhar and Shadab made brilliant 50s and made an 82-run sixth-wicket partnership. The ball was wet and hard to grip for the seamers. The South African fielders dropped many catches at the death which they paid price to. Pakistan has a good attack and South Africa has good explosive batting it is going to be fun folks.

Pakistan have set South Africa a target of 186 ?

Brilliant innings by the middle-order player. He got one against India early on at MCG. Today he came in when his side was in trouble and played an excellent counter-attacking inning.

PAK vs SA Live: Counter attack on!

South Africa after starting brilliantly with the new ball is slowly losing grip on the game. Their fielding is getting sloppy Pakistan on the other hand is showing intent. They are targeting the shorter boundary as there are both right-hander and left-hander at the crease. Pakistan 88/4.

PAK vs SA Live: Building a partnership

In a game that matters, Pakistan hasn't turned up. The South African pace attack is again showing why it is the best tournament attack. The onus is on Ifthikar and Nawaz to take the Men in Green to a decent total to give their bowlers a fighting chance.

PAK vs SA Live: WICKET!

SIX AND OUT! Haris departs for an entertaining 28. Huge appeal and has been given out. Haris shuffles across and misses the flick onto the pads. Haris sends it upstairs. Fair delivery, and no bat involved. Three reds and it is a dead plumb! So he has to go as Nortje has his revenge.

13:53 (IST)
03 NOV 2022
PAK vs SA Live: SIX!

Haris makes the most of Nortje's pace, shuffles around and scoops it over the fine leg for a six. Third six of the match for Haris.   

13:51 (IST)
03 NOV 2022
PAK vs SA Live: Excellent over by Lungi Ngidi

Excellent over by Lungi Ngidi. He has troubled Babar Azam with his clever variations. Azam is looking to hoick everything, very unusual from the Pakistan skipper. Only four runs came from Ngidi's first over. 

13:45 (IST)
03 NOV 2022
PAK vs SA Live: FOUR!

UPPER CUT! Slower ball, short as well. Outside the off, and Haris takes it on with an upper cut. Plays early and gets a healthy outside edge which goes over the slips for a streaky four.

Wayne Parnell imitates Cristiano Ronaldo

“Celebration obviously comes from Ronaldo. I have always been a big fan of Cristiano Ronaldo fan and a Manchester United fan as well. He is going through a little bit of a tough time recently,” said Parnell. “But one thing that I always liked about him is his resilience and that’s something I have always taken on as well. Like a ‘never say die’ type of attitude. I have always wanted to put in that kind of performance for the team,” he added. (Read More)

PAK vs SA Live: Temba Bavuma (South Africa captain)

"Yeah we would have batted first as well. The surface seems like a bit dry, there is a little bit of shade of green. We wanted to bat, since we have to bowl, we will do the needful, try to restrict them to a good total and then chase it down. Look fortunately I have got some great bunch of guys and support from the team. David Miller is out with an injury, it's a precautionary one. Klaasen comes in for him. Tabraiz Shamsi comes in for Keshav Maharaj."

PAK vs SA Live: Babar Azam (Pakistan Captain)

"We will bat first. And we will try to put runs on the board to put pressure on them. The pitch won't change much throughout, and we will try our best to win this game. The boys are doing well, and we will try to win this game as that is what we can best do at the moment. One change for us. Unfortunately, Fakhar is out due to an injury.

PAK vs SA Live: Wayne Parnell speaks!

"Yeah obviously it has been a good start so far. Very important game with Pakistan so far. We are looking to reset again after the highs and lows against India. I am just keeping things simple. My role in the unit is very simple. I am trying to be the bowler which I am not and it is giving me simple. Something I have been doing throughout my career. I had been bowling in the powerplay and in the death, and Temba is using me in the middle order as well. Obviously, there are a lot of left-arm seamers now, it's great to see them well. Yes, the goal stays the same, we are here to play some good cricket."
