In Short
Babar Azam was run-out for 4 in the 2nd over against Netherlands in Perth
Babar has managed 8 runs from 3 matches in T20 World Cup 2022
Questions have been asked about Babar Azam's batting spot for Pakistan

Babar Azam is not being able to buy a run in T20 World Cup 2022 as form seems to have deserted the Pakistan captain in Australia. Babar has not managed to go past single digits after 3 knocks for Pakistan in the tournament in Australia. On Sunday, Babar Azam was unfortunately run-out in Pakistan's crucial Super 12 contest against the Netherlands at the Optus Stadium in Perth.

The pressure on Babar Azam was evident as the Pakistan captain tried to pinch an improbable single in the 2nd over of Pakistan's chase of 92 runs. Babar punched a fuller-length delivery from right-arm pacer Paul van Meekeren and even as it headed to the mid-on fielder, the skipper set off for a single after calling his non-striker Mohammad Rizwan.

Babar was well short of the crease as the Netherlands' Roelof van der Merwe got a direct hit to send the Pakistan skipper back to the pavillion. It was a big setback to Pakistan who were under pressure after two successive loses in the Super 12 stages of T20 World Cup 2022.

However, Fakhar Zaman, who got a game for the first time in the World Cup, and Rizwan put the pressure right back on Netherlands bowlers by counter-attacking in the powerplay.

It's not been an ideal start to Babar Azam's T20 World Cup campaign as the star batter has been criticised for his form and captaincy in Australia. Babar got out for a first-ball duck against India after he was trapped LBW by left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh. He was out for 4 from 9 deliveries against Zimbabwe with Brad Evans taking the big wicket. Pakistan lost to both India and Zimbabwe in last-over thrillers.

Babar has scored 619 runs in 22 matches as he, along with Mohammad Rizwan, have been the pillars of Pakistan's batting unit. Despite having hit two fifties in the tri-series in New Zealand in the lead-up to the World Cup, the Pakistan captain has been struggling to get going in the World Cup.

Questions have been asked as to why Babar is not willing to drop himself down to No. 3 and bring somone like Fakhar Zaman to add firepower at the top of the order.

Former Pakistan fast bowler Waqar Younis was critical of Babar's reluctance to try out someone at the top along with Mohammad Rizwan, saying the Pakistan captain doesn't want to sacrifice for the sake of the team.

"The easiest place to bat in T20s is opening. You have not let anyone else open in the last two years. I have discussed this with Misbah before, so why don’t you try something new? You have tried it out with bowling, but with batting, we have tried all the experiments with the middle order. But the openers have remained the same and they have batted 14-15 overs together," Waqar had told A Sports.

Pakistan bowlers, however, were on fire on Sunday as they restricted the Netherlands to 91 for 9 in 20 overs. Shadab Khan picked up 3 wickets each and Mohammad Wasim Jr. picked up 2 wickets as Pakistan bowlers did not given an inch to the Dutch batters in Perth.
