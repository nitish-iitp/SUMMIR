In Short
Babar Azam has scored 8 runs in 3 matches in T20 World Cup 2022
Babar was run-out for 4 against the Netherlands on Sunday
Pakistan are fighting to stay alive in the T20 World Cup semi-final race

Vice-captain Shadab Khan threw his weight behind Babar Azam, saying the Pakistan captain is also human and that the team is not worried about his lean patch in the T20 World Cup 2022 campaign. Shadab said the Pakistan team is fully behind Babar, who is "our best captain".

Babar Azam got out for 4 in Pakistan's Super 12 match against the Netherlands as the Pakistan captain's horror run in Australia continued. Babar was so desperate that he tried to pinch an improbable single when Pakistan were chasing 92 and a direct hit from Roelof van der Merwe was enough to send him back to the hut.

T20 World Cup 2022: Full Coverage

Babar Azam has looked short of confidence as he has struggled to get going in the ongoing T20 World Cup 2022 campaign. Babar's poor run started when he got out for a first-ball duck against India in a high-pressure Super 12 match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Babar missed a fuller-length delivery from Arshdeep Singh and was hit flush on the pads for an LBW decision.

Babar Azam couldn't get going in their Super 12 match against Zimbabwe as the Pakistan captain was out for 4 from 9 deliveries. Pakistan went on to lose the match, failing to chase 131.

Even as Babar's place at the top of the order has been questioned, Shadab Khan said the team is fully behind their captain, who according to him, would need just one knock to return to peak form.

"He's a world-class player, no doubt about that. But he's human also. Sometimes humans make mistakes, but he's our leader, he's our best captain. He supports us, so we have to support him now," Shadab told the press after Pakistan's 6-wicket win over the Netherlands in Perth.

"It's just three games. I don't -- no one worries about his form because he's a world-class player. That type of player needs some shots. Like a world-class player, they need one shot or two shots. He's one shot away.

"Hopefully, like there was one today he score runs. Hopefully, Babar's next game, because our next game is a big game, so hopefully he scores there for the team," he added.

Babar has scored 619 runs in 22 matches in 2022, having been the pillar of Pakistan's batting unit along with Mohammad Rizwan. Despite having hit two fifties in the tri-series in New Zealand in the lead-up to the World Cup, the Pakistan captain has been struggling to get going in the World Cup.
