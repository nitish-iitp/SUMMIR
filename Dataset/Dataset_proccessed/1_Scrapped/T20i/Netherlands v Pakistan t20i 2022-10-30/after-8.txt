That's all we have from this one-sided affair. But don't go too far away as India have arrived at the Perth Stadium and will be locking horns with South Africa shortly. The game is scheduled to begin at 4.30 pm IST (11 am GMT). Do switch tabs and get all the updates. Cheers!

!

Babar Azam, the captain of Pakistan, is happy with the overall performance of his team. Adds that bowling the right lengths was crucial on this pitch. He is happy with the execution part. Tells that winning gives you confidence but he would have liked to chase the target by losing lesser wickets.

!

Scott Edwards, the skipper of the Netherlands, says that batting first was the right decision as they wanted to put runs on the board and give their bowlers the chance to defend. He is disappointed with their batting. Mentions that they couldn't get the partnerships and also failed to find enough boundaries. Praises the bowlers for trying hard.

!

Shadab Khan (4-0-22-3) is the Player of the Match. The leggie says that it was a true pitch and his plan was simple, i.e. to bowl in the line of the stumps. Adds that all the bowlers were brilliant and put pressure in the Powerplay. Smiles and tells that it's a team game, some bowlers create pressure and some pick wickets. He is happy that they finished the game this evening after two failed attempts.

!

Stay tuned for the presentation...

!

The bowlers of Pakistan bossed this match. They had a clinical outing and restricted the Dutch team below 100. In pursuit, Babar Azam got run out early, but Mohammad Rizwan stayed long enough to kill the chase. He failed to finish the game but Pakistan marched home eventually with 37 balls to spare. The Netherlands tried their best but they didn't have enough runs on the board and only managed to delay the inevitable.

!

Excellent win for Pakistan to boost their confidence and the NRR. The Netherlands proved to be no match for the Men in Green and got decimated. Their campaign is certainly over, but Pakistan are hanging in there by the skin of their teeth. This is also their first win in T20Is in Australia.
