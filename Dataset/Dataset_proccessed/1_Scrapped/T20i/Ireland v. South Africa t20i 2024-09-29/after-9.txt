Ireland 195 for 6 (R Adair 100, Stirling 52, Mulder 2-51) beat South Africa 185 for 9 (Hendricks 51, Breetzke 51, M Adair 4-31, Hume 3-25)


Ireland beat South Africa for the first time in a T20I after posting their highest total against them and successfully defending it in Abu Dhabi. In the process, they became the first team to win a match batting first at the Zayed Cricket Stadium in the last eight T20Is at the venue.

In what was a family affair, Ross Adair grabbed the early headlines when he scored a 57-ball hundred, his first in T20Is - and Ireland's third century in the format - before his younger brother, Mark Adair, took 4 for 31 to seal the win.

Ross set the tone when he shared Ireland's second-highest opening stand in the format - 137 - with his captain Paul Stirling, who scored his first fifty in 21 T20Is. Their start meant Ireland were on track for a score above 200 but lost 6 for 43 in 32 balls to leave some runs unscored. Still, they asked South Africa to complete the highest successful chase in T20Is at this venue and they made a fist of it.

Reeza Hendricks scored his second successive half-century Matthew Breetzke his first but Ireland struck often enough to ensure the required run rate got too big on South Africa's middle order. They needed 108 off the last 10 overs, with nine wickets in hand, and 53 off the last five overs, with seven wickets in the bank, and that is when Mark Adair struck. He went around the wicket to Tristan Stubbs, who pushed at a wide ball and was caught behind. That sparked a collapse that saw South Africa lose 5 wickets for 25 to fall 11 runs short.

Ross Adair rides his luck

Take nothing away from Ross' innings, which was an exhibition of all-round hitting, but he will know he should have been out not once, not twice, not three, not four but five times. He offered South Africa a first chance on 19, in the powerplay, when he was cramped by a Lizaad Williams short ball and miscued a pull to deep square leg. The catch was taken but Williams had overstepped and Adair batted on.

Then, in the 14th over, immediately after Stirling was dismissed, Adair, on 78, hit Wiaan Mulder to Williams at deep backward point. Williams got both hands to it but palmed the ball over the boundary rope to send Adair into the 80s. Adair swung wildly at the next ball and hit it straight up but Ryan Rickleton couldn't make enough ground to take the catch. And the ball after that, Adair was at the non-striker's end when Harry Tector called him through for a single and then changed his mind. Patrick Kruger could have run Adair out but he missed his throw from extra cover. Adair had not quite had enough of danger and in the next over, on 90, he offered Kruger a return chance but it just went over him and Adair kept going. He brought up 100 off 57 balls and finished with nine sixes, the most by an Irish batter in the format.

SA strangle Ireland in end overs

In the first match, South Africa gave away only six runs in the last two overs of the Ireland innings to leave them short of a par score; this time they gave away only 19 in the last three overs to keep Ireland under 200. Lungi Ngidi, who has been excellent on the tour, started the squeeze with an over of slower balls. That included a ball that completely foxed Neil Rock, who was far too early on his shot, and took out his middle stump. Ngidi finished with an analysis of 1 for 23 in four overs. Kruger bowled the 19th, which started with a run-out as Mark Adair was scrambling for a second run and was also peppered with pace-off. And Williams was given the last over by which time South Africa incurred an over-rate penalty and had to have an extra fielder in the ring. Still, he did not concede any boundaries as he stuck to yorker lengths.

Humphreys belated birthday gift

Left-arm spinner Matthew Humphreys turned 22 on Saturday and celebrated with a trip to the Abu Dhabi Louvre but the real gift came 24 hours later when he took his first wicket of the series, and it was a big one. After conceding 26 runs in his first three overs, Humphreys was given the 14th over to finish and he made a big incision. With 66 needed off 39 balls balls, Aiden Markram premeditated a reverse-sweep but did not account for the change of pace from Humphreys. He sent the ball down quicker, it beat Markram and bowled him. Humphreys finished with 1 for 30 and left South Africa's middle order with too much to do.

Mark Adair magic

After dismissing Stubbs, Mark Adair opened up South Africa's middle order and then dismantled it in the 19th over. South Africa needed 23 runs off the last 12, and Mark Adair sent down a slower ball to Mulder, who hit straight up and Adair took it on himself to complete the catch. Two balls later, Breetzke tried to swat Mark Adair through the leg side but sent the ball straight to Harry Tector at long-on. Mark Adair closed out his over when Nqaba Peter hit him to extra cover, where Stirling took a diving catch to put Ireland in the pound seats. Graham Hume had 17 runs to defend off the last over and picked up two wickets in the process of doing that.
