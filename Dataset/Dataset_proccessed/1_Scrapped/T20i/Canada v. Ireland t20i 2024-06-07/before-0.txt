Eid ul Adha 2024: Procedure of Dhul Hijjah moon sighting for determining date of Bakreid

Traditionally, Muslim communities rely on eyewitness testimonies from reliable sources to confirm the sighting of the new moon where local religious authorities or committees often oversee the process and skilled observers are appointed to look for the crescent moon shortly after sunset on the 29th day of the preceding Islamic month. If the moon is sighted and confirmed by these individuals, the announcement of the onset of the month of Dhu al-Hijjah (the twelfth or last month of the Islamic or lunar calendar) is announced and simultaneously, the date of Eid-ul-Adha is declared.

However, if the moon is not sighted, the month of Dhul Hijjah is extended by a day and the moon sighting process is repeated on the following evening after maghrib prayers. In recent years, advancements in technology have facilitated the moon sighting process and many Muslims now use astronomical calculations and scientific data to predict the visibility of the moon accurately.

This approach combines traditional practices with scientific knowledge to determine the start of the Islamic month but it is important to note that different regions or communities may follow different methods and criteria for moon sighting. Some rely solely on local sightings while others consider global sightings or rely on official announcements from designated authorities however, the goal is to ensure the unity and consensus within the Muslim community regarding the start of important Islamic events such as Eid-ul-Adha.

Does Eid ul Adha falls after Hajj? Know facts and misconceptions

It is often assumed that Eid ul Adha falls a day after Hajj however, it is not true. Also, this has never been the norm followed by Muslims all over the world. After the first day of Dhul Hijjah is established, then the tenth of that month is calculated hence, the date of Eid ul Adha is different for different places. On a more elaborate note, Hajj, the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, takes place from the 8th to the 12th of Dhul Hijjah where on 8th Dhul Hijjah (Yawm at-Tarwiyah), pilgrims begin their Hajj rituals; on 9th Dhul Hijjah (Yawm Arafat), the most significant day of Hajj, pilgrims gather on the plain of Arafat to pray and seek forgiveness while on the day of Eid ul Adha i.e. 10th Dhul Hijjah (Yawm an-Nahr), pilgrims perform the ritual of animal sacrifice (Qurbani) to commemorate the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to Allah. Allah provided a ram to sacrifice instead. Finally, Hajj ends on 12th Dhul Hijjah.
