United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: Monank Patel Player Of the Match after the game

It is a big achievement, beating Pakistan and that too playing (them) for the first time. It was a complete team effort. We won the toss and we made sure we utilised the conditions well, we did really well to keep them under 160. I am happy with my contribution and more happy that we won the game. We spoke about the top three contributing and happy that myself and Gous could do that. The plan was to play proper shots and he (Gous) took the pressure off me. Happy to get the two points. As a batter and player you want to show off in the big games and I am happy that my knock came in a winning cause.

United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: USA beat PAK in Super Over

Netravalkar does it. He kept his cool and executed his deliveries to perfection compared to Amir and Pakistan who looked panicked. The left-armer kept bowling wide outside the off-stump to the right-hander and into the batter for the left-hander and did an excellent job. What a victory for the USA. What a game we had. It was a rollercoaster ride through and through the 20 overs.

United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: Iftikhar departs in Super Over

Well, there is a twist in the tale. Iftikhar has departed. Netravlkar bowled a full one which the batter tried to hit in the long-on region but could not get the middle and the fielder took an excellent catch diving forward. What a moment in the game.

United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: PAK need 19 from Super Over vs USA in Dallas

It was a rusty super over from Pakistan. Amir took the ball and he sprayed the ball over the place. The fielding was off from them as well. More than the USA getting the runs those were presented by Pakistan to them. They have lost the plot completely here in Pakistan in the last 15 minutes or so. They have 19 runs to win in the over and it will be interesting to see who they will send to bat and it is not going to be easy for them whatsoever.

00:50 (IST)
07 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 20 overs USA 159/3

Well, It was Pakistan's game with 18 required in the final over and Rauf nailing his yorkers. However, the bowler lost the plot in the later part of the over first it was a full toss to Jones which went for a six, and then Nitish got another full toss which he hit down the ground for another boundary. We will be back shortly with the super over.

00:42 (IST)
07 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 19 overs USA 145/3

Another excellent over from Pakistan and it is Amir this time. Three back-to-back fabulous overs from Pakistan now. USA have lost the completely they seem to be they are panicking a bit. While they are trying to scoop the yorkers the execution has not been there from their end.

07 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 18.1 overs USA 140/3

Another fabulous over from Shaheen following up the Naseem Shah's over. This is where Pakistan bowlers show their experience against inexperienced USA batters. Amir has taken the ball to bowl the 19th over. 

00:31 (IST)
07 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 17.1 overs USA 132/3

Naseem Shah came to ball the 17th over and it has been an excellent one. He mixed up his fuller ones and hard-lengh deliveries nicely. It is a big over coming up the next one for both sides. USA might go all guns blazing in the over.

00:26 (IST)
07 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 16 overs USA 126/3

Shadab Khan has come into attack and bowled his third over. While it has not been an impressive over Babar has now got through overs of his fifth bowler. USA won't have any freebies coming their way and it will require skill from them to get these runs.

00:22 (IST)
07 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 15 overs USA 115/3

That is a fabulous over from Amir. It was a slower one from him which Monank tried to hit through the off-side and got the edge to the keeper. Excellent catch from Rizwan as it felt like the ball would not reach him. Things have got a bit tricky for USA here in the last 15 minutes.

00:18 (IST)
07 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 14.1 overs USA 111/3

Haris Rauf gets the breakthrough. It was a good-length delivery which hurried Gous and he got himself into an awkward position and got himself bowled. As we update Amir has come in and picked Monank. A couple of quick wickets for Pakistan here. 

00:10 (IST)
07 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 13.1 overs USA 104/1

Shaheen Shah has come back into attack and Monank went after the Pakistani strike bowler and slammed for a six and four. The Pakistan bowlers are now looking like they do not have the creativity to get a breakthrough. As we update Rauf picks Gous.

00:03 (IST)
07 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 12 overs USA 94/1

Iftikhar has come into attack and bowled an over which went for a couple of boundary. This has been a fabulous chase from the USA so far. This is the first time Pakistan and the USA are playing each other in the World Cup and unless something dramatic happens it is hard to see how the USA will lose this game.

23:59 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 11.1 overs USA 85/1

Naseem Shah comes back into the attack and it has been another over where the USA has progressed further towards their chase. Pakistan need a passage of play where they pick 2-3 quick wickets. As we update Babar has turned to Iftikhar with the ball.

23:52 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 10 overs USA 76/1

We have reached the halfway stage and the game is still very much alive for the USA. This has been an excellent effort in the chase from them. Looks like we are heading towards the first upset of the tournament. It has been a pretty ordinary defense from Pakistan in the second innings.

23:48 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 9 overs USA 66/1

Gous and Monank are building another handy partnership here. This has been a clever play from the USA they are taking singles and waiting for poor delivery from Pakistan which is coming because the onus is on them to make the play and win this game rather than the USA at the moment.

23:44 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 8.1 overs USA 58/1

Shadab Khan has come into the attack for his first over. Though the wicket is not turning the Pakistan leggie is a tricky customer and plenty depends on him on how this game unfolds from here. Also, It will be a test of Babar's captaincy on how he will chop and change his bowlers from here on.

23:41 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 7.2 overs USA 54/1

Rauf has come into the attack and he too looked below par. One noticeable thing with this USA batting lineup has been they have been not troubled with out-and-out pace as some of the associate nations tend to when faced against the likes of Rauf and Naseem

23:33 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 6.1 overs USA 44/1

Naseem Shah seems to have found the right length with the new ball for Pakistan here. It was a peach of a delivery to Taylor as the ball hit the good length and had a slight moment and got the edge to the keeper. Powerplay is done and the United States has got to a decent start here.

23:28 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 5.1 overs USA 36/1

Amir has changed ends and it has been an average over from his standards. The body language from Pakistan has been poor here in the first five overs. Looks like they are looking for magic to happen rather than creating one. As we update Naseem Shah picks Taylor.

23:23 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 4.1 overs USA 32/0

Naseem Shah has come into attack and it was a good over. However, what Pakistan needs is wickets not good overs. Also, the fielding from them has been pretty ordinary compared to what the USA has done in the first innings. 

23:19 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 3.2 overs USA 25/0

The appeal of the last ball against Monank looked promising as Babar went upstairs as it was not given out on-field by the umpire however, the ball was pitching outside the leg. Earlier in the over Monank got an edge which went through the first slip and keeper.

23:12 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 2.1 overs USA 14/0

Amir comes into the attack and he looks rusty. There were a few deliveries that he tried to swing by pitching up could not get the line right for them. It has been a rusty start from Pakistan with the ball as well similar to batting.

23:06 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 1 overs USA 7/0

We are done with the first over of the chase. Shaheen has taken the new ball for Pakistan and in the attempt to bowl yorkers he slipped in a couple of boundaries one was punished for a boundary and the other one was a dot ball. Pakistan needs to create early inroads here.

23:00 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: Nosthush Kenjige during innings break

It is just half the job done. We are pretty pleased to restrict them to 155 on this wicket, it is a pretty good wicket. We know they are a dangerous side but we believe in our abilities and it is good that it reflected on the ground, the bowlers executed the plans perfectly. It is pretty hot and we would have taken 150 at the start of the day, we have to bat well but I have hope we will do well.

22:50 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: PAK 159/7 vs USA in Dallas

Shaheen Shah Afridi's brief knock has taken Pakistan to 159/7 which is not a massive total. However, Pakistan has the bowling which can unravel USA batting. From the USA's perspective,, all they need is one batter batting for 20 overs which would be enough for them to get home. It will be an interesting chase stay with us for the second innings. 

22:43 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 19 overs PAK 149/7

Another excellent spell from Netravalkar. He picks up Iftikhar which would make a difference of 10-15 runs for Pakistan's total. While it has been excellent bowling from the USA after an average 2023 ICC tournament in India this is once again a poor performance to start their campaign.

22:35 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 18 overs PAK 139/6

Shaheen Shah Afridi is looking to farm the strike at the moment and that is what he needs to do until there is a set batter in Iftikhar on the other end. Netravalkar has come into the attack to ball the 19th over. He has been fabulous today with the ball.

22:32 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 17.5 overs PAK 139/6

A good cameo from Iftikhar. This has been a timely inning from him. However, one thing is the wicket has not misbehaved most of the dismissals of Pakistan batters have been soft dismissals which could have been avoided with a bit of smartness.

22:25 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 16 overs PAK 126/6

Jasdeep comes back into attack and he picks the price wicket of Babar. The batter tried to to work the ball on the leg-side by coming down the track however, missed a straight one and was given out LBW. He did send it upstairs however, there where three reds.

22:18 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 15.1 overs PAK 119/5

Harmeet is done for the day. He did bowl an excellent spell. Though he does not have a wicket to show next to his name he has bowled a fabulous spell. It was only his third over which was expensive. If Pakistan can get to around 150-mark with their bowling attack they will have a solid chance.

22:16 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 14.3 overs PAK 111/5

Ali Khan has come into the attack and nine runs came of his over. Iftikhar tried to hit the ball through the off-side and got the edge which ran away for a boundary. Pakistan is in a very tricky situation at the moment they have to make sure wickets are not falling and also need to keep getting boundaries away.

22:11 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 13.1 overs PAK 99/5

That is probably the innings changing over from Kenjige. Just when things were looking were getting on track for Pakistan he first picked Shadab Khan who tried to play behind the wicket and was caught at fine leg and Azam Khan was trapped in front of the wicket of very first ball.

22:05 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 12.3 overs PAK 98/3

Shadab Khan is receiving a bit of treatment in the middle. The physio has come in. It is hot out there. The commentators do suspect is might be a groin niggle for him which he has been struggling with in recent times.  

22:01 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 12.2 overs PAK 96/3

Much needed big over Pakistan. Harmeet kept tossing the ball up and Babar and Shadab got stuck into the bowler. The USA is slowly losing the advantage they have gained in the first six. They need to pick a wicket here immediately to get back into the game.

21:57 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 11.1 overs PAK 80/3

Kenjinge has come back into the attack and it was an eight run over from him. Babar danced down one of the deliveries and smacked him for a boundary. Looks like Babar might be looking to change gears after the drinks break. 

21:51 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 10 overs PAK 66/3

Babar flicks one on the leg-side which goes for a boundary. Much needed for the Pakistan skipper. He has not been able to get his timing since the start of the innings. However, the important thing is he is still in the middle and building a valuable partnership with Shadab.

21:46 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 9.1 overs PAK 52/3

Given the way the wicket is playing here, Pakistan needs to find a way to get a 150-run mark. The surface is not doing much after the ball has lost a bit of shine. Shadab is the ideal candidate for Pakistan at this point as he can get away singles and get a boundary from time to time.

21:42 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 8.1 overs PAK 40/3

Jasdeep Singh has come into the attack. The pitch is not doing much however, the three lost wickets from Pakistan have pushed them onto the backfoot. The running between the wickets from Pakistan has also been poor the fielding has been excellent from the USA.

21:38 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 7 overs PAK 35/3

Hermeet has come into the attack and he has tossed the up ball and has been turning off the surface. Also, something other teams will have a look at is the number of right-handers Pakistan has in their top order. The bowling changes have been excellent by the USA skipper.

21:35 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 6.2 overs PAK 33/3

Netravalkar comes into bowl his third over and does an excellent job. Shadab has been promoted up the order. Pakistan might look to manoeuvre the ball for a bit build a partnership and lay the foundation for hitters to follow in the later part of the innings.

21:30 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 5.1 overs PAK 27/3

Ali Khan came into the attack and Fakhar Zaman tried to scoop the ball and gave a simple catch to fine-leg. Pakistan have now lost three wickets in the Powerplay. This is superb from the USA. Babar Azam holds the key for Pakistan.

21:24 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 4.1 overs PAK 24/2

This is an excellent start from Netravalkar from the other end. He is getting to bowl to move which Pakistan openers struggle to cope with. Babar Azam is trying to up the strike rate, however, the seam moment is not letting him free his arms.

21:18 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 3.1 overs PAK 21/2

Usman Khan tries to hit the ball into the stands fails to time the ball and gets caught at long-off. It is left-arm spinner Kenjige who picks the wicket. This is a bit of an iffy start for Pakistan. Fakhar Zaman has walked into the middle and he tends to play only one way.

21:13 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 2.1 overs PAK 14/1

It was an eventful over from Netravlakar. The left-arm seamer squared up Rizwan the ball pitched and moved slightly away and Taylor at slip took a stunning catch. It is an excellent start from the USA. It will be interesting to see how Pakistan plays it from here.

21:06 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: After 1.1 overs PAK 9/0

USA starts with a left-arm spinner against two right-handed Pakistan openers. However, Rizwan on one knee hit one over square leg for a six to get things underway. It's an interesting choice from Monank Patel to start the proceedings with spin on a surface that has a bit of grass.

United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: Pakistan's poor run of form

Pakistan are coming into this World Cup with unenviable form, losing a T20 international to Ireland and then getting defeated by England 0-2 in a 4-match series. Even before that, the Men in Green had tied a series against a New Zealand side which was missing several of its World Cup stars. With a clash against arch-rivals India looming on the horizon, the Babar Azam-led outfit will be hoping to fix the chinks in their armour against the United States

United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: Babar Azam at toss

We would have also bowled first. It is a morning match, the pitch is fresh and we will look to put the runs on the board. Good to see sun is out, we haven't seen sunshine for the last 3-4 days. He (Imad) has an injury but we will cover it up by playing the four fast bowlers.

20:36 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: Monank Patel at toss

We will bowl first. We have been playing on the same surface and chasing is easy on this ground, also it is better to know the target. It was a great game and we want to continue that momentum. It is a new challenge and we want to make sure we play our best cricket. One change for us.

United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: PAK vs ENG recap

Two of the matches in the series were washed out, denting the World Cup preparations of both teams. There were showers around for the series finale in London too, but England and Pakistan played through them — save for 20 minutes during the Pakistan innings when players went off the field.

The tournament staged jointly in the United States and the Caribbean starts Saturday, with England’s opening match against Scotland in Barbados on Tuesday and Pakistan playing for the first time on June 6 against the U.S.

On this evidence, it will be England fighting for the title and not Pakistan.

United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: Babar Azam-Mohammad Rizwan break unique record held by Virat Kohli-Chris Gayle for RCB

Pakistani opening duo Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan have consistently churned out runs for the side over the years. The pairing has made a habit of breaking the opening record repeatedly, and on Thursday the duo broke one more such record. They have passed Virat Kohli and Chris Gayle’s record for Royal Challengers Bengaluru of having the most 50-run opening partnerships.

Against England Babar and Rizwan have put on a 59-run stand at the Oval. With that, they have crossed 50 runs for the first wicket 24 times as a pairing going past the Kohli-Gayle record who have done the feat 23 times. In addition to that Babar has become the first Pakistani player to go past the 4000 run-mark and is only behind Kohli in most runs scored in T20Is.

United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: ‘Rizwan’s presence will help Babar’ part 3

“When he played under Sarfaraz Ahmed (Quetta Gladiators), he was playing as a fielder. If you are picking Azam over Rizwan (as ‘keeper), then you are making a big blunder,” he adds.

However, Rashid says it is not Azam’s fault that he is in the Pakistan team and playing as a ‘keeper.

“I will not blame the player. Mohammad Haris is fit, more agile and in good form. If you wanted a third keeper, he should have been the ideal choice. I will not comment on Azam’s physique, I can comment on his batting, his form, his keeping, his selection. We live in a racist society. If someone’s skin colour is black, we call them kaalu. If someone is fair, we call them gora. If someone is tall he is a lambu, if someone is skinny he is a patlu. I feel bad for the kid, he is only 25. He doesn’t deserve to be trolled like this.”

20:10 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: ‘Rizwan’s presence will help Babar’ part 2

However, Azam has been deemed unfit by former greats and his wicket-keeping skills have come under fire. Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi had said he would never pick Azam for the national team. “I would never let Azam Khan get anywhere near the team as far as fitness is concerned,” Afridi had said on Samaa TV. Afridi added: “I am worried about his keeping against spinners in West Indian conditions with this fitness because the ball stays low there and you have to keep your body low as well.”

Rashid feels Pakistan should keep Azam in the playing XI but not as a keeper-batter.

“If Azam is not able to field then he doesn’t deserve to be in the XI. You can’t hide him in the field,” Rashid adds.

20:07 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: ‘Rizwan’s presence will help Babar’

Rashid also believes Pakistan captain Babar Azam will also benefit if Rizwan is the wicketkeeper.

“Wicketkeepers run the game from behind the stumps. This is why the captains are overdependent on them. It is not only about DRS but the other facets of the game as well. Now he is fielding in the deep, which is wrong. Babar doesn’t have that captaincy acumen, he needs Rizwan and if Rizwan is not Pakistan’s keeper, Pakistan will struggle in the World Cup,” Rashid says.

20:00 (IST)
06 JUN 2024
United States vs Pakistan Live Score, T20 World Cup: Azam is exceptional in T20

“Azam is an exceptional batsman in T20s. He is a clean hitter, plays spinners well, has worked on his game against the pacers. But I will not rate him as a keeper. It is nothing to do with his fitness, but because he doesn’t have that experience. He is still very new and raw to international level,” Rashid says.

Pakistan needs to give Mohammed Rizwan the big gloves if they are to progress deep in the tournament, the former captain thinks.

“Pakistan’s No.1 keeper should be Mohammed Rizwan. Rizwan is Pakistan’s best keeper and has been a warrior for this team. He has played in the last two T20I World Cups and was exceptional,” he adds.

Rashid Latif on Moin Khan’s son Azam Khan: He is being body shamed… doesn’t deserve this, is an exceptional T20 batsman

Pakistan wicketkeeper-batsman Azam Khan has been subjected to trolling on social media for his bulky frame and perceived lack of fitness this past week. The immediate trigger was him getting out to a bouncer from England fast bowler Mark Wood and then giving Will Jacks a reprieve after dropping a sitter behind the stumps. The clippings of these two incidents have gone viral and the 25-year-old’s place in Pakistan’s T20 World Cup is being questioned, even by experts.

Azam, the son of former Pakistan wicketkeeper Moin Khan, is not new to being at the receiving end of trolls. He, actually, uses the abuse to fire his motivation.

In Tabish Hashmi’s show ‘Hasna Mana hai’ on Geo News, the youngster talks about a poster in his room, which contains all the names he has been called. “Parchi, aloo, mota, sifarshi, nepotism, gainda, baby elephant.. I have written all these things on a poster in my room, and every day before going to the training I look at them and it gives me the extra confidence to do well,” he had said.
