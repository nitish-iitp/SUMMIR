CAN VS IRE, T20 World Cup 2024 Highlights:

Canada posted a historic triumph over Ireland as they picked up a 12-run win at the Nassau County Cricket Stadium in New York on Friday in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024.

Canada managed to put up a total of 137 for the loss of 7 wickets thanks to Nicholas Kirton’s 49-run knock, while Barry McCarthy and Craig Young scalped a brace of wickets each for the Irish.

Ireland got off to a good start as their openers put up a 26-run partnership before skipper Paul Stirling was dismissed in the sixth over, and the Irish innings slumped thereon.

Mark Adair’s 34 and George Dockrell’s unbeaten 30 gave the Irish some hope, but Canada bowled well to close out the game with Jeremy Gordon and Dilon Heylinger scalping two wickets each to aid their side in a famous win.

Match Preview: 

Ireland captain Paul Stirling won the toss and elected to bowl against Canada in their T20 World Cup Group A match, here on Friday.

Both Ireland and Canada will be under pressure to notch up their maiden win in the tournament and garner points after having lost their respective first matches.

While Ireland was comprehensively beaten by India by eight wickets earlier this week, Canada was trounced by a spirited USA by seven wickets in a high-scoring contest at Dallas.

For this contest, the groundsmen have taken off additional grass from the pitch and rolled it hard for the batters to have their say but some movement off the surface is still expected.

Ireland and Canada have both made one change to their playing XIs.

Aaron Johnson, Navneet Dhaliwal, Pargat Singh, Nicholas Kirton, Shreyas Movva(w), Dilpreet Bajwa, Saad Bin Zafar(c), Dillon Heyliger, Kaleem Sana, Junaid Siddiqui, Jeremy Gordon
