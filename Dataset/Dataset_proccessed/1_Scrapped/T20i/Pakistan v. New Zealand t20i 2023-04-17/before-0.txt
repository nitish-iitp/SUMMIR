PAK vs NZ 3rd T20 match playing XI: The third T20 match between Pakistan and New Zealand of the five-match T20 series will take place on Monday, April 17. The clash will take place at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. Given that the hosts have won the first two games of the series back-to-back, the Black Caps would hope to retaliate in the same manner when the third Twenty20 International begins. In both T20I matches thus far, the Men in Green have easily prevailed over New Zealand, and they will be aiming for a similar result on April 17. The Black Caps, on the other hand, would be keen to figure out ways to respond and win the first game of the series.
