Wanindu Hasaranga made his first appearance for RCB this season as he replaced David Willey against DC. Vijaykumar Vyshak also found a place and was impressive as he took three wickets. RCB might go in without a change in the combination.

Toss Prediction

The Chinnaswamy Stadium is a venue where the chasing team gets a massive advantage under lights. Therefore, the captain that wins the toss would elect to bowl first.

Probable Best Batter

Ruturaj Gaikwad missed out in the last game with the bat. But he has been in decent form this season. On a pitch that aids stroke making, he could get back amongst the runs.

Probable Best Bowler

Wanindu Hasaranga would be a key bowler for RCB as he has the variations that would be required on a pitch that won’t offer much for the bowlers. The Sri Lankan leggie is the bowler to keep an eye on.
