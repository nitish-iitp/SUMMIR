The Philadelphia Phillies were firing on all cylinders Tuesday night.

The Phillies took Game 1 of the NLCS 5-3 over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Monday but did not let it get that close in Game 2, cruising to a 10-0 victory to take a commanding 2-0 series lead.

Shortstop Trea Turner got the ball rolling in the first inning with a home run, and designated hitter Kyle Schwarber knocked two additional bombs by the sixth inning. The Phillies put up three additional runs in the sixth and four more in the seventh to put the game out of reach.

SCHWARBER GOES YARD AGAIN‼️ <br><br>This is his first career multi-HR game in the postseason 👏 <br><br>(via <a href="https://twitter.com/MLB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MLB</a>)<a href="https://t.co/NP0pNoiXkw">pic.twitter.com/NP0pNoiXkw</a>

Starting pitcher Aaron Nola was equally responsible for the dominant showing, tossing six shutout innings while only allowing three hits and recording seven strikeout. He accomplished this without issuing any walks and only throwing 82 pitches.

Aaron Nola tonight in Game 2:<br><br>6 IP, 3 H, 7 K, 0 R 🔥🔥 <a href="https://t.co/kJWtSxSIxP">pic.twitter.com/kJWtSxSIxP</a>

Schwarber was 2-3 while also drawing a walk on the day. Turner was 1-2 and drew two walks, third baseman Alec Bohm had a hit and two RBIs and catcher J.T. Realmuto had two hits with three RBIs. Outfielder Brandon Marsh hit an RBI double and outfielder Nick Castellanos also contributed an RBI.

However, the major star of the day in the batter's box was Schwarber, and fans were quick to praise his clutch hitting.

The Phillies feel like the team of destiny this year. They got so close last year and they have two modern day Mr. October's on the roster in Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber.

Kyle Schwarber has hit 101 HRs for the Phillies in the regular and postseason since April of 2022. That is ridiculous.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/kyleschwarber?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#kyleschwarber</a> <a href="https://t.co/WHnHZBuNdv">pic.twitter.com/WHnHZBuNdv</a>

Schwarber now has 3 hits in the first 2 games of this <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NLCS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NLCS</a>, and they're all home runs! The guy really only hits dingers! 😂

Nola also received significant buzz, with fans saying he delivered exactly the performance the team needed.

Aaron Nola has made himself a nice chunk of change with this playoff run so far

Paul Casella
@Paul_CasellaMLB

Aaron Nola in 3 starts this postseason:<br><br>- 18 2/3 IP<br>- 19 K's<br>- 2 ER<br>- 2 BB<br><br>The only other pitchers to match or exceed each of those numbers in ANY 3-game span in a single postseason are Cliff Lee (2010) and John Smoltz (1991).

Nathan Ackerman
@NathanAckerman_

Aaron Nola had just two scoreless starts of at least six innings this regular season — in 32 starts overall. <br><br>He's already done it twice in three starts this postseason.

Anthony SanFilippo
@AntSanPhilly

In what may have been his last start in front of the home fans, Aaron Nola throws six shutout innings, allowing just three hits with seven strikeouts. It was a clinic. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RedOctober?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RedOctober</a>

Jeff Hoffman will pitch the seventh for the Phillies.<br><br>Aaron Nola was fantastic tonight: 6 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 7 K. Nola has a 0.96 ERA in three starts this postseason.

@statmusemlb

Aaron Nola tonight:<br><br>6.0 IP<br>3 H<br>0 ER<br>0 BB<br>7 SO<br><br>Couldn't ask for a better start. <a href="https://t.co/J8G4M4EI0G">pic.twitter.com/J8G4M4EI0G</a>

After Tuesday's win, the Phillies are now just two wins away from returning to the World Series.

Philadelphia will look to keep the train rolling in Arizona while the Diamondbacks will look to try to get back into the series. That opportunity will come on Thursday at 5:07 p.m. ET.
