Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr.’s homer is hardest-hit ball in MLB this season

LOS ANGELES – On Thursday, Ronald Acuña Jr. became the first player to reach 30 home runs and 60 stolen bases in major-league history.

On Saturday, he achieved a different kind of feat: He smoked the hardest-hit ball in the majors this season.

In the top of the third inning at Dodger Stadium, Acuña pulverized a solo home run off Emmet Sheehan that left his bat at 121.2 mph – harder than any ball hit this season.

“I never imagined that was going to be the exit velocity on it, but yeah, I hit it hard,” Acuña said through interpreter Franco García after Atlanta’s 4-2 win in 10 innings.

Of the rocket, Braves manager Brian Snitker said: “Oh my God. I was wondering if maybe that was the hardest one ever hit … You better not leave your seat and get a beer when he’s coming up, because you might miss something pretty special – and that was.”

Acuña’s homer was the the third-hardest hit home run since MLB began tracking exit velocity in 2015. The Yankees’ Giancarlo Stanton hit home runs of 121.7 mph and 121.3 mph in 2018 and 2020, respectively.

“Unbelievable,” teammate Orlando Arcia said.

Could Arcia exceed the exit velocity on Acuña’s homer?

“No chance,” he said.

Acuña’s homer had an exit velocity almost three mph faster than second place this year, which is … teammate Matt Olson, who launched an 118.6 mph homer earlier this season.

Olson is tied for second place with the Angels’ Shohei Ohtani and Stanton, who each hit balls at 118.6 mph this year. Unlike Olson, Ohtani doubled and Stanton singled.

Acuña exceeded everyone, from Stanton to Ohtani to Aaron Judge and more.

“To be honest, I don’t know,” Acuña said when asked about the secret to his power. “But those guys have my utmost respect. I feel like they hit every ball hard.”

Acuña’s home run off Sheehan traveled 454 feet.

“I saw it on the way out and I thought it was going to hit off the wall, and then it was nowhere close to the wall,” Braves starter Bryce Elder said. “And then they said it was 121 (mph), I thought it was a misread, but it wasn’t. It was impressive.”
