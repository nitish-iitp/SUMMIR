BOSTON (AP) — Mike Clevinger pitched six solid innings, Elvis Andrus had a two-run double and the Chicago White Sox beat the Boston Red Sox 3-2 in a rain-shortened game on Sunday, ending a string of 12 straight series losses.

Trying to avoid their second 100-loss season in five years and the fifth in club history, the White Sox took two of three from the Red Sox and captured their first series since August 7-9 when they went 2-1 against the Yankees.

Adam Duvall and Wilyer Abreu each hit a solo homer for the Red Sox, who are on pace to finish in the AL East basement for the third time in four years.

The umpires called for the tap after the sixth inning and the game was called after an hour, 43–minute delay.

Chicago outfielder Luis Robert Jr. left with a sore right knee after stealing his 20th base. He has 38 homers and 36 doubles, becoming the first White Sox player with 35 homers, 35 doubles and 20 steals.

Clevinger (9-8) gave up two runs and five hits without striking out or walking a batter.

Playing with rain falling most of the time for the second straight day, the White Sox scored twice with just one hit against Kutter Crawford (6-8) to take a 2-1 edge in the fifth.

Crawford walked a pair before Andrus’ liner to center just got under the glove of centerfielder Ceddanne Rafaela’s full-length dive.

Gavin Sheets’ sacrifice fly made it 3-1 in the sixth.

Abreu’s drive went into the seats in deep right for his second career homer in the second. Duvall’s completely left Fenway Park over the Green Monster in the sixth.

SERIES STUFF

The Red Sox have lost a season-high six straight series.

It was Chicago’s first road series win since August 4-6, at Cleveland. The White Sox won the season series against Boston, 4-2.

TRAINER’S ROOM

White Sox: Placed right-hander Jesse Scholtens on the 15-day injured list with a strained left calf. They recalled right-hander Declan Cronin to take his spot.

Red Sox: Reinstated right-hander Zack Kelly from the 60-day injured list. He was out since April 13 with right elbow inflammation. Right-hander Nick Robertson was optioned to Triple-A to make room.

UP NEXT

White Sox: Have an off day Monday because their scheduled game against Arizona was moved to Thursday so the Diamondbacks could play a makeup game in New York against the Yankees. RHP José Ureña (0-6, 7.27 ERA) is set to start the first of a three-game series vs. Arizona on Tuesday.

Red Sox: RHP Tanner Houck (5-9, 4.92) is slated to start the first of a two-game series against Tampa Bay on Tuesday.
