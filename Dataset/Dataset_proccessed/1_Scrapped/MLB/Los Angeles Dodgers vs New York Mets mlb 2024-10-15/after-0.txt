MLB’s strong postseason continues as the league has hit its highest LCS opener viewership in 15 years with Game 1 of Mets-Dodgers. Sunday night's matchup drew 8.3 million viewers on Fox, marking the best Game 1 for any LCS opener since Fox drew 8.4 million for Yankees-Angels ALCS Game 1 in 2009. Mets-Dodgers peaked at 10.1 million viewers in the 8:15-8:30pm ET quarter-hour. L.A. led all markets with a 12.9 local rating, while N.Y. drew a 7.3 (the market also had Bengals-Giants on NBC). That “Sunday Night Football" game drew 17.1 million viewers.

The viewership in N.Y. was much closer than the national figures on Sunday night. Mets-Dodgers reportedly drew 925,000 viewers in the market, while Bengals-Giants drew just over 1 million.

Mets-Dodgers (nationally) is up 18% from the comparable Rangers-Astros ALCS Game 1 on Fox last year (7 million viewers). Fox continues to be on pace for its best MLB postseason since 2014. Mets-Dodgers also finished No. 3 in primetime on Sunday, behind “SNF” and an episode of “Tracker” on CBS that got 8.31 million viewers at 8pm.
