INJURIES
Makes abbreviated start
Jackson struck out two and gave up no hits and two walks over one scoreless inning in his start in Friday's 7-5 win over the Reds.
Impact Jackson had been serving as a traditional starter or bulk reliever for the better part of the month, but he was deployed as more of an opener in Friday's contest. Though the Pirates didn't disclose Jackson was dealing with any reported injury, he tossed just one inning before he was lifted from the contest in favor of Luis Ortiz, who covered 3.2 innings of long relief. The Pirates have been running out a six-man rotation of late, so it's possible that Jackson ends up moving to the bullpen over the final week and a half of the season if manager Derek Shelton feels the team can get by with five starters.

Getting start Friday
Jackson will get the start for the Pirates in Friday's game at Cincinnati.
Impact Jackson has been operating in a swingman role for Pittsburgh while posting a 4.82 ERA, 1.15 WHIP and 33:16 K:BB across 37.1 innings. He threw 66 pitches over 4.1 innings of long relief in his last appearance Sunday versus the Yankees.

Allows four runs in defeat
Jackson (1-3) took the loss Monday, allowing four runs on four hits and two walks over four innings against Washington. He struck out one.
Impact A CJ Abrams home run plated two for the Nationals in the third, then Jackson was removed after laboring through the fourth in allowing two more runs on two hits and two walks. Jackson had been pitching well since arriving in Pittsburgh with a 2.92 ERA in his first 24.2 innings, but his ERA has jumped to 5.51 after allowing 10 runs in 8.1 innings over his last two starts. He'll look to rebound in his next appearance, currently scheduled to take place over the weekend in a home series against the Yankees.

Six earned runs Tuesday
Jackson (1-2) took the loss Tuesday, allowing six runs on three hits and five walks over 4.1 innings against the Brewers. He struck out two.
Impact Jackson retired the first nine Brewers he faced and managed to limit the fourth-inning damage to just one run after walking the bases loaded to start the frame. However, the wheels came off in the fifth when the 27-year-old was charged with five more runs on three hits and two walks. In Jackson's previous six appearances since returning to the big-league squad Aug. 5, he posted a 2.92 ERA, 0.97 WHIP and 27:7 K:BB across 24.2 innings. He'll look to get back on track in his next outing, which is projected to be early next week versus the Nationals.

Earns first career win
Jackson (1-1) earned the win Wednesday over the Royals. He allowed a run on two hits and two walks while striking out seven over 5.2 innings.
Impact Jackson has pitched relatively well since joining the Pirates in a trade from the Dodgers, allowing eight runs over 24.2 innings while posting a 27:7 K:BB in that span. This was his third start of the season, all of which have come with Pittsburgh. Overall, he's amassed a 4.46 ERA, 1.16 WHIP and 43:10 K:BB through 42.1 innings over 13 appearances in 2023. Should Jackson remain in the rotation, he's projected for a tougher home start versus the Brewers next week.

Gets starting nod Wednesday
Pirates manager Derek Shelton said Jackson will start Wednesday's game against the Royals at Kauffman Stadium, Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports.
Impact Jackson tossed six innings of two-run ball in a bulk-relief role during his last appearance Thursday against the Cubs, but he'll pick up his third start of the season in his return to the hill. Since being acquired from the Dodgers in late June and then joining the big club earlier this month, Jackson has delivered a 3.32 ERA, 1.05 WHIP and 20:5 K:BB in 19 innings through his first five outings with the Pirates.

Effective in bulk role
Jackson allowed two runs on six hits while striking out two over six innings in Thursday's 5-4 loss to the Cubs.
Impact Jackson allowed a pair of runs in the second inning after Rob Zastryzny worked the opening frame. However, the 27-year-old Jackson would settle in and blank the Cubs over his final five innings, allowing just two additional hits. Since joining the Pirates in early August, the 27-year-old right-hander's worked to a 3.32 ERA with a 1.05 WHIP over 19 innings. It remains to be seen if Pittsburgh will deploy Jackson as a traditional starter, though he's currently lined up to pitch early next week in Kansas City.

Strikes out six in defeat
Jackson (0-1) took the loss Friday, allowing two runs on four hits and three walks over 4.1 innings against Minnesota. He struck out six.
Impact Jackson was making his second start and fourth appearance overall for the Pirates, who acquired him from the Dodgers in June. While he kept them in the game by only allowing two runs, the offense couldn't help him out and he earned his first loss. Jackson has managed to go over 70 pitches in both of his starts and the numbers look promising. During his time in Pittsburgh, Jackson has a 3.46 ERA with a 18:5 K:BB over 13 innings.

Remains in rotation
Jackson is scheduled to start Friday's game against the Twins in Minnesota, Andrew Destin of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports.
Impact The right-hander will get a second straight turn through the rotation despite a rocky showing in his first MLB start versus the Reds this past Sunday, when he struck out five while allowing three earned runs on five hits and two walks over 3.2 innings en route to taking a no-decision in the second game of a doubleheader with Cincinnati. Over 26.1 innings in the majors this season, Jackson has posted a stellar 28:5 K:BB, but most of his other ratios (5.47 ERA, 1.22 WHIP, 2.1 HR/9) are less impressive.

Impact Jackson made his first career MLB start and needed 78 pitches to record just 11 outs. He entered Sunday's game with an eight-inning scoreless streak and lost it in the second inning when Luke Maile knocked a two-run double. Jackson's ERA climbed to 5.47 with a 28:5 K:BB through 26.1 innings. He's currently expected to make a start in Minnesota, though it's unclear if the Pirates will move him back to the bullpen or not.

Saturday start postponed
Jackson's scheduled start Saturday was postponed due to inclement weather.
Impact The Pirates and Reds will play a doubleheader Sunday, so Jackson will have to wait another day to make his first career major-league start. Mitch Keller will get the nod for Game 1, while Jackson will start on the mound during the nightcap, per Justice delos Santos of MLB.com.

Making start Saturday
Jackson will make his first major-league start for the Pirates on Saturday versus the Reds, Justice delos Santos of MLB.com reports.
Impact While it is Jackson's first start in the majors, he has plenty of starting experience in the minors and his relief appearances in the big leagues have routinely been of the multi-inning variety. The right-hander's last appearance came Tuesday when he threw 30 pitches over two innings. Jackson hasn't allowed a single baserunner in his five innings with Pittsburgh.

Activated to big-league roster
Jackson was recalled from Triple-A Indianapolis on Friday.
Impact Acquired from the Dodgers at the end of June, Jackson will now get his first opportunity with the Pirates, replacing Dauri Moreta (back) in the Pittsburgh bullpen. Jackson has pitched to a 3.38 ERA and 1.18 WHIP in five appearances with Indianapolis to date -- a significant improvement on the 5.86 and 1.54 marks he had with Oklahoma City prior to the trade.

Impact This move clears out a 40-man roster spot for Ryan Brasier, who is joining the Dodgers' bullpen ahead of Tuesday night's game against the Angels. Jackson, 27, has posted a 6.62 ERA in 17.2 innings this year at the MLB level and a 5.86 ERA in 27.2 innings at Triple-A Oklahoma City.

Optioned to minors
The Dodgers optioned Jackson to Triple-A Oklahoma City on Sunday, Eric Stephen of SBNation.com reports.
Impact Jackson will head back to the minors since he likely wouldn't have been available out of the bullpen for the next few days after recording a three-inning save in Saturday's win over the Phillies. The Dodgers called up Adam Kolarek from Oklahoma City to provide the Dodgers with a fresh arm for Sunday's series finale.

Banks three-inning save
Jackson earned a save against Philadelphia on Saturday, allowing three hits and striking out three batters over three scoreless innings.
Impact Jackson was called up earlier in the day and was deployed in the seventh inning after rookie Bobby Miller gave Los Angeles six scoreless frames. Jackson preserved the shutout and was credited with a save, throwing 30 of 39 pitches for a strike without walking any batters. The right-hander has notched two saves this season and four in his career, all of which have been three innings in length. His latest call-up is a result of Shelby Miller going on the bereavement list, so Jackson may head back to the minors before long.
