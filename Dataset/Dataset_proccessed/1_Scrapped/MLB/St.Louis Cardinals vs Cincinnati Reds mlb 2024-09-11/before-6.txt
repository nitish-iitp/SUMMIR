In Tuesday’s opener versus the Cards, the Reds posted all their runs in the fifth inning during a 3-0 victory. Rhett Lowder managed 5.0 clean frames, five hits, and three Ks in the start.

Brandon Williamson will start for the Reds on Wednesday. Williamson has a 2.25 ERA and six Ks this year without a decision.

It’ll be Lance Lynn in the starter role Wednesday. So far Lynn is 6-4 with a 4.06 ERA in 21 starts this year. Lynn is 142-99 with a 3.75 ERA in 362 career games (338 starts).

Cincinnati Reds vs St. Louis Cardinals Prediction

I’m leaning toward the Cardinals. Lynn has been doing pretty well recently. Over his last three starts combined Lynn is 2-0 with three earned runs in 16.0 innings on 12 hits and six walks combined. He should be good for a quality outing here if all goes well.

On Tuesday the Cardinals had some pretty solid offensive performances mixed in with their eight-team hits but they couldn’t make anything happen on the scoreboard. St. Louis needs to perform better at the plate on Wednesday.
