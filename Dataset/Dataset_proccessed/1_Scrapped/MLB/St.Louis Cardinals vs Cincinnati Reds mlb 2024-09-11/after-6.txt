Brandon Williamson


It has mostly been a lost season for Williamson after an injury in spring training kept him off of the big league mount until the start of September. He attempted to rehab back in May but was shut down and didn’t return until he made one rehab start in Louisville at the end of August. With his only having thrown 10.2 innings in the last few months, it’s not worth paying too much attention to what his stats are this year.

Lance Lynn


It’s been six weeks since Lance Lynn took the mound for the Cardinals as he’s missed time with inflammation in his knee. He’s faced the Reds twice this season and has given up one earned run (and two unearned runs) in 12.0 innings with 11 strikeouts.

The splits are big for Lynn this season. Left-handed hitters are better across the board as they hit for a higher average, more power, walk more, and make more contact. His home and road splits are also quite big. At home he’s got a 3.43 ERA (4.81 ERA on the road) and opponents have a .629 OPS (.833 on the road).

News and Notes

Keep cooking the birds

Last night’s win guaranteed the Reds a winning record this season against St. Louis. They are now 7-4 against the Cardinals with just two games remaining between the two. It’s the first time since 2021 when the Reds went 10-9 against St. Louis that they’ve had a winning year against them.

Reds promote Chase Petty to Triple-A

Cincinnati moved #3 prospect Chase Petty up to Triple-A today. The right-handed pitcher has been in Double-A all season, making 26 starts for the Lookouts and throwing a career high 127.0 innings. He should be able to get two more starts before the minor league season ends. If you want more details on Petty and the move, we’ve got you covered over at RedsMinorLeagues.com.

Leftover grilled chicken and peppers (the stuff I made last night) for me. I’m hoping our Queen City Redlegs are hungry for …

ROASTED REDBIRD!!!

Here’s to another good outing from Williamson. It’s good to have him building back.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

Did I mention last night I really dislike these later starts? It cuts into my bedtime routine … 

Dennis Westrick 09/11/2024

First things first! Let’s beat the Dirty Birds again and close the gap between the Reds and the Cardinals in the NL Central Division!

Secondly, let’s beat up on Lance Lynn and give him a reason to consider retirement after the end of this season!

Finally, let’s go 10-6 in the last 16 games of the 2024 season and reach that coveted .500 mark!

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

I’ve got to think the toughest of those games will be with the Bravos. At least those are in our house, but they are playing for their October fortune and pretty much hold their 2024 destiny in their hands. Guardrails are only 2 games but always tough. Twinkies may be in a more comfortable spot by then, but that’s still a tight race. Then, of course, there are the round robin games against the NLC non-contenders.

.500 would be pretty bitter sweet to me given the 1-run record. Woulda, coulda, shoulda … 

JB 09/11/2024

Twinkies better be careful because Tigers are on their tail for last wild card

RedsGettingBetter 09/11/2024

Lance Lynn is another tough cookie for the Reds… We’ll see Williamson against Cards who have good RH hitters in the lineup. Go Reds and spoil them all…!!

Rednat 09/11/2024

Doug, inquiring minds want to know…. how do you decide the player you use as the front picture for these game threads? Is it random or is it an instinct you have on a player that will have a big day?

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

I do wish Steer would get the 20th HR monkey off his back. He seems to be pressing more than a little, at least to me.

RedsGettingBetter 09/11/2024

Steer is striking a lot recently especially swinging at out of the zone high balls…

Kevin H 09/11/2024

Interesting just read were Moll had been dealing with shoulder soreness since June.

Reds website

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

File that under the “things that make us go hmmmm ….”

VaRedsFan 09/11/2024

Probably from all the times he kept warming up, and then not get into the game, and then do the same thing the next day and come in for 2-3 batters. Instead of warming up and/or pitching a few pitches every day, they should be used for longer outings every other day. No recovery days seems to me would be more stress, than longer outings with a day or two off in between.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

Need Bike Helmets against Nolan here in the worst way.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

Did I call that or WHAT???

RedsGettingBetter 09/11/2024

Another great zero…

JB 09/11/2024

Got to be Lynn’s last year. The softball keg league is calling.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

+10,000 

VaRedsFan 09/11/2024

Except they can bring him out of retirement to just face the Reds.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

Lance Lynn sporting the well-fed Grizzly Adams look … 

Jason Franklin 09/11/2024

My bold (and probably impossible) prediction is that Maile hits a homer tonight. That’s right. 

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

I’m supporting that with a +5,000

VaRedsFan 09/11/2024

Reds seem to do better against the fastball.
Except if Lance Lynn is pitching, for some reason.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

My WLW audio overlay is back tonight. I will say Cowboy adds so much to a game and he does seem to keep Sadak “in check”. We all know Larkin can’t/won’t do that.

2 in the can. Time to start hitting green instead of gloves.

RedsGettingBetter 09/11/2024

Luke Maile has been horrible… I don’t want to see him in 2025 in a Reds uniform…

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

He could be our hitting coach … amiright?

VaRedsFan 09/11/2024

The Maile tax is collected right away.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

OK, Jon … just like your first AB would be nice … or a base hit would be better. Nice swipe by Marte.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

You know the high cheese is coming and you still can’t lay off it … SMHXH!!!

RedsGettingBetter 09/11/2024

Wow , very ugly at bats by India & Elly… Unacceptable

CincyDo 09/11/2024

Watching the same movie everyday right? Unable to get runner from 3rd base home. 1-3 hitters, supposed to be best hitters, have not provided key hits. Not clutch.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

All I wanted from India was a repeat of that fly ball to CF. Fraley could have walked in backwards and we’d be up 1-0.

Now we’ve got a 6-inning game.

Kevin H 09/11/2024

They make it look easy at time, however hitting is hard.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

It is. And laying off isn’t easy. But when a pitcher like Lynn keeps throwing stuff well above the zone and you just whiff at it batter after batter, that tells me guys aren’t paying attention to patterns.

JB 09/11/2024

Reds hitters have zip zero patience. Haven’t had it all year.

Kevin H 09/11/2024

True Mark, it is a guessing game for sure between hitter and batter. We see it alot

Kevin H 09/11/2024

Friedl as usual a fly ball. Does he not know how to hunt anymore?

Kevin H 09/11/2024

Opps bunt

JB 09/11/2024

Bunted last night.

Kevin H 09/11/2024

Thank you,

I didn’t watch lastnight. The times I have watched recently he doesn’t

JB 09/11/2024

Also bunted against Charlie Morton the other day.

JB 09/11/2024

Sadak and Cowboy? Mentioned last night that he is not 100% and the hammy won’t be the rest of the year. Probably why he doesn’t bunt much.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

Thrall and Welsh were debating that. Welsh was okay with him NOT bunting this early in the game.

Amarillo 09/11/2024

Friedl has explained that his early season injury has affected his bunting. Probably too much pressure on the Hamstring when trying to sprint out of the batter’s box.

Kevin H 09/11/2024

Thank you for that explanation. I didn’t know that, and it would explain the lack of bunting this year in the games I have watched.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

That certainly makes sense. Plus he was rushed back the first time. It all piles up by September.

Dennis Westrick 09/11/2024

0-5 with RISP thru 3 innings! Wow! Just wow!

JB 09/11/2024

Espy gets it done. You need a base hit and he will deliver.

RedsGettingBetter 09/11/2024

Espinal is the less bad Reds clutch hitter…Finally 1 run!!

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

That swipe of 3rd by Steer pays a dividend. Nice little looping flair from Espinal. Mountain Man Lynn tired and required a visit from his handler.

JB 09/11/2024

It was . If he didn’t take 3rd he doesn’t score there.

Old-school 09/11/2024

Espinal has bat to ball skills

CincyDo 09/11/2024

Espinal is just clutch. You need a hit, Espinal delivers. Some players just have a nag for it.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

Hearing Goldy is a free agent after the season, I’m wondering who will pay for his services, how much, and for how long. He’s definitely in his declining years.

JB 09/11/2024

I was just thinking that. I think he is 35. Cardinals are very old but their young guys aren’t really tearing it up. Their off-season is going to be interesting. Lynn is free agent and I can’t see them signing him.

JB 09/11/2024

Actually 37

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

Wynn seems to be consistent. But the length of teeth is getting up there across the board on the “stars”.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

Didn’t somebody tell Williamson NOT to feed cookies to Nolan?

MuddyCleats 09/11/2024

Exactly, especially w/ a LHH on deck! Then walk him so u can face another power hitting RHH. Youth wasted on the young!

Kevin H 09/11/2024

Lowder and Williamson seem to be good depth pieces. I have been impressed with Janis in the starting role.

Will be interesting to see what happens, however I would try and get a ace type starter during the off season. Ashcraft maybe goes to bullpen. Just some thoughts.

Pharmer85 09/11/2024

Ace pitchers don’t come cheap. Hopefully Lowder more than just a good depth piece.

JB 09/11/2024

I don’t think Lowder is ever going to see AAA again. To me he is the number 2 guy behind Hunter next year. Williamson I think is your 5th. Lodolo and Abbott are your 3 and 4. Ashcraft ,Aguiar, Petty and Spiers are starting in AAA next year. Just my opinion as well.

Pharmer85 09/11/2024

Tend to agree on one through four (not sure what order). Fifth spot up for grabs.

VaRedsFan 09/11/2024

99th game for Arenado vs the Reds
25th HR

Somebody check my math, but I believe that’s a tick better than 1 every 4 games.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

And we seem to regularly feed him cookies.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

So it’s a 5-inning sprint and Williamson is about done for tonight. Hoping Lynn is getting tired as well.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

OK, Elly. Just focus on lifting one. Anything more is a bonus.

RedsGettingBetter 09/11/2024

My goodness Elly… he is lost

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

This inning elicits a STINK. FISH. POT!!! from me … very frustrating.

RedsGettingBetter 09/11/2024

I can’t believe it… The Reds hit well only with bases empty or runner on first…the rest they are pitiful

CincyDo 09/11/2024

So, just look at the last 5 games, my book keeping said the Reds had roughly 10 chances for sac fly and failed 100%. Statistician, and I am not one, would argue that natural probability says at least 20% success rate should be expected. It leads me to believe that Reds players are doing things that are counter productive in those situations. If they just hit the way they normally do, it would lead to better result.

RedsGettingBetter 09/11/2024

Really good job by Williamson just made one mistake leaving a cutter on the middle to Arenado which costs a run. I think 82 pitches is enough for him at this moment after only 3 outings this season…

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

HT to Williamson for 5 strong innings. Boyz haven’t backed him for his W, but that’s on them.

4-inning bullpen sprint now.

Dennis Westrick 09/11/2024

This is bordering on the ridiculous! 2-9 with RISP! Add that to 7 strikeouts thru 5 innings explains only one run being scored! At least Lynn is out of the game!

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

Knew it was the forkball and couldn’t help himself … and that’s a veteran, disciplined hitter.

Nice 6th from Cruz. Now a 3-inning sprint to the finish. I really can’t afford extras tonight, so let’s get it done, boyz.

RedsGettingBetter 09/11/2024

Bell bringing in Cruz to face the top to mid Cards lineup was a little reckless but it worked. Cruz looks to have some confidence back lately…

Jim t 09/11/2024

Nice 5 innings by Williamson. Really like how are starting pitchers are shaping up for next year. If this cheap ownership will invest some of there money in a middle of the order bat this team could be very competitive next year. I know that is a big IF.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

We’ll be told that CES and MattyMc coming back will fill those spots. Also that a full season of Marte will be different than the undisciplined, free-swinger we’ve seen.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

First Wife is commenting that Kittredge looks a lot like Lynn.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

I guess Maile isn’t going to play savior tonight, is he? 

JA 09/11/2024

In a parallel universe

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

I’m not even sure it’s parallel … it’s probably 8-10 dimensions distant.

RedsGettingBetter 09/11/2024

I think Tucker Barnhart can put the ball in play more frequently or Am I wrong? Jesus…

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

Cruz for a 2nd inning? Interesting choice. Let’s hope it works out well.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

Good move by Bell to bring in somebody else to face Carpenter. Cruz did his job very well tonight.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

Of course, Carpenter won’t bat anyway.

VaRedsFan 09/11/2024

Cruz dominating….
Bell: “Let’s get him outta there”

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

Now the question is, who gets the 8th inning? Will it be Suter with somebody warming?

SteveAReno 09/11/2024

Cruz faced six batters and struck out four of them.

RedsGettingBetter 09/11/2024

The deception of Suter’s pitches is incredible…86-87 MPH 4SFF …LOL …

RedsGettingBetter 09/11/2024

This game will be decided by tiny details

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

I’ve got kind of a queasy feeling about this one now.

Kevin H 09/11/2024

Ball 4 called a strike and then a swing and miss. If Elly can cut his strike outs in half next season. Look out!! Dude is phenomenal.

wkuchad 09/11/2024

I feel like he gets screwed by the umps more than most. Probably in my head, but it’s frustrating.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

It does seem that’s the case. He was showing patience that AB and that marginal call threw him off.

TJ 09/11/2024

Game moving quickly, but sure is boring.

Kevin H 09/11/2024

Interesting not brining Suter out to face Siani.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

Yeah. A little puzzling to me.

Kevin H 09/11/2024

No consistency in the decision making.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

And the wheels are wobbling in the 8th 

Kevin H 09/11/2024

Farmer doesn’t have it today.

JB 09/11/2024

Farmer does not have it but let’s keep him out there. Smh

JB 09/11/2024

Put that one on a tee

VaRedsFan 09/11/2024

As opposed to Cruz, who did have it, gets pulled
Suter…gets pulled

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

And I’m done for the night. Seriously doubt we come back from this now. Too many wasted opportunities once again.

Dennis Westrick 09/11/2024

Thanks, Farmer! I can go to bed now!

Kevin H 09/11/2024

Perhaps bullpen had guys not available today. Is why Farmer was left out there. Who knows.

Friedl didn’t seem to get a good read on that ball. It happens sometimes.

VaRedsFan 09/11/2024

He had guys available…..The one’s that were actually pitching good when pulled.

TJ did take a bad route on it FWIW

Kevin H 09/11/2024

Great point. Lol… makes one shake their head.

VaRedsFan 09/11/2024

Goldy 3-8 with a double and a HR off Buck….”Go get him Buck”
RBI double

Kevin H 09/11/2024

Friedl should of made the catch, however seemed to get a poor read on the ball. Not all on Farmer, however he did struggle that inning for sure.

Mark A Verticchio 09/11/2024

That ball has to be caught, Freidl doesn’t seem as good as past years in center field.

VaRedsFan 09/11/2024

He’s made most every play out there in CF.
That one was the exception.

RedsGettingBetter 09/11/2024

Reds have wasted many chances to score…so if you don’t score runs in baseball the other team will score against you

Kevin H 09/11/2024

Great game this evening. Reds battled, yet just came up short.

Mark A Verticchio 09/11/2024

I may be in a minority but I am not sure Freidl is the everyday center fielder next year. Often injured and he is only hitting .215.

Jim t 09/11/2024

The home plate umpire was terrible tonight. Saw at least 5 pitches that were called strikes that were outside the box.

VaRedsFan 09/11/2024

Common theme on a nightly basis

CincyDo 09/11/2024

Reds had about 20 games like this up to this point. All the wasted sac fly opportunities, omg, just got a couple of them and their record would improve by 10 games.

Mark A Verticchio 09/11/2024

100 % agree.

SteveAReno 09/12/2024

Cruz faced six batters and struck out four of them.
