A couple of Blue Jays were looking for milestone 100s when they ventured into Tropicana Field to open a three-game weekend series on Friday night.

The Tampa Bay Rays made sure neither was achieved. With a 1-0 victory over the Jays, the hosts denied Toronto starter Jose Berrios his 100th career victory — a plateau that, given the way he pitched on this night, could have been a possibility had Vlad Guerrero Jr., and the Jays bats been able to muster any kind of offence.

One RBI from Vladdy would have given the Jays slugger 100 for the season, a feat he has managed only once before — in 2021 when he drove in 111.

Guerrero will have plenty of opportunities to get his 100th RBI before the season runs out next weekend. Berrios will likely get one more crack at 100 wins in his final start next week against the Red Sox at home.

Berrios entered Friday’s game having won his previous seven starts. By no means was the veteran right-hander at his best, but he was good enough to give his team a chance.

Ultimately, he was doomed by one pitch when Jonathan Aranda went deep off him in the sixth inning.

Still, Berrios pitched at least six innings for the eighth consecutive time, a stretch that has seen him give up two or fewer runs. He went six innings, allowing six hits and one walk while striking out six.

Berrios had all kinds of traffic in the early innings when it seemed inevitable that the Rays would score at least two or three runs. Some quality pitches in timely fashion helped him, but he was also the beneficiary of a highlight reel defensive play Ernie Clement made at shortstop.

Berrios then settled down and reverted to his recent form that made him one of the game’s best.

OUCH!

It was a painful first Blue Jays plate appearance for Jonatan Clase.

After getting hit on the third pitch he saw from Rays left-hander Tyler Alexander in the third inning, Clase took off from first base hoping to steal second. But he ran so hard that he slid well beyond the bag, ultimately getting tagged out on what would be ruled as a 2-4-5 play.

Initially, Clase was credited with the steal. Later, it was determined he did not secure the base and no steal was given.
The 22-year-old started in centre field and had to make a play right from the get-go when Yandy Diaz stroked a line drive double off the wall.

In Clase’s second plate appearance, which came in the fifth inning with runners at first and second and one out, he faced right-hander Kevin Kelly. The switch-hitting Clase sent a ball up the middle that went off Kelly’s glove but Tampa got the force-out at second.

Clase then recorded his first hit with the Blue Jays in the seventh inning on a single into right field.

INJURED TRIO

While the Blue Jays did avoid a sweep at the hands of the Texas Rangers, they weren’t exactly able to avoid the injury bug, a constant nuisance for the club that first reared its head in spring training.

game after making his return from a calf injury that shelved him for nearly two months, Bo Bichette took a grounder off his hand during warmups and fractured his right middle finger.

Bichette is scheduled to visit with a hand specialist in Arizona next Tuesday as the Blue Jays close out their season, one he will look back on with considerable frustration and pain.

As for the team’s two other injured players, news on Will Wagner is that the promising addition to the roster underwent knee surgery Friday. By all accounts, it’s not considered serious and Wagner should be able to resume baseball activities sooner than later once he gets clearance.

The same can’t be said for Daulton Varsho, who will go under the knife Monday to repair the rotator cuff in his throwing shoulder. He won’t be available when spring training begins, creating a hole in centre field the Jays will have to address until he is fully recovered.

During Varsho’s recent absence, the Jays used Nathan Lukes and Joey Loperfido in centre before turning to Clase in Friday’s series opener.
