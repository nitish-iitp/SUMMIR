WHITE SOX SPORTS MLB
Ex-White Sox manager Gene Lamont still wonders why team gave up on him in 1995
No one since Al Lopez has managed the Sox to a better winning percentage than Lamont’s .551 (258-210) from 1992 through 31 games into 1995.

A couple of months ago, former White Sox manager Gene Lamont was happy to take a phone call and share thoughts and stories about best friend Jim Leyland, who was about to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.

With this year’s Sox at 27-72 coming out of the All-Star break, a smart-aleck reporter couldn’t resist sneaking in an unrelated suggestion: If the club was going to fire manager Pedro Grifol — and it would, a few weeks later — perhaps Lamont, only 77, could throw his cap in the ring for a second go-round a la Tony La Russa?

“Yeah,” Lamont said from his home in Sarasota, Florida, “that’s probably not going to happen.”
