Perhaps no other college football player came into the 2024 season with more hype than Arch Manning. Despite not even being the team's starter, Texas Longhorns fans want to see football royalty get action this year.

Manning got on the field on Saturday, subbing in for Quinn Ewers in a blowout, and scored his first career passing and rushing touchdowns. But before Manning thrilled his fans, another redshirt freshman in the SEC put the nation on notice: Tennessee's Nico Iamaleava.

Like Texas, the Volunteers were playing a low-level opponent. But that didn't stop Iamaleava from showcasing his elite talent.

Iamaleava played so well in the first half - setting a Vols record and getting out to a 45-0 lead - that he didn't even play a snap in the final 30 minutes of the game.

He showed off his fantastic arm strength and accuracy throughout the first half.

Of course, Chattanooga is not a good litmus test by any means, but Iamaleava is carrying over the elite traits he showed off in glances during sporadic appearances in 2023. He's only going to get better from here, making Tennessee a great contender for a CFP spot.
