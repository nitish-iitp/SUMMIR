The Los Angeles Dodgers have placed veteran left-hander Clayton Kershaw on the 15-day injured list.

Kershaw, who left Friday's game against the Arizona Diamondbacks in the second inning, was diagnosed with a bone spur in his left big toe.

"There's so much swelling, he can barely move around," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said before Saturday's game.

Kershaw gave up three runs in the first inning and with the early exit, the Dodgers used every reliever on their staff except for Evan Phillips, who had pitched the previous two days.

The Dodgers called up RHP Ben Casparius from Triple-A Oklahoma City to replace Kershaw.

"We need some coverage for tonight," Roberts said, adding that they won't know for sure how long Kershaw will be out. "I don't think the 15 days will cut into the buildup" of his stamina, Roberts said.

Kershaw, who didn't pitch until July 25 after having offseason shoulder surgery, is 2-2 with a 4.50 ERA in seven starts. In 17 seasons, all with the Dodgers, the 10-time All-Star has a 212-94 record with a 2.50 ERA.

Right-hander Joe Kelly was also placed on the injured list by Los Angeles on Saturday. Kelly is dealing with right shoulder inflammation.

Kelly pitched 1 2/3 innings on Friday and gave up two earned runs on three hits. The 13-year veteran is 1-1 with a 5.20 ERA in 31 games this year.

To replace Kelly, the Dodgers selected the contract of RHP Brent Honeywell for his second stint with the club this season. Honeywell was designated for assignment on Aug. 18.

LHP Justin Wrobleski is with the team and with roster expansion on Sunday, he will be activated to start that game against Arizona.
