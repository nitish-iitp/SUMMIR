Final thoughts

Sometimes World Series Game 1 can be a bit of a disappointment, particularly coming after both the ALCS and NLCS went the full seven games. Needless to say this was not one of those games. While García is obviously the biggest winner but some credit should go to the Rangers bullpen for managing to hold the Diamondbacks scoreless after Eovaldi had a rare bad postseason game.

Tomorrow, or “later today” here in the East Coast, the Rangers are scheduled to start Jordan Montgomery and Arizona is planning to go with Merrill Kelly. We’ll be back here covering it for the Guardian, we hope that you will join us. Until then, thanks to everybody for following along with us throughout this wild Game 1, especially those of you who send in your thoughts. Ciao!

García’s walk-off

If you’re wondering what García’s home run looked like. Well, it went something like this. In fact, exactly like this.

THAT BALL IS GONE!!! ADOLIS GARCIA WALKS IT OFF FOR THE RANGERS IN THE 11TH 🤯😱

Walk-off home run! (García), Diamondbacks 5-6 Rangers, FINAL

García is now up with one out and nobody on. Castro’s first pitch is so wide that it inspires a “just a bit outside” commentary from the announcers. The next pitch is closer but not close enough. 2-0. García, a bit overeager, swings and misses. He really wants to end this one right here.

The next pitch is outside. The next pitch is… HAMMERED! That one is out of there and García has won Game 1 of the World Series on a walk-off home run in extra innings!

Diamondbacks 5-5 Rangers, bottom 11th

Nelson is back out there for one more batter, this time it happens to be Evan Carter. Nelson gets ahead of Carter 1-2 before Carter takes a ball and then flies out on a slider high in the zone. One out and it looks like it’s Miguel Castro time for Arizona.

That is a stat. Also: the Diamondbacks won their first World Series despite this!

The Diamondbacks have played in 4 World Series road games in franchise history.

They have allowed a game-tying 2-run home run in the bottom of the 9th 3 times.

Email from CeCe Siino:

Header: Go Diamondbacks!

You’re obviously a Ranger fan; why?

I appreciate the email! For the record, my team wasn’t even good enough to make the postseason. I have no rooting interest in this game beyond a) it being entertaining (it has been) and b) nailing my pregame prediction (I went with Texas on this game).

Diamondbacks 5-5 Rangers, bottom 10th

Corey Seagar is up with two out and runners on first and second. Nelson’s first two pitches are both balls, he’s having serious command issues. On 2-0, Seager hits a ground ball and we head to the 11th inning.

Semien hits a single, Tavares (the only run that really matters here) is now on second!

28 Oct 2023
23.52 EDT

Diamondbacks 5-5 Rangers, bottom 10th

Tavares takes a strike. 0-1. Tavares takes a ball, quite outside. 1-1. He gets greedy on the next pitch, swinging at a slider at near-ground level. He then takes the next two pitches to work out a full-count. 3-2.

Nelson walks him! Marcus Semien is up with a runner on first and two outs!

23.50 EDT

Diamondbacks 5-5 Rangers, bottom 10th

Jung is up now while pun-happy headline writers start praying that he walks this off. Instead he grounds into a double play, the absolute worst case scenario for Texas there. It’s up to Taveras now to prevent this from heading into the 11th.

Share
28 Oct 2023
23.49 EDT

Diamondbacks 5-5 Rangers, bottom 10th

The new pitcher for Arizona is Kyle Nelson, who will be facing Lowe. Nelson gets ahead of Lowe 0-2, but Lowe takes the next two pitches to even the count. 2-2. He takes the next pitch. 3-2. And the next pitch. Nelson walks Lowe after putting him in an 0-2 hole. The winning run is on first base with nobody out.

Walker is up next, trying to make something happen for Arizona. He doesn’t, instead flying out on three pitches. The Rangers have another chance to walk it off here in the bottom of the 10th!

Moreno is up next for the Diamondbacks and he works a full count against Leclerc before getting him to strike out swinging. Two away.

23.40 EDT

Diamondbacks 5-5 Rangers, top 10th

José Leclerc is out there pitching for Texas at the top of the 10th, facing Ketel Marte. Just in case you were wondering, the ghost-runner on second doesn’t exist in postseason extra innings, so the bases are clear. (Also, yes, the internet was also as confused as I was about why Hedges was out there in that situation.)

Leclerc gets Marte to line out to second for the first out in extras.

Diamondbacks 5-5 Rangers, bottom 9th

Hedges hasn’t had an at-bat this postseason and it’s very obvious. He strikes out swinging on three pitches, leaving the winning run at second. That’s going to be second-guessed if the Diamondbacks come back to win this.

We, improbably, are heading into extra innings!

García steals second and, with that, Sewald intentionally walks Garver. Austin Hedges, coming in ice cold, is the pinch-hitter for… some reason. Weird choice from Bochy here.

23.34 EDT

Diamondbacks 5-5 Rangers, bottom 9th

Can García pull off further postseason drama? This would be a perfect time to set the postseason RBI record. Instead he takes a strike and hits a ball foul. He’s down 0-2, right where Sewald wants him.

Except he nails García on a pitch. The crowd boos but I’m pretty sure that wasn’t the intention with Sewald a strike away from getting out of the inning. The pitch hit him on the hand however, so let’s hope that it’s not a serious injury. He stays in the game at first.

Diamondbacks 5-5 Rangers, bottom 9th

The Arlington crowd still is buzzing after that home run and why wouldn’t they be? It’s so loud that they barely register that Carter has fallen behind 0-2. He takes a ball outside. 1-2. He stays alive by fouling the next two pitches off.

But finally he goes out swinging. There’s two out in the bottom of the ninth.

Game-tying home run! (Seager) Diamondbacks 5-5 Rangers

Diamondbacks 5-5 Rangers, bottom 9th

Next up is Seager who can tie the game up with ONE SWING OF THE BAT. HE DOES! He hits a two-run homer and the Rangers have tied up the game in the ninth after being down two runs! INCREDIBLE!

Semien is up next. One on, zero out. He can’t handle a breaking ball from Sewald. 0-1. He fouls off the next pitch. 0-2. He then strikes out. Okay that was anticlimactic. Rangers down to two outs in Game 1.

Tavares takes the first pitch he sees for a strike but lays off for the next four. Just like that, the Rangers have the tying run at-bat.

Diamondbacks 5-3 Rangers, top 9th

Carroll lines out to end the top of the ninth. If the Rangers want this to head into extra innings, they need two runs. If they want to win it, they will need three. They will have to do it against Arizona closer Paul Sewald, however.

Smith faces Perdomo with one out, getting ahead of him 0-2 before throwing two straight balls that Perdomo doesn’t offer at before he grounds out to third. Two away.

Diamondbacks 5-3 Rangers, top 9th

Jon Gray is back out there and he gets Longoria to strike out on three pitches. One away in the top of the 9th. It looks like that will be all for Gray as Will “Not That One” Smith is coming out of the bullpen.

Email from Mark Harrison:

Hey Hunter,

Politely disagree on the aesthetics of the D-backs and the Royals before them. I’d take “small ball” every day of the week over three true outcomes style swinging for the fences. Baseball.is an odd-sport to me in that way, the most effective thing someone can do, the Home Run, is not really that interesting.

Thanks for the email! It’s been a quiet night and I appreciate it!

Yes it’s definitely a matter of preference on my part, but there are different types of smallball teams. Some I enjoy more than others. So far, these Diamondbacks remind me of the 2005 Chicago White Sox and the aforementioned Kansas City Royals, where their success rate seems to outpace the talent on the roster.

Arizona fans should welcome the comparison: both of those teams won championships after all.

Diamondbacks 5-3 Rangers, bottom 8th

Jung fouls off a pitch, takes a ball and then grounds out on a sinker. It takes Ginkel a lot of work but he gets the job done and keeps Texas off the board. We’re heading to the final inning here!

Up next, Lowe takes a ball high. 1-0. He swings at the next pitch but can’t make contact. 1-1. He swings and misses at the next pitch. 1-2. Then he lines one out to Gurriel in left for the second out of the inning. Masterful pitching there from Ginkel when his team needed it. He still needs another out here to complete the job though.

Share

Diamondbacks 5-3 Rangers, bottom 8th

Heim is up next, he takes two straight balls to start the at-bat. 2-0. Hitter’s count. Heim probably shouldn’t have swung there, that’s a ball that bounced so far that García managed to take second base. On 2-1, Heim takes ball three. 3-1. Heim fouls off the pitch. 3-2. Heim fouls off another fastball, the fifth of the at-bat. Ginkel tries a slider, Heim stays alive by fouling it off. Still 3-2. ANOTHER foul ball. That’s the eighth pitch of the at-bat. The ninth pitch is a borderline pitch that the umpire decides is a ball. The Rangers have runners on first and second with one out.

Share

Diamondbacks 5-3 Rangers, bottom 8th

Garver is up next with a runner on first and nobody out. He’s potentially the tying run here… except he strikes out swinging on four pitches. So, make that: a runner on first and one out.

Share

Diamondbacks 5-3 Rangers, bottom 8th

Is Kevin Ginkel there? Yes, yes, he is. He’s here pitching for the Diamondbacks and he will be facing García, who is very much not going to be lifted for a pinch-hitter. García takes a strike and then a ball and then another ball. 2-1. No, make that 3-1 after a Ginkel slider just misses the zone. García thought it was ball four. Nope. Instead, Ginkel gets him to look at a strike. 3-2. García fouls off two attempted payoff pitches, spoiling them both before hitting a solid single to lead off the inning. What a battle between pitcher and hitter!

Extremely important update: I have been informed that the Dead song I couldn’t place was a version of “Althea,” which I’ve only heard 50 times or so rather than 100s so that’s an understandable miss from me.

Thomas is up with a runner on first and two outs. He gets ahead of the count 3-1 before hitting a pitch foul and out of play for a full count. On 3-2, he strikes out to end the inning.

Diamondbacks 5-3 Rangers, top 8th

Tommy Pham, who has hit the only home run of the game, is up next and he looks at a strike. 0-1. Gray goes to his slider for the next pitch, but it bounces in the dirt. 1-1. The next slider isn’t much higher. 2-1. Pham hits the next ball foul to even things out. 2-2. Pham fouls off another pitch to stay alive but strikes out on the very next pitch. Gray stays in to face Gurriel.

Diamondbacks 5-3 Rangers, bottom 7th

Evan Carter tries to salvage something here at the bottom of the seventh. He takes a ball and fouls off a sinker. 1-1. Carter swings and misses. 1-2. He takes a pitch just off the corner. 2-2. On the next pitch he almost grounds out, but it’s just foul. Never mind, Mantiply induces a pop-up to end the inning. The Rangers now just have six outs left to get two runs. Not ideal, but the game’s not over yet.

Share

22.41 EDT

Diamondbacks 5-3 Rangers, bottom 7th

Corey Seager is back out for the Rangers. No pinch-hitters so far, but that’s probably because the Rangers started with their optimal lineup. Seager’s at-bat continues in much the same manner as his predecessor, falling behind 1-2. He fouls off the next pitch to keep alive before swinging and missing. That’s two prompt out for Mantiply.

Diamondbacks 5-3 Rangers, top 7th

Bradford is back up to start the seventh with the goal to not let this game get out of hand. A two-run deficit is manageable for these dangerous Rangers but anything more and this becomes very trick. In any case, Carroll hits a bunt back to the pitcher which is not ideal situational hitting given he’s leading off the inning, but Bradford will take it. Marte then drills one to Semien who makes a fabulous throw to get him out at first. Two down just like that.

Diamondbacks 5-3 Rangers, bottom 6th

Tavares looks at ball one and then fouls a pitch off of him. 1-1. He takes a strike next, a slider that just finds the strike zone at the last nanosecond. 1-2. Thompson is a pitch away from getting out of this potential jam. Tavares fouls off the next two pitches to stay alive but he pops one up to foul territory that’s caught by the catcher. The Rangers fail to score and we’re heading to the seventh inning.

22.21 EDT

Diamondbacks 5-3 Rangers, bottom 6th

Nathaniel Lowe is up next. He takes a sinker for a ball and then looks at a sinker that’s right in the strike zone. It’s a strike but it looked very hittable. Lowe doesn’t let up on the next pitch which he hits a very long way but he just gets underneath it so it’s just a scary-looking out number two and not a two-run homer.

Share
28 Oct 2023
22.19 EDT

Here’s the problem with Thompson: when he doesn’t have command with the sinker, things can get out of hand. He walks Heim on four pitches. Diamondbacks have a runner on first with one out.

Diamondbacks 5-3 Rangers, bottom 6th

It turns out that Gallen’s day is indeed over. Ryan Thompson is out pitching for Arizona, facing Thompson. Garver looks at a sinkerball strike and then a sinkerball ball. 1-1. I love Thompson’s funky delivery here, he crouches a bit and then sort of throws a wonky a breaker that, ideally, the hitter can’t pick up. Garver grounds out on the third one he sees to start the bottom of the sixth.

Share
28 Oct 2023
22.13 EDT

Diamondbacks 5-3 Rangers, top 6th

Perdomo fouls off a pitch and then takes a ball. Then he takes another ball. We’re at a 2-1 count here. He then takes another ball. 3-1. Thomas steal a base, that’s the fourth of the game for Arizona. Perdomo takes a strike 3-2. He thought he had first base there. He then lines out to second to end the inning.

And Dunning is out, he’s faced the minimum of three batters and it looks like Cory Bradford is coming out of the bullpen.

If I happen to call him Chad Bradford at any point I apologize in advance. I have a lot of obscure Red Sox pitchers in my brain taking up space.
