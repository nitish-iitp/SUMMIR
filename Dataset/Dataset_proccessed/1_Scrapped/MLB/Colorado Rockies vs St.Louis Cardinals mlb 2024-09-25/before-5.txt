Catch the new Ryan Murphy show Grotesquerie, starring Travis Kelce.

The Ryan Murphy takeover continues. At some point, every show on television will be produced by the creator of Glee, American Horror Story, 9-1-1 and many other shows. This newest entry in the Murphy universe is Grotesquerie, which will feature a familiar name to sports fans: Kansas City Chiefs tight end (and Taylor Swift’s boyfriend) Travis Kelce.

It’s still not clear what role Kelce will have in the new FX series, but Murphy said he specifically wrote this role for Kelce.

As quoted in a Deadline article, Murphy said this of Kelce: “I directed the first episode he did with Niecy [Nash-Betts]. Niecy and I just instantly loved him and took him by the hand and let him know that he would not, could not fail,” Murphy continued. “He really was amazing. He worked with an acting coach for several months. He showed up off book. He knew everybody’s lines. He was so professional. He was so committed. He kept saying to me, ‘I’m real coachable. Coach me, coach me.’ So I did, and he ended up being a delight, and I would love to continue working with him on this and other things. I cannot say enough about him as a leader. He’s just the kindest, sweetest…everything you think about him is true.”
