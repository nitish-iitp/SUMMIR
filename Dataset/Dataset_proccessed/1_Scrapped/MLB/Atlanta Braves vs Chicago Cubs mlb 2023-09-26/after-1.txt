Braves’ Ronald Acuña Jr. becomes first player in MLB’s 40-70 club

ATLANTA — Ronald Acuña Jr. isn’t just doing historic things, he’s doing them with a flair for the dramatic along the way.

The Atlanta Braves superstar became the first player in MLB history to have at least 40 homers and 70 stolen bases in a single season when he stole his 69th and 70th bases Wednesday night in a 10-inning, 6-5 win against the Chicago Cubs.

It wasn’t just what he did, but how, that made it so thrilling to watch for his teammates and Braves fans. Acuña singled to drive in the tying run with one out in the 10th inning, then stole second base for his historic 70th before scoring the winning run on Ozzie Albies’ walk-off single.

“I’d be lying if I said to you that I thought I was going to get this done, that I was going to be able to do it,” Acuña said of reaching 40-70. “It was one of those numbers that wasn’t impossible, but seemed impossible. So, thankfully we were able to get it done.”

After prying the base from the ground and raising it overhead to the roar of a crowd of more than 37,000 at Truist Park, then handing the base to two officials who came out to collect it for posterity, Acuña raced home from second base on Albies’ single to right field. If Acuña hadn’t stolen second, he wouldn’t have been able to score on that sharp single.

In the eighth inning, Acuña singled, stole his 69th base and scored on an Albies single to tie the score 3-3. The Cubs, fighting for a wild-card postseason berth, scored a run in the ninth, but Marcell Ozuna’s ninth-inning homer tied the score again and forced extra innings.

Acuña became the fifth member of the hallowed 40-40 club — at least 40 homers and 40 stolen bases in a season — Friday when he hit his 40th homer in a win at Washington. That homer also made him the charter member of two new clubs, the 40-50 and 40-60, since none of the previous four players in the 40-40 club had more than 46 stolen bases in a season.

Now, Acuña has added 40-70 to his staggering list of accomplishments in a season that Albies and Ozuna both said late Wednesday should assure Acuña wins the National League MVP award. Acuña is hitting .336 with 41 homers and 104 RBIs from the leadoff spot, leads the majors in both stolen bases and runs (146), and leads the NL with a 1.010 OPS.
