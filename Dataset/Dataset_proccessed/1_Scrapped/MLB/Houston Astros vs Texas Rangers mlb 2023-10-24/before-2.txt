Texas had four home runs in Game 7, starting with Corey Seager's first at-bat in the 1st inning. Adolis Garcia contributed 2 homers, one in the 3rd, and another in the 8th. Nathaniel Lowe managed another home run in the 6th.

Evan Carter and Adolis Garcia followed Seager's home run with runs of their own.

Lowe's homer against Bryan Abreu in the sixth inning made the score 10-2 with two runners on base.

Adolis Garcia set a post-season record for RBIs with his 14th in the ALCS, passing Nelson Cruz for the most RBI in a single postseason.

For the series, García won ALCS MVP honors after going 10 for 28 (.357) with five home runs and an absurd 15 RBI in the seven games.

This will be the team's first World Series appearance since 2011.  

Bruce Bochy, who came out of retirement this season to manage the Rangers, became the first skipper to win a League Championship Series with three different teams, previously leading San Diego and San Francisco to NL pennants.  

After winning their Lone Star State showdown with Houston, the wild-card Rangers open the World Series at home Friday night against Arizona or Philadelphia, who play the decisive Game 7 of their NLCS on Tuesday night.  

Individual tickets for 2023 World Series games at Globe Life Field go on sale Tuesday at 10 a.m.  

Rangers fans celebrate!
