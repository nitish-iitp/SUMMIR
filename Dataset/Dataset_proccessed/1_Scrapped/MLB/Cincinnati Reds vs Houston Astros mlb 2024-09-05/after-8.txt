Houston has now lost eight in a row to the Cincinnati Reds.

If I had to pick one team that “had our number,” I would probably select a team from the National League. Seeing as how we only play three games a year against most of them, I guess Cincinnati is as good as any. Maybe we can watch our boys break the curse of Queen City tonight.
