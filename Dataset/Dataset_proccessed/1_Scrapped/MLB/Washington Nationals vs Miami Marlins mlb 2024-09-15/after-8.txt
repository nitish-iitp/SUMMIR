The Washington Nationals got a good start from Patrick Corbin to get the win yesterday in a 4-1 victory. The Nats have now taken 2-of-3 in this four game series with the hopes of securing this series win today against the Marlins.

The Nats need to go 5-9 or better to beat their 2023 win total. How great would that be to finish in the mid-70’s for a win total? After today’s game with the Marlins, the Nats will only face teams in competition for the postseason.

The Nats are deep favorites today, at -185 to win on the moneyline. That means if you bet $185 you would win $100. Bet $18.50 and you win $10.00.

Nats’ manager Dave Martinez had to cover 3.0 innings from the bullpen yesterday and had to use Kyle Finnegan for the second day in a row and 3-of-4 days now. Robert Garcia and Derek Law covered the other two innings to help seal the victory as the bullpen threw another shutout.

This is what the Nats schedule looks like going forward, and the plan is to get Trevor Williams back into the rotation and finish the final week-and-a-half of the season with a 6-man rotation:

Sunday: MacKenzie Gore vs. Marlins
Monday: Jake Irvin vs. Mets
Tuesday: Mitchell Parker vs. Mets
Wednesday: DJ Herz vs. Mets
Thursday: Patrick Corbin vs. Cubs
Friday: Gore vs. Cubs
Saturday: Irvin vs. Cubs
Sunday: Parker vs. Cubs
Monday: Day-off September 23
Tuesday: Herz vs. Royals
Wednesday: Corbin vs. Royals
Thursday: Gore vs. Royals
Friday: Irvin vs. Phillies
Saturday: Parker vs. Phillies
Sunday: Herz vs. Phillies (Final Game of the Season)

Your top Washington Nationals on the FanGraphs’ WAR leaderboard has Luis Garcia Jr. at a WAR of +2.9, and Jacob Young at +2.8. CJ Abrams is at +1.6 WAR. There are 29 Nats’ players in positive WAR with another 8 at 0.0 including Keibert Ruiz who has worked his way back from -0.8 just last month.

“It was really nice. The guys hit some homers today, which was awesome.”


— Nats’ manager Dave Martinez said after yesterday’s game
