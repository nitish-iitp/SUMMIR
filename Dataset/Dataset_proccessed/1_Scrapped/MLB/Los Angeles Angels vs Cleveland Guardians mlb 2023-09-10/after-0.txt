Cleveland Guardians vs. Los Angeles Angels 9/10/23 MLB Analysis, Prediction, and Odds
Cleveland Guardians (68-74) vs. Los Angeles Angels (65-77)

Cleveland Guardians vs. Los Angeles Angels 9/10/23 – The Cleveland Guardians (68-74) are set to square off against the Los Angeles Angels (65-77) on September 10, 2023, at 4:07 PM ET in Angel Stadium of Anaheim. With both teams struggling to maintain a winning record this season, this matchup offers a chance for each to turn their fortunes around. Although both squads are out of playoff contention, pride and roster spots for next year are on the line, making this an interesting encounter to watch and wager on.

 

The Cleveland Guardians are currently standing at 68-74 and are not living up to their pre-season expectations. They hold a batting average of 0.249 and have scored 576 runs off of 1205 hits. Their power game is a bit lacking with just 106 home runs. The on-base percentage of 0.312 suggests some plate discipline, but not enough to make them dangerous. Their pitching staff, however, has been their strong suit with an ERA of 3.95 and a WHIP of 1.29. Their opponent batting average is a decent 0.245, thanks in part to a sturdy pitching rotation and bullpen.

 

The Los Angeles Angels, with a record of 65-77, find themselves in a similar situation. Their batting average mirrors Cleveland at 0.249, but they have managed to score more runs (663) and hit more home runs (202). Their on-base percentage is fairly strong at 0.323, suggesting they can get on base. However, their pitching has been their Achilles’ heel with an ERA of 4.73 and a WHIP of 1.43. With 555 walks given up and an opponent batting average of 0.254, their pitching staff needs significant improvement. For free consensus MLB picks, check out their upcoming games.

Tanner Bibee (10-3, 3.05 ERA) vs. Kenny Rosenberg (0-1, 5.54 ERA)

Cleveland is starting Tanner Bibee, who holds an impressive 10-3 record with a 3.05 ERA and a 1.23 WHIP across 129.2 innings pitched. He has allowed 115 hits, struck out 129 batters, and given up only 45 walks and 13 home runs. These stats indicate he’s having a solid year, with control and efficiency being his forte.

 

In contrast, Los Angeles is going with Kenny Rosenberg, who has a 0-1 record, 5.54 ERA, and 1.92 WHIP in just 13 innings pitched. He has given up 16 hits, struck out 11 batters, and walked 9. His lack of experience this season and high WHIP indicates high risk, especially when compared to the season Bibee is having.

 

If pitching wins games, then Cleveland has the upper hand going into this matchup, given Bibee’s strong performance throughout the season and Rosenberg’s relative lack of exposure and effectiveness.
