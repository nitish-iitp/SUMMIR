New York Mets vs Philadelphia Phillies Prediction 

These two teams have split the first two games in this series, but this game is way more important for the Mets than the Phillies. New York is 41-33 on the road, while Philadelphia is 51-26 at home. The Mets continue to battle for a wild card spot in the NL, but it is a very tight race with Atlanta, Arizona, and San Diego. Both of these starting pitchers have been great this season and I think we are going to see a lower scoring game, so give me the under in this matchup.
