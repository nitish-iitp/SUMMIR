Texas Championship Years Draft - Draft thread

Post#1 » by durantbird » Thu Sep 14, 2023 5:19 pm




Draft rules:

1. You will be required to draft a total of 8 players. Each of your players must play a minimum of 8 minutes in your rotations.

2. You may select any player in one of the following seasons (in which a Texas team won the NBA Championship): 1993-94, 1994-95, 1998-99, 2002-03, 2004-05, 2006-07, 2010-11, 2013-14.

3. Your team will be allowed a combined total of 88.0 FGA with a minimum of 3.0 FGA per player corresponding with the specific seasons indicated for each player. NOTE: You may pick a player whose actual FGA number was lower than 3.0, but you will still be charged 3.0 for that player.

4. Each player you select must have played at least 50% of regular season games in the season selected.

5. We will be doing a modified snake draft. It will go like this: ABBABABA

6. Players will get a maximum of a 2-hour window to make their selection when they are on the clock. If you still have not chosen a player by then, or if the player you have chosen is ineligible, you will be skipped. Also, if you know ahead of time that you won't be available to make your pick on the clock then please PM your selection to myself or another participant. NOTE: If you miss one pick and have failed to make it by the time your next pick comes around, you will be skipped.

7. The clock will be turned off between 12 midnight and 9 AM EDT.

8. Draft order will be completely randomized.

9. After you have made your draft selection, please quote and/or PM the person that goes after you so they will know that it is their turn and they are on the clock. You may not change your pick after it has been made, even if the next person in the order has not picked yet. Please note that the clock starts whenever the previous drafter has either made their pick or their two-hour window has expired, even if the next person is not quoted.

10. The winner of the draft will be determined by playoffs.

Team Roster Page Rules:

You will be responsible for creating a roster page for your fantasy team. Here are the things that you will be required to include on your roster page:

. Players
. Rotations
. Draft selections
. The most important of all, you must show the total FGA per player on your roster AND a total sum of each players FGA to display that it is under the required 88.0 FGA

-All of the above must be completed before playoffs begin.

The draft board is telling me to take someone
The Ness heart is telling me to take someone
But I’ll go with the Ness brain here…
