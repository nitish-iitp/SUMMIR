It’ll be Max Meyer in the starting role for the Marlins on Tuesday. So far Meyer is 3-4 with a 5.44 ERA in 10 starts. Over 12 career starts, Meyer is 3-5 with a 5.65 ERA.

Washington Nationals vs Miami Marlins Prediction

I’ll go Nationals here. Washington should get a nice start out of Corbin. In his last three starts, Corbin is 2-0 with three earned in 16.1 combined innings. As for Meyer, he’s been pretty shaky over his last three with 10 earned runs combined over 15.0 innings for an 0-2 record.

Washington didn’t play well at all versus the Cubs in their last series, however. The Nats gave up 26 runs across three games and scored just four themselves in the final two outings. Corbin should be able to do his part; it’ll be up to the bats and the pen after that.

Andrew’s Pick
Washington Nationals +102
