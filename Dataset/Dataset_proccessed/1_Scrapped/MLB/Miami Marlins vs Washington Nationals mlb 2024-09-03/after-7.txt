Game #138 Nats are in Miami for a 2-game series

The Washington Nationals had chances on Friday and Saturday night for walk-offs, and then were blown-out on Sunday. That happens, and with a day-off yesterday — the team is back at work today in Miami. These are the final 25 games of the 2024 season. A sprint to the finish.

There was a roster move made after Sunday’s game, and another one early yesterday. Orlando Ribalta was optioned to Triple-A Rochester on Sunday, and Derek Law was activated off of the 15-day IL early Monday morning. One other notable move on Monday was the promotion of another top prospect, Robert Hassell III, to Triple-A Rochester. At one time, Hassell was a Top-100 prospect until wrist injuries cause him to slide down the prospect charts.

Based on last year’s win total of 71-games, the Nats need to go 11-14 or better to beat that total. To beat the 66-win total from FanGraphs, the Nats need to win 6 more games. There are just 25-games remaining in the season. The team needs to win 2 more games to avoid triple-digit losses.

The Nats are slight underdogs today, at +105 to win on the moneyline. That means if you bet $100 you would win $105. Bet $10.00 and you win $10.50.

Nats’ manager Dave Martinez had Monday’s day-off as a rest day for everyone. With Law back, and a 9-man bullpen, the Nats have a deep bullpen with another day-off on Monday. Kyle Finnegan sat again and he is obviously fresh.

This is what the Nats schedule looks like going forward:

Tuesday: Patrick Corbin vs. Marlins
Wednesday: MacKenzie Gore vs. Marlins
Thursday: Jake Irvin vs. Pirates
Friday: DJ Herz vs. Pirates
Saturday: Mitchell Parker vs. Pirates
Sunday: Corbin vs. Pirates
Monday: Day-off September 9
Tuesday: Gore vs. Atlanta
Wednesday: Irvin vs. Atlanta

Your top Washington Nationals on the FanGraphs’ WAR leaderboard has Luis Garcia Jr. atop of the WAR rankings at +2.9, Jacob Young at +2.7 and CJ Abrams at +1.8. In total, 28 Nats’ players are in positive WAR and another seven are at a neutral 0.0 WAR.

“We’re going to pound the same message: We’ve got to catch the baseball. It was awful today. I can’t say nothing about it. Our defense was not there.”

“I thought [Mitchell Parker] threw the ball really well. We’ve got to play defense behind him. You can’t drive in runs — and let in three or four more runs. You’ve got to catch the baseball. Defense is a big part of the game. I say that all the time. We’ve got to catch the ball.”

— Nats’ manager Dave Martinez said after Sunday’s game

The Nats starting pitchers have a combined ERA of 4.43 and 22nd in MLB.

Here is how they rank:

No. 5 Starter: Patrick Corbin 5.50
No. 4 Starter: MacKenzie Gore 4.45
No. 3 Starter: Mitchell Parker 4.27
No. 2 Starter: DJ Herz 4.09
No. 1 Starter: Jake Irvin 4.08
