Dominic Canzone is making Ohio State Baseball fans extremely proud of his recent MLB success.

The Cleveland native starred for the Buckeyes from 2017-2019 before being drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks. Canzone made his major league debut earlier this year for the club that drafted him, but was sent to the Seattle Mariners during a trade deadline deal.

The move opened up more playing time for him, and Canzone has made the most of it, especially on defense. Thursday night against the Tampa Bay Rays, the left fielder made a highlight reel catch, running into the wall, falling into the stands and holding on for the out. Watch for yourself below.

Although Canzone has struggled at the plate, hitting just .231 on the season, he’s making much more of an impact than the stats would show.
