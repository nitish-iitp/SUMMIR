PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES
Bryce Harper, Phillies Offense Disappoint MLB Fans as Diamondbacks Force NLCS Game 7

The Philadelphia Phillies have been unstoppable at home throughout the 2023 playoffs.

Until the World Series was one win away.

Despite going 6-0 with an average of 6.5 runs per game in the first six postseason contests at Citizens Bank Park this year, the Phillies never bounced back from an early deficit on the way to a lackluster 5-1 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks in Monday's Game 6 of the National League Championship Series.

That means Philadelphia will have to win Tuesday's decisive Game 7, also at home, if it is going to reach the World Series for a second straight year.

The disappointing showing from a typically dominant offense with stars such as Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber was the biggest storyline from the Phillies' perspective, and social media had plenty of reaction:

The way the Phillies are approaching the plate, they are looking at game 7. If they lose, it isn't on Nola. It's on the absolute lack of discipline from the offense.

This Phillies offense needs to wake up.

Stating the obvious. <br><br>This performance is simply not good enough by anyone on the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Phillies?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Phillies</a>. <br><br>4 and 5 hitters are hindering the offense. Too many runners left on base. Nola doesn't have it.

What a disaster of a game for the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Phillies?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Phillies</a> offense.

I don't care who you've got pitching. You can't expect to win scoring just 1 run. Phillies offense better wake the hell up for Game 7, or else they've blown a fantastic opportunity. The fans have given their all...

Unfortunately, all phillies fans knew this was a possibility. This offense relies too much on the long ball and often did so without runners on base.

So at what point do the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Phillies?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Phillies</a> realize they're not owed another trip to the WS, there's no excuse for the approach from our offense. I know everyone will blame pitching, but the collective effort is pretty pathetic

Philadelphia's offense wasn't dialed in, but Arizona's was against starter Aaron Nola.

Back-to-back home runs from Tommy Pham and Lourdes Gurriel Jr., as well as an RBI double from Evan Longoria, gave the Diamondbacks a 3-0 lead in the second inning. Even when the home team answered back with a run on an RBI single from Brandon Marsh, Arizona was ready with a response.

Ketel Marte, in particular, was ready, as his RBI triple in the fifth chased Nola from the game before his RBI single in the seventh provided some important insurance.

That was enough for the Arizona pitching staff, as starter Merrill Kelly allowed just one run and three hits while striking out eight in five innings. The bullpen combination of Ryan Thompson, Andrew Saalfrank, Kevin Ginkel and Paul Sewald did the work from there, moving the Diamondbacks one win away from their first World Series appearance since 2001.

Arizona's Merrill Kelly has been an absolute maestro tonight. Punched out Kyle Schwarber and Bryce Harper on curveballs in the fifth. He has thrown all six of his pitches to tremendous effect. The breakdown:<br><br>Four-seamer: 25<br>Sinker: 21<br>Changeup: 14<br>Slider: 11<br>Cutter: 11<br>Curve: 8

Philadelphia's offense has consistently delivered with clutch hits, especially at home, throughout the playoffs, but that was missing Monday. The Diamondbacks limited their rallies and prevented the raucous crowd from taking over like it has in the past.

If they can do that again Tuesday, they will be in the Fall Classic.
