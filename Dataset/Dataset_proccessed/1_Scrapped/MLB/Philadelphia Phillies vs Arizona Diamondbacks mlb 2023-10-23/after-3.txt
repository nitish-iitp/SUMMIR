The Arizona Diamondbacks and Philadelphia Phillies play Game 7 of the NL Championship Series on Tuesday night for a World Series berth against the Texas Rangers.

Texas routed the Houston Astros 11-4 in Game 7 of the ALCS on Monday night as Adolis García homered twice and drove in five runs.

The wild-card Rangers are assured home-field advantage in the World Series starting Friday night following an ALCS in which the visiting team won all seven games. Texas is 8-0 on the road in the postseason, matching the 1996 New York Yankees for the most road wins without a loss.

“I think that the team, they’re just good at focusing or we’re good at focusing on the little things,” said García, the ALCS MVP. “We try to look at what we need to do, little things, to get that win or to just be successful. I think that’s really been key for us for having that success on the road, as well.”

Tommy Pham and Lourdes Gurriel Jr. hit back-to-back homers and Merrill Kelly struck out eight before an early five-inning hook to help Arizona force Game 7 with a 5-1 win at Philadelphia on Monday.

Two-time NL MVP Bryce Harper was at the forefront of another cold NLCS outing for Phillies hitters, and Aaron Nola got rocked on the mound.

Rookie right-hander Brandon Pfaadt takes a 2.13 postseason ERA to the mound for Arizona after striking out 15 and walking one in 12 2/3 innings over three playoff outings. Left-hander Ranger Suárez starts for the Phillies after going 1-0 with a 0.64 ERA in 14 innings this postseason. He has struck out 13 and walked two.

“I’m expecting some fun,” Kelly said. “Game 7, obviously, they talk about, it’s the best words in sports. I think the fact that we’re here, I don’t think anybody thought we were going to take them to Game 6. I don’t think anybody thought we were even going to make it to Game 1. I don’t think anybody thought we were going to make it past Milwaukee, to be honest with you.”

BETTING FAVORITES

The Rangers are the current betting favorites to win the World Series at -136, followed by the Phillies (+215) and Diamondbacks (+450), according to FanDuel Sportsbook.

NO REPEAT

Texas, one of six big league teams without a World Series title, reached the Fall Classic for the first time since consecutive trips in 2010 and 2011.

Houston’s loss ensured the major leagues remain without a repeat champion since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees.

“This is a tough sport, a tough game. It’s a marathon,” said Dusty Baker, who managed the Astros to the 2022 title. “Nobody stays on top in this sport very long, and the Astros have been on top for quite a while.”

LEADING THE WAY

García homered for the fourth straight game and set a record for RBIs in a postseason series with 15. He had four hits and scored three times.

García’s 20 RBIs are one shy of the postseason record set by David Freese, whose 2011 St. Louis Cardinals beat the Rangers in a seven-game World Series.

“He’s a bad man, isn’t he?” shortstop Corey Seager said. “To be able to come into this atmosphere and get booed every at-bat and do what we did was really special. It was really fun to watch.”

IMPRESSIVE COMPANY

Bochy is trying for his fourth World Series title after winning with San Francisco in 2010, 2012 and 2014. Four championships would tie Walter Alston and Joe Torre for fourth-most behind Joe McCarthy and Casey Stengel (seven each) and Connie Mack (five).

Bochy is tied at three with John McGraw, Miler Huggins, Sparky Anderson and Tony La Russa.

Every other manager with three or more is in the Hall of Fame.

HOW TO WATCH

TBS is broadcasting the NLCS. Fox will carry the World Series.
