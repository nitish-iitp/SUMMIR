SEATTLE — The Yankees were mad at themselves all winter for a rare playoff miss last season.

With Juan Soto around this season to team with Aaron Judge, the Yankees became the first American League club to earn a postseason berth Wednesday night with their 2-1, 10-inning win in Seattle.

“We’re excited,” Yankees captain Aaron Judge said. “We definitely know the job’s not finished and we’re hunting this division. To get an opportunity to punch our ticket back in the postseason after last year missing out means a lot.”

The Yankees’ AL East lead over the slumping Orioles is up to a season-high five games. The Giants won 6-3 in Baltimore on Wednesday to fhand the O’s an eighth loss in 10 games.

Earlier in the day, the Brewers were the first to get in, as they clinched a third NL Central title in four years with the second-place Cubs losing 5-3 to the Athletics at Wrigley Field.

The Brewers made their clinching celebration better by beating the visiting Phillies 2-1 in 10 innings on a bases-loaded, walk-off hit by Jake Bauers.
