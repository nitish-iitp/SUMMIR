Meet The Gorgeous Olivia Peet Who Recently Made Her Appearance At Ryder Cup With her Boyfriend, Ludvig Aberg
Posted on September 29, 2023 by Alexa Connes

With the support of his stunning new girlfriend, Ludvig hopes to transform from a Ryder Cup rookie into a hero for Europe.

This month, the Swede won the Omega European Masters in Switzerland, earning his first DP World Tour victory.

He was also selected by Luke Donald for the European Ryder Cup team as a result of his strong performances prior to that.

At the Marco Simone Golf & Country Club, which is located outside of Rome, the 44th Ryder Cup began today. The competition pits the best golfers against one another.

Aberg has, however, already made waves this week and caused a stir.

On Wednesday at the Ryder Cup Gala in Rome, he was seen for the first time in public with his girlfriend Olivia Peet.

The two are thought to have crossed paths at Texas Tech in the United States, where they were both studying.

Peet, who was among the top 10 players in the UK by national ranking, was born in Manchester, England.

After that, she reportedly won 73 singles matches and 71 doubles matches while attending Texas Tech.

Peet has appeared on the Texas Women’s Tennis and Texas Tech Red Raiders social media channels during the past year. Peet went on to achieve a career-best ranking of 115 in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Rankings.

Peet and Alberg were spotted walking hand in hand on the renowned Spanish Steps two nights ago. Peet’s father Chtis is a former professional tennis player who now trains up-and-coming players.

They were then seen walking out together once more yesterday for the Ryder Cup Opening Ceremony.

It won’t take long before we spot her among the 4,700 spectators who will be visiting Macro Simone Golf and Country Club this weekend.
