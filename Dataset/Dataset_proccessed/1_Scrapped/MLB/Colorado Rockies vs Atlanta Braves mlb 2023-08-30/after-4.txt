Jump to the 2023 Topps Cosmic Chrome Baseball checklist, team set lists and odds.

2023 Topps Cosmic Chrome Baseball reaches for the stars a second time. Like its 2022 debut, there are plenty of over-the-top, space-inspired designs and celestial-inspired parallels to go along with them. Think of it as Topps Chrome meets 1997 Metal Universe Baseball.

While collectors can expect to find several inserts and a sprinkling of parallels in every hobby box, autographs are not a guarantee. They’re on the checklist but they’re not easy pulls.

2023 Topps Cosmic Chrome Baseball Checklist Overview

The 200-card base set is inspired by space, with plenty of neon and bright colors to go with it.

Ten levels of parallels add even more flair. Although color-based, titles dig further into the product’s overall space theme:

Refractors – 1:10 packs
Nucleus Refractors – 1:15 packs
Aqua Equinox Refractors – /199
Blue Moon Refractors – /99
Green Space Dust Refractors – /75
Gold Interstellar Refractors – /50
Orange Galactic Refractors – /25
Black Eclipse Refractors – /10
Red Flare Refractors – /5
Superfractors – 1/1
Autographs and Other Inserts

Cosmic Chrome Autographs are the main source of signatures in the product. They’re rooted in the base design. Base versions are 1:173 packs, which works out to more than 1:8 hobby boxes.

Parallels add to the overall quantity but they’re not the easiest cards to find, either:

Green Space Dust Refractors – /75
Gold Interstellar Refractors – /50
Orange Galactic Refractors – /25
Black Eclipse Refractors – /10
Red Flare Refractors – /5
Superfractors – 1/1

Star Clusters (1:4 packs), which have three players from the same team, is one of the insert sets that should be fairly easy to find. Extraterrestrial Talent (1:5 packs), Launched Into Orbit (1:10 packs) and Stars in the Night (1:20 packs) should also both be represented in every hobby box.

All four have Black Eclipse Refractors (/10), Red Flare Refractors (/5) and Superfractors (1/1). Extraterrestrial Talent, Launched Into Orbit and Star Cluster also get the Gold Interstellar Refractors (/50) and Orange Galactic Refractor (/25) treatment.

Select cards for Extraterrestrial Talent and Launched Into Orbit have autographs, too.

Planetary Pursuit is a new addition to the 2023 Topps Cosmic Chrome Baseball checklist. Rather than colors, versions for these are based on planets in our solar system. The further you move away from the sun, the tougher that type is. Base Sun versions are still pretty tricky finds at 1:120 packs.

These aren’t the product’s only short print inserts. There’s also the die-cut Stella Nova (1:240 packs) and Supernova (1:387 packs).

Tacofractors, which debut in 2023 Topps Chrome Baseball, get another serving here. They’re still numbered to 5.

Is it true topps screwed up the production numbers and swapped the Venus and Uranus odds?

Stars In The Night cards are horribly centered across the board. Top-bottom, left-right. Beautiful cards. Terrible quality control.
