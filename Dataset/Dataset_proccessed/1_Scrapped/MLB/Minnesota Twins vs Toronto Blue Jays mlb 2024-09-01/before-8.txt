Our Twins vs Blue Jays best bets are based on complex simulations and gambling expertise to bring you the best possible advice 24/7/365.

While the Twins have a higher chance of winning the game, betting on the Blue Jays to win is our preferred option because of the 2.3% edge identified when comparing our data-led probabilities to the odds currently available.

Making use of the edges seen here at Stats Insider is one of the keys to being a profitable bettor in the long run.

Furthermore, despite the Over being more likely to hit in this game, Under 8.5 is our best bet because of the better odds ($1.91) that are available from TAB.
