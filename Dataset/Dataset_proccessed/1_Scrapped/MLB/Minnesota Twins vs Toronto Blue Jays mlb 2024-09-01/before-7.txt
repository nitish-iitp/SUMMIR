$7.5 million club option exercised
The Orioles exercised O'Hearn's $7.5 million club option for 2025 on Monday, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports.
Impact O'Hearn made $3.5 million in 2024, so he will be getting a nice salary bump in 2025. The 31-year-old has slashed .275/.329/.450 with 29 home runs over 254 regular-season games during his two years in Baltimore. He'll garner regular playing time against right-handed pitching again next season.

Sitting vs. lefty in Game 1
O'Hearn is out of the lineup for Game 1 of the American League Wild Card Series against the Royals on Tuesday, Roch Kubatko of MASNSports.com reports.
Impact The 31-year-old finished the regular season on a tear as he hit .382 with three doubles and two homers over the final 11 games, but he'll begin the playoffs on the bench with southpaw Cole Ragans taking the mound for Kansas City. O'Hearn is a strong candidate to appear as a pinch hitter and should be back in the lineup for Game 2 against Royals righty Seth Lugo.

Homers in back-to-back games
O'Hearn went 2-for-5 with a two-run home run in Saturday's 9-2 win over the Twins.
Impact O'Hearn has homered in back-to-back games after going 25 contests without a long ball. The slugger set a career high with his 15th homer of the year. He's added a .261/.330/.424 slash line, 59 RBI, 58 runs scored and three stolen bases over 141 games this year as a strong-side platoon option at first base, designated hitter and the corner outfield spots.

Ends power drought Friday
O'Hearn went 1-for-3 with a two-run home run in Friday's 7-2 win over the Twins.
Impact He took Pablo Lopez deep in the second inning, giving the Orioles a lead they wouldn't relinquish as they went on to clinch a wild-card spot with the victory. O'Hearn snapped a 25-game homer drought with the blast, and he's slashing a tepid .214/.267/.329 through 22 contests in September. Despite the slump, his 14 home runs on the season ties his career high, and O'Hearn has two games left on the regular-season schedule to try and set a new high-water mark.
