Sony is hosting a September State of Play showcase with a look at more than 20 upcoming PS5 games and PS VR 2 games. The showcase will run for approximately 30 minutes, so don’t expect too many in-depth looks at anything in particular. While rumors are flying around about everything from Resident Evil 9, to the rumored Horizon Zero Dawn remaster, to games we already know about, such as Monster Hunter Wilds, Sony didn’t mention much about what they have up their sleeves.

We've listed the September 2024 State of Play times below, along with where you can watch and a bit about what to expect from the latest PlayStation showcase.

The September State of Play airs on September 24, 2024, and, as mentioned, will run for approximately 30 minutes. Sony put a plus sign after “30” in the announcement, so it could run a little longer. 

The September State of Play begins at 6 p.m. Eastern, and for everywhere else, that looks like:

3 p.m. Pacific
5 p.m. Central
11 p.m. BST

What to expect from the September 2024 State of Play

Sony’s release slate for the rest of 2024 and into 2025 is a bit sparse at the moment, so what’s in store for the State of Play is anyone’s guess. The possibilities range from the industry’s worst-kept secrets – Final Fantasy 9 Remake, for example – to rumored remakes, such as Horizon Zero Dawn. Speaking of Dawn, Until Dawn is probably going to make an appearance, what with its release date coming up so quickly, and we’ll likely get a reminder that God of War Ragnarok is on PC now.

There are plenty of other possibilities, from Guerrilla’s rumored Horizon multiplayer game to Death Stranding 2. Some have suggested Resident Evil 9 may even show up, with Halloween just a few weeks away. Seeing as Capcom has another big-name game in the works, though, it seems pretty unlikely they’ll start promoting another one at the same time.

Steelers' George Pickens makes interesting move…

Pittsburgh Steelers star wide receiver George Pickens started the 2024 NFL season in dominant fashion, showcasing his ability to take over games and solidify his role as the team’s top playmaker. However, his momentum was derailed by a nagging hamstring injury that sidelined him for three games. Upon returning to the lineup, Pickens found himself underutilized, leaving him visibly frustrated as the Steelers struggled to close out the regular season on a high note. The frustration reached a boiling point during last Saturday’s matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals, where Pickens endured one of the worst performances of his career. Targeted six times, he managed only a single catch for zero yards, a stat line that shocked fans and analysts alike. The low point came late in the game when Russell Wilson missed a wide-open Pickens on a potential game-winning play, a misstep that underscored the lack of chemistry between the two in that game. Adding to the intrigue, ESPN’s Brooke Pryor reported that Pickens is now dodging media interviews ahead of the Steelers' critical playoff showdown against the Baltimore Ravens. Whether his silence signals a brewing storm or a focus on redemption, it has only added to the swirling speculation about his mindset and the team’s ability to bounce back. All eyes are on Pickens as the Steelers prepare for one of their most pivotal games of the season. This move by Pickens is likely a strategic one. The Pittsburgh media has often been harsh on the star wide receiver, rarely giving him the benefit of the doubt, even as he continues to produce in an offensive scheme that fails to cater to his strengths. Despite the Steelers’ offensive struggles, Pickens has remained one of the few bright spots. While his frustrations are usually valid, some fans believe he could express them in a more mature manner. Before the Bengals game, Pickens was asked a question that could have sparked tension between him and Wilson. Rather than risk his words being misconstrued, Pickens wisely chose not to answer. This measured response reflects a deliberate effort to avoid unnecessary drama, showing growth in how he handles pressure situations. This week, Pickens seems committed to maintaining his focus and avoiding any distractions as the Steelers prepare for their playoff matchup. By staying silent and locked in, he’s prioritizing the team’s success over external noise, a move that could prove crucial as they face the Ravens. Steelers fans can critique Pickens all they want, but fairness is essential. At just 23 years old, Pickens is widely regarded as one of the most talented offensive players in the league. Yet, he’s like a Lamborghini stuck in a used car dealership — an analogy that perfectly captures how underutilized he’s been during his first three seasons in Pittsburgh. Despite the limitations, Pickens has still managed to deliver big moments for the offense when it mattered most. If the Steelers hope to upset the Ravens in their playoff matchup, they’ll need a standout performance from Pickens. His absence was felt during their 34-17 loss to Baltimore earlier this season, where the offense struggled to find rhythm. A strong game from Pickens could be the key to defying the odds and pulling off a monumental upset against their division rival.

Mark Davis' decision to fire GM raises questions about Raiders' future

Days after the Las Vegas Raiders fired head coach Antonio Pierce, the team decided Thursday to part ways with general manager Tom Telesco after one season. Is that a surprise? For many, yes. Telesco's job was deemed safe, but Raiders owner Mark Davis didn't see it that way. The team released a statement thanking Telesco for his short contributions, including drafting tight end Brock Bowers, who had a monster season for the 4-13 Raiders. "We appreciate his efforts in helping build a foundation for the future. We wish Tom and his family all the best," the statement read. Telesco did help build a foundation in the short term by adding Bowers with the 13th overall pick. The 2024 NFL Draft for the Raiders also drafted guard Jackson Powers-Johnson (second round) and tackle DJ Glaze (third round), who could bring stability to the offensive line for several years. Both showed promise this season. The rest of the draft class remains in question, but Telesco hit a home run in the selection of Bowers, who set numerous rookie records this season. So, why rid of Telesco, who has an apparent knack for NFL Drafts? There is no clear reason the team did so, but Davis made a mistake just like he did with hiring Pierce as the permanent head coach until firing him this week. It's no wonder he is seeking input from minority owner Tom Brady on the franchise's direction. Davis' decision-making has not gone well since he became the owner after his father, Al Davis, died in 2011. Since Davis took over, the Raiders have only made it to the playoffs twice (in 2014 and 2021). He has not retained a head coach for more than three seasons. It's been a disaster for Las Vegas since Davis took over. His only hope is that Brady's winning ways will rub off on the Raiders. Until then, the blame will continue to fall on Davis.

Georgia QB's change of plans sends shockwaves through college…

In a move that shocked the college football world Thursday, Georgia quarterback Carson Beck has decided to enter the transfer portal instead of going into the NFL Draft. Beck announced his intention to declare for the draft Dec. 28 and has now gone back on that decision and entered the portal. The move comes just a week after Georgia was knocked out of the College Football Playoff by Notre Dame. Beck was injured on the last play of the first half in the SEC Championship game against Texas. He suffered a torn UCL in his right elbow and was forced to miss the CFP. The fifth-year senior has spent all five seasons of his career at Georgia and was the backup behind Stetson Bennett on back-to-back national championship teams. Beck has thrown for 7,912 yards and 58 touchdowns and rushed for 245 yards and five touchdowns during his college career. Beck looked like one of the best quarterbacks in the country at certain points during the season, including a masterful game against Tennessee. Many thought the decision to enter the NFL Draft was wrong, and based off Beck's sudden change of heart, he must have known that he would not have been a high pick. As reported by ESPN's Pete Thamel, Miami is the favorite to land Beck. With Riley Leonard departing Notre Dame after this season, the Irish are another team that will need a quarterback. Texas Tech and Ohio State are the other schools to watch for in the Beck sweepstakes. Ohio State will need a quarterback after Will Howard (presumably) declares for the draft. Texas Tech is a sleeper team that has the advantage of alum Patrick Mahomes, perhaps an influence in Beck's decision. At the end of the day, the decision comes down to what Beck thinks is best for his career and what school and coaching staff will ultimately help him develop for the 2026 NFL Draft.

Utah head coach praises big trade by Kent Hughes and the…

Head coach of the Utah hockey team, André Tourigny, was recently interviewed by Martin Lemay on BPM Sports. He discussed the latest trade by Kent Hughes and the Montreal Canadiens, and in his opinion, there is no doubt. It's another big trade successfully executed by Kent Hughes and Jeff Gorton. Tourigny is unequivocal: A Solid Trade for Kent Hughes and the Montreal Canadiens with Alexandre Carrier When asked about this acquisition, Utah's head coach, André Tourigny, mentioned that he immediately knew it would be a massive addition for the Canadiens. 'When the Carrier trade happened, I thought it was a massive acquisition for the Canadiens.' André Tourigny, on BPM Sports And the Quebecois defenseman didn't take long to prove him right. The impact of Alexandre Carrier on the Canadiens' success has been immediate and impressive. The Canadiens' record with Laine and Carrier is worthy of a championship team. Alexandre Carrier, 28 years old, a right-handed defenseman standing 5 foot 11 and weighing 174 pounds, has accumulated five points in nine games this season with the Canadiens (with a +/- of 0). He is emerging as a potential long-term replacement for the highly reliable and useful David Savard, in case of a trade or departure via free agency this summer. Do you believe that with these recent additions, the Montreal Canadiens will actually be able to stay in the NHL playoff race until the end? Considering the team's recent success, it's hard not to believe.
