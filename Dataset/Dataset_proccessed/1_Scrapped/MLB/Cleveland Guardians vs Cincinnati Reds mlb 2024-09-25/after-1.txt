'Cincinnati is in Kentucky': Guardians take shot at Queen City after win over Reds
Jason Hoffman, Cincinnati Enquirer
Wed, Sep 25, 2024·1 min read

(This story was updated because an earlier version included an inaccuracy.)

The Cleveland Guardians clinched a first-round bye in the playoffs Tuesday with a win over the Cincinnati Reds, and they didn't miss the opportunity to take a jab at the Queen City.

"Cincinnati is in Kentucky" was edited on to shirts depicting Guardians players celebrating after their 6-1 win over the Reds Tuesday night, and posted on X to the team's official page. The photos were altered versions of when the Guardians clinched their division on Thursday. Tuesday night's win guaranteed Cleveland avoided the wild-card round by virtue of being a top-two division winner in the American League.

The Reds played their first game after former manager David Bell was fired and Freddie Benavides was named as interim manager. A search for a new manager began Monday, after a press conference with Nick Krall, Reds president of baseball operations.
