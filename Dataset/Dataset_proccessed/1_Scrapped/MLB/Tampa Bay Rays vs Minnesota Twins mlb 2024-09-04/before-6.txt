Minnesota Twins vs Tampa Bay Rays Prediction 

Minnesota dropped game two in this series on Tuesday night, but they continue to hold a Wild Card spot in the AL. The Twins are 36-33 on the road this year, while the Rays are 36-37 at home. Tampa Bay’s pitching staff has been pretty strong this season, but their offense is one of the lowest-scoring in the MLB. It looks like both teams will be going with some version of a bullpen game here, but I have to give the edge to the better-hitting team. Take the Twins here.
