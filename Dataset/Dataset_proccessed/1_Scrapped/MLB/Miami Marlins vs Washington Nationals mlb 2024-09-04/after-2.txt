Game #139 Nats go for the sweep

The Washington Nationals took care of business last night in Miami and will now try to secure a 2-game sweep in this quick series. After tonight’s game, the Nationals will fly through the night to Pittsburgh. This is a sad situation with Marlins management as they have not been accommodating the Nationals and other teams with an early get away game on weekday games.

Based on last year’s win total of 71-games, the Nats need to go 10-14 or better to beat that total. To exceed the 66-win total from FanGraphs, the Nats need to win 5 more games. There are just 24-games remaining in the season. The team needs to win 1 more games to avoid triple-digit losses.

The Nats are favorites today, at -150 to win on the moneyline. That means if you bet $150 you would win $100. Bet $15.00 and you win $10.00.

Nats’ manager Dave Martinez had Monday’s day-off as a rest day for everyone. With Derek Law back, he got a 15-pitch inning last night. Kyle Finnegan warmed up but was not used when the Nats stretched the lead to 4-runs.

This is what the Nats schedule looks like going forward:

Wednesday: MacKenzie Gore vs. Marlins
Thursday: Jake Irvin vs. Pirates
Friday: DJ Herz vs. Pirates
Saturday: Mitchell Parker vs. Pirates
Sunday: Patrick Corbin vs. Pirates
Monday: Day-off September 9
Tuesday: Gore vs. Atlanta
Wednesday: Irvin vs. Atlanta

Your top Washington Nationals on the FanGraphs’ WAR leaderboard has Jacob Young at +3.0 to lead the team. Luis Garcia Jr. is next with a WAR of +2.8, and CJ Abrams has sunk all the way back to +1.6. In total, 28 Nats’ players are in positive WAR and another eight are at a neutral 0.0 WAR.

“The bottom of the order was really good. … We played well, and turned a big double-play. Patrick Corbin was really good again, so that was awesome to see. And then the bullpen came in and shut it down. We played good baseball.”

— Nats’ manager Dave Martinez said after yesterday’s game

The Nats starting pitchers have a combined ERA of 4.42 and 22nd in MLB.

Here is how they rank:

No. 5 Starter: Patrick Corbin 5.41
No. 4 Starter: MacKenzie Gore 4.45
No. 3 Starter: Mitchell Parker 4.27
No. 2 Starter: DJ Herz 4.09
No. 1 Starter: Jake Irvin 4.08
