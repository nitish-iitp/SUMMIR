MLB fans made sure to pile on the San Diego Padres as the team flamed out of the 2024 NLDS against the Los Angeles Dodgers.

The Padres were shut out by the Dodgers 2-0 in Game 5 of their series held at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, Calif.

With their season on the line, the Padres mustered just two hits against Dodgers starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto. After San Diego’s lone scoring threat in the 3rd was wiped out by an inning-ending double play, the visitors failed to get a single man on base the rest of the way.

Fans on X clowned the Padres for their lackluster showing, which came on the heels of the team’s 8-0 loss in Game 4.

The Padres wasted a gem of an outing from starter Yu Darvish. The veteran right-hander gave up just three hits and two earned runs across 6.2 innings pitched. San Diego failed to score a single run over the last 24 innings of the series.

The Dodgers-Padres series started off as a fiery affair with both teams trading big hits and pointed barbs over the first three games. But the Dodgers dominated over the last two contests to punch their ticket to the NLCS against the New York Mets.
