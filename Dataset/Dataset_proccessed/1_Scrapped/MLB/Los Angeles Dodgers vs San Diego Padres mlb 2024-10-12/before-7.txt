After writing an article labeling the Padres as agitators, Ken Rosenthal stayed on the Dodgers’ dugout side and only interviewed Dodgers during NLDS Game 3, per Barstool’s RDT.

Joe Davis announcing the Padres Dodgers playoffs games is the most one sided commentary. Do better FoxSports #MLB

The entire FS1 announcers could not get enough Dodger talk in. It was so biased. They had a countdown graphic for when Ohtani would be at bat. They didn’t do that for any other player on the Dodgers or the Padres. They kept showing Freddy Freeman even though he wasn’t playing last night. It was a Dodger love fest for those announcers & camera people. 🤦🏼‍♀️

Him interviewing Dave after that inning was actually top tier comedy 😭

Dodgers fan here. I’d just like to say Rosenthal is a joke. Judging by the way he called Machado’s throw “sinister” I can only assume Pee Wee Herman 2.0 would be ecstatic to land 9 feet short of home plate if he were to attempt a pitch.

This is a whole narrative created by MLB, because ManFRAUD wants a NY/LA World Series, and he KNOWS that teams like San Diego are interfering with that.

CORRECTION: After writing an article labeling the Padres as agitators, Ken Rosenthal had to stay on the Dodgers’ dugout side because the Padres don’t want him their dugout no more.

AND HES ACCURATE. Even though I don’t condone Dodger fans throwing things and trash to the players, (because we’re not all like that) the Padres players were extra trolling us and agitating the fans further. What kind of players in baseball fight with fans like that?!

The padres are asshats for sure, but to suggest they are on a level with scumbag cheaters from Huston is way over the top.

It’s actually because we have a height requirement to enter our dugout and short stack wasn’t tall enough 🙊

Michael Kopech and the Dodgers have settled at $5.2 million to avoid arbitration for the 2025 season.
Kopech was a major pickup for LA at the trade deadline, LET’S GO 😈

The Dodgers are reportedly putting their 2025 international signees on hold & seeing if they’re willing to sign in 2026 instead, per 
@TheBeatwriter
This could mean they’re looking to invest ALL of their international money into Roki Sasaki 👀
