The GIST: The American League (AL) and National League (NL) Division Series keep on swinging with one team already punching their Championship Series ticket and another potential upset sweep around the corner. Brooms at the ready.

(AL) Texas Rangers dust the Baltimore Orioles: The Rangers sure did take things higher last night, sweeping the Os with a dominant 7–1 home Game 3 win. The tough Texas offense posted 21 runs across their three games and now they have plenty of time to rest up before their first AL Championship Series since 2011.

(AL) Houston Astros homer their way to series lead: The reigning champs blasted off for four dingers — including two from first baseman José Abreu — in yesterday’s 9–1 win over the Minnesota Twins, meaning a Houston victory tonight at 7:07 p.m. ET would send them to their seventh straight AL Championship Series. Sheesh.

(NL) Atlanta Braves & Philadelphia Phillies head to the City of Brotherly Love: Billed as the best (and feistiest) Division Series matchup, this tied up NL East clash hasn’t disappointed. The Phils faithful will be out in full force for today’s 5:07 p.m. ET Game 3 and ready to cheer on hurler Aaron Nola as he takes on the best offense in baseball.

(NL) Arizona Diamondbacks swinging for sweep of juggernaut LA Dodgers: Led by stellar pitching, the Snakes (leading 2-0) are one win away from handing the Dodgers another disappointing playoff exit and clinching their first Championship Series appearance since 2007. Plus, they’ll have the home crowd hissing their support in tonight’s 9:07 p.m. ET Game 3.
