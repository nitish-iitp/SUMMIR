A key piece of Bruce Bochy’s coaching staff will reportedly remain with the Texas Rangers after their postseason run.

According to Jon Morosi of MLB Network, Rangers associate manager Will Venable was contacted by clubs with managerial openings. He told the teams that he would stay in Texas.

Venable, 40, joined Bochy’s coaching staff in Nov. 2022. He had a previous connection with Rangers general manager Chris Young — Venable and Young were schoolmates at Princeton and later teammates with the San Diego Padres.

Before landing with Bochy in Texas, Venable spent two seasons with the Boston Red Sox as their bench coach. He was also on the Chicago Cubs’ staff from 2018 to 2020.

As a player, Venable spent nine years in the majors as an outfielder. He spent 37 games with the Rangers in 2015, where he recorded a .182 batting average, a .552 OPS and three RBIs.
