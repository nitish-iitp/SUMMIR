Photos: San Francisco Giants Brandon Crawford receives multiple ovations from fans during last game of the season
Crawford goes 0-4 in Giants 5-2 loss to Los Angeles Dodgers

Today’s game may have been San Francisco Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford’s farewell not only to his team, but to professional baseball.

“The main thing will be if I want to come back and play baseball next year,” Crawford, 36, said of his looming decision. “There were a lot of parts I didn’t enjoy, unfortunately. But that’s baseball. You fail a lot in this game. Failing isn’t very fun. That’s probably partially why I haven’t made a decision yet. This year is far from how I pictured it going, whether it was going on the IL or just not playing well. Not kind of how I pictured to go out. So that’s definitely a factor.”

Crawford said he will consult with his family, who have accompanied him all the way, starting with his wife, Jalynne, ever since they met at UCLA. Their first-born, Braylyn, arrived two years into Crawford’s career. The nest has since grown to four, with a fifth on the way. All four kids threw ceremonial first pitches, with their dad crouched behind home plate.

Born in Mountain View and raised in Menlo Park and Pleasanton, the Foothill High School graduate received multiple ovations from fans, but loudest and longest was saved for the final time, when he was removed from the game before the top of the ninth inning. Crawford hugged interim manager Kai Correa and each of his fellow infielders, tipped his cap to the fans and was greeted by a procession of hugs upon entering the dugout.

“That was the time where I almost got a little emotional,” Crawford said. “I held it back. I was just trying to take it in and appreciate all the fans and cheers and all that.”

Staff reporter Evan Webeck contributed to this report.
