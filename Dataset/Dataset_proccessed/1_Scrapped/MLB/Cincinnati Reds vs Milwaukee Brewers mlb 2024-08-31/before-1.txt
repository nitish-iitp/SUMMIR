INJURIES
Shifted to 60-day injured list
The Reds transferred Williamson (elbow) to the 60-day injured list Tuesday.
Impact The transaction clears a spot on the 40-man roster for Ian Gibaut, who was activated from the 60-day IL. Williamson is set to undergo Tommy John surgery which is likely to sideline him until 2026.

Requires Tommy John surgery
Williamson said Wednesday that he has a full UCL tear in his left elbow and will require Tommy John surgery, Mark Sheldon of MLB.com reports.
Impact Williamson's comments came shortly after the Reds placed him on the 15-day injured list earlier Wednesday. The southpaw had been on the shelf for most of the season due to a shoulder problem, but he avoided surgery and was cleared to make his 2024 debut for the Reds on Sept. 1 after making just one rehab start. He produced a 3.77 ERA, 1.05 WHIP and 12:5 K:BB across 14.1 innings in four starts with the Reds before he ultimately strained his elbow in Tuesday's 6-5 win over Atlanta. A date for Williamson's elbow surgery hasn't been set, but he'll miss the entire 2025 season while he embarks on an arduous rehab process.

Done for season with strained elbow
The Reds placed Williamson on the 15-day injured list Wednesday with a left elbow strain.
Impact Williamson was forced to depart Tuesday's outing against Atlanta because of the injury, and it has now officially ended his season. The left-hander also missed much of the campaign with a Bennett lesion in his left shoulder, ultimately opting to treat that injury with injections rather than surgery. It's not clear at this point whether an offseason operation for either injury might be on the table.

Diagnosed with elbow strain
Williamson left Tuesday's game against Atlanta with a left elbow strain, Charlie Goldsmith of The Cincinnati Enquirer reports.
Impact Williamson suffered the injury after throwing a pitch in the second inning of Tuesday's contest and had to be taken out of the game immediately afterward. The Reds haven't specified the severity of his injury, but if the team elects to place the left-hander back on the injured list, his season would be put to an early end after making just four starts.

Exits with trainer
Williamson was removed from his start Tuesday against Atlanta with an apparent injury, Gordon Wittenmyer of The Cincinnati Enquirer reports.
Impact Williamson appeared to be grabbing at his left elbow after making a pitch in the second inning of Tuesday's contest. The specifics of his injury won't be known until the Reds are able to take a closer look at him, but the 26-year-old southpaw may be at risk of missing even more time after sitting out the first five months of the season due to a shoulder issue.

Gives up one run to Cardinals
Williamson allowed one run on three hits and two walks while striking out five over five innings in a no-decision versus the Cardinals on Wednesday.
Impact Williamson completed five innings for the first time in his three appearances (two starts) since he returned from a shoulder injury that cost him five months to begin the year. He's been good so far, allowing four runs (three earned) over 13 innings while posting an 11:3 K:BB. The lone mistake on his line Wednesday was a solo home run by Nolan Arenado. Williamson is tentatively projected to make his next appearance at home versus Atlanta.

Allows one run in bulk role
Williamson did not factor into the decision Friday, allowing one run on one hit and one walk over 4.2 innings against the Mets. He struck out one.
Impact The Cincinnati southpaw relieved opener Fernando Cruz in the second frame and fired 60 pitches in this performance. Williamson pitched into the sixth inning before being relieved by Buck Farmer, who allowed an inherited runner to score. Williamson has now made two appearances since returning from a shoulder injury that sidelined him all season, pitching to a 3.38 ERA, 0.75 WHIP and 6:1 K:BB across eight innings. He currently lines up to make his next outing against the Cardinals in St. Louis, but it is unknown whether he will start our serve as the bulk reliever again.

Fans five in season debut
Williamson did not factor into the decision in Sunday's win over Milwaukee, allowing two earned runs on four hits and zero walks while striking out five in 3.1 innings.
Impact Working his way back from a shoulder injury that sidelined most of the season, Williamson made his 2024 debut Sunday after just one rehab start in the minors. The 26-year-old impressed early on, retiring the first seven batters he faced including a strong second inning where he struck out the side. Williamson slowed down as the game progressed, allowing a sacrifice fly in the third and a solo home run to Willy Adames in the fourth before departing after 66 pitches. Williamson displayed impressive control Sunday, throwing 44 of his 66 pitches for strikes en route to a flawless 5:0 K:BB. The southpaw started 23 games for Cincinnati as a rookie last season, going 5-5 with a 4.46 ERA, 1.28 WHIP and 98:39 K:BB in 117 innings.

Activated ahead of start
The Reds reinstated Williamson (shoulder) from the 60-day injured list ahead of his scheduled start Sunday versus the Brewers.
Impact Despite having been on the IL all season and having just restarted his minor-league rehab assignment Tuesday, Williamson will get the green light to rejoin the Cincinnati rotation with the roster expanding to 28 men Sunday. After tossing 2.2 scoreless innings and 50 pitches in his rehab start with Triple-A Louisville, Williamson will almost surely be in store for a limited workload Sunday and may not reach the five innings he would need to qualify for a win. Jakob Junis made a four-inning start Tuesday and could end up piggybacking Williamson if the Reds want to go that route.

Set to return Sunday
Williamson (shoulder) will be activated from the 60-day injured list and start in Sunday's game against the Brewers, Charlie Goldsmith of The Cincinnati Enquirer reports.
Impact Williamson began the regular season on the 15-day injured list due to a left shoulder injury. He started a rehab assignment in May after being transferred to the 60-day IL, but he was shut down from that program and was faced with season-ending surgery to remove a Bennett lesion in his left shoulder. Williamson opted for injections instead, and after resuming his throwing program after the All-Star break, he progressed to a rehab start with Triple-A Louisville on Tuesday, during which he threw 50 pitches over 2.2 scoreless innings. 2023 was Williamson's first season in the majors, and across 23 starts, he posted a 5-5 record with a 4.46 ERA, 1.28 WHIP and 98:39 K:BB over 117 innings.

Set to return Sunday
Williamson (shoulder) will be activated from the 60-day injured list to start in Sunday's game against the Brewers, Charlie Goldsmith of The Cincinnati Enquirer reports.
Impact Williamson has been on the shelf all season after suffered a shoulder injury in spring training. He began a rehab assignment in May, but he was pulled off of it in early June after being diagnosed with a Bennett lesion in his left shoulder. Williamson opted to treat the injury with injections rather than season-ending surgery, and after a lengthy shutdown period, he finally resumed his rehab assignment with Triple-A Louisville on Tuesday, tossing 50 pitches over 2.2 scoreless innings. The Reds apparently saw enough from Williamson in that outing to bring him back from the IL, but he's still expected to be operated on a limited pitch count as he toes the rubber for the big club for the first time Sunday. Williamson could need two outings before he's fully stretched out to handle a typical starter's workload. As a rookie with Cincinnati in 2023, Williamson posted a 5-5 record with a 4.46 ERA, 1.28 WHIP and 98:39 K:BB over 117 innings.

Shines in short rehab start
Williamson (shoulder) struck out four and gave up one hit and one walk over 2.2 scoreless innings in his rehab start Tuesday for Triple-A Louisville.
Impact After making four rehab starts in May and June, Williamson was pulled off his minor-league assignment when he experienced a setback with his shoulder. He was then diagnosed with a Bennett lesion in his shoulder, but rather than opting for season-ending surgery to address the issue, he instead received injections to treat the injury. Williamson seems to be responding well more than two months later, and he took a major step forward in the recovery process by restarting his rehab assignment Tuesday. He tossed 50 pitches (26 strikes) in the rehab outing for Louisville, generating seven swings and misses along the way. Williamson will likely continue to build up over at least two more rehab outings before he becomes a realistic option for the Cincinnati rotation.

Scheduled for rehab start
Williamson (shoulder) is scheduled to start for Triple-A Louisville on Tuesday, C. Trent Rosecrans of The Athletic reports.
Impact Williamson, who threw two innings at the Reds' complex in Arizona last Thursday, is scheduled for three innings Tuesday in what will be the first rehab appearance of his second rehab assignment. The left-hander opened the season on the injured list and was pulled off an earlier rehab assignment in June.

Closing in on rehab assignment
Williamson (shoulder) is expected to begin a rehab assignment next week, Charlie Goldsmith of the Cincinnati Enquirer reports.
Impact Williamson initially went on the injured list before Opening Day because of a left shoulder strain, but he was later diagnosed with a Bennett lesion in his shoulder in June. The southpaw was given multiple injections in the shoulder and has been ramping things back up to the point that he's nearly game-ready again. Williamson could join the Reds by September, perhaps in a relief role.

Slated for July 23 bullpen session
Williamson (shoulder) will throw a bullpen session July 23, Charlie Goldsmith of The Cincinnati Enquirer reports.
Impact It will be Williamson's first time throwing off a mound since he received injections last month to combat a lesion in his left shoulder. The left-hander is hoping to be ready to pitch for the Reds in September, but he'll have many hoops to jump through still to make that happen.

Reaches fourth inning in rehab start
Williamson (shoulder) struck out four and allowed one earned run on five hits and one walk over 3.2 innings Sunday in his rehab start with Triple-A Louisville.
Impact Sunday's outing was Williamson's first with Louisville but the second overall of his rehab assignment, which he began with High-A Dayton on May 14. Williamson, who has been on the shelf all season with a left shoulder strain, is eligible for activation next week, but he'll likely need at least another rehab start or two to get fully stretched out for a traditional starting role. With Nick Lodolo (groin) tentatively in line to return from the 15-day injured list Monday to bring the Cincinnati rotation back to full strength, Williamson may have to settle for a bullpen role once activated, if the Reds don't elect to option him to Louisville to remain on a starter's schedule.

Out until late May
Reds manager David Bell said Wednesday that Williamson (shoulder) will likely be sidelined until late May, Charlie Goldsmith of The Cincinnati Enquirer reports.
Impact Williamson has been on the shelf since mid-March with a left shoulder strain and it's unclear whether he has begun a throwing program. The southpaw had been in contention for a spot in the Reds' rotation before the injury and could be under consideration again, but he'll need to get healthy first.

Shifts to injured list
The Reds placed Williamson (shoulder) on the 15-day injured list Wednesday.
Impact The left-hander exited his March 17 start with shoulder soreness and won't be available to begin the regular season. Williamson was expected to be shut down from throwing for a few days, but it's unclear where he currently stands in his recovery. Andrew Abbott is rounding out Cincinnati's rotation, at least until Nick Lodolo (lower leg) is ready.

Bound for injured list
Williamson (shoulder) will begin the season on the injured list, Charlie Goldsmith of The Cincinnati Enquirer reports.
Impact Williamson left Sunday's game against Cleveland early due to shoulder soreness, and his injury is apparently severe enough to cause him to miss the first few weeks of the regular season. Manager David Bell said Tuesday that Williamson will be shut down from throwing for a couple of days, and there is no timetable currently in place for his return. With Williamson out, Andrew Abbott will fill the final spot in the Reds' Opening Day rotation.

Competing for rotation spot
Reds manager David Bell said Monday that Williamson (shoulder) is competing with Andrew Abbott for the fifth spot in the rotation, C. Trent Rosecrans of The Athletic reports.
Impact Bell also added that Williamson is feeling better after having to exit an appearance Sunday with a sore left shoulder, although it's not clear when he might be cleared to pitch again. Whoever wins the fifth spot out of Williamson or Abbott might just be keeping the seat warm for Nick Lodolo (lower leg), who could be back by April 10.

Improves to 5-5
Williamson (5-5) allowed two runs on five hits and two walks over six innings Friday, striking out two and earning a win over St. Louis.
Impact Williamson cruised to an easy win with 14 runs of support before he left the contest. It was his longest outing since Aug. 29 and first win since Aug. 7. The 25-year-old lefty will end his rookie campaign with a 4.46 ERA and a 98:39 K:BB through 117 frames. Williamson registered a 5.55 ERA over his final five starts.
