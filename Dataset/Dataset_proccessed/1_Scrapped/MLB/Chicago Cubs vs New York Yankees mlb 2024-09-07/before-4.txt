Stock Up: Mark Vientos - September 7, 2024
 

Mark Vientos (3B-NYM) had a productive game against the Reds on Friday as he went 3-5 with a pair of 2-run blasts. The 24 year-old is now batting .289 with 24 homers, 62 RBI, and 50 runs scored through 368 PA on the year, with a robust 151 wRC+. Vientos has posted an improved 27.5% strikeout rate so far this season (down from 30.5% last season) while drawing a few more walks (up to 7.5% from just 4.5%) and continuing to make lots of hard contact as Statcast shows a 46% hard-hit rate, 15% barrel rate, and average exit velo of 91 mph. There's plenty of thump in Vientos's bat, so an improved ability to make contact has significantly improved his fantasy stock.

Joey Bart (C-PIT) was activated from the 10-day IL on Friday after a minimum stay as he recovered from a mild hamstring issue. The Pirates' contest with the Nationals was rained out and will be made up as part of a doubleheader on Saturday, so Bart seems likely to see action in at least one half of that twin bill. The 27 year-old is in the midst of a post-hype breakout campaign of sorts, as he's hitting .272 with 12 dingers, 39 RBI, and 32 runs scored across 219 PA, with a wRC+ of 132. Bart's 25% strikeout rate isn't pretty, but it's a significant improvement on his 32.5% career clip and the 38.5% rate he logged in 291 PA back in 2022 (the only other time recorded more than 200 PA in an MLB season. With a career-high 75% contact rate, Bart has capitalized on a healthy Statcast profile that includes a 40.5% hard-hit rate and 11.5% barrel rate. He's a solid option for fantasy rosters down the stretch so long as he's healthy.

Sean Manaea (SP-NYM) had his recent run of success on the mound snapped by the Reds on Friday as he allowed 4 runs on 3 hits and 2 walks while fanning 9 over 6.2 IP. The 32 year-old lefty tossed 64 of his 97 offerings for strikes in the outing while the longball - two of them - did most of the damage against him. Manaea now owns a 3.43 ERA, 9.3 K/9, 3.2 BB/9, and 4.08 xFIP through 28 starts (157.1 IP) on the year. A .251 BABIP (.286 career) and 75.5% strand rate (72% career) seem to be suppressing his ERA a bit, but Manaea's Statcast profile is one of the best of his career (it includes a 38% hard-hit rate and average exit velo of 88.5 mph) while his 11.5% swinging-strike rate is in line with his career average (11.5%). Entering Friday's outing the southpaw hadn't surrendered more than 3 runs in an outing since July 19th while posting a 3.15 ERA, 9.6 K/9, 2.3 BB/9, and 3.81 xFIP in 54.1 IP since the All-Star break. He's slated to take on the Blue Jays in Toronto this week.

Luis Gil (SP-NYY) was sharp in his return from the IL (back) on Friday afternoon as he picked up a W against the Cubs. In doing so, he fired 6 shutout innings in which he scattered just 1 hit and a pair of walks while racking up 7 punchouts. The 26 year-old righty fired 54 of his 89 offerings for strikes in the outing. Gil now boasts a 3.24 ERA, 10.4 K/9, 4.7 BB/9, and 4.27 xFIP through 130.2 IP on the year. The gap between his ERA and xFIP points to a .235 BABIP and 8.3% HR/FB suppressing the former, although it's worth noting that Gil has not surrendered a lot of loud contact as Statcast shows a 36% hard-hit rate. Meanwhile, his control is poor while his 11.5% swinging-strike rate is solid but not spectacular. Gil's fantasy owners welcomed the strong performance on Friday as he had largely limped out of the All-Star break before going on the IL, posting a 4.43 ERA, 10.5 K/9, 6.9 BB/9, and 5.18 xFIP in 22.1 IP during that span. He lines up to face the Royals at home on Wednesday.

Luke Weaver (RP-NYY) picked up his first save of the season against the Cubs on Friday afternoon with a fairly uneventful 9th inning in which he walked one while allowing no runs and no hits while fanning a pair. The 31 year-old starter-turned-reliever has been effective - although not overpowering - as a setup man for the Yankees this season, posting a 3.28 ERA, 9.9 K/9, 2.9 BB/9, and 3.84 xFIP through 74 IP. He leads the team with 21 holds, so it was little surprising to see him get the call in the 9th just days after Yankees manager Aaron Boone noted that the club would be "creative" in save situations with Clay Holmes struggling to close out games. Weaver's 14% swinging-strike rate is solid, his 70.5% contact rate is nice, and he's largely kept the loud contact in check with a 37.5% hard-hit rate and average exit velocity of 88.5 mph per Statcast. It's not guaranteed that he'll be the club's primary closer from here on out, but he's clearly the favorite to see the most chances at the moment.

Adam Hodge (@arhodge013) is a lifelong baseball fan and has been playing fantasy baseball for twenty years. He learned that the game is a cruel mistress early on, as he drafted a young Adrian Beltre season after season before giving up on him just before he finally broke out in 2004. A true fantasy baseball junkie, he has won championships in a variety of formats, including rotisserie and head-to-head leagues that have had standard "snake" drafts as well as auction drafts. He lives in eastern Kansas with his wife and baby girl.
