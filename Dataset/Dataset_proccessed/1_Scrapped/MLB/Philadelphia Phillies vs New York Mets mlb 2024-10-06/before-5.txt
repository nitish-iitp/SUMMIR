How to Purchase Playoff Tickets

It’s no surprise that the Phils are a hot ticket right now. Season ticket holders had first dibs on tickets and individual ticket sales are not open to the public, so pickings are slim. The good news? You can sign up now for a lottery for a chance to purchase playoff tickets.

If you’re not among the few lucky lotto winners, your best bet is to keep an eye on trusted ticket resale sites like Ticketmaster, Seat Geek and StubHub.

Where can I watch the games?
Hoot and holler with fellow Phils fans at one of these bars with rowdy game day atmospheres...
Buffalo Billiards

While this Old City sports bar and billiards hall has long been a popular gathering spot for college football and NFL fans, the atmosphere proved to be just as electric during the 2022 and 2023 Phillies playoff run. Work out some of that nervous pregame energy by shooting pool, throwing darts or hopping on one of two regulation shuffleboards.

Where: Buffalo Billiards, 118 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA

Cavanaugh's

One of Philly’s most popular sports bars became even more popular after opening its newer Rittenhouse Square location, right before the Phillies began their three-year playoffs streak. Coincidence? We think not. The Sansom Street spot serves up classic bar favorites (think wings, burgers, and mac and cheese) and game-day drink specials. Not in Center City? Find other Cavanaugh’s locations in Headhouse Square and on the Delaware River waterfront.

Where: Cavanaugh's Rittenhouse, 1921 Sansom Street, Philadelphia, PA

Craft Hall

Enjoy a feast fit for the Fightins at this spot on the Delaware River waterfront. While the Phils dominate on the field and the game streams on several TVs and a 140-square-foot LED wall, team up with a few friends to tackle Jon’s Almost Famous BBQ Tower. This two-tier portal to the meat dimension features a choice of three meats, from brisket and jerk chicken to spare ribs and pulled pork shoulder; three sides, like macaroni and cheese, cornbread, and fries; and all the fixins (aka Texas toast, cole slaw and pickles). Let’s go!

There isn’t a bad seat in the house at South Street’s Founding Fathers Sports Bar & Grill, thanks to over a dozen TVs lining the walls. An expansive list of craft beers and a menu full of game day specials like sandwiches, wings and pizza add to the atmosphere. Last year, the spot opened a second location in Bensalem for Phils fans in the ’burbs.

Garage

“Cold beers right heres” is the slogan at this mechanic-themed bar, which boasts an impressive canned beer selection at locations in East Passyunk and Fishtown. You can add “cheers and jeers” to that tagline during Phils’ playoff games with tuned-in fans glued to every pitch on the nearly countless TVs lining several walls. Pro tip: You’re allowed to bring outside food into both locations, so grab a cheesesteak from Pat’s or Geno’s across the street in South Philly or from Joe’s in Fishtown before heading in to snag your lucky seat.

Where: Garage Passyunk, 1231 E. Passyunk Avenue, Philadelphia, PA

Plus, super-fans can purchase McGillin’s merch, like this year’s swanky Baseball, Beers & Brotherly Love T-shirts and sweatshirts.

A bar with eight drafts on tap and live sports all day every day completes the package.

Cheesesteaks

Success in the postseason is all about fundamentals. Don’t overthink it: Stick to the basics, and grab Philly’s most famous sandwich at one of the spots below, or check out our full guide to where to find the best cheesesteaks in Philadelphia:

Angelo’s Pizzeria South Philadelphia: Yes, the pizza is great, but this South Philly shop also serves up some of the best cheesesteaks around. Finely sliced steak, onions and gooey cheese (your choice of Whiz, cooper sharp, American or provolone) are piled high on a seeded Sarcone’s Bakery roll.
Pat’s King of Steaks: The original home of the cheesesteak, this spot’s claim to fame is that its founder, Pat Olivieri, invented the steak sandwich in 1930. Since then, Pat’s has grown from a little stand at the southern end of South Philly’s Italian Market to one of the most famous cheesesteak shops in the world.
Geno’s Steaks: It may be across the street from the oldest cheesesteak joint in town, but Geno’s Steaks is a formidable competitor, going roll-for-roll with Pat’s for decades and fueling friendly competition at the cheesesteak capital of the world. The key to success for the 24/7 spot? Quality thinly sliced rib-eye steak for maximum juiciness, the freshest of onions and house-made bread. Oh, and you can’t miss it, with neon lights beckoning curious travelers.
Tony & Nick’s: Every sandwich at Tony and Nick’s Steaks — formerly the original location of Tony Luke’s — is worth digging your teeth into. The restaurant — located next to an I-95 overpass on Oregon Avenue in South Philadelphia — is perfectly located for a stop on your way to tailgate.

Where: Angelo's Pizzeria, 736 S. 9th Street, Philadelphia, PA

Hoagies

The Phillies are on a roll. And so are these delicious Philly sandwiches that come piled high with meat, cheese and all all the fixin’s. You can’t go wrong with a game-day sandwich (or party tray) from these hoagie spots. Hungry for more? Check out our complete guide to where to find the best hoagies in Philadelphia.

PrimoHoagies: A shop originally from South Philly that’s grown immensely in recent years, PrimoHoagies has multiple locations across the Philadelphia region, offering one-off sandwiches and plenty of catering options. Phils fans can also enter for a chance to win playoff tickets by liking and sharing Primo posts on social media.
Cosmi’s Deli: Open since 1932, this tiny corner deli in South Philly churns out some of the best cheesesteaks, hoagies and roast pork sandwiches in Philadelphia. With more than a dozen hoagies on the menu, it can be tough to choose. Order a hoagie tray to sample them all.
Fink’s: Self-dubbed the “King of Gourmet Hoagies,” Fink’s offers its signature hoagie (helpfully named Fink’s Signature Hoagie) with two secret weapons: coteghino (fresh pork sausage) and a secret olive spread. The other gourmet hoagies, named for Northeast neighborhoods, similarly elevate traditional recipes with creative touches. The family-owned shop prides itself on offering affordable hoagie trays that can accommodate any party size.

Where: Multiple locations including PrimoHoagies, 1501 E. Susquehanna Avenue, Philadelphia, PA
