Congratulations to the Chicago White Sox. They have passed the 2003 Detroit Tigers and have set a new American League worse 120 losses in a single season.

The Chicago White Sox have lost their 120th game of the season. That ties the 1962 Mets for the most in modern baseball history.<br><br>On Tuesday, they'll face the Angels for a chance to hold history all to themselves.

White Sox just gave up 3 runs in the bottom of the 8th…this would tie the all-time losses by a team in a single season <a href="https://t.co/szWwZqz4sH">pic.twitter.com/szWwZqz4sH</a>

Well we knew it was a matter of time with this White Sox team, right? You didn't REALLY think they'd squeeze this win out did you?

The White Sox are playing in a playoff atmosphere trying to avoid their 120th loss. Love it.

It initially seemed as though the White Sox would avoid tying the record against the Padres, as they held a 2-1 lead through seven innings. San Diego struck in the bottom of the eighth, starting with a game-tying double by Luis Arráez.

Jurickson Profar's sacrifice fly gave the Padres the lead and a solo home run by Fernando Tatis Jr. put the team up by two runs.

Chicago started the 2024 season by losing 22 of its first 25 games. The White Sox didn't fare much better as the year progressed, tying an American League record by dropping 21 consecutive games from July 10 through Aug. 5. Manager Pedro Grifol was fired after the losing streak, getting replaced by Grady Sizemore.

The White Sox suffered their 100th defeat of the season on Aug. 25, becoming the third team in the modern era to reach the century mark in the loss column before the start of September. They were also eliminated from playoff contention on Aug. 17, the earliest mark in the wild card or divisional era.

Chicago will attempt to avoid setting a new single-season loss record as the team begins a three-game series with the Los Angeles Angels on Tuesday.
