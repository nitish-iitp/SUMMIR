SAN DIEGO — The White Sox will all but certainly go down as the worst baseball team of the modern era. The only question is, just how low will they set the bar?

With a game Sunday against the Padres, three against the Angels at home and three at the Tigers to close out the season next weekend, a handful of losses for a team that tied the American League record at 119 with a 6-2 loss to the Padres on Saturday is to be expected.

The 119 defeats are tied for the second-most by any team in the modern era. The 1962 Mets have the major-league record with 120, and the 2003 Tigers had held the AL record alone.
