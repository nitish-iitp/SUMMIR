Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman departed Los Angeles' Thursday game against the visiting San Diego Padres after he rolled his right ankle while trying to beat out a ground ball to second base. The Dodgers were in the midst of a five-run seventh inning to take a 5-2 lead when Freeman delivered a hard-hit grounder to the right side. Padres second baseman Jake Cronenworth made the stop and threw to first baseman Luis Arraez, but the throw pulled Arraez off the bag. Freeman twisted his body as he ran through the bag in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid the tag, then rolled the ankle and fell to the ground after the out was recorded. Los Angeles wound up winning 7-2 to clinch its 11th National League West title in 12 seasons. Freeman, who went 1-for-4, is batting .282 this season with 22 home runs and 89 RBIs. In 15 seasons, the eight-time All-Star and 2020 NL MVP is a career .300 hitter in 2,032 games with 343 home runs and 1,232 RBIs for the Atlanta Braves (2010-21) and the Dodgers. Freeman was replaced at first base in the eighth inning by Enrique Hernandez. --Field Level Media
