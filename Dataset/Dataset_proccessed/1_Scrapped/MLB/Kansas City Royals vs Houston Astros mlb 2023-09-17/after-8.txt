Framber Valdez (11-10, 3.32 ERA) vs. Jordan Lyles (4-16, 6.44 ERA)

 

Framber Valdez will take the mound for the Astros this time out and has posted an impressive 11-10 win-loss record this season, but don’t let his relatively balanced win/loss record fool you – his 3.32 ERA and WHIP of just 1.1 over 181.2 innings pitched are impressive numbers that speak to Valdez ability to keep runs off the board, get out of tight spots quickly, as well as his mental edge when facing pressure in late season and postseason games like this one. Valdez is known for his devastating curveball as well as an assortment of fastballs and changeups that make him effective against batters from both sides of the plate. This makes him an indispensable weapon for the Astros as he can adjust his approach depending on which lineups he faces.

 

On the opposite end of the spectrum is Jordan Lyles for the Royals, whose season has not been impressive. Boasting a 4-16 win-loss record and 6.44 ERA, Lyles’ stats demonstrate a pitcher who’s having difficulty finding his footing over 160.2 innings; giving up an alarming 164 hits with 36 homers allowed. On a more positive note, however, Luzardo boasts a somewhat respectable WHIP of 1.28 while striking out 107 batters.Lyles’ main struggle has been consistency. While he has shown glimpses of brilliance with fastballs that can touch the upper 90s and changeups that can deceive batters, he struggles with control issues that leave him vulnerable in high-leverage situations despite being a relatively inexperienced pitcher.

 

MLB Odds/Point Spread: Houston Astros -230, Total Odds: 9.5

 

The betting odds strongly favor the Astros with a spread of -1.5 at -159 and a Moneyline of -230. The Royals have a spread of +1.5 at +130 and a Moneyline of +206. The over/under for the game is set at 9.5.

 

Houston Astros Betting Trends Analysis

 

Houston’s recent form has been promising, especially in games against Kansas City. They are 7-3 straight-up (SU) in their last ten meetings. Furthermore, they are an exceptional 8-1 SU in their last nine games on the road, and 10-5 SU in their last 15 road games against Kansas City. Four of their last six games against an opponent in the American League and the American League Central Division have gone under the total.

 

Kansas City Royals Betting Trends Analysis

 

For the Royals, their home form has been a concern as they are 4-9 SU in their last 13 games at home. They also have a poor 6-13 SU record in their last 19 games. However, six of their last nine games against Houston have gone over the total, providing a glimpse of optimism in an otherwise dreary season.

 

Houston Astros vs. Kansas City Royals 9/17/23 Betting Picks

 

Considering all factors, including recent trends, team statistics, and starting pitchers, the safest bet appears to be on Houston. Valdez’ superior stats and experience make him a likely candidate to outpitch Lyles, who has been struggling throughout the season.

 

The Astros’ strong road form and the Royals’ struggles at home further tip the scales in favor of Houston. However, considering both teams have seen their games go under the total recently, betting the under on the total of 9.5 also seems like a good option.
