The Round Rock Express inducted pitcher Kirk Saarloos to their Hall of Fame on Friday, September 9, 2022, at Dell Diamond in Round Rock Texas.

Composed, Confident Express Prevail (April 24, 2026)

What a different team. 

Two weeks ago, I, as well as most fans, questioned the ability of this team.  Since the disappointing start to the season, in which the team lost the first three games, the team has gone on to assemble 13 wins against 3 losses.
