All hands on deck: Rangers add Matt Bush for final two games of season

SEATTLE — The Texas Rangers’ push to cross the finishing line in the playoff race has become an all hands — er, all arms — on deck effort.

For the third time in the final week of the season, the Rangers made a roster move to add help for the bullpen. On Saturday, it was a reunion with right-hander Matt Bush, whose contract was selected from Triple-A Round Rock. He replaces Jake Latz, who has been on a head-spinning transactional carousel all week.

Latz was optioned to Round Rock on Wednesday to make room for Josh Sborz then recalled on Friday to replace injured starter Jon Gray. Latz pitched two scoreless innings in Friday’s 8-0 loss to Seattle. He has pitched 6.1 shutout innings this month between all those transactions.

Bush replaces right-hander Alex Speas on the 40-man roster. Speas, who reached the big leagues for the first time earlier this season, was unlikely to remain on the 40-man roster through the winter due to a number of tough roster decisions. Speas, 25, can reach 100 mph with his fastball, but has struggled with command.

With the club uncertain on a starter for Sunday’s season finale and uncertain how long Andrew Heaney could go on Saturday, the Rangers decided to add another right-handed pitcher. Seattle’s lineup is heavy with right-handed threats.

Bush, 37, had spent all of his major league career with the Rangers before being traded to Milwaukee at the deadline last season. He struggled this year, compiling a 9.58 ERA through June and was released. The Rangers re-signed him to a minor league contract. He spent six weeks at Double-A Frisco before going to Triple-A Round Rock. He posted a 2.13 ERA with 16 strikeouts and one walk in 12.2 innings at Triple-A.

Evan has covered the Rangers since 1997. He has twice been named one of the top 10 beat writers in the country by the AP Sports Editors. His passions outside of covering baseball are his wife, Gina, his two step kids, two crazy dogs & barbecue. Let's not discuss the cat. Evan graduated from Georgia State University, but oddly is a Georgia fan.
