In this weekend's top matchup of highly ranked teams in college football, Ohio State defeated Notre Dame 17-14 in dramatic fashion. It was not the prettiest game, with both teams struggling to create any sort of offense, leading to a halftime score with three total points.

The scoring ramped up in the second half, though. Notre Dame held a four-point lead with Ohio State getting the ball back with 1:26 left in the game. Ohio State marched down the field to the one-yard line with seven seconds left. On the final play with three seconds left, Chip Trayanum plunged up the middle for the go-ahead and winning touchdown.

It all seemed normal, until everyone realized that Notre Dame only had 10 defenders on the field when the play happened. On that play, the Fighting Irish only had three defensive linemen with their hands on the ground, and Ohio State used it to their advantage by running right up the middle for the score.

To make matters worse, Notre Dame also only had 10 players on the field for the play before that. It didn't end up biting them then, but it eventually did.

Ryan Day calls out Lou Holtz

Once the game ended, Ohio State head coach Ryan Day was fired up. He specifically called out Lou Holtz, who had said some unsavory things about Ohio State and Day in the lead-up to the game.

"I'd like to know where Lou Holtz is now. What he said about our team... I cannot believe. This is a tough team right here. We're proud to be from Ohio. And it's always been Ohio against the world. It'll continue to be Ohio against the world."
