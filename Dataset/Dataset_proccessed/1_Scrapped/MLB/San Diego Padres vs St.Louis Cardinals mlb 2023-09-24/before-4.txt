NFL. NFL Week 3 Betting Odds: Chiefs and Cowboys expected to win big
NFL. Which legendary NFL coach could Andy Reid surpass with a win over Bears?

There was a time during the global pandemic when promoting vaccines was considered a public service, especially from athletes and celebrities. But division in the country over recent years has made this practice frowned upon by some. Now, most famous people who decide to support big pharma gets torched online instantly. Before this Saturday morning, Travis Kelce pretty much had all NFL fans in his pocket, especially amid his recent contact with Taylor Swift. But he recently appeared in a Pfizer commercial promoting vaccine boosters, which is rejected by a part of American society.

As expected, there is a part of the internet who didn't like Travis Kelce promoting vaccine boosters. A pro athlete using his platform to get people to vaccinate when the political climate is so divided at the moment can be risky. The move alienates a large part of the fans who are against a narrative that can be seen as serving big pharma wealthier than they already are.

Immediately, folks started pointing out how Travis Kelce is doing this promotion for the money without even thinking about the possible repercussions it may have on society. Travis' mother was also part of the commercial that promotes the new Pfizer booster, he showed off his two Super Bowl rings as part of the script that promotes these boosters. The backlash against both Travis Kelce and his mother was notable.

Travis Kelce's Instagram account reads: "With my schedule, saving time is key. The CDC says you can get this season's updated COVID-19 shot when you get your flu shot if you're due for both. That's why I got two shots in one stop! Ask your doctor or pharmacist if it would be right for you. You can also visit CDC's vaccines.gov to learn more and schedule an appointment. This video is for US residents only and is intended to be viewed as it was originally produced in partnership with Pfizer. The information provided is for educational purposes only and is not intended to replace discussions with a healthcare provider."
