Recalled from Triple-A
The Yankees recalled Misiewicz from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Sunday.
Impact Misiewicz was claimed off waivers from the Tigers in early July and will get his first major-league opportunity with New York after posting a 3.91 ERA and 30:12 K:BB in 25.1 innings of work for their Triple-A affiliate.

Claimed by Yankees
The Yankees claimed Misiewicz off waivers from the Tigers on Thursday and assigned him to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.
Impact After being designated for assignment by Detroit last week, Misiewicz will now join the Yankees' organization while remaining in Triple-A. The 28-year-old southpaw hasn't fared well in the majors or minors this season, but the slew of injuries within the Yankees' pitching staff could allow Misiewicz to join New York's bullpen at some point as a depth piece.

Outrighted to Toledo
The Tigers sent Misiewicz outright to Triple-A Toledo on Tuesday, Evan Woodbery of MLive.com reports.
Impact Misiewicz was DFA'd by Detroit on Thursday, and he'll officially remain within the Tigers' farm system after clearing waivers. The 28-year-old southpaw holds a 4.70 ERA and 1.50 WHIP through 15.1 frames in Triple-A and will most likely remain in the minors for the rest of the season.

Dropped from 40-man roster
Misiewicz was designated for assignment by the Tigers on Thursday.
Impact This move clears out a 40-man roster spot for Zach Logue, who is joining Detroit's bullpen ahead of Thursday's series finale against the Rangers. Misiewicz has allowed eight earned runs on 15 hits and three walks over 8.1 major-league innings this season between the Tigers and Diamondbacks.

Back in minors
The Tigers optioned Misiewicz to Triple-A Toledo on Wednesday.
Impact Misiewicz was called up from Triple-A on Tuesday and surrendered three runs over just 0.1 innings, inflating his ERA to 8.64 through 8.1 frames. Garrett Hill was recalled from Toledo to replace Misiewicz in Detroit's bullpen.

Called up Tuesday
Misiewicz was called up from Triple-A Toledo on Tuesday.
Impact Misiewicz will join Detroit's major-league roster after the team claimed him off waivers from Arizona on June 18. The left-hander had struggled to a 5.63 ERA and 1.75 WHIP with six strikeouts over eight innings in seven appearances with the Diamondbacks before being designated for assignment June 12, but he'll look to turn it around with the Tigers.
