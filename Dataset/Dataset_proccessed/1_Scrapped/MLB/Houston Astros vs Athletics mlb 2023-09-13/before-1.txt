Since they switched to the ugly, boring uniforms in 2019, the majority of Baylor's success has come when they wear 1 color head to toe; either full pickle (all green), full mustard (all yellow), or stormtrooper (all white).
Here's the breakdown:

Full Pickle : 13-5 (.722)
Full Mustard : 3-1 (.750)
Stormtrooper : 3-1 (.750)
All other combos : 12-15 (.444)

How about going back to green (kelly) and gold at home. There could be several combos and all white with green numerals and gold helmet when we go on the road. Sure they're throwback but pickle and mustard are gross. I doubt seriously if we've lost a recruit because of our traditional color combinations.

This uniform debacle has been bizarre. We look more and more ridiculous each year. More evidence of the school "Doing the Opposite" from Briles years, including winning.

Sugar Bowl win over Ole Miss was green helmet, white jersey, green pants.

I'm not sure if you want to look at the record books for Kelly green and gold, if you are one to believe that uniform colors impact results whatsoever (which I don't).

Nope, just thought these were interesting results so far with these Jovan Overstreet/Tcu influenced uniforms.


That's all.

I don't believe that it impacts results either, I just feel like the combos we currently use are not reflective of our stated school colors and makes us look stupid. It seems like we are getting what Oregon said no too.

What did Nike actually bring to the actual design elements of the uniforms other than adding their logo to it? I guess the crappy number font.

Due to the 6:30 PM abc kickoff on 9/23 I would like to announce that it very well may, in fact, be time.

How about all August/September home games we wear white and put the visitors in the dark colors that absorb more heat?

Some of those games will always kick off between 11 and 3.

I don't hate the uniforms in and of themselves. But I was hoping they would grow on me. They haven't.

The thing that I do hate about them is that they don't look like Baylor football uniforms.

We may not have the long-time traditions of a Penn State, Notre Dame, or Alabama, but there have been a few commonalities that distinguish Baylor football uniforms:

1. Metallic gold helmets. We had them at least as far back as the 1940s, maybe even before that. We switched to white during the Bill Beale era -- he wasn't just a bad coach, he screwed up the uniform. After he was gone we returned to the metallic gold. In the early 2000s, an alternate green appeared, later white resurfaced, but these were alternates. I never cared for them, but I recognized that others did, and that they were not the norm, just alternates.

We later introduced the mirror-finish chrome helmets, which were another variant of the traditional metallic gold with a flashy augmentation. Of course we had the black and grey so we could have more combinations and keep up with the fashions of the day. But Baylor football was always associated with the metallic gold, either shiny or sparkly.

There have been many shades of the metallic gold helmets, some with no stripes, some with different kinds of stripes-- solid, green with a white outline, white with a green outline...I can't remember the variations; they were little more than curiosities to me.

Anyway, given that we don't have that many football traditions, we should at least cling to the few we have and go back to metallic gold helmets as the primary helmet.

2. Interlocking BU on the helmet. This doesn't go back quite as far, but it's been there since the 1960s. I seen to remember a time or two that it wasn't on the helmet, and my memory is a bit fuzzy on this. It seems like one time the decals didn't work, or change in late, or something like that. Another time I seen to remember a coach saying they couldn't wear the BU until they earned them.

If course, recently, there have been some alternate "sailor bear" helmets.

At any rate, the standard helmet for Baylor has an interlocking BU on it.

3. Green jerseys for home games. There have been numerous variations of the green jersey, different shades, with and without the school name, with and without the player names, various other decorations like bear paws and accents and piping. If course alternates have flourished in the last 20 years, but a green home jersey is the standard.

So if we want a uniform that people will look at and say, "that looks like Baylor," it needs to have a metallic gold helmet with an interlocking BU, with a green jersey (for home).

That's about it. We've had different pant colors over the years, with and without stripes. Shoe preferences change with the wind. I have personal preferences on all the uniform stuff we but that doesn't matter as much as getting something that people will recognize as Baylor, then it's OK to dress up the uniforms with alternates and variations.

After our history of alleged assaults, I'm not sure that we really need full pickle extension.

The only thing missing from your requirements is a metallic gold helmet.

green jersey - check
metallic gold helmet - no
BU on helmet - check

I'm a little slow sometimes...

You are correct, we currently have two of the three.

Watching the Jets game tonight I much prefer their shade of green. Do we ever wear that shade anymore?

Please, just do something exciting! The uniforms should excite the players, full stop. We aren't a blue blood so we should embrace trends. This is why Briles was so good for Baylor, he understood that given our poor 20 year run before him we should embrace cool. Aranda should have demanded after the Sugar Bowl to redo the uniforms with his identity. But he didn't care, which might be part of the problem. All "sacred cows" should be on the table to help sell the Baylor brand to a new generation… BU logo, Bear logo, sailor bear. One good thing about having variety is you could do it all. And the players usually like mixing it up.

Just make them well designed and classy. They don't have to be blingy or flashy. The Sears & Roebuck 1970 wishbook generic kids uniform look in green and yellow doesn't work.

Or "captain's" "voluntary" weights 4am Sunday after a loss? And then film. Followed by weights, "voluntary" of course.

Make the uniform look cooler by winning.
