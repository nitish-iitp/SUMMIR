Milwaukee Brewers' Freddy Peralta Joins Exclusive List By Zooming to 200 Strikeouts /
In this story:
Milwaukee Brewers

Right-handed pitcher Freddy Peralta has joined an exclusive list of Milwaukee Brewers hurlers.

Peralta recorded nine strikeouts Tuesday against the Miami Marlins, allowing just one earned run in 6.1 innings of work. The 27-year-old from the Dominican Republic got credit for the win, which gave the Brewers a 4.0-game lead atop of the NL Central.

The last strikeout Peralta tossed Tuesday got him to 200 on the season through 28 starts.

According to TSN's StatsCentre, Peralta is now tied for the fourth-fewest number of games to reach 200 strikeouts in a season in Brewers franchise history.

Corbin Burnes needed 25 games to hit the mark in 2021, then 27 games in 2022. Ben Sheets was the previous record-holder, needing 27 games to toss 200 strikeouts in 2004.

Zack Greinke, like Peralta, also threw his 200th strikeout in his 28 appearance in 2011. Teddy Higuera and Brandon Woodruff took 29 games to reach 200 strikeouts in 1987 and 2021, respectively.

Peralta has always been great at inducing strikeouts, but a lack of volume had prevented him from reaching 200 prior to 2023.

From 2018 to 2020, Peralta averaged 12.1 strikeouts per nine innings, but he was only used as a part-time starter.

Peralta broke out in 2021, making his first career All-Star Game, but he finished the season with 195 strikeouts. Although he posted a 2.81 ERA, 0.970 WHIP and 12.2 strikeouts per nine innings, Peralta only pitched 144.1 innings.

In 2022, Peralta made just 17 starts, pitching 78.0 innings after spending most of the summer on the 60-day injured list with a lat strain.

Peralta has tossed a career-high 156.2 innings pitched so far in 2023, with as many as three starts remaining in the regular season. Peralta is 12-8 with a 3.79 ERA, 1.098 WHIP and 11.5 strikeouts per nine innings this year.

Through six major league seasons, Peralta has yet to post a losing record. He is 42-25 with a 3.81 ERA, 1.120 WHIP and 11.6 strikeouts per nine innings since debuting with the Brewers in 2018.

Milwaukee will look to secure the series win against the Marlins on Wednesday, with game three scheduled to start at 7:40 p.m. ET. Peralta's next start will likely come against either the Washington Nationals or St. Louis Cardinals early next week.
