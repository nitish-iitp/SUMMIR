Rays finish with losing record after dropping season finale to Red Sox
This marks the first time since 2017 that the Rays complete a season under .500 and the first since 2016 that they finish lower than third in the AL East.

BOSTON — A season packed with disappointments for the Rays ended with another on Sunday thanks to a 3-1 loss to the Red Sox.

With a win, the Rays would have finished appropriately at .500 and — as their most veteran player, Brandon Lowe, said before the game — “on the podium” with a third-place finish in the American League East.

Instead, they ended up 80-82, their first losing season since 2017 and first division finish lower than third place since 2016.

“Obviously, it’s disappointing,” said starter Ryan Pepiot amid handshakes and hugs in the clubhouse.
