Boston Red Sox vs Tampa Bay Rays Prediction 

Boston was able to pick up a much-needed win in game two of this series on Wednesday night and they need just about every win they can get, as they are a few games out of the last wild card spot in the AL. Boston is 41-36 on the road, while Tampa Bay is 38-39 at home this year. The Rays' offense continues to be dreadful, as they are now the second-worst scoring team in baseball this season. The Red Sox have played well with Bello on the mound for most of this season and I like them to pick up another win here.
