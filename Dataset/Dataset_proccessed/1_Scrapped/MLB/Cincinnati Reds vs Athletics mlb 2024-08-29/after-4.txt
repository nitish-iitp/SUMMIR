Julian Aguiar


Tonight will see Julian Aguiar make his third big league start. He’s been solid in the first two and he’ll be looking to keep that going. And he might be asked to pitch deep into the game, too, given the shape of the club’s rotation and how they’ve had to eat through the bullpen this week to fill in for injuries.

Both lefties and righties are hitting about the same against Aguiar when we look at their batting average. But that’s about where the comparison ends. Lefties are walking more, making more contact, and hitting for more power than their righty counterparts.

J.T. Ginn


Like Aguiar, Ginn is in his rookie season and has pitched in just two games. Neither of his outings were starts, though, and he’s thrown just 3.2 innings thus far as a big leaguer.

In the minor leagues he had been starting, making 20 starts with just one relief appearance, so he’s stretched out if Oakland wants him to go more than a few innings. Left-handed hitters have found far more success against him this season than righties. They are walking more, making way more contact, and hitting for a lot more power.

News and Notes

Brandon Leibrandt up, Casey Kelly out

The Reds called up Brandon Leibrandt from Triple-A. The lefty has been used as a starter for the Bats since signing with Cincinnati back in late May. He’s taking the spot of Casey Kelly, who was designated for assignment. You can read more about the moves here from our piece earlier today if you’d like more details.

For the last time. Maybe?

Today could be the final time the Cincinnati Reds play the Oakland Athletics. They are set to play in Sacramento for the next few years before the hopeful move to Las Vegas. Of course, the deal for a stadium in Las Vegas isn’t finalized yet and there are still questions about whether it is actually going to happen or not, no matter what Oakland’s ownership is trying to sell you. It’s possible that they wind up back in Oakland if things fall apart.

Dennis Westrick 08/29/2024

Like a moth to a flame, I am hovering over this dumpster fire which is the 2024 Reds! My wings have been singed but I haven’t taken the final death plunge!

I watched last night’s 9-6 loss from the first pitch to the last, something I rarely do!

Frankly, I am at a loss on what is needed to turn this team around!

Due to injuries that have decimated the starting pitching, Bell is pretty much forced to have pitching by committee! Again, the problem is when you run out 6 different pitchers in a 9 inning game, the odds are at least one or more of those pitchers will not be successful. Last night it was Kelly and Pagan!

Will hang in there for the final 29 games left in the regular season but I’m afraid this weekend’s series with the Brewers may be a whole lot of ugly!

Maybe we can win at least one game against the A’s?

ptaylor2112 08/29/2024

Dennis, are you ok? You used a question mark instead of an exclamation point.

Oldtimer 08/29/2024

The Reds are 63-70 with 29 games left. For actual dumpster fires, look up really bad seasons. All 5 starters projected in ST are either on IL or were traded. Starting 1B and 2B projected in ST are both on IL. Starting RF in ST and back-up OF in ST are both on IL.

Oldtimer 08/29/2024

To wit, look at 2022 and 2015-16-17-18 examples of Really Bad Seasons by Reds in past 10 years.

ptaylor2112 08/29/2024

I thought Stock had disappeared, so it was nice to see some recent comments on other threads. A voice of reason. Go Reds.

LDS 08/29/2024

I’d like to see Hinds and Rosario instead of Smith and Benson. The handedness hangup isn’t helping the team. Benson hasn’t really advanced this year. Maybe Hinds will. Maybe he won’t. But, it’s worth finding out.

LarkinPhillips 08/29/2024

Hinds called up to sit the bench three straight games. That’s got to be good for development.

LDS 08/29/2024

Let’s hope he doesn’t follow in Hopkins’ footsteps – called up, few appearances, and dumped in the offseason. Seems unlikely, but the Reds do strange things. Almost surprised they haven’t resigned Senzel.

greenmtred 08/29/2024

A kind assessment, LDS: Benson has taken a tremendous tailspin compared to last year. Perhaps they believe that he can only solve the problem by batting against MLB pitching. He showed in an extended trial last season that he can be a good hitter, but a team seriously shooting for the post-season would, one would think, put on hold player development at the MLB level. Might as well play him now, though.

LDS 08/29/2024

@greenmtred, generally in recent years, the Reds haven’t been as generous. For example, Benson has had more PAs this season than Barrero over two seasons. Rosario is 28+ and a career .275 hitter. Seems he’d play more.

greenmtred 08/29/2024

Benson showed, over an extended period of time, that he could produce. 385 obp, a bit of power. Barrero, for all of the potential we saw, really never did that, and his subsequent struggles have shown that other teams saw the same thing that the Reds did.

LDS 08/29/2024

Actually, Benson looked decent last year. Beyond that he looked no better. Cleveland knew what they were doing.

greenmtred 08/29/2024

I overstated the obp: .365. Ops in the high 800’s. Better than decent. Any team–including Cleveland, would want that player.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Game starts an hour and a half earlier today… And I’m looking for the Reds to blow them out !

Jim Walker 08/29/2024

Yeah, so why the early start? A’s flying commercial instead of charter and have to catch the last flight out of CVG to a hub somewhere?

Old-school 08/29/2024

Probably the Rare to never day night friday DH tomorrow making up the Brewers rain game.

dimondfvr 08/29/2024

Jim: I heard the announcers say there’s a concert at GABP after the game.

Oldtimer 08/29/2024

Country Western superstar Thomas Rhett performing at GABP after the game tonight.

doofus 08/29/2024

Would Aaron Boone be a better manager for the Cincinnati Reds than David Bell?

greenmtred 08/29/2024

If he brought better players with him. Unquestionably.

Mark A Verticchio 08/29/2024

At this point the Reds simply need to make a change to make a change. if not the crowds are going to look like the White Sox crowd today. A change might give an indication that they simply care, once again it’s not all Bell’s fault but that is the nature of the job in most cases.

greenmtred 08/29/2024

Can’t really argue, Mark. But I hope the Reds also add enough good players to give EDLC, McLain, Greene et al a chance to succeed.

Nick in NKY 08/29/2024

I also agree with Mark. I’ve been resistant to the “fire Bell” urge of the mob, as the I’ve felt the teams’ results mostly weren’t his fault, but at this point the organization needs to demonstrate the willingness to make a cultural change.

Oldtimer 08/29/2024

Reds fired Mayo Smith in 1959 (replaced him with Hutch) and MS won the 1968 WS managing the Detroit Tigers.

Reds fired John McNamara in 1982 (replaced him with Russ Nixon maybe) and JM won the 1986 AL pennant and might have won the 1986 WS if Bill Buckner could field a ground ball.

Reds replaced Trader Jack McKeon after 1999 but TJM won the WS with the Marlins.

Mauired 08/29/2024

When Reds fire Bell, I guarantee he won’t be winning the World Series with another team unless it’s the Little League World Series.

greenmtred 08/29/2024

He probably won’t, but if he got hired by one of the teams with elite rosters, he’d have a chance. Not because of his managing, but because good players win games.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Aguiar gets into trouble with three straight singles … the score is now 2-0 with two outs in the first.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Three outs. The Reds can’t let things linger today. We need to score early and often.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

The Reds go quietly in their half of the first.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Double Play ! Gets the leading lady, and takes the pressure off Aguiar.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

But then gives up a single and a Homer to Butler… time to take him out.

A’s up 4-0

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

This is what I hoped the Reds would be doing today !

greenmtred 08/29/2024

Good Lord!! I knew there was a reason I wasn’t watching. Maybe the Reds will run the table. Not in the good way.

Matt McWax 08/29/2024

I miss the Miami series when those meatball pitches were coming to our hitters.

Mark A Verticchio 08/29/2024

Let’s face it the A’s young players are putting the Reds to shame.

Rob 08/29/2024

And we are fortunate that Bell won’t be saying that the As are a good team. They are the 3rd or 4th worst team in mlb. In this case, it is an average team playing a bad team. But the average team looks to be in shock at getting dressed down by these guys.

Question of the day: If we are not going to compete any harder than this, then we didn’t we trade some of our expiring contracts for 2025 offense? Martinez, Suter, Farmer, Wilson, and even guys like India,Fraley, etc. Gosh, you could have gotten some pretty decent young bats from contenders for several of these guys. Now some of them will leave as free agents without anything in return. Just wondering. Out of all the above, Montas would have been the very last guy I would have traded when chasing a playoff spot. Lodolo struggling, Spiers, who knows, and Greene and Abbott both with high inning counts. The only reason you would trade Montas and not the others would be superb confidence in the durability and health of the other starters and some confidence in the Louisville crowd as backups. I have no clue how a knowledgeable GM could reach those conclusions.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Now a walk and double puts men on 2nd and 3rd with 2 outs.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

A merciful pop up ends the A’s 2nd, but the damage is done.

Matt McWax 08/29/2024

I don’t think 4 runs wins it but I don’t think we have the arms to shut them down.

LDS 08/29/2024

Swept by the A’s? At home, no less. How impressive.

Jim Walker 08/29/2024

Watching the A’s celebrating their exploits reminds me of watching a BlueJackets hockey game the last couple of seasons and seeing a guy score a goal against them then go all crazy like that as a graphic comes up that it is his first goal of the season 70 games in.

Context>> CBJ have had a natural top 3 draft pick the last 2 seasons. 

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Let’s see if the Reds can pull some back in their half.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Wow, not making good contact in the 2nd, and go down 1-2-3.

Mark A Verticchio 08/29/2024

When is the last time this team did anything in the early innings?

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Rare, but it has happened.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Aguiar back out there for the 3rd… seems impossible.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

After the first out, Gelof doubles.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

But McCann helps him out and goes down on strikes.

LarkinPhillips 08/29/2024

They have to. After two straight bullpen games and then a double header tomorrow.

RedAlert 08/29/2024

No fight or any signs of competing in this team … TOTALLY CHECKED OUT AND QUIT .

BELL
HAS GOTTA GO ! no excuse for this level of ineptitude against one of the worst teams in MLB. injuries or not ….

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Reds escape with no runs in the 3rd… There’s still plenty of innings left.

Jeremiah 08/29/2024

Reds are reminding me of the 90’s Bengals, you have to laugh a little how bad things are going! They’re becoming a disaster.

Now it feels like they are really rushing Aguilar and Lowder because of the I juries and possibly mounting pressure on the front office. I feel a bit for the players and Bell even. You have little chance to win with the pitching they are having to rely on nightly now.

Mark A Verticchio 08/29/2024

I agree but the offense looks like they have checked out and that is on Bell and the players as well.

Bill M 08/29/2024

And yet the Reds have the greatest pitching coach in MLB.

Rob 08/29/2024

It may not be a good decision but I don’t see any choice. They are probably on the verge of being investigated by the Competition Committee for lack of competitiveness. How many Louisvillites have they brought up lately. They are on Louisvilles 4th or 5th starting pitcher. That reeks on giving up right there.

The Reds are also between a rock and a hard place on their injured starters. We all know these guys need to be built up for September 2025 or Deja Vu all over again. And we are not talking rookies but guys entering a fourth year. When do you turn them loose?

SteveAReno 08/29/2024

Louisvillians not Louisvillites.

Dennis Westrick 08/29/2024

Still on track to lose their last 31 regular season games I see!

Oldtimer 08/29/2024

Take a positive or even neutral outlook once in a while. Sheesh.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Dom Smith goes down on 4 pitches… the trend continues.

JB 08/29/2024

I’m just here to see him hit.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Espinal got hosed on the first called strike, but then gets fooled by a slider way outside for strike 3.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Will Benson ends the shutout with the Reds first hit – Homerun !

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Enough !

Mark A Verticchio 08/29/2024

As bad as he has been I feel that Benson has a better place on the 2025 team than India. He is a better athlete and much better on defense. If India is more than a role player next year it will be rinse and repeat.

LDS 08/29/2024

Benson homers gain? Wow, it’s over 100 where I am but it appears the “down below “ has frozen over.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Looks like it’s sink or swim with Aguiar…He’s back out for the 4th.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

And Butler makes him pay again ! He played with fire and got burned.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

And now Bleday makes him pay… it’s now 6-1 Oakland.

dimondfvr 08/29/2024

Sadak says it’s been “batting practice homers” for the A’s. Yep!

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

I still think it’s criminal to keep Aguiar on the mound.

dimondfvr 08/29/2024

Where’s David Buchanan that the Reds traded for earlier this week? is he with the ballclub?

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

I don’t know, but Leibrandt is out there now.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Ty Steve adds to the homerun fest … the Reds now down 6-2.

Mark A Verticchio 08/29/2024

An obvious move is to put Freidl back at lead off, he should have never batted 4th, and move India down, way down.
On another note this series has made a case to move back the fences.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

But the chicks love the long ball, remember …

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Can’t argue with Friedl at leadoff, especially since India is not getting it done.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Leibrandt gets three groundouts in the 5th…

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

With a little luck the Reds have runners on 1st and 2nd with no outs…

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Espy too eager in that at bat, but then gets Hit By Pitch to load the bases…

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

With homerun Benson at the plate, it looks like a change of pitchers to me.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

But he goes down on three straight strikes… one away

Matt McWax 08/29/2024

Norris Hopper mention! Finished his illustrious career with a .316 avg and .367 obp, 2.1 war in 440 plate appearances.

Pharmer85 08/29/2024

Master of the push bunt to the right side.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

And then he walks India on 4 pitches, making it 6-3.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Elly grounds out, but another run scores, and Ty Steve is at the plate. 6-4

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

But that’s all they will get at the end of 5. A’s lead 6-4.

Jim Walker 08/29/2024

Anybody going to argue very hard with me if I say that ball 4 call to India which walked in a run may have been a delayed makeup call for the ball called strike 1 versus Benson which set the tone for Benson’s entire PA???

Nick in NKY 08/29/2024

My very first thought

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Leibrandt with 5 ground balls in a row, all for outs, 2 down in the 6th.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Rooker flies out to end the A’s 6th. Good pitching by Leibrandt.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Friedl gets to leadoff the Reds half and is immediately hit by a pitch, and an injury delay is called.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

How bad is it ?

Votto4life 08/29/2024

Stephenson is having a great season. Hope
The Reds extend him this off season.

Jim Walker 08/29/2024

Get Hurtubise, Wiemer or Blake on a Uber ride from Indy where the Bats are on down to GABP.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Boyle fired that one in at 100.1 mph to get Steer. One out.

Ksdavis 08/29/2024

Some people on here thought it was a mistake to trade Boyle. He may get out of the inning but he is all over the place

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

France gets a walk, on the 2nd time…

Dennis Westrick 08/29/2024

A couple of questions! Is the Leibrandt kid from Florida State related to Charlie Leibrandt?

Also, wonder how many times this season Benson has struck out with RISP, especially with the bases loaded!

JB 08/29/2024

I think I read he wasn’t but then again I have no idea what I had for breakfast.

Rick 08/29/2024

He is Charlie’s son.

Jim Walker 08/29/2024

Brandon Leibrant is Charlie’s son. Doug wrote so and BBRef agrees. 

Oldtimer 08/29/2024

https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/leibrbr01.shtml da link.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

6 blazing fastballs to Dom Smith, but he gets a walk to load the bases.

SteveAReno 08/29/2024

Dom. Smith has scored two runs now.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Who else would you want up in this situation… Espy gets a walk and another run is in for the Redlegs, it’s 6-5.

JB 08/29/2024

If Boyle was still pitching for the Reds , Dennis Westrick would be dead. No way his High Blood Pressure medicine could handle Boyle.

DW 08/29/2024

Haha!!!

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Looks like a change of pitchers this time, Benson at the plate.

magi210 08/29/2024

It’s nice to see someone else’s bullpen explode.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Rosario pinch hits for Benson and gets hit by pitch, bringing in another run.

India hits a sac fly but ends up in a double play with another run scoring.

It’s tied up folks at 6 a piece.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Espinal tried for third on the fly ball… made for the third out.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Make that 7-6 Reds.

Oldtimer 08/29/2024

I was getting my White Castle takeout dinner when it went down.

Jim Walker 08/29/2024

After, that comeback which got away from the Reds last and being gifted a late lead tonight, why doesn’t David Bell come with his best right out of the box and go for win.

No sooner typed than here comes Satillan.

Jim Walker 08/29/2024

Excuse me Santillan not Satillan.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

With one out and one on first, Bell brings in Tony Santillan replacing Leibrandt.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Santillan takes care of Cameron, 2 outs in the 7th.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

And strikes out Geloff to end the top half of the inning.

Old-school 08/29/2024

Lot of why did the Reds trade Boyle for Moll a year ago at the deadline….That one worked out well. If pitchers cant throw strikes, they cant pitch. First rule of pitching. Boyle cant throw stirkes. End of story. Too many coaches think they can coach strike throwing up or get chase.

JayTheRed 08/29/2024

I also really like having Moll. He is consistently good at keeping runs from scoring.

Old-school 08/29/2024

Tony santillan has had a bounce back year. Good to see him return as a Reds core player for 2025. He’s been very good.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Stephenson puts wood on the ball for a base hit. One on and one out for the Reds here in the 7th.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

But two fly outs end it for the Reds in the 7th. Reds still up 7-6.

Old-school 08/29/2024

Tyler Stephenson has been very good. He may lead the Reds in OPS when all is said and done. Great comeback year. Sign this guy in the off-season to an extension. He can hit.

Votto4life 08/29/2024

+10,000

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Santillan back out for the A’s 8th.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

And continues where he left off with another strikeout, one down.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Schuemann strikes out on three pitches for out no. 2 !

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

and gets a fly out to end the A’s 8th.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

the Reds have 7 runs on 5 hits. Be nice to get an insurance run or two.

Mike W 08/29/2024

All I’m going to say is if you’re a Major League team and you give up 3 runs on NO hits — as the A’s just did — you deserve to lose.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Dom Smith walks again to leadoff the Reds 8th.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

One out already though.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Pinch runner for Smith, just what I was thinking.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Ground ball double play ends it though… onto the 9th… any guesses on who will pitch ?

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Diaz vs. Butler to start it off…

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

And Butler wins that match up with a homerun ! Score is tied at 7 a piece.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

He tried to bust him in after 4 pitches away, and it didn’t work.

RedAlert 08/29/2024

New closer for 2025 hopefully – Diaz ain’t it no more .

While we’re at , hopefully new manager ….but they don’t have the guts to do it

Daytonnati 08/29/2024

“It ain’t over till it’s over.”

JB 08/29/2024

Butler is the new Reds killer.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Then Rooker walks and Bleday doubles…looking grim.

JayTheRed 08/29/2024

Thanks for the play by play tonight I am working and didn’t get to see any of the game.

RedAlert 08/29/2024

New closer for 2025 hopefully – Diaz ain’t it no more .

While we’re at , hopefully new manager ….but they don’t have the guts to do it

Brantley thinks Ashcraft has the pitches and attitude to be a closer.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

He should have pulled Diaz, Brown singles home two more, and the A’s lead 9-7.

Ill bill 08/29/2024

Dumpster fire

Beaufort Red 08/29/2024

I don’t know who’s worse Bell or the idiots that think Diaz is a closer.

Kevin H 08/29/2024

Why the name calling. Would you call some a idiot to their face?

Beaufort Red 08/29/2024

Yes would. Sorry your boy ain’t getting it done.

Harry Stoner 08/29/2024

And Diaz gets the win, big fella.

Harry Stoner 08/29/2024

Sorry, no….Pagan.

But you can carry on being a tough guy, just the same.

Kevin H 08/29/2024

Pardon me Beaufort??? Using the term ” boy” the way you did is racist dude. Plus I highly doubt u would call others idiots to their face key board warrior

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Pagan comes on with no one out.

Daytonnati 08/29/2024

It might be over.

Mark A Verticchio 08/29/2024

Diaz is no closer period.

Old-school 08/29/2024

A’s a parade of lefty hitters crushing Diaz.
For a manager who has bet his entire managerial career on handedness…curious why A’s lefty hitters are just making a mockery of Diaz. Why does Diaz get special treatment?

Kevin H 08/29/2024

He’s their closer. Pretty simple

Old-school 08/29/2024

ERA 2024 4.86
ERA Career 2.94

WHIP 2024 1.34
WHIP Career 1.14

Change is allowed. Hes been bad for awhile.

Name a closer with an ERA of 4.86 on Labor Day?

Kevin H 08/29/2024

I don’t care Old-school. He has been their closer and it’s not gonna change

Old-school 08/29/2024

Well..baseball is the most statistics based game in sports. You should care if you are a Reds fan.

It’s a fair argument to say Diaz hasn’t been good as a closer and change needs to happen in that role and across an organization that is fighting for last place again. Reds win though so it’s a good night but lose 2/3 to the worst franchise in MLB.

Randoxu1 08/29/2024

He’s closer by title only. If you think Diaz is the closer for this team then you and Bell are the only ones drinking that kool-aid. The guy has been terrible since the all star game in 23. He and Bell are responsible for about half the 1 run losses. It’s truly sad that the manager puts closer role ahead of what’s best for the team. Please send Bell packing!

RedAlert 08/29/2024

He shouldn’t be – high wire act every single time . Ridiculous and it’s old !

JayTheRed 08/29/2024

Get your brooms out A’s fans.

MK 08/29/2024

Can tell Sadek never played a team sport. When people are mad because they blow a lead he just needs to shut up. The last thing you want to hear is him spewing his philosophic bull, Vin Skully used to say let the fans have their moment

Mark A Verticchio 08/29/2024

Bell is the last manager you want with a short pitching staff.

RedAlert 08/29/2024

This should be it for Bell …. Every move he makes backfires . WILL NEVER WIN SAUAT LONG AS THIS dude remains manager !!!! Sad state of affairs !!

RedAlert 08/29/2024

…SQUAT …

Oldtimer 08/29/2024

Does 10-9 win tonight count as Diddly or Squat?

RedAlert 08/29/2024

I don’t care if they got lucky and won tonight – good for them . Bell is the
absolute worst manager in MLB . I’ve seen enough evidence how inept he is over the last 6 years .He doesn’t deserve to continue to be manager of this team . How bout diddly squat ! That would fit perfectly .

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Well the Reds need 2 to tie it in the 9th.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Rece Hinds comes on to lead off for the Reds.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

And earns a walk to start things off.

Mike W 08/29/2024

Soooo,
A team CAN give up 3 runs on no hits and still beat the Reds in the 9th inning. What you going to do ownership? Give up half the starting 9 for some future prospects, or let the manager go? Let the manager go and bring in someone else with a different philosophy! It’s what has been done for 100 years and how “the business of baseball” is conducted. Have the guts to do what’s needed to be done —- or spend $200M in payroll and buy some wins that way.

doofus 08/29/2024

Ball 5 to Hinds.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

India drives Hinds to third with a single, no outs and two on.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Elly needs to stay chili… and draws the walk… no outs.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Ty Steve gets a pitch to hit and drives in one run… still no one out.

JB 08/29/2024

Crazy game.

Matt McWax 08/29/2024

Woooo, wow!

magi210 08/29/2024

Baseball’s a funny game…

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

And TJ Friedl gets the walk off base hit… Reds win 10-9 !!

Talk about a wild one !

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

Both teams put up 3 runs in the 9th …

Kevin H 08/29/2024

Reds win. Maybe that will silence them

Harry Stoner 08/29/2024

Silence who?

Kevin H 08/29/2024

The constant complaing of some of Bell. Truly is old and to the point of toxic.

Especially since the pitching is a hot mess at this point.

Randoxu1 08/29/2024

Who? The fans that are sick of losing baseball. If you are happy with this mess then that’s on you. Bell should of been gone last year and by the way the constant bashing is deserved. Injuries are not an excuse and up until about 2 weeks ago they had great starting pitching and still couldn’t win.

RedAlert 08/29/2024

Yep – bingo – he certainly does!

Mike w 08/31/2024

Great points Randoxu1.
I heard 1st place Milwaukee has used 17 SPs. That’s 50% more than the Reds 13 — and they lead us by 10 games! Injuries are the part of all professional sports. Good managers find ways to win regardless. (Interesting fact: the Brewers also lead the league in bunt singles. Bell clearly doesn’t tell our players to bunt often!)

Daytonnati 08/29/2024

Yogi still correct: “It ain’t over till it’s over.”

Harry Stoner 08/29/2024

Sometimes watching two bad teams play can be more entertaining than watching two good teams play.

Old-school 08/29/2024

Entertaining???? Yes.

Pleasurable??? No

But thats funny

Matt McWax 08/29/2024

Good thing Bleday wasn’t in the 1 slot and Butler in the 3 slot.

Matt McWax 08/29/2024

#2 and #3 were on base 8 times. #7, #8, and #9 only twice. Thus Butler only knocked 1 in besides himself. Hat tip to him, very impressive.

dimondfvr 08/29/2024

And this one belongs to the Reds!!

CLT Reds Fan 08/29/2024

Never had a doubt!! Go Reds!!

LarkinPhillips 08/29/2024

I really hope Suter ends up being a pitching coach fir the Reds in the future. He is a cincy guy and super smart. First one out to celebrate the walk off as well. Just a fun guy to root for.

Oldtimer 08/29/2024

Fans got their $ worth tonight AND a Thomas Rhett concert to boot.

Harry Stoner 08/29/2024

Good thing you weren’t eating any chili.

Oldtimer 08/29/2024

Yeah. White Castles tonight.

Old-school 08/29/2024

Pickles cheese and onions on the sliders I hope! I might need a DoorDash

CLT Reds Fan 08/29/2024

If Old-timer eating at White Castle gets the Reds a late rally win I’m buying him a stack of Gift Cards!! A win always feels good!!
