Reds win a roller coaster game on a walk-off by TJ Friedl
 Doug Gray  08/29/2024 51

The Cincinnati Reds and Oakland Athletics battled back-and-forth all day. Oakland blew a 5-run lead, only to score three runs in the 9th inning to take the lead back from Cincinnati. But the Reds would score three runs in the bottom of the inning, capped off by a walk-off hit by TJ Friedl as they salvaged a win in the series.

Final	R	H	E
Oakland Athletics (58-76)
	9	14	0
Cincinnati Reds (64-70)	10	8	0
W: Pagan (4-4) L: Holman (0-1)

Box Score | Game Thread

Oakland came out of the dugout in the 1st inning ready to swing and after Lawrence Butler grounded out to begin the game, the Athletics hit three consecutive singles to get on the board. Daz Cameron then grounded into a force out that brought in a run to put his team up 2-0. The next inning they would tack on two more runs as Butler connected for a 2-run homer.

The Reds would get one of those runs back in the bottom of the 3rd when Will Benson hit a 438-foot home run off of the batters eye. Oakland went right back to it in the top of the 4th, though. Lawrence Butler homered for the second time on the day and the fourth time in the series. JJ Bleday added a solo homer of his own to make it 6-1. Tyler Stephenson would add a home run in the bottom of the 4th to get one of those runs back.

After Julian Aguiar struggled through four innings, the Reds called on Brandon Leibrandt to begin the 5th inning and he picked up three groundball outs in his Cincinnati debut. The offense got to work, with a little help from J.T. Ginn in the bottom of the inning. Ty France and Dominic Smith both singled to begin the inning and then Santiago Espinal was hit by a pitch to load the bases. The Reds cashed in runs on a walk to Jonathan India and then a groundout by Elly De La Cruz to make it 6-4.

The next inning saw Oakland call on Joe Boyle, the former Reds prospect who was traded at least year’s deadline for Sam Moll. He hit TJ Friedl to begin the inning before getting a pop up for the first out of the inning. But he then walked the next three batters to bring in a run before being pulled and replaced by T.J. McFarland. The first pitch he threw hit Amed Rosario to tie up the game at 6-6. Three pitches later Jonathan India hit a sacrifice fly on a great diving play in center by JJ Bleday. But on the play he was able to get to his feet and throw to third base to get Santiago Espinal trying to tag up and advance. Cincinnati challenged the call and replay certainly appeared to show he got his hand in under the tag, but the call remained and the inning was over – but the Reds now led 7-6.

Brandon Leibrandt gave up an infield single to start the 7th inning before getting a force out. That would be the final hitter he faced. Tony Santillan took over from there and he struck out four batters in a row before getting a fly out for the final out in the 8th inning as the Reds held onto a 1-run lead.

Alexis Diaz entered the game in the 9th to face the top of the Athletics lineup. The hitter at the top of the lineup is Lawrence Butler, who has homered twice on the day and four times in the 3-game series. He made it three homers on the day and six in the series as he crushed a game-tying blast 427-feet into the bar area beyond the bullpen in right field. Diaz followed up with a walk of Brent Rooker. That led to pitching coach Derek Johnson making a visit, but whatever he said didn’t pay immediate dividends as JJ Bleday lined a double off of the wall in right field that moved Rooker to third base. Seth Brown followed up with an absolute laser of a double into right field of his own that brought in two runs and put Oakland up 9-7.

That was the end of the day for Diaz as manager David Bell made the walk to the mound to bring in Emilio Pagan. After he got a lazy fly ball out, Elly De La Cruz made a highlight reel diving catch for the second out of the inning.

Cincinnati wasn’t ready to just roll over in the bottom of the 9th. Rece Hinds walked to lead off the inning and then Jonathan India singled to move Hinds over to third base with no one out. A wild pitch then moved India into scoring position. Elly De La Cruz then walked to load the bases for Tyler Stephenson. He came through with a single just between the shortstop and third baseman, bringing Hinds in to make it 9-8 and everyone moving up a base in the process. Two pitches later TJ Friedl lined a single into right field for a walk-off hit that saw India and De La Cruz cross the plate for a 10-9 win.

Key Moment of the Game


TJ Friedl’s walk-off hit.

Notes Worth Noting

Tyler Stephenson had three hits on the night – the only Red with more than one hit – and extended his hitting streak to 13 games. His home run as his 18th of the year, extending what was already a career high in home runs.

Tony Santillan now has 27 strikeouts, five walks, and just 10 hits allowed in 17.2 innings since being called up by the Reds (and a 2.55 ERA).

According to the television broadcast, this was the first walk-off win by the Reds since May.

The Reds hitters had seven walks and four strikeouts on the day.

Santillan and Stephenson having big bounceback seasons.
Good to see those guys making a statement for 2025.
Perhaps it’s time Bell demotes Diaz from his anointed closer role.

What MLB team has a close in September with an ERA nearing 5?

Small sample sizes are over

Nick in NKY 08/29/2024

Diaz’s peripherals are bad, and his save rate is a red herring. He’s been lucky more than good, and that was never gonna last. It’s too bad they didn’t unload him at peak value.

Alternatively, perhaps he’s hurt and good diagnosis and offseason’s worth of rest will get him back to where he was.

Oldtimer 08/29/2024

My guess – AND JUST THAT – is that he may be tipping his pitches lately.

redfanorbust 08/30/2024

Unload him at peak value is hindsight. Why would they unload him at his peak value when when he was pitching well and makes less than 1M and not a FA till 2028? If he is injured which I personally have not heard a whisper of then he should not be pitching like most of the rest of our starting pitchers.

Andrew Brewer 08/29/2024

The Reds battled back for a 7-6 lead only to see it evaporate in the 9th… But then score 3 of there own to take the win. Should be some happiness in the Queen City over this one. The Reds refused to lose.

Klugo 08/29/2024

Trade. Diaz.

Oldtimer 08/29/2024

Trades are not permitted right now.

Klugo 08/29/2024

No. Like, this winter, spring, yesterday, asap. Get something for him. If we’re serious about winning, he’s worthless. If we’re not serious about winning, then why bother pretending he’s any good? Trade him for a bucket of balls.

Dan 08/30/2024

Buy high, sell low?

Harry Stoner 08/29/2024

Nah.

But certainly time to move him out of the closer role.

He faced 3 lefties in the 9th.

Why not use Moll?

I think Santillan is ready to try a few 9th inning assignments.

Diaz is young, still has options.

I’d send him to AAA long before I’d make any panic trade.

Check out who is closing for Atlanta and Pittsburgh.

The last two Reds’ closers.

Klugo 08/29/2024

Panic? He’s been hot garbage for a loooong time now.

Harry Stoner 08/29/2024

Yeah, panic mode.

Or hyperbole mode, if that suits better.

Diaz is 27 years old.

With options.

A recent Allstar.

Send him to AAA and get things fixed.

Or keep your knickers twisted up and trade him for another Rookie Davis or Noe Ramirez.

That’ll show ‘em who’s boss.

Klugo 08/29/2024

Exactly why some fool would be willing to give us something for him. There are a lot of young pitchers out there with options. Doesn’t make them good. The All-Star appearance ( which only takes about one half season of good pitching to achieve btw. What happened after the ASG?) is enough to get someone somewhere to actually believe he’s worth a crap.

Harry Stoner 08/29/2024

Good thing you’re not in charge of anything.

DW 08/29/2024

Agree on all of this Harry. Nailed it!

Dan 08/30/2024

Amen, Harry!

Sending Diaz (and Marte, and Benson) to Louisville is a much more rational approach.

“This is worthless, must be time to sell it” is not an approach that makes any sense.

AMDG 08/30/2024

Trade Diaz?

You have to have something of value to get something of value.

Over the past year and a half Diaz is giving up 1.5 baserunners per inning, and an ERA north of 5.00

At best that would bring you a low A lottery ticket, or a past-his-prime veteran on the downslide.

redfanorbust 08/30/2024

Trade Diaz for what? Who is significantly better to take over the closer roll? Per Baseball Trade Values he has low trade value. It was not that long ago he was close to an elite closer and there must be some reason(s) why he is struggling so badly. He is still only 27 and makes less than $1 per year and is not a FA till 28. IMO if the Reds do trade him it will be in a package for a premium OF.

Doc 08/29/2024

Bullpen is suffering under the usage and it doesn’t help that Cruz is still on the big league field. Wouldn’t move Diaz. He was on a long, good run until this fascination with BP days, and injured starters. Reds should consider revamping their training staff, and rethinking the all out all the time pitching approach.

MLB needs to seriously inhibit the HR potential to facilitate a return to a normal game. Players are just too big, strike zone is too small, parks cannot be expanded.

Mark 08/29/2024

When your bullpen anchor and closer is this bad it kills the whole team.
It’s pervasive and has an effect way beyond box scores , stats , etc.

Harry Stoner 08/29/2024

Your closer (though I would contend Moll or Farmer and now Santillan have been the real bullpen ‘anchors’) had a string of what, 16 straight saves before the last to meltdowns.

That’s ’killing your whole team’?

His WHIP is killing the whole team?

But the Reds poor hitting, poor base running and poor fielding isn’t?

Sure, blown saves are crushing, but so is running yourself out of yet another inning or lamely striking out with the winning runs on base.

Diaz has to be moved out of closing, for sure, but don’t oversell your argument.

Cruz was right yesterday “The whole team lost this game.”

greenmtred 08/30/2024

Excellent post, Harry.

old-school 08/30/2024

@ harry
How ’bout Diaz is killing my supply of Tums in the medicine cabinet?
Already burned through it with Sims.

greenmtred 08/30/2024

O-S: Diaz and Sims are the reason I switched to store brand antacids; saves enough money to be worth considering. Alternately: how I quit worrying and learned to love the bomb. Greet whatever happens with tranquility. I agree with Harry: give Diaz a lower impact role so he can figure out what’s up–maybe oldtimer is on to something. Maybe he’s tipping his pitches. I’ve always thought his 3/4 arm slot causes some of his pitches to sail, so he’s often pitching behind in the count. It’s easy to say get rid of him (and Benson, and Marte) but they’ve all shown that they’re worth some more effort.

Klugo 08/29/2024

He was on a “long”, good, lucky run. I’d hate to know what his WHIP is and even was during that “run”. My guess is still no bueno.

greenmtred 08/30/2024

Closers usually pitch one inning per appearance, so their stats can be blown to pieces by a bad appearance. It isn’t that their peripheral stats are meaningless, but they need to be taken in context.

rednat 08/30/2024

i agree with your second paragraph. it is now like nba players playing on an elementary school basketball court. But why do you think parks can’t be expanded? seems like an easy fix to me.

TR 08/30/2024

It’s understandable that if seats are removed, then probably utilities would need to be moved also. But at GABP, homerun distance could be extended with a screen on the fence similar to the left field at Fenway Park.

Dan 08/30/2024

I would LOVE to see the Reds blow up the first 3 or 4 rows of seats in the outfield. Baltimore did it – they’re the only example I know of.

If you build a ballpark too big (the field, not the seating), you can just move the fences in. (See San Diego, Detroit, NY Mets…) If you build it too small… you are stuck w/ a much bigger problem.

I hate the bandbox way that GABP plays.

Not to mention that doubles and triples (and running/diving catches in the gaps) are far more exciting (to me) that HR’s.

Anyway… no way Greasy Phil goes for it. But we can dream.

JayTheRed 08/29/2024

Nice to see this team comeback twice. Goal for me for the team is to finish at .500 or better at this point. Hope we can see more wins than not.

Oldtimer 08/29/2024

On pace now for 77 W so just have to flip a few games.

rednat 08/30/2024

saw Oakland twice this week. they remind me of the reds in a lot of ways.
I noticed their young players seem to take “shorter swings” and seem to try to “inside-out ” the ball more where our young hitters tend to take bigger looping swings. Not sure if it is a philosophy or just the way they swing but you could tell a difference.

also I still think mlb needs to do more with shift restriction. i hate that the 2b or ss can stand behind second base. also something has to be done about the outfield shifts. this is hurting the game more than anything imo. these corner outfielders are basically playing in left center and rt center field now. at least take away their “cheat cheat ” for gosh sakes.

a think a hard hit ball up the middle should be a single most of the time and and hard line drive in the gap should be at least a double most of the time. now they are usually routine outs.

rednat 08/30/2024

ALSO I FELT Hinds showed excellent aggressive but intelligent base running in that 9th inning. hard 1st to third running on the india single but then did not try to score on the wild pitch which was very smart. he would have been out by a mile.

Rob 08/30/2024

His run was not meaningful. Whether he scores or not, the final score becomes 9-7 or 9-8. Still a L. In that situation, he should not try to score unless he is 100% sure or is required to run. Very smart on his part to stay at third. The important base runner is at 2B. The 9-9 base runner.

India’s baserunning on Tyler’s single was not good. Bases loaded and he pauses at 2B! He has to be running from the get go on that grounder but make sure he doesn’t run into a tag. He took 2-3 steps then paused. Should have scored. No chance after the pause. Got loss in the final score but I hope it gets addressed.

CI3J 08/30/2024

Wow, nice job for them to pull that one out.

Now comes the gauntlet to end the season. The Reds only have ONE series left against a team with a losing record, and that’s the Pittsburgh Pirates, who they just lost 3 of 4 to.

28 games left. They have to win 11 of them to get to 75 wins. I’m honestly not sure they’ll make it.

Jim Walker 08/30/2024

Some milestones (or millstones)
8-20 gets them to 72-90
10-18 gets them to 74-88
14-14 gets them to 78-84
18-10 gets them to 82-82
20-8 gets them to 84-82

And since their current win % is .478. that rate over the remaining 28 games 13-15 would land them at 73-85.

LDS 08/30/2024

I punched out at 6-1 and the Reds actually rallied and won the game? Amazing. Two comebacks in the last week or so down 5 or 6 games. Imagine if they had played to comeback in all those earlier games instead of throwing in the towel. Right now, they are 12-14 for August. Sweek the next three against Milwaukee and have a winning month. Sweep all four and get September off to a good start. Going to happen? Unlikely given their history with Milwaukee over the last couple of years. Obviously, the playoffs are dead, 9 games out in the WC race and 13.5 in the division. So, sweeping Milwaukee wouldn’t change the playoff picture much but it would go a long way to establishing some competitive credibility. Something Bell and his team need to start demonstrating.

David 08/30/2024

DIaz as closer:
Relievers, as a group, run hot and cold, season to season.
Diaz was good, then lousy for a while.
Is there something physically wrong with him? Unknown.
Is it a problem with his pitching mechanics? The pitching coach should be able to see this, if so.
Has he just lost pitching velocity from arm fatigue? Will he recover?

Sometimes guys just lose it, and never get it back. At least, Bell should stop using him as a closer the rest of the year.

MBS 08/30/2024

I’d expect a IL announcement for him soon.

Jim Walker 08/30/2024

Yep. Next man down versus next man up.

Oldtimer 08/30/2024

The Nasty Boy Randy Myers is the poster boy for that. He was dominant in 1990, not so much in 1991 or 1992 (his WHIP with SDP that year was 1.481 despite his 38 saves), then got his mojo back in 1993 with the Cubs. He was dominant again in 1997 with Orioles.

JayTheRed 08/30/2024

I’ve been wondering if he has a small naggy type injury that he isn’t telling the team about or just trying to work through it. Hoping Diaz can turn things around or the Reds may need to find a new closer this offseason.

Stan 08/30/2024

Diaz is the new Strickland.You just know Bell will keep running Diaz out there no matter what.

Oldtimer 08/30/2024

His 3-year career numbers are 3.10 ERA, 143 ERA+, and 1.167 WHIP. He was dominant in 2022 but blew a few save chances that year, too.

LDS 08/30/2024

Diaz is nowhere near being a Strickland. He’s been knocked around a bit the last two outings but he had a really good stretch prior to that, 17 straight saves since his previous blown save. Yes, he’s blown his last two saves and he isn’t as dominant as he has been in the past. But he’s only about 28. Too soon to give up on him. No reliever has been nailing it particularly well overall. It’s just that Diaz pitches in a highly visible spot and his failures are magnified. For example, Moll was hit for 2 runs in one inning a couple of weeks ago. Farmer gave up a couple in one inning in the same game. These were in the 13-1 blowout by KC so no one noticed. Santillan was hit for 3 just a couple of days ago. I’d suggest changing pitching coaches. I understand that DJ was well regarded at the college level. However, I’m not really overwhelmed by his “success” at the ML level. Too many blown arms and not enough progression, Greene this year being the exception, although Greene too is out with arm issues.

BK 08/30/2024

DJ is well regarded in the majors as well. It was considered quite a coup when Dick Williams stole him from Milwaukee. Blown out arms occur all over professional baseball.

LDS 08/30/2024

Yes, they do. That points to a problem in MLB. Regardless, I have a hard time pinpointing too many successes with DJ.

JayTheRed 08/30/2024

Disagree, Diaz is nowhere near as bad as Strickland was. There are very few relievers in baseball that produce the same results or really good results over a career.

I do think they need to think about another option if he continues to have issues though for closer.

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

Traveling during the game, so mostly on WLW feed. I managed to fend off any “road rage” at the wicked roller coaster ride. Got to watch a little bit during dinner where we kept advancing with no hits.

Feels like we salvaged the series even if we didn’t win it. Two games against Bernie today will be brutal. Heck, ONE game has been brutal enough this year. Add in the extreme heat and my First Wife is wondering how they do it.

Out and about today, so likely not commenting. Let’s hope we can nail down one of these games and that Lowder has a great taxi squad debut.

Jim Walker 08/30/2024

Taking a quick look through the comments here, I don’t see any mention that none other than Rece Hinds making his 1st MLB PA in over a month drew a lead off walk on a full count to start the 9th inning Reds magic. Little things lose games and sometimes they also set the stage to make winning possible games.

Dan 08/30/2024

Great point, Jim!
