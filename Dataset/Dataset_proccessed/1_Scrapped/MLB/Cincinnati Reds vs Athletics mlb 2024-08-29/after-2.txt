“To show the fight to answer back in that fashion, just shows the character of the group really,” A's manager Mark Kotsay said. “That’s how you win baseball games.”

The A's hit four home runs in the game and have homered 166 times this season, seventh-most in the major leagues. Oakland has scored 50.3% of its runs on homers, the highest percentage in the majors.

Oakland has homered seven times in the first two games of the three-game series at hitter-friendly Great American Ball Park.

“We were hoping to not let it get into our heads,” Brown said of the ballpark's reputation. “Just continue to take our approaches. Just hitting the ball hard where it's pitched.”

The Reds had one hit and were trailing 5-0 after six, but scored six runs in the seventh to take the lead on Will Benson's three-run home run.

“It was a tough swing when we took the lead," Reds manager David Bell said. “The A's did their job. Their offense was able to turn it around against us.”

Brown's second home run — off Emilio Pagán (3-4) — put the A’s ahead to stay 8-6 in the eighth.

“We lost the lead, we come back in and it's OK, we have to punch back,” Brown said. “Baseball's crazy. You're going to have innings like that. You have to be able to punch back. That's our mindset.”

Oakland's Lawrence Butler hit the second career leadoff home run of his career. The first was on Aug. 23 against Milwaukee. Brown hit his first of the game to make the score 2-0 in the fourth.

Brent Rooker, who hit 30 homers last season, hit his career-best 31st in the sixth to make it 3-0.

“This guy has become the heart of the team," Kotsay said.

A’s starter Osvaldo Bido, who has a 1.17 ERA over his past four starts, retired the first 13 batters he faced until Spencer Steer singled in the fifth. He allowed two earned runs on three hits in six innings.

“All three pitches were working,” Bido said through a translator. “It's always great when you pitch great and you help your team win. I go out and prepare myself for every start. Everything is working well so far.”

Tyler Ferguson (2-1) pitched the eighth inning for the win.

The Reds had runners on first and second with one out in the ninth against Mason Miller, who struck out Amed Rosario and Benson for his 23rd save.

With five starters on the injured list, setup man Fernando Cruz started for the Reds and pitched a career-high three innings with six strikeouts. Pagán gave up five hits and four runs in one inning.

Athletics: RHP JT Ginn (0-0, 2.45) will make his third career appearance but first start.
