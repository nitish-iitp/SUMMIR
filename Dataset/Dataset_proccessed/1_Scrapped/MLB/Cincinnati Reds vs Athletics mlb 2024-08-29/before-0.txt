A’s Offense Breaks Out

Oakland’s offense scored nine runs on Wednesday and that was enough for the three-run victory. Seth Brown hit two home runs and drove in four RBIs. The A’s are averaging 3.99 runs, while their pitching is giving up 4.59 runs per game.

The offense is ranked 25th in the league, while the pitching is ranked 22nd. Brent Rooker has hit 30 home runs and driven in 87 RBIs so far this season. Getting the start for the A’s will be G.T. Ginn, who sits with a 0-0 record and an ERA of 2.45. Against the Milwaukee Brewers in the last game, he went 1.2 innings giving up one hit and one run. 

Why the A's Will Beat the Reds
The Reds have lost each of their last 10 home games against American League opponents.
The underdogs have won eight of the Reds' last nine games at Great American Ball Park.
The Reds have failed to cover the run line in each of their last eight games as home favorites against American League opponents.
The underdogs have covered the run line in each of the Reds' last six games at Great American Ball Park.
The Athletics have led after 5 innings in 14 of their last 21 games as underdogs against NL Central opponents.
Reds Pitching Has to be Better

The Reds' pitching was awful on Wednesday, scoring six runs, but the pitching gave up nine and that led to the defeat. Casey Kelly went 2.1 innings, giving up five hits and three runs. The Reds are averaging 4.55 runs, while their pitching is giving up 4.24 runs per game.

The offense is ranked 14th in the league, while the pitching is ranked 12th. Elly De La Cruz has hit 22 home runs and driven in 59 RBIs. Getting the start for the Reds will be Julian Aguiar who sits with a 1-0 record and an ERA of 3.60. In his last start against the Pittsburgh Pirates, he went six innings giving up three hits and two runs. The Reds will face the Brewers and Astros following this series.

Oakland Athletics vs Cincinnati Reds Prediction

The A’s and Reds are both going to struggle to get the offense going here. Aguilar gave up two runs in his last start, and he went six innings. The A's offense has been a major issue, and they are going to really struggle to get the offense going. The Reds' offense is ranked 14th, but they are going to struggle here too with the bats. This game will have only four or five runs scored. Back the under to cash.
