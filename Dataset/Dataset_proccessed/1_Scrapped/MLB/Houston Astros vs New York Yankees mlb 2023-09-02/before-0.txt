Before Prairie View opens against arch-rival Texas Southern in the Labor Day Classic on September 02, 2023, it will have a plan in place. Last season, the Panthers defeated Texas Southern 40-23.

The Panthers’ recent bragging rights date back to March 16, 2021, when it defeated Texas Southern twice in one year. The final decision, 20-19, and September 4, 2021, 40-17, as the Corona Virus outbreak carried an output that strained the world. 

This season’s experience is on the Panthers’ side, with 11 players named to the Phil Steele preseason all-SWAC team. Second-team running back Ahmad Antoine, quarterback Trazon Connley, and linebacker Keyshawn Johnson will provide help. The third team features offensive linemen Eric Dunn and Arrington Taylor, linebackers Trevion Green and Warren Shankle, free safety Tario Mulmore, running back Caleb Johnson, kicker Carlos Villagomez and receiver Brian Jenkins, Jr.

Duo threat Connolly led the offense last season, passing for 1,478 and 11 touchdowns. He compiled 661 rushing yards.

After day one of training camp, coach McDowell felt good about the quarterback position. All three performed well, according to McDowell. 

Still, other things could have gone better, McDowell explained.

McDowell reminded his team to avoid mental mistakes and play up to their experience ahead of its matchup versus Texas Southern. 

With 18 incoming recruits, McDowell and his staff expect to have its hands full.
