2023 Topps Update value

2023 Topps Update has a lot of inserts, relics, and autographs to chase, but how does it hold its value? Let’s take a look at what hobby boxes from the last few years sell for today.

Shop for boxes of 2023 Topps Update on eBay

Year	Topps Update Hobby Box Comp Price
2023	$80
2022	$145-160
2021	$45-60
2020	$35-60

As you can see, recent sales for the last few year of hobby boxes have been a bit all over the place. Differences in format, rookies included, and the like can affect prices year to year.

Unless you feel particularly good about a crop of rookies, I’m not sure these are the best buy-and-hold unopened candidates.

In terms of singles, looking at sales of 2022 Topps Update cards in PSA 10 slabs, the big seller are various rarer parallels and SSPs of Julio Rodriguez.

Sales in the $1,000 to $1,500 range for those cards appear to be the high water mark for 2022 Topps Update singles. Bobby Witt Jr. makes a few appearances in the $500-1,000 range, along with a few more J-Rod cards. Everything else is well south of those price points.

Does 2023 Topps Update have any rookie cards of the caliber of Julio Rodriguez or Bobby Witt Jr.?

We’ll take a closer look at that soon here at Cardlines, but there aren’t as many big hype prospects as last year at first glance.  

Final thoughts on Topps Update 2023

Closing the final chapter of the Topps Flagship Trilogy for 2023, 2023 Topps Update offers collectors a lot to like.

There are a lot of inserts, parallels, and autographs to make for an enjoyable chase. But does 2023 Topps Update have the caliber of rookie card that we saw in 2022? Time will tell.

Mike's collecting focus is centered on graded cards, mostly rookie cards, of Hall of Famers and future Hall of Famers. Lately, he's been enjoying dabbling in graded minor league cards. A collector/investor with a "buy and hold" approach, Mike takes the long-term view with his collection.
