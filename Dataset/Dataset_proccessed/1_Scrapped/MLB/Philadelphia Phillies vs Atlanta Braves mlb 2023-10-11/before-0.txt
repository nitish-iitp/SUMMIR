On the cover NH Music Collective is all over our Music This Week listings, with its artists playing at restaurants and breweries as well as on stages dedicated to music, like the Bank of NH Stage. Michael Witthaus tells the story of the creation of this booking, production and artist development operation. Photo above and on the cover comes courtesy the NH Music Collective and is of April Cushman and Brad Myrick. Also on the cover: We’re still in the thick of festival season. Find a weekend of fun at the Warner Fall Foliage Festival (page 19) and the Milford Pumpkin Festival (page 18). And we check in with the Currier Museum of Art to get the details of this season’s exhibitions (page 14).
