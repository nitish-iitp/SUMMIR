You don't always need to poke the bear. Especially if the bear is named Bryce Harper.

After Harper's base-running mishap saw the Philadelphia Phillies lose Game 2 of the NLDS, Atlanta Braves shortstop Orlando Arcia reportedly mocked the two-time NL MVP in the aftermath.

Arcia in the Braves' locker room "cackled emphatically about Harper's misfortune, bellowing "ha-ha, atta-boy, Harper!" repeatedly," reported Jake Mintz of FOX Sports from the scene.

In Game 3 at home Wednesday, Harper got his revenge more than once. He unleashed a three-run homer in the third inning to give Philadelphia a 4-1 lead, then stared down Arcia as he rounded second.

Harper didn't move on from the unspoken feud after that.

In the fifth inning, he launched a solo homer -- his second of the game -- and made sure to stare down Arcia once again on second base. The Phillies' social media team also kept the receipts.
