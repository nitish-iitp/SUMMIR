Wake Up and Watch the Cubs Turn a Win Into a Loss and Back Into a Win
Brett Taylor
Sep 12, 2023
CHICAGO CUBS

If you’d told me beforehand that last night’s game was going to be a wild one, worthy of immediately re-watching the highlights in the morning, I am sure I would have assumed Pete Crow-Armstrong was involved. Some of that is his nature – he’s a highlight machine – but it’s also just that it was his first game. If things got crazy, surely he was at the center of it!

But not really. Although PCA did make his debut, it was a mostly quiet one. Routine plays in the outfield. A caught stealing (on a very nice play by the Rockies). A sacrifice bunt. In a way, it was a perfect reflection of how we saw his incorporation going: he’s not here to be the hero. A nice, complementary piece, getting a taste of the big leagues ahead of brighter days in the future.

Instead, there were a lot of other heroes you could point to last night, which is almost always true in a one-run win. The Cubs ultimately prevailed last night against the Rockies 5-4, scoring twice in the top of the 9th after blowing a 3-1 lead late.

Jordan Wicks went six innings and allowed just one run at Coors Field. Christopher Morel hit one further than he’s ever hit one. Yan Gomes came up clutch twice. Dansby Swanson and Ian Happ pulled off a critical double-steal in the 9th. Drew Smyly was great as a bridge reliever. Michael Fulmer got a particularly terrifying save.

Let’s enjoy the highlights again (or watch them for the first time if you were otherwise occupied with Monday Night Football and THAT wild game). It was a late blown lead turns into a late comeback turns into a white-knuckle hold on at the end.

First, the Cubs-centric highlight package from Marquee:

And now the more full highlight set from MLB:
