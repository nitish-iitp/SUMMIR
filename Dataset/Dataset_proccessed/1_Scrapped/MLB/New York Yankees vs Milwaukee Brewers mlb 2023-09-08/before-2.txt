Autographs and memorabilia are the stars in 2023 Panini Immaculate Baseball. In fact, all cards in the product are hits.

Six-card hobby boxes have four signed cards and a pair of relics. Like all of Panini’s 2023 products, the checklist consists entirely of prospects and retired stars.

2023 Panini Immaculate Baseball Checklist Overview

Autographs are available in several places on the 2023 Immaculate Baseball checklist, however Prospect Patch Autographs rank among the most notable. These include on-card signatures from a deep mix of young standouts.

Some of the toughest parallels for these use unique pieces like logos.

Although not all of the product’s autographs are on-card, there are several places to find hard signatures. According to Panini, these include card styles like shadowbox cards, multi-signature cards and autographed memorabilia with more than one swatch.

Jumbo Bat Signatures is a place to find both prospects and stars from the past.

Clearly Immaculate Material Signatures uses pieces of acetate for the autograph.

Jumbo memorabilia cards come with huge swatches of prospect-worn gear. It’s not just jerseys, either. Batting gloves, jackets, caps and other types of gear can be found in these. No individual card for these has more than 10 copies.

Getting to the greats, Jersey Numbers Materials highlight some famous numbers worn on legends’ backs to act as a memorabilia showcase.

Dual Legends Materials pair up two players and their relics.

Immaculate Black Materials, Hall of Fame Jumbo Materials, Immaculate Moments, Prime Prospects Memorabilia and Quad Legends Memorabilia are among the other themes found on the checklist.
