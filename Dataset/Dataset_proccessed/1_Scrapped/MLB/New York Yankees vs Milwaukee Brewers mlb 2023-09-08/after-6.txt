Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Sal Frelick had perhaps the catch of the year during Sunday’s finale against the New York Yankees.  His catch came during the 10th inning of a scoreless ballgame and at the time his team had not allowed a single hit.

With big Joey Wiemer bearing down on him at the wall, Sal Frelick made the play of the year to push this game — and the Brewers’ bid for a no-hitter — to the 11th inning. Sweet sassy molassy. pic.twitter.com/XXSHMFQrZs

There are a few impressive aspects about this catch from Sal Frelick that at the time preserved a no-hitter  Not only was it highly improbable that he got to the ball, but he then held on to it despite having contact with the outfield wall and his teammate Joey Wiemer.  After the play occurred fans reacted on social media.
