INJURIES
Activated from 60-day IL
The Reds activated Encarnacion-Strand (wrist) from the 60-day injured list Monday.
Impact The move was required because Encarnacion-Strand is in the Arizona Fall League on a rehab assignment, which has expired. He will continue to play in the AFL and is now back on the Reds' 40-man roster after missing most of the season following wrist surgery.

Will play in AFL games
Encarnacion-Strand (wrist) will play in the Arizona Fall League, Gordon Wittenmyer of The Cincinnati Enquirer reports.
Impact Encarnacion-Strand was limited to just 29 games this season due to a wrist injury which eventually required surgery. He will make up for at-bats he lost during the year with some Fall League games and should head into spring training without any restrictions.

Begins baseball activities
Encarnacion-Strand (wrist) has been cleared to begin baseball activities, Charlie Goldsmith of The Cincinnati Enquirer reports.
Impact Encarnacion-Strand underwent surgery in mid-July to repair ligaments in his fractured right wrist. He has already been ruled out for the remainder of the regular season, but the 24-year-old will hope to have a normal offseason after getting the go-ahead to ramp things up this month.

Hopes to be back for playoff run
Encarnacion-Strand (wrist) hopes to be ready to return during a potential playoff run for the Reds, Charlie Goldsmith of the Cincinnati Enquirer reports.
Impact Encarnacion-Strand underwent surgery a month ago to repair ligaments in his fractured right wrist and has yet to resume baseball activities. While the infielder is holding out hope that he could possibly impact a postseason run for the Reds, the likelihood is high that he will ultimately be held out until next season. Still, the fact that it's even a remote possibility indicates that Encarnacion-Strand should have a relatively normal offseason if all goes well.

Undergoes surgery
Encarnacion-Strand underwent surgery to repair ligaments in his fractured right wrist Thursday, MLB.com reports.
Impact The recovery time is estimated to be three months, which means Encarnacion-Strand is unlikely to return until next year. The Reds are getting by with a combination of Spencer Steer and Jeimer Candelario at first base.

Follow-up exam on June 5
Encarnacion-Strand (wrist) will have a follow-up exam on June 5, Charlie Goldsmith of The Cincinnati Enquirer reports.
Impact That will be the four-week mark of Encarnacion-Strand's projected 4-to-6 week timetable as he recovers from a fracture in his right wrist, so it would appear he's not going to make it back on the early side of that timeline. Encarnacion-Strand would presumably require a rehab assignment before returning.

Impact Initial imaging after Encarnacion-Strand was hit on the hand by a pitch late last month came back clean, but subsequent tests revealed a right ulnar styloid fracture. The 24-year-old has hit a disappointing .190/.220/.293 with two home runs in 29 games for the Reds this season. Cincinnati is starting Jeimer Candelario at first base and Santiago Espinal at third base against a left-hander Wednesday. The newly-added Mike Ford will give them an option versus righties.

Resting for first time in 2024
Encarnacion-Strand is out of the lineup for Wednesday's game in Seattle.
Impact He'll be riding pine for the first time this season while Spencer Steer replaces him at first base and while Stuart Fairchild steps in as the Reds' No. 3 hitter. Before an 0-for-4 showing in Tuesday's 3-1 loss, Encarnacion-Strand had delivered exactly two hits in four of his preceding six starts.

Walks off Nats
Encarnacion-Strand went 1-for-5 with a solo home run in Sunday's 6-5 victory over Washington.
Impact The Reds made a dramatic comeback in the bottom of the ninth, plating three two-out runs to gain the win. After Will Benson tied the game with a two-run shot, Encarnacion-Strand walked it off with a solo blast. The homer was his first hit after going 0-for-12 to start the season.

Knocks 13th homer
Encarnacion-Strand went 2-for-5 with a home run, three RBI and two runs scored in Friday's win over the Cardinals.
Impact Encarnacion-Strand launched a three-run homer as part of the Reds' seven-run fourth inning. It was one of the team's six home runs in the contest. The rookie slugger has gone deep 13 times, including seven times over his last 10 games. Encarnacion-Strand is now slashing .274/.328/.488 with 37 RBI and 20 extra-base hits through 232 plate appearances.

Homers keep coming
Encarnacion-Strand went 1-for-5 with a two-run home run and a second run scored in Tuesday's 11-7 win over Cleveland.
Impact Encarnacion-Strand smacked a two-run home run as part of the Reds' three-run third inning, which helped the team survive an early onslaught by the Guardians. The rookie is making a case as the team's best hitter down the stretch. The home run was Encarnacion-Strand's sixth in the last eight games, during which he's slashing .367/.406/.967 with 12 RBI. For the season, he has 12 homers over 59 games.

Plates four runs in shocking loss
Encarnacion-Strand went 3-for-5 with a home run, two total runs and four total RBI in a loss to the Pirates on Saturday.
Impact Encarnacion-Strand put Cincinnati on the board with a two-run homer in the first inning. He added a run-scoring single in the second to help the team build an early 9-0 advantage. However, Pittsburgh came storming back to build a 13-9 lead before Encarnacion-Strand's eighth-inning single brought home another run to make the score 13-11. The rookie's big day ultimately went to waste, however, as the Pirates pulled off a one-run win. The four RBI were the most Encarnacion-Strand was recorded in a game thus far in his brief career. He's been on a power surge of late, knocking four homers over his past six games to give him 10 long balls on the season.

Belts homer in loss
Encarnacion-Strand went 1-for-3 with a solo home run in Wednesday's 5-3 loss to Minnesota.
Impact Encarnacion-Strand launched his ninth homer in the fourth inning, the rookie's third homer over the last four games. A slumping Elly De La Cruz, who sat out for the third time in the last six contests, has opened a few extra opportunities for Encarnacion-Strand and Noelvi Marte on the left side of the infield.

Absent from lineup
Encarnacion-Strand is not in the lineup for Monday's game versus the Twins.
Impact Encarnacion-Strand has hit home runs in both of his last two games, but those are the only two starts he's made in the Reds' past five contests, as his playing time versus righties has been lagging since Joey Votto returned from the injured list. Votto will pick up the start at first base Monday.

Homers again
Encarnacion-Strand went 2-for-4 with a two-run home run in Sunday's 8-4 loss to the Mets.
Impact Encarnacion-Strand homered for a second time in as many days; however, Sunday's blast didn't carry the same impact as his game-winning hit the previous day. He's given the Reds a lift during the chase for the playoffs, registering a .341/.370/.591 slash line with three home runs and seven RBI over 13 September games.

Comes up big in win over Mets
Encarnacion-Strand went 2-for-3 with a two-run home run and a stolen base in Saturday's 3-2 win over the Mets.
Impact Getting the start at third base and batting seventh, Encarnacion-Strand delivered what proved to be the winning runs when he lofted a Tylor Megill fastball over the fence in right-center field in the fourth inning. Encarnacion-Strand hasn't been seeing regular playing time lately on a crowded Reds roster, but the 23-year-old has been making the most of his opportunities, slashing .325/.357/.525 through 12 games in September with two doubles, two homers, four runs and five RBI.

Playing time trending down
Encarnacion-Strand is out of the lineup for Friday's game against the Mets.
Impact Encarnacion-Strand will be on the bench for the fourth time in five games, with two absences coming against right-handed pitchers and two coming versus left-handed pitchers. With the power-hitting rookie no longer looking to be assured of even a short-side platoon role at this point, he's tough to justify holding outside of NL-only or dynasty/keeper leagues. Encarnacion-Strand's downturn in playing time comes even as he's gotten off to a solid start to September with a .297/.333/.432 slash line through 11 games.

ROTOWIRE
On bench again Thursday
Encarnacion-Strand is absent from the lineup for Thursday's contest in Detroit.
Impact Encarnacion-Strand started Wednesday's game and reached base twice, but this now marks the third time he's been out of the lineup in the Reds' last four contests. With Joey Votto back from the injured list and Jake Fraley limited to designated hitter duty, the playing time squeeze for Encarnacion-Strand could continue.
