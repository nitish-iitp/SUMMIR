Aaron Judge belted his major-league-leading 54th home run, Carlos Rodon threw six shutout innings and the visiting New York Yankees bombarded the Oakland Athletics 10-0 on Saturday night, giving manager Aaron Boone his 600th career win. The Yankees (91-64) reduced their magic number to three to clinch the American League East after the Detroit Tigers beat the Baltimore Orioles 6-4 earlier Saturday. Judge hit a leadoff homer in the seventh to give the Yankees a 7-0 lead. New York roughed up Oakland ace JP Sears (11-12) for six runs and nine hits in five innings. Sears struck out six and walked two. The Yankees scored two runs in the first inning. Gleyber Torres scored on Giancarlo Stanton's double play and Jasson Dominguez hit an RBI single. Anthony Volpe pushed the lead to 3-0, hitting a leadoff blast in the second inning for his 12th homer of the season. Stanton added to the Yankees' lead in the third. He hit a three-run shot -- his 26th of the year -- to give New York a 6-0 cushion. Rodon (16-9) allowed five hits and one walk with four strikeouts in six shutout innings to add to his career high in wins. Boone became the seventh manager in Yankees history to reach 600 wins, joining Joe McCarthy (1,460), Joe Torre (1,173), Casey Stengel (1,149), Miller Huggins (1,067), Ralph Houk (944) and Joe Girardi (910). Stanton finished 2-for-4 with two runs and three RBIs for the Yankees, who pounded out 14 hits. Torres helped pave the way with three hits and two RBIs. Judge, Juan Soto and Jon Berti added two hits apiece. Volpe, Judge and Soto also scored twice apiece. Shea Langeliers had a double and a single for the A's (67-88), who will play the Yankees for the final time in Oakland on Sunday. Oakland finished with just five hits. --Field Level Media
