Why these Yankees fixtures may have had their last day in pinstripes
By Dan Martin

The Yankees don’t play another game in The Bronx until next April.

The home finale on Monday, played in front of a sparse — to be generous — crowd, thanks to Saturday’s rainout, offered a look at some of the organization’s younger players (one of those, Austin Wells, provided the decisive homer in Tuesday night’s win in Toronto).

With a playoff-less October ahead, though, everyone from Hal Steinbrenner to Aaron Judge to Aaron Boone is saying significant changes need to be made this offseason after the team’s worst performance in at least seven years — and arguably, in decades.

It’s fair to wonder just who will be back in 2024.
