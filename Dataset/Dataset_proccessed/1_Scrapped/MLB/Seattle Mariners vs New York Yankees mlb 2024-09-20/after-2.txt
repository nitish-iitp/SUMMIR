Hello everyone! As we get this Friday underway, let’s recap a historic day in baseball.

In Mariners news...
Davy Andrews at Fangraphs celebrates the success of Victor Robles.

Around the league...
Shohei Ohtani has done it, becoming the first player ever to record a 50/50 season following a 3-homer, 2-steal performance against the Marlins yesterday.
He made history while making history!
Charlie Culberson announced his retirement yesterday — an attempted transition to pitching this season hadn’t exactly panned out for the former infielder.
My takeaway from this: Jerry was right?
Jonatan Clase is back up in the majors! (And yes, that’s Bo Bichette landing on the injured list...again. He’s done for the season.)

Anders’ picks...
Yeah, you guys have fun at Toy Story 7, I’m gonna go zipline.
