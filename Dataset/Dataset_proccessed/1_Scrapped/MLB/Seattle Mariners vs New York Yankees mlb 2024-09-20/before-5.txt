Rangers' Offense Needs to be Better

The Rangers faced off against the Toronto Blue Jays on Thursday, and the offense failed to score any runs. The Rangers had only two hits, and they didn’t put a whole lot of pressure on the Blue Jays. The Rangers are averaging 4.17 runs per game, while their pitching is giving up 4.56 runs per game. The offense is ranked 21st in the league, while the pitching is ranked 20th. The Rangers have a negative run differential of -0.39, which is 22nd in the league. Getting the start for the Rangers will Jacob DeGrom who hasn’t given up a run this season. Against the Mariners, he went 3.2 innings giving up four hits and zero runs. 

Seattle Mariners vs Texas Rangers Prediction

DeGrom didn’t give up a run in his first start against the Mariners, but he was playing with fire, and in this game that fire is going to be a problem. The Mariners aren’t exactly known for running up the score, but they are going to find success here. Kirby is going to have a strong start, and that is going to be the difference here as the Mariners are going to get the job done. Back the Mariners.
