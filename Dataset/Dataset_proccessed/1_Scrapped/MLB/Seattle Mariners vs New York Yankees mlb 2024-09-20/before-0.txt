MLB DFS: DraftKings, FanDuel Daily Fantasy Baseball Picks (9/20/24) - Today's Top Lineups
4 months ago
by MIKE BARNER
 

Friday brings another busy 15-game slate across baseball. There are a few early start times, but we still have 12 games to choose players from for the main evening slates on DraftKings and FanDuel.

This article will provide my daily fantasy baseball lineup picks for DraftKings and FanDuel on 9/20/2024, with the slate starting at 7:05 p.m. EDT. The lineup picks will range from some elite players to mid-priced options and value plays.

You can also read more DFS advice and lineup picks for other sports here. Monitoring injury news and today's MLB starting lineups is also essential. Good luck, RotoBallers!

 

DraftKings, FanDuel Pitchers - MLB DFS Lineup Picks

Joe Musgrove vs. CWS ($9,100 DraftKings; $9,900 FanDuel)

Musgrove has logged at least six innings in four of his last five starts. In three of those outings, he didn’t allow a single run while posting at least eight strikeouts. Not only have the White Sox scored the fewest runs in baseball, but they have scored more than 100 runs fewer than the next worst team. Expect to see Musgrove in a ton of lineups, and rightfully so.

Charlie Morton at MIA ($8,500 DraftKings; $9,700 FanDuel)

The veteran Morton has a 2.68 ERA and a 1.26 WHIP over his last seven starts. He has lowered his WHIP to 1.30, compared to his 1.43 WHIP last season. His strikeout rate is on pace to decline for the third straight season, but it’s respectable at 24.5%. The Marlins have scored the third-fewest runs in baseball, leaving Morton with a favorable opportunity to stay hot.

Michael Wacha vs. SF ($8,200 DraftKings; $9,500 FanDuel)

Wacha is one of the main reasons why the Royals are in the playoff hunt. He has helped stabilize their starting rotation, recording a 3.29 ERA and a 3.66 FIP. He induces plenty of weak contact, holding opponents to a 32.4% hard-hit rate. This is a great matchup for him versus the Giants, who only have a .683 OPS versus right-handed pitchers.

Also consider: Gerrit Cole at OAK

DraftKings, FanDuel Infielders - MLB DFS Lineup Picks

Matt Olson – 1B, ATL vs. Valente Bellozo ($5,200 DK; $3,500 FD)

Olson is heating up as the Braves push for a playoff spot. He launched two more home runs Thursday, making him 17-for-42 (.405) with three home runs and five doubles across his last 12 games. Bellozo might not seem like the easiest matchup if you only look at his 3.70 ERA, but his FIP is far worse at 5.59. He has also given up 1.9 HR/9.

Mark Vientos – 1B/3B, NYM vs. Cristopher Sanchez ($4,600 DK; $3,100 FD)

Vientos started this series against the Phillies on a high note, going 2-for-4 with a home run Thursday. Facing a left-handed pitcher at home makes Vientos an appealing option. He has a .395 wOBA at home this season and a .397 wOBA versus lefties.

Zach Neto – SS, LAA vs. Justin Verlander ($4,200 DK; $3,100 FD)

Neto is mired in a 2-for-29 slump. Still, he has 21 home runs and 30 stolen bases for the season. This might be just the matchup that he needs to get back on track. Verlander has looked like a shell of himself down the stretch, posting a 7.99 ERA and a 1.71 WHIP across his last seven starts.

Also consider: Pete Alonso, Jazz Chisholm Jr., Luisangel Acuna

 

DraftKings, FanDuel Outfielders - MLB DFS Lineup Picks

Mookie Betts – OF/2B/SS, LAD vs. Kyle Freeland ($6,200 DK; $4,200 FD)

While Freeland has been better this season, he still has a 4.89 ERA and a 4.41 FIP. His 9.2% barrel rate allowed is on pace to be the second-highest mark of his career. This is still a great opportunity to roll with Betts, who has a career .237 ISO and .386 wOBA versus left-handed pitchers.

Tommy Edman – OF/2B/SS, LAD vs. Kyle Freeland ($4,100 DK; $3,200 FD)

Edman has a staggering .500 ISO and .563 wOBA against lefties this season. A small sample size has contributed to those numbers, but he does have a career .222 ISO and .352 wOBA versus southpaws. In comparison, righties have limited him to a .120 ISO and a .303 wOBA. He is an excellent option for any Dodgers stack.

Jasson Dominguez – OF, NYY vs. J.T. Ginn ($3,400 DK; $2,700 FD)

Dominguez has a combination of power and speed that makes him one of the top prospects in baseball. He has at least one hit in three of his last four games and he has drawn at least one walk in five of his last six games. Ginn has a 4.44 FIP and a 1.39 WHIP across 23.2 innings, leaving Dominguez with the potential to provide value.

Also consider: Corbin Carroll, Teoscar Hernandez, Taylor Ward
