Stats Insider's Braves vs Rockies predictions are based on detailed simulations and betting experience to give you the best possible advice every day of the year.

Making use of the edges published on Stats Insider is crucial to achieving long-term profitability.

Even though the Braves are more likely to cover the line, our best bet of Rockies +1.5 is based on the probability of that happening, as suggested by our predictive analytics model, and the best odds available.
