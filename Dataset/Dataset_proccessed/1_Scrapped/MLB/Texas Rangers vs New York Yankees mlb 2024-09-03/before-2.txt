This article features Stats Insider's prediction and tips for the Rangers vs Yankees game, as well as the latest betting odds in Australia.

Who Will Win?

Using advanced machine learning and data, Stats Insider has simulated the result of Tuesday's Texas vs NY Yankees MLB match-up 10,000 times.

Our leading predictive analytics model currently gives the Yankees a 60% chance of beating the Rangers at Globe Life Field.

Looking at the latest head-to-head odds, the bookmakers currently have the Rangers at $2.56 and the Yankees at $1.54.

The Rangers are listed as 1.5-run underdogs against the Yankees, with odds of $1.98 available at TAB.

The over/under for total runs scored is set at 8.5 with TAB, which has odds of $1.91 for the over and $1.91 for the under.

These Rangers vs Yankees best bets are based on market-leading simulations and betting intelligence to bring you the best possible advice every day of the year.

While the Yankees have a higher chance of winning the game, betting on the Rangers to win is our recommended option because of the 2.2% edge identified when comparing our data-led probabilities to the odds currently available.

Taking advantage of the edges seen here at Stats Insider is one of the keys to achieving long-term success as a punter.

Furthermore, despite the Over being more likely to hit in this game, Under 8.5 is our best bet due to the better odds ($1.91) that are available from TAB.
