Padres, definitely.
Orioles and Astros can just tip their cap to the opposing pitchers yesterday and are capable of bouncing back.
The Mets came back twice in Atlanta and came back twice in Milwaukee on zero rest. You have to give the Brewers a shot based on how they handled Manaea last week; but the Mets are showing signs of going on a pixie dust run.

The Mets announce they’ve avoided arbitration with all six arbitration eligible players and agreed to a one-year deal with each.
These players were tendered contracts by the team back at the non-tender deadline in November.

Kiké Hernández has now been linked to a rival NL team as we get closer & closer to free agency 😔
Kiké has made it clear his top priority is to re-sign with the Dodgers but will go to a team that will be playing in October as a Plan B.
