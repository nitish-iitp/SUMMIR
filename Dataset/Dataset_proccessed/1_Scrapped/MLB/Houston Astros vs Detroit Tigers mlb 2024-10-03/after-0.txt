Andy Ibanez smashed a three-run double in the eighth inning to help the Detroit Tigers defeat the Houston Astros 5-2 to advance to the American League Division Series.

Detroit swept the best-of-three AL Wild Card Series to reach a second-round matchup against the Cleveland Guardians, who host the opener on Saturday.

The Kansas City Royals also advanced, finishing a two-game sweep of the Baltimore Orioles with a 2-1 win in the second game of their AL Wild Card Series.

In National League action, the San Diego Padres held off the Atlanta Braves 5-4 to advance, but the Milwaukee Brewers rallied with three runs in the eighth inning for a 5-3 victory over the New York Mets to force a decisive Game 3 on Thursday.

The upstart Tigers, who had not reached the playoffs since 2014 and had not won a playoff series since 2013, ousted an Astros club that had reached the AL Championship Series in each of the past seven seasons.

"We just needed to believe," Ibanez said. "That's the one thing we were missing. We believed coming into this series, and we ended up beating a great team in the Astros, and now we're moving on."

With the contest deadlocked and the bases loaded, Ibanez blasted the game-winning hit down the left-field line off left-handed Houston relief pitcher Josh Hader.

"I think that was the best at-bat of my life," Ibanez, a 31-year-old Cuban, said through a translator.

"The coaches were telling me to be ready to face a left-hander, and the moment finally came."

The Royals, in the playoffs for the first time since winning the World Series in 2015, will face the New York Yankees in the second round.

"This group is special," said Royals shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., who drove in the winning run for the second game in a row. "We're not done yet."

The Orioles lost their 10th consecutive playoff game. They haven't won a playoff series since 2014.

For the Brewers, 20-year-old rookie Jackson Chourio led off the eighth inning with his second home run of the game, an opposite-field shot off Phil Maton that tied the game.

Garrett Mitchell followed with a two-run blast that put the Brewers up 5-3, and relief pitcher Devin Williams retired three straight Mets batters to close out the win.

In San Diego, the Padres scored five runs with two outs in the second inning and made the lead stand up to book a second-round clash with Shohei Ohtani and the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Kyle Higashioka homered to start the outburst. Three Padres batters hit singles before Manny Machado hit a two-run double and Jackson Merrill smacked a two-run triple as San Diego took a 5-1 lead.

Jorge Soler homered in the fifth for Atlanta, and Michael Harris II belted a two-run homer in the eighth before the Padres polished it off.

When Higashioka caught Travis D'Arnaud's pop-up foul for the final out, Padres fans began chanting "Beat LA!" It will be the third time in five years that the National League West division rivals will play in the NL Division Series.

"This is what everyone wanted," Machado said of the matchup with the Dodgers.

"And, you know, it's been a hell of a year for both teams going back and forth. It's going to be an exciting series for us to go out there and play the Dodgers."
