Shohei Ohtani done for 2023 season with oblique injury: Has he played his last game for Angels?

ANAHEIM, Calif. — The Los Angeles Angels placed Shohei Ohtani on the 10-day injured list Saturday with an oblique injury and said he will not play again this season.

Ohtani’s locker was cleared out following the Angels’ 11-2 loss to the Detroit Tigers at home Friday. A fully packed All-Star Game duffel bag was sitting in front of it, and nearly all of his baseball gear and personal belongings were no longer in his locker.

The Angels declined to say Friday if his roster status had changed, or what the reason was for the contents of his locker being removed. Los Angeles general manager Perry Minasian said Saturday that Ohtani got an MRI at 4 p.m. PT Friday and got the results around the first inning, which is why his locker was packed up.

Ohtani, 29, has missed the last 11 games with the oblique injury. Angels manager Phil Nevin stated that the superstar was day to day for every game, but he never got back on the field. The injury was not considered serious, and there wasn’t initially an expectation that he’d go on the injured list.

Ohtani also has a UCL tear in his pitching elbow, it was revealed last month. While that would prevent him from pitching, he continued to hit in the days afterward. Ohtani’s agent, Nez Balelo, told reporters last week that he believed Ohtani getting some surgical procedure was inevitable. But he declined to get into specifics.

Minasian said Saturday that he anticipates Ohtani getting a surgical procedure for his UCL soon, but that he doesn’t know the procedure.

Ohtani has put together one of the greatest seasons of all time. He has posted a 1.066 OPS at the plate, along with a 3.14 ERA on the mound.

He’ll be a free agent after the season; it’s possible Ohtani has played his final game in an Angels uniform. The team still intends to pursue Ohtani, who will be at the ballpark Saturday and during the final homestand, in free agency.
