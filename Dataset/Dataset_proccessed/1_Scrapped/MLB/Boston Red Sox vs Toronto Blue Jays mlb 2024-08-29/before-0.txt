Cheat Sheet and Projections

We have reviewed every player from every team to help you find the best selections on Thursday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Christopher Sale (ATL, P)	$24,290	21.8	0.9
Value	Walker Buehler (LAD, P)	$10,840	13.6	1.3
Fade	Adrian Del Castillo (ARI, C)	$10,550	2.3	0.2
Cheapie	Thomas Pham (STL, OF)	$5,000	6	1.2

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks provide the most "bang for your buck," meaning they're expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For budget-conscious strategies, "cheapie" options highlight the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

When building your MLB Thursday teams, consider starting with a value player like Walker Buehler. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Christopher Sale is a strong option. If you're looking for budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, check out our cheapie options, including Thomas Pham.

On the other hand, according to our model, Adrian Del Castillo is one of the worst value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if putting together multiple line-ups.
