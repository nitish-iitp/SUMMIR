By Paul Hoynes, cleveland.com

CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The Guardians’ 2023 season wasn’t a success in the standings, but at the turnstile it was all good.

In Wednesday’s home finale, the Guardians drew 28,915 fans to Progressive Field to bid farewell to outgoing manager Terry Francona. A 4-3 victory over the Reds to keep possession of the Ohio Cup added to the celebration.

Still, the Guardians are going home after their three-game weekend series against the Tigers at Comerica Park. Last year they were preparing for the postseason on the way to winning the AL Central with 92 victories.

Those 92 wins last year, and a deep postseason run by the youngest team in baseball, were part of the reason the Guardians experienced a 41.5% jump in attendance this season.

They drew 1,834,068 fans in 78 home dates. That’s an increase of 538,198 over last year’s total of 1,295,870.

It’s their third-biggest season at the gate in the last 11 years. They drew over 2 million fans in 2017, the year after they went to the World Series. In 2018, they drew over 1.9 million after they won 102 games in 2017.

The Guardians currently rank 21st in attendance among MLB’s 30 teams.

There are several possibilities why attendance increased this year.

The unexpected success of the 2022 season played a big part. Other factors included the new rules that shortened games and increased action; and the balanced schedule which had each team playing every other team in the big leagues.
