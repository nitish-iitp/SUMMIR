The projected starting pitcher for Atlanta is Chris Sale, who is 16-3 with a 2.38 ERA and a 1.00 WHIP over 166.2 innings pitched this year. Sale has allowed zero earned runs in his last two starts and two earned runs or fewer in five straight outings. 

Why the Braves will beat the Dodgers
The home team has won each of the last five games between the Dodgers and Braves.
The Dodgers have lost each of their last five night games against NL East opponents following a loss.
The Braves have covered the run line in seven of their last eight night games against teams that held a winning record.
The Dodgers have failed to cover the run line in four of their last five games as underdogs against National League opponents.
Total Runs Facts
Thirteen of the Braves' last 14 home games have gone UNDER the total runs line.
Ten of the Dodgers' last 12 night games after playing the previous day have gone OVER the total runs line.
The 'Inning 1 UNDER 0.5 runs' market has hit in each of the Dodgers' last six games as road underdogs.
The 'Inning 1 UNDER 0.5 runs' market has hit in each of the Braves' last four games as home favorites.
LA Dodgers vs Atlanta Braves Prediction 

Atlanta comes into this game looking for their second straight win in the series and they are chasing the Mets for second in the NL East and the last wild card spot in the NL. The Braves are 41-31 at home this season, while the Dodgers are 39-33 on the road. Los Angeles has struggled over the last week, but they still have a decent lead in the NL West. This should be a fantastic pitching matchup between two very good pitchers, but I have to give the edge to Atlanta, who is 6-0 in Sale’s last six starts.
