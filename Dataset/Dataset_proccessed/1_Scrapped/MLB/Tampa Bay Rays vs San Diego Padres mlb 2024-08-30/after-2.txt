In the standings

San Diego Padres (76-60, 3rd in NL West)

Settling for a split in St. Louis dropped the Padres five games behind the Dodgers in the division and one game behind the Diamondbacks in the race for the NL’s top wild-card spot. They are up two games on the Braves, the current No.6 seed, and three games up on the Mets, the immediate team on the outside looking in. The Padres took two of three against the Rays last year in San Diego. This is the Padres’ first trip to Tampa Bay since 2016.

Pérez has a 2.70 ERA in 26 ⅔ innings since the trade deadline. Pérez has a 5.98 ERA in 87⅓ innings against the Rays, including seven runs in 3⅓ innings last year while in Texas’ rotation.

Saturday

Padres RHP Randy Vásquez (4-6, 4.52 ERA)   |   He won his return from Triple-A El Paso, allowing two runs on six hits and two walks in six innings in St. Louis. Vásquez has a 5.67 ERA on the road, compared to 3.24 at Petco Park. This is Vásquez’s first appearance against the Rays.
Rays RHP Shane Baz (1-2, 3.48 ERA)   |   He’s struck out 36 against 17 walks in eight starts (44 IP) since returning from the Tommy John surgery that wiped out his 2023 season. The 25-year-old was drafted 12th overall in 2017. This is his first appearance against the Padres. He was scratched from his last start with the flu.

Training room
San Diego: RHP Yu Davish’s ramp-up will continue in Arizona, where he’ll be joined by SS Ha-Seong Kim (shoulder). Kim is swinging and throwing, but he is not yet throwing across the diamond. OF Fernando Tatis Jr. (quad) is also facing pitching in Arizona, but neither Tatis nor Kim is expected to face Darvish. LHP Wandy Peralta (groin) has thrown two rehab games and is a candidate to join the team when rosters expand on Sunday.
Tampa Bay: RHP Pete Fairbanks (lat) remains without a timetable, but will be hard-pressed to return this season. RHP Zack Littell (shoulder) should return in early September. Long-term, LHP Shane McClanahan (Tommy John) is out until next season.
