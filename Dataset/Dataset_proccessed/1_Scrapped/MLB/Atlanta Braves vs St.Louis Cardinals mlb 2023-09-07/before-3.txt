The 2023 Major League Baseball (MLB) season has brought significant changes to the sport, aimed at enhancing the fan experience and speeding up games. Here’s a look at what’s happening in baseball this year:

Rule Changes: In a bid to shorten games and increase offense, MLB introduced several rule changes for the 2023 season. These include a pitch clock, restrictions on the infield shift, and larger bases, as reported by CNBC and ESPN.
Game Length: The new rules have had an impact on game duration. A New York Times article highlighted the changes, including the pitch clock and ban on the infield shift, with the aim of speeding up the pace of play.
2023 Season Overview: The 2023 MLB season began on March 30 and was scheduled to end on October 1, as detailed on Wikipedia. The 93rd All-Star Game took place on July 11.
Fan Experience: Despite the rule changes, baseball in 2023 has been an enjoyable experience for fans, as mentioned in The Atlantic. The sport continues to captivate audiences with its rich history and statistical analysis.
New Scheduling Format: MLB introduced a new scheduling format in 2023, where teams play 46 matchups, up from 20 in previous years, as explained by NBC Sports Philadelphia.
