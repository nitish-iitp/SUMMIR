Earns fifth save
Uceta allowed a hit and struck out one batter in a scoreless inning while earning a save against Boston on Friday.
Impact Uceta worked around a one-out single by Vaughn Grissom in the ninth inning to preserve the 2-1 win. It was Uceta's fifth save of the year, with all of them coming during his last 12 appearances. During that span, he's converted each of his five save chances while tallying three holds alongside a 2.77 ERA. For the season, Uceta has produced a terrific 1.51 ERA and 57:8 K:BB through 41.2 innings.

Converts adventurous save
Uceta allowed one earned run on two hits and one walk while striking out one in the ninth inning to earn the save Sunday against the Blue Jays.
Impact Uceta was called upon to protect a two-run lead and allowed the tying run to reach third base with only one out. However, he recorded the final two outs without allowing the ball out of the infield to record his fourth save of the season. Uceta remains one of the most skilled pitchers in the Rays' bullpen, but a different reliever has now converted each of the team's four save chances.

Earns third save in return
Uceta earned the save in Friday's 3-1 victory over Cleveland, pitching 1.2 clean innings with two strikeouts.
Impact Uceta relieved Mason Montgomery with one out in the eighth after the latter allowed two hits to his three batters faced. Uceta efficiently retired five straight batters on only 18 pitches to lock down the Rays win in his first appearance since serving a two-game suspension for intentionally hitting Nick Castellanos on Tuesday. He has now pitched to a 1.42 ERA, 0.76 WHIP and 53:6 K:BB with three saves across 38 innings this season. The 26-year-old has been an elite reliever and is in the fluid mix for Tampa Bay save opportunities while Pete Fairbanks (lat) remains on the injured list.

Suspension reduced to two games
Uceta's suspension was reduced Wednesday from three games to two games plus a fine, Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times reports.
Impact The reliever's suspension comes after umpires determined he intentionally hit Nick Castellanos with a pitch during Tuesday's loss to Philadelphia. Uceta will begin serving the suspension Wednesday, but the Rays will now be able to add him to their bullpen a day earlier than initially expected.

Impact Rays manager Kevin Cash was also handed a one-game suspension. Uceta was charged with three runs while retiring just one batter before getting the heave-ho after umpires determined he intentionally hit Castellanos with a pitch. The reliever has the right to appeal -- which would allow him to continue pitching until the appeal is heard -- but it's unclear whether he plans to exercise that right. Uceta is one of four different Rays relievers to pick up at least one save since Pete Fairbanks (lat) was injured last month.

Struggles in high-leverage spot
Uceta allowed three earned runs on four hits while recording only one out Tuesday against the Phillies.
Impact Uceta entered the game in the eighth inning with the score knotted at 4-4 and runners on second and third. He allowed three of the next four batters he faced to reach base on a double, single and homer, pushing the game out of reach for the Rays. Uceta avoided a loss because Richard Lovelady allowed the inherited runners on base, but it was still a disastrous outing. Even factoring in Tuesday's results, Uceta has a 1.62 ERA and 0.90 WHIP with a 27:3 K:BB since Aug. 1 and across 16.2 innings.

Dominant in five-out save
Uceta notched his second save of the season Sunday against Baltimore, allowing one hit and one walk while striking out four in 1.2 innings.
Impact Called upon to preserve a 2-0 lead with two runners on and one out in the eighth, Uceta promptly struck out the next two batters to escape the jam. Uceta then worked around a single and a walk in the ninth to pick up his second save of the season. Save opportunities have been few and far between, but Uceta has been dominant since Pete Fairbanks (lat) landed on the injured list on Aug. 19, throwing 7.1 scoreless innings with a sparkling 15:2 K:BB during that stretch. The 26-year-old Uceta hasn't allowed a run since July 31 and owns a pristine 0.75 ERA, 0.69 WHIP and 50:6 K:BB in 36 innings this season.

Can't complete save chance
Uceta allowed two hits and struck out two across 0.2 innings Tuesday against the Twins.
Impact Uceta was called upon to protect a 2-1 lead in the ninth inning. He allowed consecutive singles to lead off the frame, but he did strike out the next two batters he faced before being pulled in favor of Garrett Cleavinger. Despite losing out on a save chance, Uceta has still been excellent since Pete Fairbanks (lat) went on the injured list by racking up an 11:1 K:BB across 5.2 innings while recording a save, a hold and a win.

Grabs first post-Fairbanks save
Uceta struck out one over 1.1 perfect innings to earn the save in Tuesday's 1-0 win over the Athletics.
Impact Uceta received the first save opportunity since Pete Fairbanks (lat) went on the injured list Monday, and he went on to convert his first major-league save. Uceta retired four batters on a total of nine pitches (seven strikes), extending his scoreless streak to 10.1 innings in the process. He emerged as a setup man after the All-Star break and now has a chance to be part of a closing committee that doesn't have a clear favorite to lead the way just yet. For the year, Uceta has a 0.90 ERA, 0.57 WHIP and 36:4 K:BB over 30 innings. While he doesn't have stellar velocity -- he doesn't throw a four-seamer, and his fastest pitch is a 93.9 mph sinker -- Uceta continues to thrive mostly by inducing weak contact and getting batters to chase pitches at an above-average rate.

Fans four in relief
Uceta pitched two shutout innings of relief in Sunday's 2-1 win over the Reds, allowing one hit and zero walks while striking out four. He did not factor into the decision.
Impact Shawn Armstrong opened the game for the Rays, pitching two innings before giving way to Uceta. The 26-year-old Uceta fanned four batters in just two innings of work, headlining a strong performance from the Rays bullpen in which they struck out nine batters over seven scoreless frames. On his fourth team in four seasons, Uceta has finally found his groove with the Rays, logging a microscopic 0.51 ERA, 0.57 WHIP and 19:3 K:BB in 17.2 innings this season.
