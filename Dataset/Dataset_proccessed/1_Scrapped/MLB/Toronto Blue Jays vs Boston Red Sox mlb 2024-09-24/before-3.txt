Boston Red Sox vs Toronto Blue Jays Prediction

I’ll go with the Red Sox. We should have a good starter battle here regardless, though. Bello is 2-1 in his last three starts, notching a combined four earned runs in 16.1 innings of work. As for Francis, he’s 0-2 in his last three but has a solid six earned over 20.0 innings in that time.

On Monday the Sox made the most of their five team hits, and the 10 walks didn’t hurt either. Boston used four arms out of the bullpen so it’d be nice to see Bello eat up some innings in the Tuesday game. It should be a fun one.
