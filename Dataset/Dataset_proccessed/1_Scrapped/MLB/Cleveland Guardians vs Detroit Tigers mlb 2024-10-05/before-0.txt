Ohtani. Judge. Dodgers. Yankees.
We are pretty close to getting a truly blockbuster World Series matchup, writes SI’s Tom Verducci. (Link in bio for more)

Because teams like them are killing the game. Ohtani or Soto to Kansas City or Cleveland. No chance. Big markets get big names. When the Twins best player they created is Buxton then you just know it's not fair. Especially when all the great talent moves to the coasts for the big contracts. It would showcase what really is wrong with baseball.

Respectfully, Tom is being a little dramatic. I have already watched these two teams in the WS before, don’t need to see it again.

The national media wanting teams from New York and Los Angeles? I’m so shocked. 😶

I may be a Yankees fan but San Diego/Kansas City would be incredible just to anger Manfred.
Plus it’d be a damn good series.

Somebody is gonna whiff. This why I laugh at the media. They always think the Yankees and Dodgers are the best teams in either league. Lmfao Baseball Threads

Dodgers are losing in 4 in the NLDS. They have no healthy pitching.

They didn’t have no healthy pitching, and some other position players were out to, and yet they still managed to have the best record and all MLB so sleep on that one.
