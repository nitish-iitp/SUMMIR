Use limited data to select advertising
Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.
Create profiles for personalised advertising
Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.
Measure advertising performance
Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.
Measure content performance
Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.
Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources
Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.
Develop and improve services
Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.

Astros vs Rangers summary online: stats, scores and highlights | MLB ALCS Game 5 highlights

Update: Oct 20th, 2023 15:50 EDT
Astros come from behind to snatch Game 5

Jose Altuve blasts Houston into series lead

This was the best of games, this was the worst of games. The 2023 ALCS Game 5 had something for everyone, from excellent pitching duels, to come-from-behind home run shots, to bench clearing brawls and ejections, to record setting wins.

Like Charles Dickens' epoch of belief and incredulity, the Astros' spring of hope is one game away from becoming the Rangers' winter of despair.

Jordan Montgomery and Justin Verlander had a pitching duel worthy of masters, each surrendering a single solo home run to bookend five outstanding innings. Bregman and Lowe's solo shots went by innocuously. But it was the three-run shots that caused the fuss.

In the sixth inning, Adolis Garcia hit a three-run blast to put the Rangers on top. In doing that, he stood and admired his handiwork before spiking the bat to the ground as he trotted around the bases. This led to a situation where, when he was hit by a pitch in the eighth inning, it was assumed by many, certainly by Garcia and the umpires, that he was purposely hit as retaliation.

The benches cleared and when the dust settled, both Garcia and Astros pitcher Bryan Abreu, as well as Dusty Baker, had been ejected from the game. It was a farce wrapped inside a melodrama. Whether you believe that the pitch was thrown intentionally or not, there were no punches thrown, nothing but words, and no warning from the umpires. There should have never been any ejection made at all.

But then the checkers turned into chess, when it became obvious that in delaying the game so long, the Rangers closer José Leclerc had been put on ice for over 11 extra minutes, leading for his ninth inning stuff to be... well... less. Not as good as normal, not as sharp, struggling to find the zone.

The Astros, and one player in particular, are masters of making you pay dearly for your mistakes. A single and a walk off of a struggling and frustrated Leclerc offered a chink of daylight, and José Altuve took full advantage.

A three-run blast into left field, just beyond the outstretched glove of Evan Carter, saw the Astros take the lead in the top of the ninth and a reeling Texas put men on base in the bottom, but could not push them around to score.

With that, José Altuve becomes the all-time ALCS home run leader with 11 blasts in the contest. His third go-ahead home run in the ninth inning or later is another all time post season record. Love him or hate him, he is the best $15,000 investment that the Astros ever made and he will almost certainly reside in Cooperstown one day.

As for the Rangers, they now head into the final stretch of this ALCS with their backs firmly against the wall. From winning seven in a row in the post season, including the first two in the series, they have dropped three in a row and are in danger of allowing Houston to shoplift the championship.

In the regular season, Texas led the AL West the entire season, allowing the Astros to steal it away on the final day. 159 days at the top lost to 28 days at the top. The playoffs are looking to be headed the same way.

To this point, the home team has yet to win a game in the ALCS, and if Texas can maintain that, then they have hope. If, like the Astros, you don't believe in numbers and just play power baseball regardless, then it is all a bunch of nonsense.

Losing this game hurts Texas far more than it helps Houston. With Nathan Eovaldi scheduled for Game 6, they will be without a dominant starter should they manage to force a Game 7. And that is all of the Rangers' worst fears come to fruition.

Pitching change

Bruce Bochy has seen enough and that is going to do it for Jordan Montgomery. He just ran out of steam after five and a third. Josh Sborz will come in to see if he can get the Rangers out of this jam.

PITCHING

It is a repeat of Game 1 in the pitching matchup, as both teams field their aces. The Rangers will turn to Jordan Montgomery, who has been golden since coming to Texas at the trade deadline. In Game 1, the Astros were blanked over 6.1 innings by the big left-hander and he has been equally problematic for them when he was with the Cardinals.

The Astros will counter this with an ace of their own in Justin Verlander. He was just as dominant as his counterpart over 6.2 innings, eventually surrendering two runs in that loss. Texas are no luckier against Verlander than Houston are agains Monty, but they will feel that the matchup at the very least levels the playing field, in hopes that they can beat the Astros to the punch with the bats.

WELCOME!!!

Welcome to the Diario AS USA live commentary of Game 5 of this historic All-Texas ALCS between the Texas Rangers and the Houston Astros presents the final opportunity for the Rangers to get a win in Arlington.

With the series tied at two games apiece, the question is one of trends. The Astros have won two after falling behind and they have also got a nice trend of winning on the road in Arlington. But the Rangers have got a trend of winning behind Jordan Montgomery.

Houston, enviably, is perhaps the only team in baseball, perhaps even in world sport, that is never truly down. They can win even when losing. They can come back from any deficit and have done so, repeatedly, for years. All of this has given them an air of invincibility, one that they wear like a cloak. And their players, coaches, staff, and fans, are well aware of it, taking on a kind of swagger that accompanies only the most successful in life.

The issue facing Texas is one of perception. They have a ton of talent, on both sides of the ball. In raw ability, they outstack the Astros in nearly every position. But they are gangly in it, often finding it difficult to coordinate the various components of their team. They either pitch well, or hit well, or defend well, but rarely all three at once.

To quote Agatha Christie, “The mantle of life should fit like a well-tailored suit of clothes.” Sometimes, for all their talent, success does not hang so well on the Texas Rangers.
