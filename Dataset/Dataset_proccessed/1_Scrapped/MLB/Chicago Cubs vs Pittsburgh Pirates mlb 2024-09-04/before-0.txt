Cheat Sheet and Projections

We have reviewed every player from every team to help you find the best selections on Wednesday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Paul Skenes (PIT, P)	$23,860	23.3	1
Value	Steven Matz (STL, P)	$9,800	13.6	1.4
Fade	Robert Refsnyder (BOS, OF)	$8,120	1.7	0.2
Cheapie	Masataka Yoshida (BOS, OF)	$5,000	5.6	1.1

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks provide the most "bang for your buck," meaning they're expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For those needing to stay under the salary cap, "cheapie" options highlight the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

When building your MLB Wednesday teams, consider starting with a value player like Steven Matz. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Paul Skenes is a strong option. If you're looking for budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, check out our cheapie options, including Masataka Yoshida.

On the other hand, according to our model, Robert Refsnyder is one of the lowest value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if building multiple line-ups.
