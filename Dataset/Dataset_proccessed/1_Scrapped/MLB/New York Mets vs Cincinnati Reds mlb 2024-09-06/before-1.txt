Fantasy baseball waiver wire: Jhonkensy Noel, Rhett Lowder and more adds; plus, two-start pitchers and stashes
By John Laghezza
Sep 6, 2024

If your current fantasy roster still even partially resembles the team you drafted, you’re surely in the minority. For the rest of us normal people, I’ll be using a data-backed, formulaic approach to discover next week’s MLB waiver wire headliners… today. Going position by position, I mine my favorite obscure fantasy baseball statistics in regard to control, batted ball quality, and swing-and-miss ability. Then I mash them all together, hopefully identifying some cheap gems to grab now before the squares figure it out next week. At the very bottom, I rank my favorite available players around the diamond, as well as two-start pitchers and speculative adds.

Starting Pitchers

As far as pitching goes, the thesis couldn’t be simpler — do our best to avoid any bias attached to surface stats (outputs) by instead focusing on underlying metrics (inputs). The most important SP skills are the ability to generate whiffs (first list below) and limit hard contact (second list below). While showing up on one of these two lists may be noise, I’m generally treating an appearance on both as a signal to immediately pull the trigger.

Available Starters: Multiple >30% Whiff Offerings

*(min. 15 pitches, since August 1st)*

David Peterson, NYM — 4-Seam Fastball 35.2%, Slider 32.6%, Changeup 31.7%
Osvaldo Bido, OAK — Changeup 35.8%, Slider 32.1%, 4-Seamer 32.0%
Andrew Heaney, TEX — Changeup 47.2%, Slider 47.1%
Mitchell Parker, WAS — Slider 43.6%, Split-Finger 41.8%
Griffin Canning, LAA — Slider 39.0%, Changeup 38.4%
Kyle Gibson, STL — Sweeper 35.7%, Changeup 32.0%
Valente Bellozo, MIA — Sweeper 34.6%, Curveball 32.0%
Bradley Blalock, COL — Split-Finger 34.4%, Slider 29.8%
Roddery Munoz, MIA — Cutter 33.3%, Slider 29.8%
Andre Pallante, STL — Curveball 32.4%, Slider 29.6%
Available Starters: ≤.340 Expected Weighted On-Base Average, Contact-Only

*(since August 1st)*

Steven Matz, STL — 0.224 xwOBAcon
Caden Dana, LAA — 0.250 xwOBAcon
Rhett Lowder, CIN — 0.269 xwOBAcon
JP Sears, OAK — 0.315 xwOBAcon
Jack Kochanowicz, LAA — 0.318 xwOBAcon
Samuel Aldegheri, LAA — 0.320 xwOBAcon
Adam Oller, MIA — 0.324 xwOBAcon
Dean Kremer, BAL — 0.328 xwOBAcon
Nick Nastrini, CHW — 0.330 xwOBAcon
DJ Herz, WAS — 0.336 xwOBAcon
Casey Mize, DET — 0.339 xwOBAcon

Hidden Gems By Category: The waiver wire actually blessed us with a few final opportunities at SP but, even in many shallow leagues, supply’s scarce. I’d prioritize Rhett Lowder purely for the upside despite the home park, except he’s rostered in half my 12-teamers already — refer to the SP rankings below and work down the list. Do not be afraid to stream a reliever on a team playing seven games with a chance to win the majority of them — there’s no time to work off starter blowups.

Available Hitters: >107.0 mph 90th Percentile Exit Velocity

*(min. 75 PA since the All-Star Break)*

Jhonkensy Noel, OF, CLE — 108.9 m.p.h. EV

Jo Adell, OF, LAA — 107.7 m.p.h. EV
Trevor Larnach, OF, MIN — 107.4 m.p.h. EV
Shea Langeliers, C, OAK — 107.0 m.p.h. EV
Paul DeJong, SS, KC — 106.8 m.p.h. EV
Mickey Moniak, OF, LAA — 106.7 m.p.h. EV
Available Hitters: <25% Chase Rate And >.380 Expected Weighted On-Base Average, Contact-Only

*(min. 75 PA since the All-Star Break)*

Michael Conforto, OF, SF — 21.4% Chase, 0.512 xwOBAcon
Santiago Espinal, 3B, CIN — 24.8% Chase, 0.429 xwOBAcon
Carlos Santana, 1B, MIN — 20.6% Chase, 0.400 xwOBAcon
Brandon Marsh, OF, PHI — 22.8% Chase, 0.393 xwOBAcon

*(min. 75 PA since the All-Star Break)*

Rowdy Tellez, 1B, PIT — 22.6% Pulled FBLD
Mickey Moniak, OF, LAA — 20.8% Pulled FBLD
Michael Massey, 2B, KC — 20.7% Pulled FBLD
José Caballero, SS, TB — 20.5% Pulled FBLD

Paul DeJong, SS, KC — 17.6% Pulled FBLD
Jo Adell, OF, LAA — 17.3% Pulled FBLD
Shea Langeliers, C, OAK — 17.2% Pulled FBLD

Hidden Gem: We’ve reached the wholly pragmatic part of the fantasy season. No time for speculating too far ahead as we’re rounding third and almost home — it’s down to the brass tacks of winning categories…

Batting Average — Brendan Donovan, 2B/3B/OF, STL
Runs — Mickey Moniak, OF,LAA
RBI — Randal Grichuk, OF, ARI
HR — Taylor Ward, OF, LAA

Relief Pitchers

Slight pivot on relievers the last month to focus more on targeting roles over skills. If you want to go deeper into all things relievers, I strongly suggest Greg Jewett’s weekly column — nobody does RPs better.
