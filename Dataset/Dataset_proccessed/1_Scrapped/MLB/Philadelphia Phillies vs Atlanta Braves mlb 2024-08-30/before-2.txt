Cheat Sheet and Projections

We've reviewed every player from every team to help you make the best picks on Friday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Hunter Brown (HOU, P)	$18,140	17	0.9
Value	Cade Povich (BAL, P)	$9,090	13.3	1.5
Fade	Paul DeJong (KC, SS)	$8,130	2.2	0.3
Cheapie	Maikel Garcia (KC, 3B)	$5,000	5.8	1.2

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks provide the most "bang for your buck," meaning they're expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For budget-conscious strategies, "cheapie" options highlight the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

In DFS, creating an optimal line-up requires understanding key concepts and metrics. When building your MLB Friday teams, consider starting with a value player like Cade Povich. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Hunter Brown is a strong option. If you're seeking budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, take a look at our cheapie options, including Maikel Garcia.

On the other hand, according to our model, Paul DeJong is one of the worst value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if putting together multiple line-ups.
