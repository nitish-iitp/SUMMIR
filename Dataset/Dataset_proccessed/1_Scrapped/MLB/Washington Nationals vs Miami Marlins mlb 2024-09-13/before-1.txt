How To Claim bet365’s Thursday Night Touchdowns NFL Offer

Time needed: 5 minutes

Are you ready to sign up and take advantage of the bet365 Sportsbook’s latest promotion for Thursday Night Football? Just follow the six simple steps outlined below!

Visit bet365

First, click or tap here to visit bet365 Sportsbook on your smartphone, tablet, or another preferred device.

Log In or Create a New Account

If you’re an existing user, go ahead and log into your bet365 account. However, if you’re new to the app, you’ll need to register for an account. Don’t worry! This process is typically pretty quick. You’ll just need to provide some basic personal information and verify your account by providing the last four digits of your SSN.

Make a Deposit

Next, if you haven’t already, you’ll need to make a deposit! Choose your preferred method of payment (debit/credit card, online banking, PayPal, etc.), and select or enter the amount you’d like to deposit ($10 or more). Then, if everything looks alright, you can go ahead and confirm the transaction.

Opt Into the Promotion

Once you’ve added funds to your betting account, open the “Promos” tab. Find bet365’s “Thursday Night Touchdowns” promotion, and tap the yellow “Opt In” button to activate the offer.

Place a Qualifying Wager

You’ll then just need to place a qualifying Same Game Parlay wager of $20+ on the Dolphins-Bills TNF matchup. In fact, it doesn’t have to be a single bet; you can spread your total wager amount across multiple Same Game Parlays or other eligible bets as long as the combined total meets the $20 minimum.

Receive Your Bonus

Now, you’re all set! After the game is over, you’ll receive $10 in bonus bets for each touchdown scored if you placed a qualifying wager of $50 or more. If your wager was between $20 and $49.99, you’ll earn $5 in bonus bets per touchdown. Enjoy!

bet365 Sportsbook New Customer Bonus

In addition to the bet365 Thursday Night Touchdowns promotion, all new customers will get to choose between two incredible welcome offers: the Bet $5 Get $200 promo and the $1,000 First Bet Safety Net.

Here’s a quick breakdown of your two choices:

Bet $5 Get $200 in Bonus Bets

The bet365 Bet $5 Get $200 promotion works exactly how it sounds! When you sign up today using our exclusive bonus code ATSPROMO and place any $5+ wager, you’ll instantly receive $200 in bonus bets.

It doesn’t matter if your first bet wins or loses. Either way, you’ll still get the full $200 bonus. This means you can enjoy extra betting opportunities and explore different markets without worrying about the outcome of your initial wager.

$1,000 First Bet Safety Net

The bet365 First Bet Safety Net, on the other hand, provides up to $1,000 in first-bet insurance. This means that if your very first bet doesn’t go your way, bet365 will provide a 100% refund of up to $1,000 in bonus funds.

To take advantage of this offer, simply sign up using our exclusive bet365 Sportsbook promo code ATSPROMO and place your first wager of up to $1,000. If it loses, you’ll get a full refund in the form of bonus bets, so you can try again without losing your initial stake.
