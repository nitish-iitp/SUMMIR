England’s Todd Clements rode an eagle to the top of the Irish Open leaderboard after a tough, windy first round. How will he do on Friday?

Conditions will likely continue to be difficult in Friday’s second round of the Amgen Irish Open after England’s Todd Clements took the lead after Thursday’s opening 18 holes with a five-under-par 66 on the windy Royal County Down Golf Club in Newcastle, Northern Ireland. Temperatures for Friday are forecast for the upper 40s to low 50s with winds expected to whip at 10 to 15 miles per hour. Crosswinds made scoring difficult on Thursday, with Clements able to close out his first nine holes with an eagle on the par-five 18th to go with five birdies and a pair of bogeys. Rory McIlroy, the two-time defending DP World Tour champion, is two shots off the lead after a first round 68. He won the event in 2016.

Alejandro Del Rey and Sami Välimäki share second place entering Friday, both one shot off the lead. McIlroy is joined in a tie for fourth place by Will Enefer, Filippo Celli, Thriston Lawrence — second behind McIlroy in the Race to Dubai rankings — and Marcus Armitage. 11 players, including Denmark’s Søren Kjeldsen, who won the tournament the last time it was played at Royal County Down in 2015, are three shots back at two-under-par.

Defending champion Vincent Norrman struggled to a first round 75 and is in a group tied for 120th place. Clements is looking for just his second DP World Tour victory after getting his first at the Czech Masters a little more than a year ago.
