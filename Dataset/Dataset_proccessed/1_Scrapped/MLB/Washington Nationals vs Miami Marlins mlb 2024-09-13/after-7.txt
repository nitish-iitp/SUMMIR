Game #147 Get it right Nats

The Washington Nationals got another ace performance from Mitchell Parker last night, but it went wasted as the offense stalled after the first inning, the infield defense was horrific, and the bullpen buckled. But seriously, what is up with the defense and why is Jose Tena still playing at 3rd base? This is the definition of insanity. The game would have been tied if not for the unearned runs.

In all, there were three infield errors, one by Tena, one by CJ Abrams, and one by Luis Garcia Jr. Totally avoidable, and these are becoming the norm. It’s the balls they don’t get to, and the plays they don’t make that are ruled as hits that are costly too. The good news is the Gold Glove defense being played in the outfield.

A couple of other notes were that CJ Abrams got his 29th stolen base last night and with one more steal, he would join the 20/30 club as the second member with Alfonso Soriano. As a team, the Nationals stole their 200th base of the season, and that is the best in the Majors. That set a new modern mark since the Rickey Henderson days. In conparison, the Washington Senators of 1913 stole 287 bases in fewer games. Baseball was different back then.

The Nats need to go 7-9 or better to beat their 2023 win total. How great would that be to finish in the mid-70’s for a win total? After this 4-game series with the Marlins, the Nats will only face teams in competition for the postseason.

The Nats are favorites today, at -145 to win on the moneyline. That means if you bet $145 you would win $100. Bet $14.50 and you win $10.00.

Nats’ manager Dave Martinez got a deep start from Parker, and unfortunately Derek Law blew the save and took the loss.

This is what the Nats schedule looks like going forward, and the plan is to get Trevor Williams back into the rotation and finish the final week-and-a-half of the season with a 6-man rotation:

Friday: DJ Herz vs. Marlins
Saturday: Patrick Corbin vs. Marlins
Sunday: MacKenzie Gore vs. Marlins
Monday: Jake Irvin vs. Mets
Tuesday: Mitchell Parker vs. Mets
Wednesday: Herz vs. Mets
Thursday: Corbin vs. Cubs
Friday: Gore vs. Cubs
Saturday: Irvin vs. Cubs
Sunday: Parker vs. Cubs
Monday: Day-off September 23
Tuesday: Herz vs. Royals
Wednesday: Corbin vs. Royals
Thursday: Gore vs. Royals
Friday: Irvin vs. Phillies
Saturday: Parker vs. Phillies
Sunday: Herz vs. Phillies (Final Game of the Season)

Your top Washington Nationals on the FanGraphs’ WAR leaderboard has Jacob Young at +2.8, Luis Garcia Jr. at a WAR of +2.8, and CJ Abrams has sunk all the way back to +1.6. In total, 29 Nats’ players are in positive WAR and another seven are at a neutral 0.0 WAR.


“We came out swinging, scoring first, then we stopped swinging. I don’t know what to say. And our defense … our defense today was not good. We’ve got to play better defense.”

— Nats’ manager Dave Martinez said after yesterday’s game

The Nats starting pitchers have a combined ERA of 4.43 and 22nd in MLB.

No. 5 Starter: Patrick Corbin 5.60
