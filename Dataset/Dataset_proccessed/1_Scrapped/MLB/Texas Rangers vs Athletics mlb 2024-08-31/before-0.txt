PHOENIX -- History, he’s coming for you.

Shohei Ohtani’s campaign for a third Most Valuable Player Award continued during Friday night’s 10-9 Dodgers win at Chase Field, where the superstar stole his 43rd base and hit his 43rd home run to become the first member of the 43-43 club.

“He’s incredible,” manager Dave Roberts said. “I don’t know what else to say. I don’t have any more superlatives on Shohei. He’s incredible.”

Alex Rodriguez, who hit 42 homers and stole 46 bases with the Mariners in 1998, was the only other player to hit the 42-42 threshold. Now, Ohtani stands alone.

But let’s face it, 43-43 is a mere placeholder for this man. In the last seven games alone, Ohtani has accomplished the following:

Aug. 23: Ohtani joins the 40-40 club faster than anyone in MLB history with a walk-off grand slam against the Rays.
Aug. 24: Ohtani hits home run No. 41.
Aug. 28: Ohtani celebrates his bobblehead night by having his dog, Decoy, throw out the first pitch and then hitting home run No. 42 and stealing bases No. 41 and 42.

Ohtani is three homers away from tying his career high of 46, set in his first American League MVP campaign in 2021. His previous career high in stolen bases, 26, also came that season.

There are still 27 games left to go. Could MLB see its first 50-50 season before all is said and done?
