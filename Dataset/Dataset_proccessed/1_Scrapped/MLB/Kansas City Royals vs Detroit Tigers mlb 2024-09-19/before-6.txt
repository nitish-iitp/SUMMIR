Blanks BoSox in no-decision
Francis came away with a no-decision in Tuesday's 6-5 extra-inning loss to the Red Sox, allowing three hits and a walk over five scoreless innings. He struck out four.
Impact In his final start of the season, Francis saw his quality-start streak snapped at seven when he got the hook after just 71 pitches (48 strikes), but he still ended a breakout campaign on a high note. The right-hander developed a splitter in the minors and moved back into the big-league rotation after the All-Star break, and the new pitch helped him deliver a dazzling 1.80 ERA, 0.60 WHIP and 58:8 K:BB through 65 innings. Francis has put himself firmly in Toronto's 2025 pitching plans.

Logs seventh-straight quality start
Francis (8-5) took the loss against the Rangers on Wednesday, allowing two runs on five hits and one walk over six innings. He struck out six.
Impact Francis allowed the leadoff man to reach in each of the first two innings but didn't surrender a run in the contest until the bottom of the sixth when Adolis Garcia took him deep for a two-run homer. Those would be the only runs allowed on the night for the right-hander, who's now given up at least one long ball in three-consecutive outings. It marked Francis' seventh-straight quality start, though he's now taken losses in two of his last three trips to the mound after previously winning four in a row. Despite the two losses, he still carries a strong 2.70 ERA through three September outings and has posted six strikeouts in two of his last starts.

Loses no-hitter in the ninth
Francis allowed one run on one hit and walk over eight innings Wednesday in a no-decision against the Mets. He struck out one.
Impact It's the second time in Francis' last four starts that he's lost a no-hitter on a ninth-inning home run. The right-hander issued just one walk through eight innings before Francisco Lindor smacked a game-tying homer to lead off the ninth. Despite another tough finish, Francis has been spectacular of late, holding opponents to just one hit over seven or more innings in four of his last six outings -- he's posted a 1.25 ERA in that span (43 innings). Overall, the 28-year-old Francis is 8-4 on the season with a 3.50 ERA, 0.93 WHIP and 82:20 K:BB over 92.2 innings. He's currently lined up for a road matchup with the Rangers next week in his next start.
