Pirates Look to Finish Season Strong

Oneil Cruz has hit 21 home runs and driven in 76 RBIs so far this season. Getting the start for the Pirates will be Jared Jones who sits with a 6-8 record and an ERA of 4.14. In his last start against the Reds, he went five innings giving up six hits and six runs 

Yankees Dominated on Thursday

The Yankees dominated on Thursday putting up 10 runs against the Baltimore Orioles. Aaron Judge finished with a home run and drove in two RBIs.

The offense is ranked 3rd in the league while the defense is ranked 10th. Aaron Judge has hit 57 home runs and driven in 142 RBIs so far this season. 

Why the Yankees Will Beat the Pirates
The Pirates have lost each of their last eight night games against AL East opponents that held a winning record.
The Yankees have won each of their last six Friday games.
The Pirates have failed to cover the run line each of their last eight night games against AL East opponents that held a winning record.
The Yankees have covered the run line in each of their last three games against teams that held a losing record.
Pittsburgh Pirates vs New York Yankees Prediction

The Yankees offense is going to put on a show here. Jared Jones hasn’t been great for the Pirates and in his last start he gave up six hits and six runs. The Yankees bats are going to be hot on him early, and that is going to be the difference here as the Yankees are going to end up cruising to the victory. The Pirates are going to struggle to put up two runs. Back the Yankees on the run line.
