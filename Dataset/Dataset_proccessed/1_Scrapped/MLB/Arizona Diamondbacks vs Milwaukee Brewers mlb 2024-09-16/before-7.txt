NEW YORK — Like Trump vs. Harris for the White House, there are division and wild card races too close to call with MLB’s regular season down to two weeks through Sunday’s games.

The closest division races are three-games leads in the AL East for the Yankees over the Orioles and the NL West for the Dodgers over the Padres.

Aaron Judge hit his 53rd home on Sunday in the Yankees’ 5-2 win over the Red Sox and Orioles lost 2-1 to the Tigers in Detroit.

The Orioles have lost six of their last eight and are 27-33 in their last 60.

The Dodgers blew out the Braves 9-2 in Atlanta and the Padres edged the Giants 4-3 in 10 innings in San Francisco.
