Royals Suffer 6th Consecutive Loss; Fall To Giants 9-0

LaMonte Wade Jr. and Matt Chapman each homered twice, leading the San Francisco Giants to a dominant 9-0 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Saturday. The win extended the Giants’ winning streak to four games and tightened the race for the American League’s second wild-card spot.

The Royals’ lead over the Minnesota Twins was reduced to a half-game following the postponement of their game due to inclement weather. The Detroit Tigers remain another half-game behind the Twins.

Wade’s solo home run in the first inning gave the Giants an early lead, and he followed with another home run in the fourth inning. Chapman’s home run in the fourth inning marked the seventh time the Giants have hit back-to-back home runs this season.

The Giants’ offensive onslaught continued in the sixth inning, with six runs scored, highlighted by Chapman’s second home run and Mike Yastrzemski’s three-run homer.

Curt Casali contributed a two-run single, while Roupp pitched a complete game shutout for the Giants, allowing only three hits and walking three.

Brady Singer struggled for the Royals, allowing six runs and four home runs. The Royals’ offense struggled to capitalize on scoring opportunities, going 8 for 52 with runners in scoring position during their six-game losing streak.

The Royals look to turn things around Sunday as they face the San Francisco Giants at Kauffman Stadium Sunday in the teams’ final home game of the regular season.  Seth Lugo (16-8, 3.05 ERA) will take the mound for the Royals, opposing Blake Snell (4-3, 3.31 ERA) of the Giants.

The Royals hold a slim half-game lead over the Minnesota Twins for the second wild-card spot in the American League. The Detroit Tigers are also within a half-game of the Twins, making the final stretch of the season highly competitive.

Pregame coverage begins at 12:30 PM on SuperStar Country 102.5 & 1530 AM, with the first pitch scheduled for 1:10 PM.
