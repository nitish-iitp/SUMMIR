The spectacular season of Los Angeles Angels two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani is over. And maybe his Angels tenure, too.

The team announced Saturday that Ohtani was put on the 10-day injured list with an oblique injury and would sit out the rest of 2023.

Ohtani missed 11 straight games with a right oblique injury, and after Friday night's loss to the Detroit Tigers, his locker at Angel Stadium was empty and had a packed bag in front of it.
