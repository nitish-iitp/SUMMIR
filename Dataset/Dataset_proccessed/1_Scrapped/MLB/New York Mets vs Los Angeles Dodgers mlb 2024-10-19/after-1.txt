LOS ANGELES — The bullpen has been one of the Dodgers’ greatest strengths this season. Now, after conservative usage through the first five games of the National League Championship Series, the team will rely heavily on its high-leverage relievers to get the one win they need to secure the pennant.

Facing elimination on the road in the Division Series, the Dodgers executed a bullpen game perfectly to shut out the Padres in Game 4 in San Diego. Five days later at home, with no Alex Vesia on the roster and Daniel Hudson unavailable that day, the bullpen game didn’t go so well.

In that NLCS Game 2 loss, the Dodgers turned to starter Landon Knack early for his bulk innings, but that plan was quickly foiled when he allowed five runs before getting three outs. For Game 6 on Sunday, expect more high-leverage relievers earlier before turning to any other pitcher.

“We can be a bit more aggressive,” manager Dave Roberts said Saturday at Dodger Stadium.

The Dodgers leverage relievers are certainly well-rested, after Roberts wasn’t as urgent to relieve Jack Flaherty before Game 5 got away, but also based on how this enter NLCS has gone. Not only have all five games of this series been decided by at least four runs, but there hasn’t even been a lead change all series. The only time the initial scoring was even matched came in Game 4, when the Mets scored one in the bottom of the first inning to tie the Dodgers from the top half.

By the third inning, the Dodgers held the lead for good.

“I think across baseball, managers are being more aggressive once they catch a lead and going with those [high-leverage] guys, and it’s just hard to get back into a game or tack on,” Roberts said Saturday. “When you’re seeing other arms, I think it just kind of exposes other teams’ pens, and I think we’ve done a really good job.”

Anthony Banda, who got one out in the eighth inning of Game 5, will have pitched in the last two days head into Game 6. Every other high-leverage reliever will have at least two days of rest heading into the final game, or two games. The only other high-leverage Dodgers relievers to pitch in the last three days are Evan Phillips, who threw 34 pitches to get four outs in Game 4, and Blake Treinen, who followed him with four outs of his own and 23 pitches.

Because the Dodgers tacked on runs late to make Games 3 and 4 more lopsided, the club turned to rookies Ben Casparius (Wednesday) and Edgardo Henriquez (Thursday) to pitch the final two innings of wins. That’s fewer innings needed from the high-leverage group.

Through five games of the NLCS, only two Dodgers high-leverage relievers have faced a Mets batter in more than one plate appearance. Ryan Brasier faced Pete Alonso in Games 2 and 3, while Treinen pitched to Francisco Lindor in Games 3 and 4. That’s it.

Since 2019 in the postseason, batters when facing relievers a third time or more are hitting .274/.340/.483 in 426 plate appearances, per Sarah Langs at MLB.com and MLB Network research.

It’s not necessarily a death knell if relievers face batters multiple times in a short span. But it can help a hitter to get more looks.

“Thankfully from our game-planning point of view we have more than one way to get a guy out. So whether or not we showed our whole game plan to one guy, it’s probably unlikely that we did so,” Phillips said Saturday at Dodger Stadium. “We still feel confident even if we faced a guy a couple times or back-to-back days, whatever it may be, we still feel confident in our plan.”

By contrast, Dodgers hitters have gotten more looks at Mets relievers. Here is every New York pitcher who hasn’t started a game this series.

through Game 5

The Mets’ backs are against the wall, but have a starter in Sean Manaea who did well against the Dodgers in Game 2, especially his first two times through the order.

For the Dodgers, it’s all hands on deck (well, not Yoshinobu Yamamoto), with a National League pennant within reach.

“We have potentially two games here, and I feel that to prevent runs, we’re in a very good spot,” Roberts said, reflecting on his nine years of managing in the postseason. “I don’t think we’ve exposed our high-leverage guys at all. And that’s part of kind of the learning curve for me over history.”
