Sept. 24, 2024: A day that could go down in infamy for the White Sox.

With a record of 36-120, the Sox host the Angels at Guaranteed Rate Field on Tuesday night, two days removed from a 4-2 loss to the Padres (their 27th after taking a lead into the seventh inning) that tied them with the 1962 Mets for the humiliating record of most losses in a season since 1900.

A sixth straight loss Tuesday would be their 121st, a shocking number avoidable only with six wins over the six games left on their schedule.
