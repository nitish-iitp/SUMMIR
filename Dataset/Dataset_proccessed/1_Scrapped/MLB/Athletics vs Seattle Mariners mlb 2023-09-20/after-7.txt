OAKLAND, Calif. — Dominic Canzone homered and drove in four runs as the Seattle Mariners beat the Oakland Athletics 6-3 on Wednesday to complete a three-game sweep and maintain their position in the tight AL West race.

Julio Rodríguez and Cal Raleigh added back-to-back homers to give Seattle 200 home runs in a season for the seventh time in franchise history. Raleigh also doubled, giving him 52 extra-base hits, the most by a Mariners catcher in a season.

Seattle (84-68) kept pace with Texas (84-68) and division-leading Houston (85-68), which both won Wednesday. The Rangers and Mariners are also tied for the third and final AL wild card, one-half game behind Toronto, which played later Wednesday. Seattle heads to Texas for a three-game series starting Friday.

“We’re in a really good spot, I think,” Canzone said. “The pitching is (going) really well, the hitting is coming around. This was a great sign to just be able to sweep the A’s and go into this series a little bit hot.”

Rodríguez reached 100 RBIs, becoming the third player age 22 or younger with at least 30 homers, 30 stolen bases and 100 RBIs in a season, joining Alex Rodriguez (1998) and Ronald Acuña Jr. (2019).

“He’s had an unbelievable year, following up a crazy rookie year where he jumped on the scene,” Seattle manager Scott Servais said. “He has been awesome for us.”

Added Rodríguez: “I was helping the team win. That’s what feels really good, to be able to, whenever guys get on base, be able to drive them in and have that good at-bat.”

George Kirby (11-10) scattered eight hits across seven strong innings, allowing three runs and striking out three. The right-hander earned his first win since Aug. 5 against the Angels.

“Felt really good today,” Kirby said. “Just attacked like I usually do and limit the walks and usually good things happen. We hit the ball really well today and played really good defense too. Good team win today.”

Justin Topa pitched a scoreless ninth for his third save.

Zack Gelof and Brent Rooker homered for the A’s, who lost their seventh in a row and suffered their 19th sweep of the year, extending an Oakland record.

The Athletics (46-106) moved within two losses of the Oakland record set in 1979 and fell 60 games below .500 for the first time since 1919.

In his major league debut, Joey Estes (0-1) allowed six runs, five earned, on six hits with two strikeouts in 4 2/3 innings. The 21-year-old right-hander became the 24th pitcher to start for the Athletics this season, tying the 1915 Philadelphia A’s for the major league record.

“It’s been a crazy journey for me,” Estes said. “I’m not really worried about results. I’m happy just to be living in this moment. I’ve worked very hard to get here.”
