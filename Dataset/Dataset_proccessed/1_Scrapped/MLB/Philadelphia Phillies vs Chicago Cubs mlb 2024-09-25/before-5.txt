Yellow: PEANUTS
Green: GIANTS
Blue: CARD
Purple: SLOAN

More reading (and an extra hint)

The green hint is GIANTS — as in the NFL team. Does that help?

Expectations aren’t high for the Giants in 2024, but their season turned in the right direction Sunday with a 21-15 win over the Browns. And if there’s one reason for hope, it’s rookie wide receiver Malik Nabers. The first-round pick is the first player in NFL history to record 20-plus catches, 250-plus receiving yards and three-plus receiving touchdowns across his first three games.

The Athletic’s Charlotte Carroll wrote an excellent profile of Nabers this summer after the Giants drafted him with the sixth pick. Read it below.

Malik Nabers wants to 'destroy you,' and that's why the Giants wanted him

Puzzle No. 3 will be available at midnight in your time zone. Thanks for playing — and share your scores in the comments!
