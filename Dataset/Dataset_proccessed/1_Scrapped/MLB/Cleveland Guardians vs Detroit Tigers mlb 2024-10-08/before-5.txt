Unbeaten Liberty returns to action for the first time in more than two weeks when it hosts FIU on Tuesday night in college football.

Liberty (4-0) gets back on the field on Tuesday night for the first time since Sept. 21 when it hosts FIU (2-3) in a Conference USA matchup at Williams Stadium in Lynchburg, Virginia. The Flames are 2-0 in CUSA play while the Panthers are 1-0. Liberty is 17-1 under coach Jamey Chadwell, with its only loss coming to Oregon in last season’s Fiesta Bowl, the first New Year’s Six bowl game in program history. FIU hasn’t been to a bowl since 2019 and coach Mike MacIntyre is 10-19 in his third season guiding the Panthers.
