Eight contestants head to the wilderness of Alaska as Life Below Zero kicks off Season 23 with the premiere on Tuesday night.

Season 23 of Life Below Zero will premiere Tuesday on National Geographic. When bears, wolves, and foxes are your only neighbors, life can be pretty lonely. Add minus-60-degree days and a constant battle for the most basic necessities, and you have the daily challenges of people who live in remote corners of Alaska. This series takes viewers deep into an Alaskan winter to meet tough, resilient residents as they try to stay one step ahead of storms and man-eating beasts to survive the season.

When the closest neighbor is more than 300 miles away, these Alaskans subsist solely on what is hunted and foraged. They catch fish for currency in bartering for supplies or use their packs of sled dogs for transportation. Also highlighted is a time of year not always part of what viewers see in Alaska: spring! Ice is breaking, animals are waking, and residents face new tests before deep cold returns.
