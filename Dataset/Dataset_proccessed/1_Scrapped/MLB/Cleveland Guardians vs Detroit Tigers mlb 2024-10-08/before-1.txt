How to Win with My MLB Computer Picks

I have baseball computer picks on every single matchup and my MLB computer predictions are incredibly accurate when compared to Vegas MLB computer picks, so how are you able to take full advantage of this information?

1. Get an Overview of the Matchups

When it comes to handicapping the matchups each day, it's good to assess the big picture first. Checking the start times, opening runline and totals lines, or noting games that are 'circled' - where the line was taken off the board (often due to a key injury), is a solid starting point.

2. View Computer Picks

Take a few minutes to open each MLB matchup on my computer picks screen and record the predicted score, noting the edge my projections are giving towards the runline and the total. While these projections do not represent my official picks, they are a sound indication of where my database is highlighting a potential mismatch.

3. Check the Consensus

Along with MLB computer picks, my site offers free MLB consensus data for both the side and total. These numbers will fluctuate throughout the day, and getting a feel for where the majority of public bettors are putting their money can help correlate runline and totals line moves.

4. Handicapping, Trends and Free MLB Picks

By this stage, you are already well ahead of the pack when it comes to a daily handicapping routine. You know the opening lines, have familiarized yourself with the matchups, and understand where the public money is starting to lean. It's time to take a deeper dive into the games you've identified as potential plays. Checking injury reports, trends, and situational spots (such as teams who are playing in a back-to-back), can help you narrow down your list. If you're signed up for my free MLB picks, check the writeup and prediction to see how it fits into your gameplan.

5. Pull the Trigger on my Premium MLB Picks

Now that you've assessed the situation, the next step is to book your action. Grab my premium MLB picks and unlock the door to my top picks of the day. In my 20-plus years of handicapping, I've developed a statistically-driven system for picking winners that involves power rankings, predictive models, and data analysis that has withstood the test of time.
