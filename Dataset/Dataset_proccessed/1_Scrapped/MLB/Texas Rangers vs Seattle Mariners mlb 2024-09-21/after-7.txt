ARLINGTON ― Max Scherzer’s injury-plagued season, and in all likelihood his Rangers’ career, is done.

Scherzer, 40, informed the Rangers Saturday morning that a sore left hamstring would prevent him from making a scheduled start against Seattle. The Rangers, already in a bind where pitching is concerned, felt they needed an extra relief arm and placed Scherzer on the 15-day IL. There are only nine days remaining in the season. The Rangers recalled Gerson Garabito to replace Scherzer. Dane Dunning, recalled on Friday, started against Seattle instead.

“He’s battled some things,” Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said. “He’s been trying hard to get back out there and pitching, which he did. But, yes, it’s been a challenge. You want them out there. We were hoping to see him out there on a consistent basis, but we’ve had some things that we’ve had to figure out. So, it’s been a tough year for him and it makes it look difficult for us, too.”

The future Hall of Famer, who can be a free agent after the season, has had three different stints on the IL this season with back, arm and now hamstring issues. He had more IL stints than wins (two). He also spent time last year on the IL with a torn teres major muscle in his back after the Rangers acquired him from the New York Mets for Luisangel Acuña, who made his MLB debut earlier this week.

Scherzer missed the first three months of the season, made eight starts between June 23 and July 30, then ended back on the DL with further arm issues. He has made just one start since July 30. In all, Scherzer has made just 17 regular season starts for the Rangers over the past two seasons, going 6-6 with a 3.57 ERA in 88⅓ innings.

Scherzer was not available for comment before Saturday’s game against Seattle. Had his issue been more clear to the Rangers on Friday, Jack Leiter likely would have been held back from a relief outing to start Saturday. It’s likely that Leiter, who has piggy-back relieved behind starters in the last two turns of the rotation, will slide back into the rotation to take Scherzer’s one scheduled remaining start.

“He was frustrated and disappointed to see his season come to an end,” GM Chris Young said of Scherzer. “He’s a competitor and he wants to be out there. I know how hard it is for him. I feel for him.”
