After leading his team to a 21-6 record in August, Seattle Mariners star Julio Rodriguez was named the American League Player of the Month on Sunday night.

Rodriguez takes home the honour for the time in his career, and becomes the first Mariners player to win the monthly award since April of 2015.

The 22-year-old centre fielder hit .429/.474/.724 over 23 games in the month while launching seven home runs, 10 doubles and stealing 11 bases. Rodriguez set a major league record for his performance from Aug. 16-19, piling up 17 hits over four games.

In August, Rodriguez ranked second among all MLB hitters in batting average, on-base percentage and hits.

In the senior circuit, Los Angeles Dodgers star Mookie Betts was the National League's Player of the Month.

Betts was named a Player of the Month for the second time in his career, previously winning in July 2016 as a member of the Boston Red Sox.

He guided the Dodgers to a 24-5 record in August, tying the franchise record for wins in a single month.

The 30-year-old led the league in batting average (.455), home runs (11), on-base percentage (.516), slugging (.839), OPS (1.355), hits (51), extra-base hits (21), total bases (94) and runs (35).

MLB also named its Pitchers of the Month for August, highlighting Kansas City Royals southpaw Cole Ragans and Milwaukee Brewers starter Freddy Peralta.

Ragans burst onto the scene in August after being traded to the Royals in June for Aroldis Chapman.

The 25-year-old went 3-1 over six starts in the month with a 1.72 ERA. He struck out 53 hitters over 36.2 innings of work.

Meanwhile, Peralta made five starts and posted a perfect 5-0 record, finishing with a 2.10 ERA. Over 30.0 innings, the 27-year-old held opponents to a .162 average while striking out 46.

MLB also awarded its Rookies and Relievers of the Month.

Oakland Athletics second baseman Zach Gelof was named the AL Rookie of the Month after hitting .286 with seven home runs over 27 games. In the NL, Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder James Outman earned the award for the second time this season after posting an .890 OPS.

Mariners closer Andres Munoz won his first career monthly honour, after saving 11 games in Seattle's August surge. He finished with a 1.93 ERA over 14 appearances in the month.

Atlanta Braves closer Raisel Iglesias didn't allow a single run in August to take home the NL award. He recorded seven saves and struck out 17 batters.
