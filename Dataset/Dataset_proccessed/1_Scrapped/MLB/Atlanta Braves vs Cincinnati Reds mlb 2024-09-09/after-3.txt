Nick Martinez dominates in Reds 1-0 win in Atlanta
 Doug Gray  09/09/2024 76

On Monday night it was Nick Martinez’s world and we were all just living in it. The right-hander dominated Atlanta for seven shutout innings as the Cincinnati Reds held on for a 1-0 win over the Braves in a 1-game stop in Georgia to make up a postponed game from July.

Final	R	H	E
Cincinnati Reds (70-75)
	1	8	0
Atlanta Braves (78-66)	0	2	1
W: Martinez (8-6) L: Morton (8-8) SV: Diaz (27)

Box Score | Game Thread

Cincinnati went down in order in the 1st inning. The Reds got some help from Charlie Morton to avoid that happening in the 2nd. Morton hit TJ Friedl to lead off the inning and then Ty France came through with a double into right field that scored Friedl to put the visiting club up 1-0.

That’s where the score remained as Nick Martinez was rolling and was in control against Atlanta’s offense. Charlie Morton settled in for a bit after the 2nd, but the Reds were threatening again in the 5th after back-to-back walks with two outs from Spencer Steer and Elly De La Cruz loaded the bases. But a trip to the mound worked out as Morton struck out Tyler Stephenson to strand all three runners.

Two innings later the Reds were once again threatening after 2-out singles from Noelvi Marte and Spencer Steer. That led to the Braves going to the bullpen to turn around Elly De La Cruz, but during the first pitch of the at-bat Cincinnati attempted a double steal and Marte was thrown out at third to end the inning.

Nick Martinez returned to the mound for the 7th inning and got a fly out on the first pitch he threw. Matt Olson picked up an infield hit on a soft grounder to third that saw Noelvi Marte’s throw pull Ty France off of the bag and he couldn’t make the swipe tag. That was just the second hit of the game against Martinez, but it also got the bullpen stirring for the Reds. It was no problem for Cincinnati’s starter, though, who retired the next two batters to hold onto the Reds 1-run lead.

Following seven shutout innings of 2-hit baseball, the Reds turned to the bullpen and sent Fernando Cruz out for the 8th inning. He needed just 11 pitches to pick up two strikeouts and a fly out to send the game to the 9th.

Cincinnati would put some pressure on Atlanta in the top of the inning. Jake Fraley and Santiago Espinal both picked up 1-out singles to put runners on the corners. Spencer Steer then reached on a 2-out infield hit to put a run on the board. Or at least for a second it did, but Atlanta challenged the call that Steer was safe at the bag and it was overturned to end the inning.

Alexis Diaz came into the game for the bottom of the 9th for Cincinnati and looked to hold onto a 1-0 lead. The Reds closer would do just that as he needed just 12 pitches to retire the side in order and pick up the save.

Notes Worth Noting

Nick Martinez matched a season high in innings. With his seven shutout frames he lowered his ERA to 3.46 on the season.

Ty France, Jake Fraley, and Amed Rosario all had two hits on the day.

France has had five multi-hit games out of his last seven games. He’s gone 14-27 in that stretch.

Nice ballgame by Reds tonight. Would be neat if Reds could get to 80 W somehow.

Jim t 09/09/2024

If the reds get to 80 wins with the state of their starting pitching it would be a huge accomplishment.

TR 09/10/2024

As the song goes, “what will be, will be.” Que sera, sera. I have a good feeling things will come together for the Reds in 2025.

Dennis Westrick 09/09/2024

Another AWESOME job by Martinez! And, great job by the bullpen as well! Reds pitchers limited a very good Braves team to only 2 hits! Remarkable!

I hope the Reds can find a way to resign Nick!

PTBNL 09/09/2024

Your positivity is putting me into a Bizzaro, alternate world dimension right now. What is going on?

It’s an old age thing!

O’m a Kentucky and Cincinnati fan, and Bengals, too. He’s a Notre Dame fan. We had a rough weekend on the gridiron.

MBS 09/10/2024

@Dennis, “I hope the Reds can find a way to resign Nick!”

That should be a top priority this offseason. He’s been huge for the club in a variety of ways. He’s not only been a great insurance policy, but he’s also been excellent in the different roles of Starter, Long Relief, and Short Relief.

The only thing that tops resigning Nick imo is acquiring an outfielder that is a difference maker.

LDS 09/09/2024

Reds still 9 off the wild card and with 17 games to go, they are rapidly approaching actual mathematical elimination. But, the fun thing is, that for tonight at least, the Reds have knocked Atlanta out of the third playoff spot. Going back to the days when both teams were in the NL West, and I was much, much younger, beating Atlanta was almost as much fun as beating the Dodgers.

RedlegScott 09/09/2024

Back in the day, beating LA was easily numerous uno.

RedlegScott 09/09/2024

Yes, it was. Obviously, the Dodgers had great players back in the 70s, but I hated the “marketing “ oh Garvey as a choirboy. No one was as saintly as he was often portrayed.

“No one was as saintly as he {Steve Garvey} was often portrayed…”

On Garvey: watch your fame and fortune dissipate, have your philandering exposed, become a politician, live off your doners–whose footsteps is he trying to follow in?

Nick in NKY 09/10/2024

I get that feeling that I am on the younger side compared to some of the commenters here, but I am old enough to remember watching on the old downstairs TV when you could only get away games on analog broadcast. I can remember the Braves owned the Reds in the 90s, and my dad HATED the tomahawk chop with righteous passion. Beating Smoltz, Glavine, or Maddux was a good night.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Quite the magical night!!!

RedsGettingBetter 09/09/2024

The Reds swept the 3-game scheduled at Atlanta finally. They have played pretty good the last two games winning 3-1 and 1-0 having outstanding pitching even without Greene, Abbott, Lodolo, Moll and so on…On the other hand, the offense keeps struggling especially in clutch situations…
Should the reds re-sign Martinez and keep Ty France for next season ?
Should Noelvi Marte start at triple-A in 2025?

Dennis Westrick 09/09/2024

In response to your player questions, Yes, Yes and Yes!

Dewey Roberts 09/09/2024

Espinal and Ty France are better both offensively and defensively. Marte needs to earn a roster spot in the majors. Espinal can play third better than Marte. France has been a surprise. He is not a great hitter but he is a player worthy of a roster spot.

jmb 09/10/2024

But what are they going to do with France, Candy, Steer, India, and CES all on the roster? If they want to get better, they can’t stick with India at second or Steer in left.

Redsvol 09/09/2024

Nick Krall – pay the man! Get an extension done before he leaves. Show the others that you will pay for performance.

Rob 09/10/2024

Some baseball sites are reporting that it will be a close call for Martinez on whether he stays or not. Krall should make it a non close call before October. I would think a 2 year deal would slam the door. But if Krall wants to take the risk that Martinez will choose to return, I would bet he loses him to free agency.

Vottoriffic 09/09/2024

Martinez has a $12 million dollar player option. He’ll definitely decline it and test the FA waters. But he sure would be a solid 2nd or 3rd guy in the rotation next year. Would the Reds pony up 3yrs/$45 million?

Kevin H 09/09/2024

Great job by Bell and Johnson. They have truly done remarkable things getting the pitching staff ready and fresh these last few weeks. Martinez dominate and how about Cruz and Diaz.

This team doesn’t quit

Justin T 09/10/2024

Bell had definitely been remarkable. Another late surge to keep his job. Next year rinse and repeat.

greenmtred 09/10/2024

I doubt that Bell is primarily responsible for the late surge, Justin. The complaint in years past has been the second half collapse. Pitching seems like the key in both cases: last year the guys who replaced all of the injured pitchers were mostly ineffective. This year, they’re doing much better so far.

jmb 09/10/2024

Another great start for Martinez! Watch his ERA drop! The more it does, the more likely he will decline his option and try for a 3-year deal for $14+ mil.yr. There are teams who will go for that, I think, but the Reds should not be one of them.

The Duke 09/10/2024

Martinez is 34 years old. Signing him to a long term contract would be betting on him being what he is right now into his upper 30s. If he takes the team option for next year, great, if not, let someone else pay the extra years. The Reds need to use their FA $$$ to get a power hitting RF.

VaRedsFan 09/10/2024

Charlie Morton is 40.
34-36 is not a death sentence

Rob 09/10/2024

Morton has made like 30 starts 5 straight years. Poster boy for durability. Are you listening Krall? Nah, you would rather have Lodolo who never pitches beyond August. These are the type of decisions a GM has to make and be right on.

The Duke 09/10/2024

Yes, the one or two exceptions are what we should expect, not the 98% of pitchers who fall off a cliff in their mid to upper 30’s.

MBS 09/10/2024

@Duke, 34 isn’t old, and 3 years isn’t long. 3Y x $15 is my guess on what keeps him here.

If it makes you feel any better, they could frontload his contract going $22M, $15M, $8M. The payroll is going to be laughably low in 2025. This will give us budget flexibility in 2027 when the young guys start making money.

BK 09/10/2024

Martinez is also in fantastic shape and doesn’t appear to need max effort to pitch successfully. There may be tangible signs that he is aging better than the norm.

Chris 09/10/2024

@The Duke, you are absolutely spot on. Guys just never seem to learn. Martinez has been excellent, but that doesn’t mean you pay him for multiple years.

LWBlogger 09/13/2024

Mostly agree with you here, but if a 2nd year would get it done, I wouldn’t be against it. As for a 3rd year or more, I agree it wouldn’t be a good idea, especially for a guy who has never thrown 150 innings. I mean he hasn’t ever thrown more than 130 since his rookie year.

SultanofSwaff 09/10/2024

Martinez was dazzling….the Braves broadcasters said 23 of 24 first pitch strikes. To me, he would be the perfect complement to the young rotation as a swing man. His 4 pitch mix makes a rapid dropoff at his age unlikely. Unless he is determined to have a defined role, I would think a return to the Reds could be possible. It would likely require a second year added to his contract, easily something ownership can afford no matter what they claim.

SultanofSwaff 09/10/2024

I think we’re all numb to the suicidal baserunning, but the effects on the game cannot be ignored. There’s aggressive and then there’s dumb, and the outs on the bases the last two games fall into the latter category. Twice on Sunday we made outs on the bases, and then last night with Elly at bat and two men on in a 1 run game Bell orders a double steal. It’s almost as if Bell fancies himself some baseball industry disruptor bro like you see in other fields….you know, the ones that flame out because no one needs what he’s selling. Sure, the Reds are 2nd in SB and have an 82% success rate (still, how would it look if you add in all the pickoffs), but there’s a recklessness here that doesn’t take into account the batter and situation. It needs to stop!

BK 09/10/2024

Overall base running numbers are very complementary of the Reds. That may be masking the impact of the number of outs they give up on the basepaths that often seem to be the byproduct of poor situational baseball and over aggression.

While they are arguably best in the league in baserunning production, there appears to be opportunities to improve by reducing pickoffs and TOOTBLANs. Bell and company have the right strategy to leverage the team speed advantage the Reds have, but the reality is modest improvement in this area would be game-changing.

greenmtred 09/10/2024

Good overview, BK.

old-school 09/10/2024

Id like to see a deeper analysis into the Reds baserunning numbers sans Elly.

Elly is a freak and with Acuna hurt, the most game changing baserunner in baseball. His Tootblans are minimized because he is so ridiculous otherwise and his contributions on the bases are log factors more important than his mistakes. But, its my bias he is massively propping up the Reds on the bases overall and the other baserunners are mostly over aggressive and/or reckless and mistake prone. Their mistakes are much costlier because they arent neutralized by being wildly successful taking extra bases other times. I could be just be blinded by the huge total of Outs on the bases that is hard to see over.

Doug Gray 09/10/2024

Just looking at the Fangraphs data the Reds are pretty good even without Elly’s contributions on the bases. He’s at +7.9. The team is at an MLB best +15.0. Even without Elly’s contributions, the Reds would rank 7th best in baseball.

Spencer Steer is the next best on the Reds at +4.0. No one else is at +2.0, but 11 guys on the team (including Steer and EDLC) are on the positive side of the ledger among the guys with at least 50 plate appearances. Tyler Stephenson (-2.9), Will Benson (-2.0), Ty France (-1.1), Nick Martini (-0.9) and Jeimer Candelario (-0.8) are the real negative guys. https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders/major-league?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&type=8&season=2024&month=0&season1=2024&ind=0&team=18&qual=50&sortcol=18&sortdir=default&pagenum=1

greenmtred 09/10/2024

Guys like Steer and Fraley have respectable success percentages, but aren’t as prolific as Elly who, himself, seems to have stopped running as much, probably tired. I agree, O-S, it would be interesting to see a deep dive into the running game. I suspect that the tootblans are a by-product of a strategic decision to run at unpredictable times and sow panic in opponents. Doesn’t seem to be an unalloyed success, does it?

BK 09/10/2024

https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2024-baserunning-batting.shtml

Looking through some of the base running stats, what stands out to me is the Reds have made the most outs on base (runner out trying to make a base running play) ans second in pickoffs. In those two categories alone the Reds have made 32 outs more than league average. These are two categories where improvement seems well within reach.

SultanofSwaff 09/10/2024

Cruz is still pre-arb, yet he’s already 34 years old. 95 strikeouts in 60 IP will draw serious trade interest. Probably best to see what he could bring in return…..might be a classic case of trading a year early rather than a year late.

The Duke 09/10/2024

Not sure how big of a return you can expect for a guy coming off a 5.13 ERA/1.34 WHIP year.

SultanofSwaff 09/10/2024

ERA/WHIP can be deceptive for relievers. He’s 12th in baseball in holds. There’s value in that.

Pharmer85 09/10/2024

Nice discussion in this post game thread. Shows what is possible without the constant play by play posts.

GreatRedLegsFan 09/10/2024

Outstanding job by Martinez. France continues raking the ball. Friedl saved the day with his sprint from first to home.

Tampa Red 09/10/2024

Martinez is the definition of a big league pitcher. Fantastic location, 4-pitch mix, constant change in speed and eye level. Durable, consistent. I’d have no problem with Reds extending him a 1-2 years beyond next season.

GreatRedLegsFan 09/10/2024

Considering comparable players’ salaries and how hybrid pitchers’ market is evolving, he should be demanding an AAV close to $20MM, 2-3 years.

Votto4life 09/10/2024

Which the Reds should offer. They already have $12 Million dollars dedicated to him next year. Offer him 20M a year for three years. He might not take it, but they should at least make an effort.

Michael B. Green 09/10/2024

I love 1-0 games! That typically means great pitching and defense. It also typically means one team was able to manufacture a run. Baseball is a beautiful art! In this case, it was our speed that made the difference. Great game, fellas!

BK 09/10/2024

Agree.

SultanofSwaff 09/10/2024

Marte’s throwing accuracy continues to worry–2 more offline. He seems to be having trouble with the internal clock. Oftentimes he’ll pop the mitt one time before recognizing the runner is faster than expected, which causes him to rush. With ample time he tends to take a little off. Hopefully with experience (he’s just 22) these issues will get ironed out.

BK 09/10/2024

This season has been disastrous for Marte. He needs AAA time to reset across the board. The offseason can’t come fast enough for him.

Jim Walker 09/10/2024

I’ve seen a fair amount of chatter in “scouts say” type articles that project Marte becoming a corner OF guy. I’m not sure how that happens if they persist in keeping him at MLB. However, if they put him in the outfield at AAA, and does well and also rediscovers his offense, he could emerge as a major plus for the Reds.

Jim Walker 09/10/2024

Also not excusing Marte for his overall defense, but I think the Reds have a systemic issue with how they are positioning their 3B in some of their shifts. Espinal had issues with a similar ball over the weekend; and, my mind’s eye memory says we have seen a number of them throughout the season regardless of who has been playing 3B.

They seem to line the 3B up in the natural SS spot and at times even shade him toward 2B. The results seem to be looping routes and/or running throws on balls hit to the player’s right.

Old Big Ed 09/10/2024

The Reds could play Marte and 2 clones at 3B at the same time, jointly covering the line and the 5-6 hole, and Marte would still be a lousy third baseman. He has the range of a domino, the footwork of a toddler, and the arm of an alligator.

He is the worst fielder at any position that I remember the Reds playing, since they played Yonder Alonso in LF for a few games. Alonso played LF like Herman Munster.

old-school 09/10/2024

Suarez SS experiment was awful and Moose towards the end, Ill let others use the analogy reference to his “glove”

Melvin 09/10/2024

Old Big Ed – …but tell us what you really think. 

Rednat 09/10/2024

this is the 5th 1-0 game the reds have been involved in this year. seems like a lot. scoring and offense way down this year, (continuing the dead ball era trend). the pitch clock seems to be favoring the pitchers and defense big time (although maybe leading to more injuries).

i still think the defensive shifts need to be restricted a lot more (particularly the outfield shifts and cheat cheats) to help level the playing field for the hitters.

some people like the low scoring games but i would rather see a back and forth epic 11-10 game any day of the week. I hope the league continues to modify rules to favor the offense

Anthony 09/10/2024

Guys…i love Reds as much as anyone. But we do NOT want them to get to 80 wins. Cant have any reason that FO brings this manager back in 25. If hes retained were stuck in this cycle can never get out of. For love of the franchise we gotta have a final win total in low-mid 70s .

Mark A Verticchio 09/10/2024

I am not a Bell supporter, to say the least, but we all must realize that he is going to be the manager in 2025. Hence I am pulling for this team to win as much as possible. I don’t think they will reach .500, 81 wins. They need to go 11 and 6 the rest of the way, possible but not likely. I look for maybe 7 and 10 for a 77 and 85 finish.

greenmtred 09/10/2024

Well, if we all took turns pitching for them for the rest of the season, we could probably accomplish your goal.

LDS 09/10/2024

Could it be any worse? We old coots here wouldn’t be expected to pitch well. The highly paid, professional athletes are.

greenmtred 09/10/2024

I was suggesting an old coot rotation to help Anthony reach his goal of the fewest possible wins. The pitching has, to my eye, been surprisingly good considering its stop-gap nature. Had the Reds been able to hit more and refrain from running themselves out of innings, they might even be flirting with respectability.

LDS 09/10/2024

Yes, the pitching has mostly surprised this year. The hitting? Not so much. Krall didn’t make the right off season moves. And likely won’t this year. Acquiring league average players is not going to move the Reds forward.

David 09/10/2024

Except to make you league average. With a little bit o’luck, the Reds could have finished at 0.500

League average.

And I generally agree, that next year will not be much different than this year, unless one or more of the present regulars on the team have a really stand-out year.

greenmtred 09/10/2024

I think their hope, David, is that the young guys who are playing grow and improve and that the young guys who have missed most or all of the season will come back healthy and begin to live up to their promise. If that happens for a fair number of them, the Reds will probably be better if they aren’t hamstrung by injuries as they so often are. If we had some ham we could have some ham and eggs if we had some eggs.

LWBlogger 09/13/2024

“Don’t we need a Catcher?”

“Not if you get it near the plate, we don’t.”

redfanorbust 09/10/2024

Mostly the same story different year. Losing franchises have to overpay for quality players. Unless Martinez just loves playing for the Reds and is willing to play for them if Reds match the highest bidder, with pitching the premium it is I can see 2 yrs 40M plus for him. In any event they need to make a qualifying offer so they can get a draft pick out of it if he does not sign with the Reds. We still need a premium OF as we all know. Depending on what the definition of premium ends up being could cost anywhere from 15M to 50M per year. Then their is the matter of signing some of our young talent to an extension much like we did for Hunter. Elly extension? What would that look like even if he agreed, which I doubt he will? Then they still have to surround him with a quality team or what is the point in signing him long term? I am guessing Reds trade him in a couple of years for half of some teams farm system. So in my conclusion, IMHO ownership needs to open up it’s pocketbook if they ever hope to be serious contenders for anything other than scrapping for a WC spot.

LDS 09/10/2024

Not happening. You’re not wrong. It’s just not likely. And EDLC will probably never sign with the Reds

David 09/10/2024

in conclusion, the present ownership is really not concerned with the Reds really being a contender. They will once again go cheap on signing any free agents this winter.

Prove me wrong, Big Bob and Phil!

And no, they will not sign Elly to an extension, because he would want the Moon and some stars, too.

JayTheRed 09/10/2024

I see Steer signing an extension before Elly unless the front office shocks us.
