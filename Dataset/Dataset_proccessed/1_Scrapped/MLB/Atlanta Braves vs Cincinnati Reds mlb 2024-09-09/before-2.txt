Cincinnati Reds vs Atlanta Braves Prediction

I’ll stick with the Braves. Morton hasn’t been too bad over his last three starts. In that time he’s 1-0 with seven earned runs in 16.1 total innings. Morton has given up 18 hits and nine walks in that time and has gone at least 5.0 innings in each outing.

On Sunday Atlanta got the winning run on an infield grounder by Sean Murphy after a lengthy and tense 11-inning battle. The Braves’ bullpen came through with 5.0 innings, six hits, two walks, and no earned runs, though there were some close calls along the way. I like Atlanta to keep it going in Monday’s matchup.
