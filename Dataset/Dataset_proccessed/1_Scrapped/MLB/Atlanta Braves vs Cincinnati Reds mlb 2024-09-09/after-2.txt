Nick Martinez


After a strong start to the second half of the season, Nick Martinez has stumbled a bit in his last five starts where he’s given up six home runs in 24.1 innings, allowed 32 hits, and has a 5.55 ERA. In his last outing against Houston he allowed one earned run – but was charged with three additional unearned runs – in 5.2 innings during a 12-5 Reds victory.

The splits for righties and lefties aren’t that big for Martinez. Lefties are slightly better across the board against him but only hold an 18 point advantage in OPS compared to righties. Where his splits are big are in the home and road categories. On the road he has a 2.74 ERA (4.36 at home) and holds hitters to a .558 OPS (.808 at home).

Charlie Morton


On August 8th, Milwaukee put up eight runs and hit four homers in 2.2 innings against Morton. Since then he’s made five starts and has a 3.25 ERA in his 27.2 innings and has given up just three home runs.

The splits for Charlie Morton are interesting. Right-handed hitters do well when they make contact – they are hitting .268 and they are slugging .492. But they rarely walk against him and only have a .308 on-base percentage against him. Lefties are the opposite – they hit for a low average and little power, but they walk a lot and sport a .364 on-base percentage against him.

Who would have thought at the beginning of the year Nick Martinez would be the work horse of our starting pitchers

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

In this long war of attrition, I’m thinking most of the Reds are tired mentally and physically, those who are still left standing. Musial used to lie down on his back with his feet up on the bench, with knees bent, in the locker room and just rest before the game. He played 20 years. Most of us can’t imagine what playing this many games (162) over the course from Spring to Fall does to the players. Still they are out there… and we root for them just the same to come thru in the clutch. The greats rise to the occasion. And these Reds need to finish strong.

CincyDo 09/09/2024

Not sure about everyone but I go to work about 45-46 weeks a year and I don’t make millions. So I have no sympathy for players playing 9 months a year including spring training and making millions.

Doug Gray 09/09/2024

The amount of money you make doesn’t have anything to do with how tired and exhausted one gets.

Also, more than half of the team doesn’t “make millions”.

That said – I know that I’m exhausted for covering the team every single day without an off day since like mid-February.

Tom Reeves 09/09/2024

Most people have no idea how much better professional baseball players are at their job than us commentators are at our jobs.

CincyDo 09/09/2024

I am not sure I agree Doug. Athletes can afford a better life style that helps them recover quickly. Story goes that Russel Wilson spends about $1mil a year on massage and other recovery help. Tennis players travel with a couple physios to help them recover quickly. So the more money one has, the more amititues one has to keep their body in better shape to handle the physical demand of their job.

Doug Gray 09/09/2024

Recovery doesn’t change how tired or exhausted one is, though. It simply allows you to push forward more and longer despite all of the work you are putting in.

Jim Walker 09/09/2024

CincyDo>> Another way of seeing things is that all the time effort and money professional athletes spend staying in physical and mental shape to compete is actually time spent on their job and part of the basis for their salary.

Daytonnati 09/09/2024

I know the fans are 

Mauired 09/09/2024

Funny story I was at this game in July. It was a beautiful day and then it started monsooning just before game time. I went to the getaway day game the following day. Another beautiful day. Then when they tried to makeup the rainout in the evening it started monsooning again. Hopefully 3rd times a charm.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

We can hope that’s the case … always a chance, right?

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Doug – if I wrote something in my comment that shouldn’t be here, I apologize. I didn’t think I had, but my comment posted and then disappeared.

Let’s win this one and then get out of town. Storms tracking up toward St. Louis by later this week.

Doug Gray 09/09/2024

I deleted it. It wasn’t exactly against the rules, but I wasn’t a fan of the stated description of what to do to Atlanta. It’s fine – I’d just prefer other terms to be used than the ones you did.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Got it. I was on the fence about it. No worries.

RedsGettingBetter 09/09/2024

Charlie Morton has been a tough cookie recent years for the Reds. I remember the Reds hit him well when he was a Pirate…Obviously, he reinvented himself as a pitcher so turned into a very strong one but the age is not helping at this point…

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

I’m wondering just how much pixie dust and magic Morton has in his kit bag. It seems like he’s been around forever (and pretty good for the most part). Gonna take some patience from the boyz and we are often short on that.

First pitch coming shortly.

On a baseball movie related note, we lost a great one today. James Earl Jones – from Bingo Long to Field of Dreams to The Sandlot. He approached every role with a ton of class and poise. He will be missed.

RedsGettingBetter 09/09/2024

Martinez has had problems against Ozuna and Olson in his career. This inning wasn’t an exception…

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Ozuna’s numbers … WOW!!! He’s having quite a year.

Got out of the inning without damage. Still need more patience against Morton to make it work.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Don’t know about patience but France just drove in Friedl on a first pitch double, who got on with a hit by pitch. Reds up 1-0.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Morton throwing heat where he wants to, and then follows with a good curveball to get Fraley for out number 2.

VaRedsFan 09/09/2024

TJ looked surprised that House was sending him and had to kick it up a notch.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Scraped out a run. That ball checked up and died at the wall.

At least we turned over the line-up and ran up the pitch count.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

the 2-2-2 vortex sucks in Marte for out three with runners on 2nd and 3rd.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

I noticed he didn’t take the usual batter timeout after the 2nd strike…

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

That’s a more comfortable inning. Marte made a solid throw as well. Keeps the “adventure fielding” in check for France.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Yep, good inning for Martinez.

RedsGettingBetter 09/09/2024

Apparently, the Morton’s curveball is much for Elly…

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

I think Elly is trying to outguess himself. And he’s pressing … again … 

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Wow, Morton just shut down the top of the Reds order… His four seamer is smoking at about 95 and his curveball is about 82 mph.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

For the second time

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Yeah, and Martinez matches his effort in the Braves half of the 3rd…

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Morton making it look easy, too easy… his drillin’ it.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Murphy gets fooled by the slider for the 3rd out in the Braves’ 4th.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

This is looking like another pitcher’s duel !

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

4 in the books. Need to score and maybe chase Charlie.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Fraley puts the leading lady on in the Reds 5th.

Votto4life 09/09/2024

I thought we were asked to reframe from posting play by play?

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

We were. Doug asked that very politely a couple of games ago.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

I’m thinking a little bit keeps the flow going.

Doug Gray 09/09/2024

Stop posting play by play.

Votto4life 09/09/2024

Andrew it’s nice you think that, but I think you find others here disagree. This is Doug’s site. He is the owner of this space. As Doug reminds us, this is not a baseball forum. It’s a source of well written articles by Doug and his excellent group of writers.

We are all guests here, Doug has asked us specifically not to do play by play in the comments, I just don’t understand why you or anyone else would refuse to honor such a request?

Sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt your “flow”.

Votto4life 09/09/2024

Sorry Doug, feel free to delete my latest post.

DaveCT 09/09/2024

This is Doug’s livelihood.

Failing to adhere to his commenting policies can harm that livelihood.

To be unaware of that is, at this point, irresponsible.

And to ignore that fact is quite possibly disrespectful.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

OK, TySteve … time to shine!!!!

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Nuts!!!

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Morton walks Steer to get to Elly ? Throws a 3-1 curveball for strike 2 … and loses Elly with a ball in the dirt, prompting a mound visit. Reds threaten with 2 outs.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

And Morton strikes out Stephenson with the high heat to end the 5th.

RedsGettingBetter 09/09/2024

How hard has been for this Reds team hit in clutch situations all season… My goodness

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Brutal … or so it would seem

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Nice 5 innings from Nick. Let’s back him with a couple of runs, shall we?

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Martinez looking stellar after 5… Arcia helped him out by swinging at ball 4 and then lines out to right for the 3rd out

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Yeah … I’m liking this version of Ty France.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Complete face palm … 

What a snag and start to that GIDP. Talk about “unlucky” for us.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Nice to see Friedl try a bunt for a basehit … Then France gets on, but the inning ends on a dbl play off the bat of Espinal. Reds still up 1-0.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

6 strong innings and 16 Bravos in a row … anybody have that on their BINGO card tonight?

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

We’ve seen Martinez pitch this well lately, but a one hitter thru 6…

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

With two down in the 6th, the Reds make a mound visit, and Martinez gets Soler on two pitches… Wheels are turning in the Reds dugout.

VaRedsFan 09/09/2024

1 hit through 6.
What a masterclass in pitching by Martinez.

Leave him alone Mr. Bell.
Let him be.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Morton and Votto both drafted in 2002. Interesting. Welsh saying we’re seeing “vintage Morton” on display tonight.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

OK, Elly … time to show us some stuff … against somebody other than Morton … 

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Another 2 out rally in the 7th, brings on a mound visit with Elly at the plate.

And Aaron Bummer replaces Charlie Morton… the games is on the line.

Daytonnati 09/09/2024

I don’t think this is going to end well for you, Andrew …

DaveCT 09/09/2024

Ty France > Smith, Rios, Ford, Martini, Myers, Vosler, Moose, & Moran.

It’s relatively unknown if France is > Candelario or CES when healthy. I choose to just acknowledge the differences.

Espinal > Jordan, Soto, Barrero, Reynolds, Lopez, Farmer, Schrock, & JT Riddle (who?).

It’s unknown if Espinal is better overall than Marte, as the latter has played poorly this year. This season, Espinal is most certainly is superior. But, as above, i’ll take a pass.

I think these two players, with Rosario, are an example of how quality reserves and/or part time players can stabilize a lineup let alone a roster.

They were acquired for a third string, Lo-A catcher, Andruw Salcedo, and a 7th round 2022 draftee, Chris McElvain, with average stuff currently on the full season IL in Hi-A.

Credit where credit is due.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

+25,000

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Well I didn’t expect that. Noelvi caught stealing third on a dbl steal attempt, and that ends the Reds threat.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

The Book says not to make the first out or the last out at third… cardinal rule.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Good challenge call. No idea if they’ll overturn it. And why isn’t Marte wearing an oven mitt?

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

“Stands” … and rally killed.

Old-school 09/09/2024

Nick Martinez, Santiago Espinal, and Ty France are giving some professional big league contributions. Good to see. Reds control Santiago and France and those are becoming no-brainers for 2025. Martinez wont take his player option and opt for FA. Reds need to get ahead of that and offer him 2 years again. He has been a big asset for this team.

Sigh….another out on the bases at 3b.

VaRedsFan 09/09/2024

This is not being overturned.
Glove hit his left thumb.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Surprised it wasn’t “confirmed”.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Martinez is certainly getting those cans of corn.

VaRedsFan 09/09/2024

Marte just can’t consistently make an accurate throw.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

And it wasn’t even that he had time to overthink it. A little redemption on snagging that liner from Murphy.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

That’s where the burned challenge may come back to haunt. Marte’s arm is still inconsistent.

How about Bike Helmets here?

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Need a couple of insurance runs now.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Martinez still looking strong after 7 … instead of 2 on and 2 outs the Braves’ batter hits a pitch outside for the third out.

RedsGettingBetter 09/09/2024

Martínez outdueled Morton today… outstanding outing…

Roger Garrett 09/09/2024

Marte never learned a thing while setting for a few games.Set him back down please.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

I’m afraid the combination of youth and raw talent are what we’re seeing. He dug himself a hole with the suspension and hasn’t really climbed out of it from where I sit. I hope he doesn’t play Winter ball anywhere and just focuses on his fundamentals.

LDS 09/09/2024

The Reds won last night and they are leading 1-0 after 7? Martinez having a really good game. Nick Krall and his FO crew needs to pitch an extension to Martinez before he opts out of his option.

Votto4life 09/09/2024

Yeah, they have already committed $12 Million (I think) to Martinez next year, why not offer him an extra $5 Million and keep him around awhile?

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

And let him start so he knows how to prepare in the offseason.

Votto4life 09/09/2024

Yes, great point Mark.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

With 2 down and a man on first, there’s a mound visit by the Braves with Ty France at the plate. … and Grant Holmes replaces Bummer.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

the Strikeout blues plague the Reds in the 8th.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

I’ve resisted replying to any of your comments. Doug has asked you directly on this game thread to stop the play-by-play. We all like having a diverse community here, but I’m thinking you are riding the edge of a ban. I strongly suggest you cut it out.

RedsGettingBetter 09/09/2024

It seems the only chance to win this game is with a 1-0 shut out.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Kind of feels that way. Just hoping Cruz has learned something from his “starts”.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

time for Bike Helmets now… F. Cruz onto pitch for the Reds.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Cruz strikes out the first two Bravos in the 8th… and gets Williams to fly out, for a 1-2-3 inning… Looking good.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

I’m voting to put F. Cruz back out there for the 9th…

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

WOW!!! 

8 shutout innings. Everybody in Mets Country has to be throwing their best mojo our way tonight.

RedsGettingBetter 09/09/2024

Cruz retired 1-2-3 as the good old days

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Blew a fastball by an 0-2 count when the splitter/forkball was expected. That was extra special.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Notice nobody is calling out our Mr. Bell for “over managing” tonight … the only marginal call was the challenge and that was probably worth the shot. Funny what a solid game will do to quiet the crowd, eh? 

RedsGettingBetter 09/09/2024

An insurance run would be nice here

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Got a little lucky after that big turn 

Roger Garrett 09/09/2024

Will Marte make up for his base running blunder?Lets hope so.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Nope. Not even close. Now it takes a hit or something else “weird” to get the runner in.

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Sean Murphy is earning his paycheck tonight

RedsGettingBetter 09/09/2024

Marte is horrible

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

Youth + Raw Talent + (what I think is) Ego = a dangerous combination

Expected challenge here.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

He did look bad in that at bat.

Daytonnati 09/09/2024

Just a fly ball, Noelve, just a fly ball … but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO …

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

It’s now up to Steer… and he comes thru with a base hit. One run scores…

RedsGettingBetter 09/09/2024

Steerrrrr is nice

Daytonnati 09/09/2024

Tie goes to the runner?

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

That was the rule in all our playground or sandlot games, wasn’t it? 

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

A not-so-rested Diaz … hold on to your butts … 

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

For the record, I support this move. It makes me nervous, but I support it.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Well my vote didn’t count. On comes Diaz for the Braves’ 9th.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

One down … Diaz is facing the top of the order.

RedsGettingBetter 09/09/2024

Incredible, not ideal really that overtuned play…

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

We had one go our way in NYC if I’m not mistaken. Same call with “in the glove”.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

And Diaz gets Ocuna for the 3rd out. Reds win in a shutout ! 2-0 !

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

What 1-0 ? Ok, I missed something. I thought Steer drove in a run in the 9th to make it 2-0.

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Oh, The call of Steer safe at first was overturned, nullifying the run scored… c’est la vie …

Mark Moore 09/09/2024

And our “barnstorming stop” comes out for the good guys.

Got to be Martinez with Day tonight.

Onward to St. Louis!!

RedsGettingBetter 09/09/2024

REDS WIN! the only way tonight 1-0 …Spoiling the Braves today… Funny.. BTW this is a Reds sweep in Atlanta

Andrew Brewer 09/09/2024

Yep, because we already won the first two.

Doc 09/09/2024

Five out of seven from playoff bound teams. David Bell still manager. Love it.
