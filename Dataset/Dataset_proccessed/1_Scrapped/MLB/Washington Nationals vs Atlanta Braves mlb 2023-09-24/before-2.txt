MLS. Leo Messi: I was the only World Cup winning player who didn't get recognition

Luciano "Lucho" Acosta has dominated opponents and danced around defenders ever since joining MLS in 2017 with D.C. United. Now with FC Cincinnati since 2021, Acosta has been getting better and better every season.

2023 is going as well as possible for Acosta, with his league-leading 15 goals and additional 12 assists putting him as one of the MVP frontrunners with the season coming to a close soon. On Saturday against Charlotte FC, Acosta demonstrated he is in untouchable form, giving fans a goal they will not soon forget.

Messi and Maradona would be proud of Lucho Acosta

As an Argentinian, Acosta's mazy run and finish had many thinking about two iconic goals from his fellow countrymen: Lionel Messi against Getafe and Diego Maradona against England.

Acosta has never been called up to the Argentina national team due to the talent and depth the country has, but his recent form has surely caught the eye of Lionel Scaloni.

Acosta's goal helped cap off a 3-0 blowout of Charlotte for FC Cincinnati. Cincy has been by far the best team in MLS, having earned nine more points than the next closest team in the entire league and 12 more than the second place Eastern Conference team.

A loss to Inter Miami in the US Open Cup semifinals put a damper on their season, but they should be considered the favorite to lift the MLS Cup trophy in December.
