MLB
Mookie Betts seen on crutches in Dodgers injury scare
By Mike Rosenstein
Published Sep. 8, 2023, 10:34 a.m. ET

Dodgers right fielder Mookie Betts left LoanDepot Park in Miami Thursday on crutches after fouling a ball off his foot in a 10-0 win over the Marlins.

ESPN reports initial X-rays were negative.

The injury happened in the first inning, but Betts stayed in the game until the eighth inning.

Betts is having an MVP year for the Dodgers, hitting .314 with a career-high 38 home runs and 99 RBI.

The 30-year-old Betts was named American League MVP in 2018 when he led the Boston Red Sox to their most recent World Series title.

Betts is bidding to join Frank Robinson as the only players to win MVP in both leagues.

Robinson was NL MVP in 1961 with the Cincinnati Reds and in 1966 with the Baltimore Orioles, when he won the Triple Crown.

Betts’ main competition this year figures to be Braves right fielder Ronald Acuna Jr., who’s hitting .331 with 34 home runs and 88 RBI.

Acuna also leads the majors with 63 stolen bases, making him the first 30-60 player in MLB history.

As for Betts, all eyes will be on his foot as he walks into the clubhouse Friday when the Dodgers open a three-game series with the Nationals in Washington, D.C.

What do you think? Post a comment.

There’s no need for the Dodgers to rush Betts into the lineup, since Los Angeles has a 13-game lead over the Diamondbacks in the NL West.

The Dodgers also trail the Braves by six games for the No. 1 seed in the NL with 23 games left in the regular season.
