MLB
Pete Alonso hit in helmet with Taijuan Walker pitch in scary Mets moment
By Dan Martin

Pete Alonso and the Mets got a scare on Saturday, when the first baseman was drilled in the helmet by a pitch from Philadelphia’s Taijuan Walker in the bottom of the second of the first game of a doubleheader at Citi Field.

The 84-mph cutter broke the flap off of Alonso’s helmet and he stayed in the game after a visit from the training staff and Buck Showalter.

It was the 21st time Alonso had been hit by a pitch this season, the second-most in the majors behind only Seattle’s Ty France, who’s been drilled 34 times. 

Pete Alonso #20 of the New York Mets is hit by a pitch by Taijuan Walker #99 of the Philadelphia Phillies that breaks the jaw guard of the helmet during the second inning of the first game of a doubleheader at Citi Field.

Walker played for the Mets and Alonso the previous two years before signing with the Phillies last offseason.
