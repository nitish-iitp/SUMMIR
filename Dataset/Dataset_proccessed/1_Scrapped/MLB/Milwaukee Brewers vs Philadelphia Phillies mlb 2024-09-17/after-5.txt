Phillies vs Brewers Predictions & MLB Picks Today (9/17)

The Brewers opened this three-game series with a massive 6-2 win over the Phillies on Monday. Milwaukee took a 2-0 lead in the third inning and didn’t look back as RHP Aaron Civale struck out six batters across five innings for his seventh win of the 2024 season.

With the victory, the Brewers have extended their NL Central lead to 10 games over the Chicago Cubs. Meanwhile, despite the disappointing loss, the Phillies still hold an eight-game lead over the New York Mets in the NL East.

Nevertheless, Monday’s defeat at the hands of the Brewers was a rare one for the Phillies, who are 4-1 SU in their last five meetings with the former. Philadelphia swept Milwaukee when they met for three games at Citizens Bank Park in June, which included limiting Pat Murphy’s club to two total runs.

The Phillies also know how to bounce back from a loss. After all, they haven’t suffered back-to-back defeats since the end of August, going 16-6 SU across 22 games since then. Conversely, the Brewers are a respectable 12-7 SU since Aug. 28 and have won five of their last seven outings.

The Brewers and Phillies have been among the National League’s hottest teams since the end of August. 

With how well these teams have been playing, tonight’s Phillies vs. Brewers showdown could come down to the starting pitchers.

The Phillies are rolling with RHP Zack Wheeler, who’s been among the best hurlers in the Majors yet again. The former NL Cy Young finalist has only lost once in his last eight games, going 5-1 with a 1.76 ERA with 60 strikeouts in 51 innings. Wheeler also beat the Brewers earlier this season when he tallied six Ks across seven innings with one run allowed on June 3.

As for the Brewers, RHP Frankie Montas just recorded eight strikeouts across six scoreless innings during Thursday’s 3-0 win over the San Francisco Giants. Interestingly enough, Montas recorded a win over the Phillies when he was with the Brewers at the start of the campaign, allowing one run with five Ks on April 3.

Will Phillies RHP Zack Wheeler lead his club to another victory on Tuesday?  

After being embarrassed yesterday, I predict that the Phillies will bounce back today. It’s easy to have confidence in Philadelphia when Wheeler is on the mound, especially when you consider his recent success against Milwaukee. We also haven’t seen the visitors suffer consecutive losses in a while, so look for them to get back on track.

Keeping that in mind, let’s back the Phillies on the moneyline before moving on.

Best Phillies vs Brewers MLB Player Prop (9/17)

The two-time MLB All-Star slugger is on a bit of a hot streak lately. In his last 12 games (45 at-bats), Schwarber is slashing .378/.442/.911 with 17 hits, seven home runs, 14 RBIs, and 13 runs scored. He finished with the Over on this prop in eight of those games, including when he tallied an RBI less than 24 hours ago.

Considering how Schwarber has two HRs in five career at-bats vs. Montas, I like his odds of hitting the Over on this prop (and, potentially more).
