Cubs Offense Dominated

The Cubs have won six games in a row and they have a ton of confidence heading into this game.

Seiya Suzuki also finished with two hits, two runs, and two walks. The Cubs are averaging 4.54 runs while their pitching is giving up 4.19 runs per game. The offense is ranked 13th in the league while the pitching is ranked 10th. Ian Happ has hit 23 home runs and driven in 77 RBIs so far this season. Getting the start for the Cubs will be Jameson Taillon who sits with a 9-8 record and an ERA of 3.85. Two starts ago against the Detroit Tigers, he went five innings, giving up six hits and four runs. 

Pirates Offense Looks to Bounce Back

The Pirate's offense is going to bounce in a big way after they really struggled on Sunday. The Pirates offense scored one run on Sunday against the Cleveland Guardians and that led to the five-run defeat. Mitch Keller went 5.2 innings giving up 11 hits and three runs. The Pirates are averaging 4.21 runs while their pitching is giving up 4.58 runs per game. The offense is ranked 21st while the pitching is also ranked 21st. They also have a negative run differential of -0.39 which is ranked 21st. Getting the start for the Pirates will be Jared Jones who sits with a 5-7 record and an ERA of 3.88. In his last start against the Chicago Cubs, he went four innings giving up five hits and five runs. 

Why the Pirates Will Beat the Cubs
The road team has won eight of the Cubs' last nine games.
The Cubs have lost each of their last three home games against the Pirates following a win.
The Pirates have covered the run line in each of their last seven night games against NL Central opponents following a road loss.
The Cubs have failed to cover the run line in 10 of their last 11 games at Wrigley Field against NL Central opponents that held a losing record.
Pittsburgh Pirates vs Chicago Cubs Prediction 

Jones has actually been decent this season and this is a great spot to take the Pirates. Jones sits with an ERA of 5-7 but the Pirates haven’t done him any favors. In this game the Pirates bats are going to bounce back early and they are going to get to Taillon. Jones will have another strong start and it will be Pittsburgh that gets the job done. Back the Pirates on the money line to cash.
