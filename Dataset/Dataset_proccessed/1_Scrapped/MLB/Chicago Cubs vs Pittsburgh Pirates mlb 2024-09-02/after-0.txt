BN  Chicago Cubs  Enhanced Box Score: Pirates 5,....
Enhanced Box Score: Pirates 5, Cubs 3 – September 2, 2024
Brett Taylor
Sep 02, 2024
CHICAGO CUBS

The Cubs got out to a 3-0 lead on the strength of Dansby Swanson and Ian Happ staying hot, Pete Crow-Armstrong staying fast, the defense staying sound, and Jameson Taillon staying on the ground (like, batted balls, I mean).

But then the bullpen scuffled, the Pirates came back, and the Cubs … lost? They can still do that?

(I make jokes to protect myself against feeling feelings.)

Jorge Lopez had been brilliant for the Cubs this year coming into tonight, so I’m definitely not going to destroy him for things going sideways. I will, however, note that he missed last week with a groin injury but did not go on the Injured List. He appeared again this weekend with a solid inning, so maybe he’s fine, but it’s hard not to let it pass through your mind after an outing like that.

Swanson is your Ankin Law “Making it Personal” Player of the Game, but it feels mighty hollow right about now.

Full box score.
