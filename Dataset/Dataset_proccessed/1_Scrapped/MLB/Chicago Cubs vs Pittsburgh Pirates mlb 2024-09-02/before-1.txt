Cheat Sheet and Projections

We have reviewed every player from every team to help you make the best selections on Monday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Garrett Crochet (CWS, P)	$19,280	21.2	1.1
Value	Caden Dana (LAA, P)	$5,000	12.3	2.5
Fade	Benjamin Gamel (HOU, OF)	$8,070	1.6	0.2
Cheapie	Lane Thomas (CLE, OF)	$5,000	5.6	1.1

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks offer the most "bang for your buck," meaning they're expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For budget-conscious strategies, "cheapie" options highlight the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

In DFS, creating an optimal line-up requires understanding key concepts and metrics. When building your MLB Monday teams, consider starting with a value player like Caden Dana. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Garrett Crochet is a strong option. If you're seeking budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, take a look at our cheapie options, including Lane Thomas.

On the other hand, according to our model, Benjamin Gamel is one of the lowest value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if building multiple line-ups.
