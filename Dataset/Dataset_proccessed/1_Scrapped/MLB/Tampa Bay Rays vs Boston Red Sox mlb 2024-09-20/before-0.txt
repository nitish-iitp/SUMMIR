Twins Continue to Lose

The Twins offense continues to struggle and their bullpen is just tired which has led to the struggles. On Thursday the Twins scored two runs but it wasn’t enough as they ended up losing in extra innings. Manuel Margot had the only RBI for the Twins. The Twins are averaging 4.66 runs while their pitching is giving up 4.44 runs per game. They have a run differential of 0.22 which is 16th in the league. Byron Buxton went 0-5 on Thursday and they need him to be better. Getting the start for the Twins will be David Festa who sits with a 2-6 record and an ERA of 5.07. In his last start against the Cincinnati Reds, he went 3.2 innings giving up three hits and two runs. 

Red Sox Fell Short

The Red Sox fell short on Thursday against the Tampa Bay Rays. The offense failed to score any runs and that led to the defeat. Brayan Bello went 5.2 innings giving up five hits and one run. The offense managed only one hit total and that isn’t going to be good enough to compete in many games. The Red Sox are averaging 4.71 runs while their pitching is giving up 4.71 runs per game. The offense is ranked 9th in the league while the pitching is ranked 24th. Tyler O’Neil has hit 31 home runs and driven in 61 RBIs so far this season. The Red Sox offense needs to jump out to a fast lead in this game. 

Why the Red Sox Will Beat the Twins
The Red Sox have won each of their last six games against the Twins at Fenway Park following a loss.
The Twins have lost each of their last five games after going to extra innings.
The Twins have failed to cover the run line in seven of their last eight games after going to extra innings.
The Red Sox have covered the run line in each of their last five home games against the Twins following a loss.
Minnesota Twins vs Boston Red Sox Prediction

The Twins are struggling, and it’s not going to get any easier in this game. Festa probably shouldn’t be pitching for the Twins, but they have no other choice, so they continue to run him out there. The Red Sox are averaging 4.71 runs per game, and they are going to go even higher than that here. The Twins won’t have an answer, and the Red Sox are going to get the job done. Back the Red Sox.
