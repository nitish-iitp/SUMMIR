The film is all about the exploits of Princess Anna, the younger sister of Elsa, Snow Queen of Arendelle.

And, did you know that Nora Ephron’s second marriage was to journalist Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame?

The other end of the strings are held by the soundboard, the side of the triangular frame that is hollow, allowing the body of the harp to resonate when strings are plucked. The long side of the triangular frame is the column or pillar, the purpose of which is to hold up the neck under the tension of the strings.

The Latin word “stamen” translates as “thread”, or more specifically “warp in an upright loom”. The term was used figuratively to describe the thread woven by the Fates, the length of which predetermined the duration of a person’s natural life. This idea evolved into the idea that a person had several vital capacities (“stamina”, plural of “stamen”) that contributed to the duration of a life. Over time, “stamina” came to be used in a singular sense, describing a person’s capacity to endure. Quite interesting …

53 Joan of __ : ARC

Joan of Arc (also “Jeanne d’Arc”, her birth name) led the French Army successfully into battle a number of times during the Hundred Years War with England. When she was eventually captured, Joan was tried in Rouen, the seat of the occupying English government in France at that time. There she was burned at the stake having been found guilty of heresy. In fact, after the fire died down, the executioner raked the coals to display the charred body, proving Joan had died, and then burned the corpse again, twice, so that relics could not be collected. The remaining ashes were then cast into the Seine River. Joan of Arc was canonized some 600 years later, in 1920, and is now one of the patron saints of France.

59 “Miracle on Ice” losing team: Abbr. : USSR

Team USA won the gold medal in men’s hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. The victory was a surprising one given the decades-long dominance of the USSR team. The “big result” for the American team was the epic victory against the Soviets, a victory often referred to as the “Miracle on Ice”. The US went on to defeat Finland in the final and secured the gold medal. The moniker “miracle” comes from words uttered by sportscaster Al Michaels, who was calling the game for ABC. He declared, in the final seconds, “Do you believe in miracles?! Yes!”

Also, tort lawsuits may be decided on a preponderance of evidence, without the need of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

1 Artist M.C. whose work inspired the art of the game Monument Valley : ESCHER

M. C. Escher was a graphic artist from the Netherlands. Escher was noted for creating works inspired by mathematics, often works that were physical impossibilities.

Monument Valley is a computer game that was released in 2014. It was very successful, and was named the best game for the iPad that first year.

117 Lake Mead creator : DAM

When the magnificent Hoover Dam was completed in 1936 it was the largest hydroelectric plant in the world, as well as being the world’s largest concrete structure. The edifice was originally known as Boulder Dam, due to its location near Boulder City, Nevada. The dam was eventually named after Herbert Hoover for his role in having the dam built when he was Secretary of Commerce, and his later support as US President. There was a formal dedication ceremony held in September 1935 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt was in the area, when only work on the powerhouse was incomplete. President Roosevelt managed to make his dedication speech without once referring to the name of his former opponent President Hoover. When the dam was finally put into service in 1936, the project was two years ahead of schedule. Those were the days …

The reservoir on the Colorado River known as Lake Mead, created by the Hoover Dam, used to be the largest reservoir in the US. Located outside Las Vegas, drought and increasing demand for water has shrunk Lake Mead so that now Lake Sakakawea on the Missouri in North Dakota has a larger surface area and volume of water.

Quick run for a Sunday. Glad I waited til the end of my fill with the SW corner.
EDDARD and ATTA and TOECAP held me up.

I’ve worn a few work boots in my time but I’ve never heard Steel toed boots referred to as TOE CAPS?

I agree with Anon Mike’s comments, word-for-word and letter-for-letter.

The toe of the boot has a steel cover over it, and that’s called the toe cap.

21 mins 14 seconds and 4 errors, brought on by dodgy clues. Couldn’t “see” ALLIES from “Support squad”, nor PEP/ELLA. Otherwise a breezy Sunday grid. Useless “theme,” as usual. I don’t know why they bother with the pun fills. It’s usually just embarrassingly bad.

24:17, no errors. Disagree with the “useless theme” comment; the theme was obvious from the beginning and made it easy in my opinion.
The clue about the work boots referred to a *feature* of them, not another term for them. Toe caps fits the bill.

21:42 – one letter error at HATBANk/EDDARk. The “stetson decor” could have been a bank of hats, and I didn’t know what Stark family was being referenced, so maybe it was Ed Dark?

A handful of new names and items.

First got the theme scheme with the two at 36A and 67A. Not a bad gimmick, and mixed it up in the Across and Down clues.

Duplicate cluing: “Title said with a curtsy, perhaps.”

Happy to once again get Sunday done in under 30 minutes.

No look ups, no errors. One change on the fly, Edward/Eddard. Got the theme right
away and it helped……
