MLB NRFI and YRFI Picks – September 10
by Daniel Vreeland

September 9, 2024

Some people like to sweat out a bet for 9 hard innings – others like immediate satisfaction. Count us as being in the latter, which is why we like to get down with MLB NRFI and YRFI picks. And we’ve decided to pass that knowledge on to you with our NRFI bets for September 10. Go here for MLB World Series odds.

Of course, there are plenty out there taking blind guesses at this stuff. It’s easy to pick the best-hitting team or look at what happened in the last game. However, we spent the time pouring through the analytics to make sure that we give you the best odds to stay in the green on these NRFI and YRFI props for September 10. Come check out what we have cooked up for this slate of games.

MLB NRFI and YRFI Picks – September 10
Atlanta Braves vs. Washington Nationals

First Pitch – 6:45 pm EST
Nationals Park –Washington, DC
Broadcast – MLB TV

The Braves have quickly become my favorite team to play on the NRFI. Their pitching has been so good, and their bats have been so cold. We’ll rely on the latter to get this one started right. They’ve scored just 13 runs in their last five games (2.6 per game) and are coming off of a game where they got shutout by the Reds. They will face MacKenzie Gore, on the heels of three straight quality starts. One of those was against these very Braves. In that game he went 6.0 strong and allowed just one run with four strikeouts. I like his chances to get a clean first again.

In the bottom of the inning, the Braves will send Reynaldo Lopez to the bump. I’d take him against just about any team right now. He enters the game with a 2.04 ERA on the season. Since returning from the injured list, he’s logged 23.0 innings and allowed just five earned runs. That’s a 1.96 ERA in that span, which is better than pre-injury. The Nationals are 28th in the league at scoring in the first, so Lopez should cruise.

NRFI/YRFI Bet for September 10: No (-120)

Oakland Athletics vs. Houston Astros

First Pitch – 8:10 pm EST
Minute Maid Park – Houston, Texas
Broadcast – MLB TV

The righty Spencer Arrighetti will toe the rubber to kick off this NRFI effort. He’s looked ugly last time out, but prior to that he was lights out. He had back-to-back scoreless starts against the the Orioles and the Phillies – grabbing 13.2 innings and 17 strikeouts in that span. Those two teams are far better than what they’ll be seeing on Tuesday. The Athletics are 26th in the majors in runs scored and should have a hard enough time early in this one.

The Astros are a far better hitting team, making the bottom of the inning a much bigger sweat. However, I like my chances to cash with Osvaldo Bido. In his last five appearances (24.1 innings), he’s allowed just seven earned runs. That comes in as a 2.59 ERA in that spand. Additionally, they have won the last four of his starts. Not that we need them to win this one, but that speaks to just how good he’s been – since he’s giving these bats a chance at a victory.

NRFI/YRFI Bet for September 10: No (-105)
