Texas Rangers 2023 Moves Tracker: Josh Sborz Activated /
In this story:
Texas Rangers

Sept. 27: The Texas Rangers made the following transactions before the series finale at the Los Angeles Angels:

RHP Josh Sborz activated from 15-day Injured List
LHP Jake Latz optioned to Round Rock (AAA)

Sborz had been on the 15-day IL since Sept. 5 with a right hamstring strain. He didn't go on a rehab assignment, instead throwing live batting practice to Rangers hitters over the past few weeks. He has a 5.80 ERA over 42 relief appearances this season.

Latz wasn't likely to pitch for the Rangers in the upcoming Seattle Mariners series after throwing 43 pitches in relief Tuesday at the Angels. He threw 4 1/3 scoreless innings over two relief appearances since being called up Sept. 16.

Sept. 26: Texas Rangers starting pitcher Jon Gray had imaging testing done on right wrist Tuesday, according to manager Bruce Bochy. The  club is waiting on the results. 

Gray left the series-opening 5-1 win Monday night at Los Angeles Angels before the seventh inning with wrist tightness. He was feeling discomfort in the sixth, but tried to work through it by warming up for the seventh. 

The tightness persisted and the Rangers decided to proceed with caution, ending Gray's night. Bochy and Gray both said after the game that they felt the setback wasn't serious.

Sept. 16: The Texas Rangers announced the following roster moves shortly before their game with the Cleveland Guardians on Saturday:

LHP Jake Latz selected from Round Rock (AAA)
RHP Ian Kennedy placed on the 60-day Injured List with a right rotator cuff strain

Sept 14: The Texas Rangers announced the following roster moves prior to Thursday night's series finale at the Toronto Blue Jays:

RHP Max Scherzer placed on 15-day Injured List with right teres major strain
RHP Jonathan Hernández recalled from Round Rock (AAA)

Sept. 9: The Texas Rangers made a couple of roster moves before Saturday's game against the Oakland Athletics at Globe Life Field.

INF Jonathan Ornelas recalled from Round Rock (AAA)
OF J.P. Martínez optioned to Round Rock (AAA)

Sept 8: Though there is no official timeline for the return of Adolis García, Bruce Bochy offered up a glimmer of optimism before the start of the Oakland Athletics series.

The Texas Rangers skipper said García could be in a designated hitter role “sooner than we think.” The All-Star right fielder, on the 10-day injured list with a right patellar strain suffered Wednesday, leads the club with 34 home runs and 100 RBI.

Sept. 7: The Texas Rangers announced on Thursday that pitcher Glenn Otto was picked up by the San Diego Padres on waivers, two days after being designated for assignment.

Otto had no record and a 10.13 ERA over 6 relief appearances spanning two stints with the Rangers this season: June 30-July 22 and August 28-September 4. He has spent the balance of the year, both on option and injury rehabilitation assignment, with Triple-A Round Rock, posting a 1-1 record with a 3.38 ERA (11 ER/29.1 IP) over 10 games/6 starts. The Rangers have seven days to release or outright Otto to the minor leagues.

Sept. 5:  The Texas Rangers announced the following roster moves prior to Tuesday night’s game against the Houston Astros at Globe Life Field:

Right-handed pitcher Nathan Eovaldi activated from 15-day Injured List
Right-handed pitcher Ian Kennedy (#21) contract selected from Triple-A Round Rock
Right-handed pitcher Josh Sborz placed on 15-day Injured List with a left hamstring strain
Right-handed pitcher Glenn Otto designated for assignment

Eovaldi is scheduled to start Tuesday night’s game against the Astros, his first outing since July 18 vs. Tampa Bay. He was on the 15-day Injured List from July 27-September 4 with a right forearm strain. Eovaldi has an 11-3 record with a 2.69 ERA over 19 games/starts for Texas this season, ranking among American League leaders in complete games (T2nd, 2) and wins (T7th, 11). He was voted by players to the American League roster for the 2023 All-Star Game on July 11 in Seattle, the second selection of his career.

Kennedy returns for a second stint with the Rangers this season, the 38-year-old went 0-1 with a 7.20 ERA (8 ER/10.0 IP) over 11 relief outings with Texas during his first stint from Opening Day-May 10. He made the Rangers’ Opening Day roster as a non-roster invitee for a second straight season. Kennedy was re-signed to a minor league contact with Texas on June 20, and he has compiled a 1-0 record with a 3.51 ERA (10 ER/25.2 IP) and 3 saves over 22 relief appearances for Triple-A Round Rock since late June. Over his last 10 outings at Triple-A beginning August 1, Kennedy has 19 strikeouts spanning 14.0 innings. He last pitched on Sunday at Oklahoma City (1.0 IP, 1 H, 1 BB, 2 SO, 26 pitches/17 strikes).

Sborz has a 5-7 record with a 5.80 ERA over 42 relief appearances with the Rangers this season. The first date he would be eligible to return is September 20.

Otto had no record and a 10.13 ERA over 6 relief appearances spanning two stints with the Rangers this season: June 30-July 22 and August 28-September 4. He has spent the balance of the year, both on option and injury rehabilitation assignment, with Triple-A Round Rock, posting a 1-1 record with a 3.38 ERA (11 ER/29.1 IP) over 10 games/6 starts. The Rangers have seven days to release or outright Otto to the minor leagues.

Following today’s transactions, the Rangers remain at the 40-man limit on the club’s Major League roster, along with three players (Jacob deGrom, Brett Martin, and Jake Odorizzi) on the 60-day Injured List.

Sept. 1: The Texas Rangers have sent utility man Brad Miller to Double-A Frisco to being an injury rehab assignment. 

Miller has been on the injured list since Aug. 2 with a left hamstring strain. Miller, who is batting .214 this season, last played on Aug. 1.

Also, former Rangers relief pitcher Joe Barlow was designated for assignment by the Kansas City Royals. 

Aug. 28: The Texas Rangers have recalled right-handed pitcher Glenn Otto from Triple-A Round Rock and optioned right-handed pitcher Jonathan Hernández to Round Rock.

Otto will be available for Monday's game at the New York Mets. 

Otto allowed 10 runs/earned runs over 4 relief appearances and 8.1 innings during his first stint from June 30-July 22. His last outing with Texas came on July 22 vs. Los Angeles Dodgers (2.0 IP, 5 R-ER). He has spent the balance of the year, both on option and injury rehabilitation assignment, with Triple-A Round Rock, posting a 1-1 record with a 3.38 ERA (11 ER/29.1 IP) over 10 games/6 starts with 12.0 strikeouts per 9 innings and a 1.057 WHIP figure.

Hernández took the walk-off loss in Sunday’s 7-6, 13-inning defeat at Minnesota. It was his only outing after being recalled from Round Rock on Saturday. He is 1-2 with a 6.45 ERA over 26 relief appearances spanning two stints with the Rangers this season: Opening Day-June 4 and August 26-27. With Round Rock this season, Hernández has a 1-1 record with 2 saves and a 1.35 ERA (4 ER/26.2 IP).

Aug. 26: The Texas Rangers announced prior to Saturday night’s game that they recalled right-handed pitcher Jonathan Hernández from Triple-A Round Rock and optioned optioned right-handed pitcher Grant Anderson to Round Rock.

Hernández will be in his second stint with the Rangers this season, as he was 1-1 with a 6.65 ERA over 25 relief appearances for the club during his first stint from Opening Day-June 4. Since being optioned to Round Rock on June 5, he has a 1-1 record with 2 saves and a 1.35 ERA (4 ER/26.2 IP), posting 18 walks with 28 strikeouts.

Anderson has a 2-1 record and a 5.05 ERA (20 ER/35.2 IP) over 26 relief appearances spanning two stints with Texas this season in his first Major League action: May 29-July 21 and July 30-August 25.

Aug. 23: Another bullpen session is set for Nathan Eovaldi on Thursday in Minneapolis, according to MLB.com. The Texas Rangers open a four-game series at the Minnesota Twins that night.

The injured starter has continued to make progress from the right forearm strain that landed Eovaldi on the injured list earlier this month. He threw to live hitters in a batting practice session on Monday in Phoenix, going the equivalent of two innings.

Eovaldi reported no issues from the BP session, which included facing Brad Miller and Austin Hedges. Eovaldi estimated he would have given up one hit during his simulated two innings of work, per MLB.com.

The Rangers have yet to commit to a rehab start or an immediate return to the rotation once Eovaldi is ready to pitch.

Aug. 16: The Texas Rangers have released catcher Kevin Plawecki from Triple-A Round Rock, per MiLB.com. 

The Rangers signed Plawecki — who played for them in 2022 — to a minor-league deal after the injury to Jonah Heim. He returned on Sunday, and the Rangers now have three catchers on the MLB roster, along with Mitch Garver and Austin Hedges. 

Plawecki batted .294/.400/.325 in 40 at-bats with the Express.

Aug. 15: The Texas Rangers have signed veteran infielder Josh Harrison, a former All-Star, to a minor-league deal.

Harrison's agency, MSM Sports, announced the deal. He is expected to join Triple-A Round Rock.

Most recently with the Philadelphia Phillies, he was released on Aug. 2. 

The Rangers have not announced the contract and don't typically announce minor-league deals. His signing was not on the MiLB.com transactions tracker.

Harrison, 36, has played more than 1,000 career MLB games and was an All-Star in 2014 and 2017 with Pittsburgh.

Aug. 14: The Texas Rangers reinstated outfielder Travis Jankowski from the MLB Paternity Leave List and optioned infielder Jonathan Ornelas to Triple-A Round Rock in advance of Monday's game against the Los Angeles Angels at Globe Life Field.

Jankowski, 32, has batted .292/.388/.375/.763 (56-192) with 11 doubles, one triple, one home run, and 25 RBI across 75 games with Texas this season. He leads all Rangers with 16 stolen bases and ranks second in the American League (3rd in MLB) with a 94.1% stolen base success rate (16-for-17). Prior to being placed on the MLB Paternity Leave List on Friday, Jankowski was batting .284/.366/.364/.730 (25-88) in his last 31 games, including a career high-tying 9-game hitting streak from July 3-19 (also July 31-August 10, 2016 with San Diego).

Ornelas, 23, played in two of the team’s last five games after being selected from Triple-A Round Rock on August 7. He made his Major League debut last Monday at Oakland, entering the game as a pinch-runner for Mitch Garver in the seventh inning and scoring the go-ahead run for Texas in a 5-3 win. He also appeared as a defensive replacement at third base on Wednesday at Oakland, but did not register a plate appearance. Ornelas has slashed .250/.360/.348/.708 (84-336) with five home runs and 39 RBI in 88 games with Round Rock this season.

Aug. 13: The Texas Rangers activated Jonah Heim to start Sunday’s finale at the San Francisco Giants. The All-Star catcher had been on the 10-day injured list with a wrist injury.

The surprise move comes earlier than expected, though Heim had been making considerable progress in recent days taking batting practice. He returns to the lineup without a rehab assignment.

The expectation was that Heim would possibly return on the upcoming Texas homestand that starts Monday against the Los Angeles Angels.

Heim has been one of the best catchers in baseball this season. Before the injury he slashed .280/.337/.479/.816 with 14 home runs and 70 RBI. The average and RBI are single-season highs and helped Heim earn a spot in the All-Star Game starting lineup for the American League.

In a corresponding transaction, the Rangers optioned backup catcher Sam Huff optioned to Triple-A Round Rock.

Aug. 6: The Texas Rangers will call up Top 30 infield prospect Jonathan Ornelas from Triple-A on Monday, per a report from Fansided.com.

The Rangers have not made an official announcement. But, with third baseman Josh Jung suffering a fractured left wrist on Sunday, a move to the injured list seems likely on Monday, which would open up a spot on the 26-man roster. 

Ornelas was not in Round Rock's lineup on Sunday. Ornelas is already on the Rangers' 40-man roster. 

Ornelas, who is the Rangers' No. 14 prospect per MLB.com, is batting .250 with five home runs and 39 RBI. Ornelas has played second base, shortstop, third base and center field for the Express this season.

Aug. 6: Rangers manager Bruce Bochy gave star shortstop Corey Seager the series finale against Miami Marlins off Sunday to rest his right thumb. Texas, on a five-game winning streak, is going for a sweep of the six-game homestand.

“It wasn’t so much a scheduled day off,” Bochy said. “Could he play? Yeah. But we’re going to try and keep this thing (thumb injury) under control. It’s a pretty big injury and it’s really amazing what he’s done with it. I just don’t want it to get to the point where we lose him for a while.”

Josh Smith was scheduled to start at shortstop and bat eighth.

Seager played a key role in the Rangers’ 9-8 comeback win Saturday. He connected for a game-tying two-run home run in the fifth inning to knot the score at 5-5.

It was his third homer in four games since being activated from the 10-day injured list with a thumb sprain. Seager has four long balls in five games and five in seven going back to July 18.

Saturday was his 70th game of the season, with 47 extra-base hits in that span. That’s the second-most in franchise history (Washington/Texas) in 70 games with Iván Rodríguez holding the mark with 48 in 2000).

Seager has hits in 20 of his last 23 games, slashing.356/.410/.722/1.132 (32-90) with eight homers, nine doubles and 18 RBI over that span.

Aug. 4: The Texas Rangers announced on Friday that Hall-of-Fame broadcaster Eric Nadel would be back in the booth for the game with Miami. 

Nadel has missed the entire season since announcing in March that he was struggling with mental health issues. Matt Hicks and Jared Sandler have handled Rangers radio broadcasts in his absence.

Nadel has been at Globe Life Field doing warm-up games this week in preparation. 

Aug. 2: Texas Rangers transactions:

C Austin Hedges (#11) reported to club and added to active roster
OF Bubba Thompson optioned to Round Rock (AAA)

Aug. 1: Prior to 5 p.m. CT trading deadline, the Rangers announced a pair of trades and several roster moves affecting the club's active roster:

C Austin Hedges acquired from Pittsburgh in exchange for international bonus pool money.
RHP Spencer Howard traded to New York Yankees in exchange for cash considerations.
RHP Max Scherzer (#31), LHP Jordan Montgomery (#52) and RHP Chris Stratton (#35) added to active roster.
LHP Cody Bradford and RHP Yerry Rodríguez optioned to Round Rock (AAA).

July 26: The Texas Rangers announced on Wednesday that relief pitcher Josh Sborz would start an injury rehab assignment with Triple-A Round Rock as he nears activation from the injured list. 

The Rangers put Sborz on the IL on July 15 with right biceps tendinitis. Before he was moved to the injured list, he was one of the Rangers' more effective relievers and serving as a set-up man for closer Will Smith.

Sborz is eligible to be activated on Thursday.

July 24: The Texas Rangers announced that the club has traded left-handed pitcher Taylor Hearn to the Atlanta Braves in exchange for cash considerations.

Hearn, 28, had been designated for assignment by Texas on July 19. He began the season with the Rangers and posted a 10.29 ERA (8 ER/7.0 IP) over 4 relief outings before being optioned to Triple-A Round Rock on April 13. In 24 games/2 starts with the Express, Hearn registered a 2-2 record with a 3.66 ERA (16 ER/39.1 IP).

The Royse City, Texas native posted a 12-15 record with a 5.11 ERA (130 ERA/229.0 IP) with the Rangers over five major league seasons after being acquired from Pittsburgh in the 2018 trade deadline in exchange for right-handed pitcher Keone Kela.

July 23: The Texas Rangers made the following transactions on Sunday: 

-RHP Owen White recalled from Round Rock (AAA) 

-RHP Glenn Otto optioned to Round Rock (AAA)

White is the Rangers' top-ranked pitching prospect and made his MLB debut last month in a relief role. Otto pitched against the Dodgers on Saturday and based on bullpen usage, the Rangers needed a fresher arm. White was scratched from his expected Saturday start at Round Rock to make the move.

July 22: On Saturday the Texas Rangers announced the following moves:

- Right-handed pitcher Yerry Rodríguez recalled from Triple-A Round Rock.

- Right-handed pitcher Grant Anderson optioned to Triple-A Round Rock.

Anderson was optioned due to workload, Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said. He worked 1 2/3 innings and threw 51 pitches in Friday's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. 

July 19: The Texas Rangers announced the following moves:

RHP Alex Speas contract selected from Round Rock (AAA)
LHP John King optioned to Round Rock (AAA)
LHP Taylor Hearn designated for assignment

Speas could make his MLB debut on Wednesday against Tampa Bay. He is 4-0 this season with a 1.00 ERA in 36 innings with 59 strikeouts. 

King has been up-and-down with the Rangers this season as a long-relief option. He is 1-1 with a 5.79 ERA this season. 

Hearn started the season with the Rangers, but spent most of the year with Round Rock. He has a 12-15 career record with the Rangers as a starter and reliever. By designating him for assignment, the Rangers have seven days to trade or release him. Hearn can accept the assignment or elect for free agency.

July 15: Right-handed pitcher Josh Sborz was moved to the 15-day Injured List, retroactive to July 12, with right biceps tendinitis. Left-handed pitcher John King was recalled from Triple-A Round Rock.

Sborz has gone 4-4 with a 4.54 ERA over 29 relief appearances for the Rangers this season. He last pitched on Sunday at Washington in the Rangers’ final game before the All-Star break. The first date that Sborz would be eligible to return is July 27.

King will be available for Saturday's game against the Cleveland Guardians. He has gone 1-1 with a 5.79 ERA (12 ER/18.2 IP) over 15 relief appearances spanning two prior stints with the Rangers this season: May 11-June 29 and July 3-6. 

July 12: Matt Bush is headed back to the Texas Rangers less than a year after being traded to the Milwaukee Brewers. Bush, 37,  signed a minor league deal with the Rangers, per MLB.com. 

The right-handed reliever has been assigned to Double-A Frisco. Bush was dealt to Milwaukee last July for utility man Mark Mathias and pitcher Antoine Kelly.

Bush struggled with the Brewers down the stretch last season and again this year. In 12 appearances this season, he allowed 11 runs in just 10 1/3 innings, along with five home runs. 

The Rangers are in need of bullpen help, so bringing back Bush makes sense. He worked in high-leverage situations for Texas from 2016-22, managing a 3.34 ERA in 177 2/3 innings with 46 holds and 12 saves.

July 7: The Texas Rangers today that the club has activated LHP Andrew Heaney from Major League Baseball’s Paternity Leave List and optioned LHP John King to Round Rock (AAA).

Heaney, 32, was placed on MLB’s Paternity Leave List on Tuesday. He is scheduled to serve as Texas’ starting pitcher Saturday afternoon at Washington. The left-hander will be working on five days’ rest after tossing 5.0 scoreless innings in his most recent outing on Sunday vs. Houston (ND, 5.0 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 1 BB, 8 SO, 85 pitches/62 strikes). Heaney has gone 5-5 with a 4.12 ERA (38 ER/83.0 IP) in 16 games/starts for the Rangers this season.

King, 28, has gone 1-1 with a 5.79 ERA (12 ER/18.2 IP) over 15 relief appearances spanning two stints with the Rangers this season (May 11-June 29, July 3-6). He has spent the balance of the campaign with Round Rock, posting a 2-1 record, one save, a 2.08 ERA (4 ER/17.1 IP), and 11 strikeouts/5 walks over 9 games/2 starts.

Following today’s transactions, the Rangers remain at the 40-man limit on the club’s Major League roster, along with three players (Jacob deGrom, Brett Martin, and Jake Odorizzi) on the 60-day Injured List.

July 6: The Texas Rangers announced that the club has activated right-handed pitcher José Leclerc from the 15-day Injured List and optioned right-handed pitcher Joe Barlow to Round Rock (AAA).

Leclerc, 29, is 0-1 with one save and a 3.42 ERA (9 ER/23.2 IP) over 24 relief appearances for Texas this season. He was placed on the 15-day Injured List (retroactive to June 21) with a right ankle sprain after sustaining the injury during pregame batting practice on June 23 at Yankee Stadium.

Leclerc began the season without allowing an earned run over his first 9 games (8.2 IP) but pitched to a 5.40 ERA (9 ER/15.0 IP) over his last 15 games before being placed on the Injured List. During a recent rehabilitation assignment with Frisco (AA), Leclerc allowed 1 ER in 2.0 IP over 2 relief appearances, along with a .143 (1-for-7) opponent batting average.

Barlow, 27, owns a 1-1 record with a 4.66 ERA (5 ER/9.2 IP) in 13 relief appearances over 2 stints with Texas this season. The right-hander allowed 3 ER in 6.1 IP over 8 games since being activated from the 15-day Injured List on June 14.

Following today’s transactions, the Rangers remain at the 40-man limit on the club’s Major League roster, along with three players (Jacob deGrom, Brett Martin, and Jake Odorizzi) on the 60-day Injured List.

July 4: The Texas Rangers announced that the club has placed LHP Andrew Heaney on MLB’s paternity leave list and recalled LHP John King from Triple-A Round Rock.

Heaney, 32, may remain on paternity leave for a maximum of 72 hours. He has gone 5-5 with a 4.12 ERA (38 ER/83.0 IP) in 16 games/starts this season. The left-hander logged 5.0 scoreless innings in his most recent start on Sunday vs. Houston (ND, 5.0 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 1 BB, 8 SO, 85 pitches/62 strikes).

King, 28, went 1-1 with a 6.61 ERA (12 ER/16.1 IP) across 13 relief appearances in his first stint with Texas this season (May 11-June 29). He has spent the balance of the campaign with Round Rock, posting a 2-1 record, one save, a 2.08 ERA (4 ER/17.1 IP), and 11 strikeouts/5 walks over 9 games/2 starts. The Missouri City, Tex. native has not pitched since being optioned to Triple-A on June 30, as his last game action came in a relief outing for the Rangers on Thursday vs. Detroit (2.0 IP, 3 H, 4 R-ER, 1 BB, 1 SO, 1 HR, 37 pitches/27 strikes).

Following today’s transactions, the Rangers remain at the 40-man limit on the club’s Major League roster, along with three players (Jacob deGrom, Brett Martin, and Jake Odorizzi) on the 60-day Injured List.

July 2: The Texas Rangers announced on Sunday that they were sending relief pitcher Jose Leclerc to Double-A Frisco to being a rehab assignment. 

Leclerc was put on the 15-day injured list on June 24 (retroactive to June 21) for a right ankle sprain. He is eligible to be activated on Thursday. 

June 30: The Texas Rangers pitching staff is getting more depth, as Glenn Otto and Cole Ragans are being called up from Triple-A Round Rock, according to manager Bruce Bochy.

Otto has been making steady progress getting stretched out with the Express. He was on the 60-day injured list after suffering a right shoulder strain during Spring Training.

Otto was considered a bullpen candidate before the injury, but has been working as a starter with Round Rock. He was a member of the starting rotation last season, going 7-10 with a 4.64 ERA.

Ragans, who started the season in the bullpen, was sent down about two weeks ago to get stretched out to be a potential starter later this season.

Ragans is 2-3 with a 5.92 ERA in 17 appearances this season.

John King and Yerry Rodriguez are being sent to Triple-A. King gave up four earned runs in two innings in Thursday's 8-5 loss to the Detroit Tigers.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Ragans was traded to the Kansas City Royals in a deal that netted the Rangers reliever Aroldis Chapman.

 

June 24: The Texas Rangers announced that relief pitcher José Leclerc would be moved to the 15-day injured list for a right ankle sprain.

The move is retroactive to Wednesday. Leclerc is 1-2 with a 3.48 ERA. After a bumpy start to the season, he has one hold, a 2.79 ERA, five walks and 10 strikeouts in his last nine outings.

June 22: Two veteran players opted to leave the organization to pursue free-agent opportunities, per the Dallas Morning News.

Outfielder Yoshi Tsutsugo and catcher Sandy Leon were at Triple-A Round Rock before making their decisions in the past two days. 

León was designated for assignment on June 14, cleared waivers on Sunday and accepted an assignment to Round Rock. León was signed to a minor-league contract in Spring Training and was called up in April to back up Jonah Heim after an injury to Mitch Garver. 

Tsutsugo was also signed to a minor-league deal and was late to Spring Training due to visa issues. He's been at Round Rock since the start of the regular season.

June 21: Ian Kennedy should report to Triple-A Round Rock on Wednesday after signing a minor-league deal with the Texas Rangers, per The Dallas Morning News.

The Rangers designated Kennedy for assignment last month after he went 0-1 with a 7.20 ERA in 11 games with the Rangers. 

The right-hander is a 17-year veteran that could remain a bullpen option for the Rangers later this season.

June 20: The Texas Rangers announced on Tuesday that infielder Brad Miller would move his injury rehab assignment from Triple-A Round Rock to Double-A Frisco. 

Miller spent the past week with the Express and batted .211 with one home run and two RBI.

Miller is eligible to be activated. The Rangers have not hinted when Miller would return to the team. The Rangers are in Chicago to face the White Sox through Wednesday, and then move on to New York to face the Yankees Thursday-Sunday.

June 18: The Texas Rangers announced that Sandy León cleared waivers and was assigned to Triple-A Round Rock, meaning the catcher remains an option to be called up later this season. 

The Rangers designated León for assignment on June 14 and recalled catcher Sam Huff from Round Rock. The Rangers had the option to trade or release León, and he also had to clear the waiver process, before he could be added to the minor league roster. 

June 14: The Texas Rangers announced the following roster moves prior to Wednesday’s game against the Los Angeles Angels:

Right-handed pitcher Joe Barlow activated from 15-day Injured List (Illness).
Catcher Sam Huff recalled from Round Rock (AAA).
Right-handed pitcher Owen White optioned to Frisco (AA).
Catcher Sandy León designated for assignment.

Barlow, 27, will be seeking his first action with the Rangers since May 28 at Baltimore (0.2 SHO IP, 1 H), as he missed the team’s last 11 games after being placed on the 15-day Injured List on May 30, retroactive to May 29, with an illness. The right-hander was scoreless over 3 relief appearances (3.1 IP) while on rehab assignment with Round Rock (AAA) last week, most recently pitching in the Express’ 8-6 defeat on Sunday at Salt Lake (H, 1.1 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 2 SO, 27 pitches/18 strikes). Barlow has posted no record and a 5.40 ERA (2 ER/3.1 IP) in 5 relief outings with Texas this season, the third straight campaign in which he has seen big league action with the club (2021-23). An 11th round selection by the Rangers in the 2016 MLB Draft, Barlow is 3-3 with 24 saves and a 2.94 ERA (22 ER/67.1 IP) in 71 career MLB relief outings.

Huff, 25, has spent the majority of the season at Round Rock, batting .273/.363/.473/.836 (45-165) with 9 home runs and 37 RBI over 41 games/starts at catcher (36) and designated hitter (5). This will be his second stint with Texas this season, as he previously went 2-for-10 with one RBI in 5 games/3 starts (all at DH) from May 9-16. Huff has batted .296 (21-71) with 4 home runs, 4 doubles, 17 RBI, and 12 walks/21 strikeouts over his last 18 games with the Express dating back to May 19. He went 2-for-4 with a home run and 2 RBI in his last appearance on Tuesday vs. El Paso. The Phoenix, Ariz. native has seen Major League action with the Rangers in three of the last four seasons (excl. 2021), compiling a .259 (42-162) batting average, 7 home runs, and 15 RBI across 59 contests.

White, 23, took the loss in a 2.0-inning relief appearance for Texas last night, making his Major League debut (L, 2.0 IP, 4 H, 3 R-ER, 1 BB, 2 SO, 1 HR, 36 pitches/24 strikes).

León, 34, batted .146 (6-41) with 2 doubles and 4 RBI in 21 games for the Rangers this season. He appeared in 22 games/11 starts at catcher, compiling a 4.54 catcher ERA and a .992 fielding percentage (one error/119 total chances).

Following today’s transactions, the Rangers have 39 players on the club’s Major League roster, along with four players (Jacob deGrom, Brett Martin, Jake Odorizzi, and Glenn Otto) on the 60-day Injured List.

June 13: The Texas Rangers announced the following roster moves prior to Tuesday’s game against the Los Angeles Angels:

Left-handed pitcher Cody Bradford (#61) recalled from Round Rock (AAA).
Right-handed pitcher Owen White (#43) recalled from Frisco (AA).
Left-handed pitcher Cole Ragans optioned to Round Rock (AAA).
Right-handed pitcher Yerry Rodríguez optioned to Round Rock (AAA).

Bradford, 25, is scheduled to start tonight’s game against the Angels. It will be his third stint with the Rangers this season, as he was also with the club both May 15 and May 27-28, going 0-1 with a 7.20 ERA (8 ER/10.0 IP) in 2 games/starts for Texas in his first MLB action. He has spent the balance of the season at Round Rock, going 8-1 with a 1.82 ERA (12 ER/59.1 IP) over 10 games/starts at Triple-A, leading the Pacific Coast League in ERA, WHIP (0.927), and wins (tied). He last pitched on Friday at Salt Lake, earning the win in a 9-3 Express victory (8.0 IP, 6 H, 3 R-ER, 0 BB, 5 SO, 1 HR, 99 pitches/75 strikes).

White, 23, will be available in the bullpen tonight, seeking his Major League debut. He has compiled a 2-3 record with a 3.54 ERA (21 ER/53.1 IP) in 11 games/starts for Frisco this season. He entered 2023 rated among the top-100 prospects in the sport by both Baseball America (no. 59) and MLB Pipeline (no. 66), and was recently named Texas League Pitcher of the Week for June 5-11 after tossing 7.0 shutout frames in his last start on Wednesday at Corpus Christi (W, 7.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 2 BB, 6 SO, 84 pitches/51 strikes).

Research indicates that White will be the first Rangers pitching prospect ranked on Baseball America's preseason top-100 list to make his MLB debut with Texas since RHP Chi Chi Gonzalez - who entered 2015 at no. 89 on the BA top-100 - on May 30, 2015 vs. Boston. The last Rangers pitching prospect rated as high as White on the BA preseason top-100 to debut with Texas was LHP Martín Pérez (no. 31 in 2012) on June 27, 2012 vs. Detroit. The right-handed White was originally selected by the Rangers in the 2nd round of the 2018 MLB Draft out of Carson High School in China Grove, N.C., and has gone 15-6 with a 3.46 ERA (65 ER/169.0 IP) and 10.9 strikeouts per 9.0 innings figure over 35 games/33 starts spanning three seasons in the minors.

Ragans has posted a 2-3 record with a 5.92 ERA over 17 relief appearances since making the club’s Opening Day roster. He took the loss in last night’s 12-inning defeat to the Angels.

Rodríguez has a 3.38 ERA over 6 relief appearances spanning two stints with the Rangers this season: April 29-May 15 and June 10-12. He has spent the balance of the campaign at Round Rock, going 1-0 with 2 saves and a 4.91 ERA in 15 relief outings.

Following today’s transactions, the Rangers remain at the 40-man limit on the club’s Major League roster, along with four players (Jacob deGrom, Brett Martin, Jake Odorizzi, and Glenn Otto) on the 60-day Injured List.

June 13: The Texas Rangers announced that Cody Bradford will make his third MLB start on Tuesday night against the Los Angeles Angels. 

Bradford is 0-1 with a 7.20 ERA in two start since making his debut on May 15 against Atlanta. 

With Triple-A Round Rock he has been one of the best pitchers in the entire system, with an 8-1 record and a 1.83 ERA. He was April's Pacific Coast League Player of the Month. 

The Rangers needed a starting pitcher for Tuesday after announced on Monday that Jon Gray would be pushed back in the rotation. The Rangers are also reportedly going to call up top pitching prospect Owen White from Double-A. 

The Rangers reportedly called up top pitching prospect Owen White.

June 12: Texas Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said Monday that Jon Gray's scheduled start for Tuesday would be pushed back due to a blister issue. 

Gray (6-2, 2.32) was set to start against the Los Angeles Angels right-hander Jaime Barria (2-2, 1.85). 

Gray was sidelined at the start of last season due to a blister issue, but it wasn't a recurring issue. The Rangers are being cautious with Gray and also mindful of the rotation's overall workload ahead. The Rangers are in the midst of a 13-day stretch without an off-day. 

Bochy isn't certain if they're simply going to push Gray back a day or if they'll skip his start entirely. Gray's next scheduled start is Saturday against the Toronto Blue Jays.

Bochy won't announce the team's plans for Tuesday until after Monday's game. He wants to see how the bullpen is used before making a decision. 

The Rangers don't have many options. They can't move Andrew Heaney up a day. He pitched on Friday at the Tampa Bay Rays and is slated to pitch on Wednesday. 

The Rangers could go to a bullpen game or call up a starter from the minors, such as Cody Bradford, who has already filled in twice this season. Bradford is currently in Arlington with the club.

June 10: After giving up four runs and four hits in 1/3 inning of work in his 2023 season debut on Friday, the Texas Rangers have optioned Howard back to Triple-A, the team announced. 

The Rangers called up reliever Yerry Rodriguez to take Howard's spot on the 26-man roster. 

Howard missed the first two months with a right lat strain and was recalled after a rehab assignment at the start of the St. Louis series. 

June 5: Right-handed pitcher Spencer Howard is expected to be activated for Monday night’s series opener against the St. Louis Cardinals at Globe Life Field.

To make room on the 40-man roster, Jacob deGrom was moved to the 60-day injured list. 

Howard pitched last week on a rehab assignment with Triple-A Round Rock for the first time since early March after suffering a right lat strain. The Rangers placed him on the 15-day injured list on March 30 and transferred him to the 60-day injured list on April 10.

Monday was the first day Howard was eligible to return.

Howard made the Opening Day roster last season, but battled injuries throughout the year.

He made eight starts and pitched in 10 games total, going 2-4 with a 7.41 ERA. He threw 37 2/3 innings, giving up 50 hits, 33 runs (31 earned) and 12 home runs. He walked 15 and struck out 32. Batters hit .309 against him and he had a 1.73 WHIP.

The Rangers optioned Jonathan Hernández to Round Rock.

June 4: Ezequiel Duran and Leody Taveras were both given Sunday’s series finale against the Seattle Mariners off.

Duran returned from the injured list for Saturday’s 16-6 rout of the Mariners and started in left field. With the game in hand, he left in the late innings as precautionary move. Duran was placed on the 10-day injured list on May 27 with mild right oblique discomfort.

Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said Duran was feeling a "little tight” after the game. The original plan was for Duran to return Monday, but an injury to Brad Miller accelerated that timetable.

Duran is available to pinch hit against Seattle.

Taveras was off after going 2-for-5 with a three-run home run Saturday. He did appear to bang his knee sliding into second base late in the game and was sore Sunday. Travis Jankowski is slated to start in center field.

June 3: Texas Rangers manager Bruce Bochy announced Saturday Ezequiel Duran was being activated and starting him in left field for that day's game with the Seattle Mariners.

To make room, the Rangers moved utility player Brad Miller to the injured list for an oblique injury he suffered during batting practice on Friday. 

Duran was placed on the 10-day injured list on May 27 with mild right oblique discomfort. He was eligible to come off the IL on Saturday, but the Rangers were originally going to wait until Monday to activate him. Miller's injury accelerated that timetable, Bochy said. 

Duran is batting .301 with seven home runs and 23 RBI. Miller is batting .208 with one home run and six RBI. 

June 1: The Texas Rangers have acquired LHP Luis Valdez from the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for RHP Ricky Vanasco. Valdez, 19, has gone 0-2, 3.12 ERA (6 ER/17.1 IP) over 8 games/starts with Low-A Rancho Cucamonga this season, striking out 24 of 83 (28.9%) batters faced.

The left-hander owns a lifetime 3-3 record, 2.70 ERA (20 ER/66.2 IP), and 11.3 strikeouts per 9.0 innings figure across 24 games/21 starts in the minor leagues. Valdez, a native of Mexico, originally signed with the Dodgers as a non-drafted free agent on Nov. 4, 2019.

Vanasco has spent his entire 5-year professional career with the Rangers organization, going 9-10 with a 3.84 ERA (76 ER/178.0 IP) over 53 games/39 starts in the minor leagues. He was originally selected by Texas in the 15th round of the 2017 MLB Draft out of Williston (Fla.) HS.

May 29: The Rangers made the following roster moves:

RHP Dane Dunning reinstated from MLB Paternity Leave List
RHP Joe Barlow placed on 15-day Injured List (retro to 5/29) with an illness
RHP Spencer Howard sent to Round Rock (AAA) on injury rehabilitation assignment

Texas faces the Detroit Tigers in the second game of the series at 5:40 p.m.

May 29: The Texas Rangers made three moves on Monday morning leading into their three-game series with the Detroit Tigers. 

The Rangers selected the contract of RHP Grant Anderson from Round Rock (AAA). Anderson has served as a reliever with the Express all season. 
The Rangers optioned LHP Cody Bradford optioned to Round Rock (AAA).
Because Anderson was not on the 40-man roster, the Rangers needed to make a move and designated RHP Ricky Vanasco for assignment.

Anderson, 25, will be seeking his Major League debut after having his contract selected from Round Rock (AAA) this morning. The right-hander, who will wear uniform number 65, has combined to go 2-0 with one save and a 3.54 ERA (11 ER/28.0 IP) over 15 appearances/one start between Round Rock and Frisco (AA) this season.

Bradford, 25, has gone 0-1 with a 7.20 ERA (8 ER/10.0 IP) in 2 starts spanning a pair of stints with Texas this season (May 15, May 27-28), including a 5.0-inning outing in yesterday’s 3-2 defeat at Baltimore (ND, 5.0 IP, 5 H, 2 R-ER, 1 BB, 5 SO). He is 6-1 with a 0.99 ERA (5 ER/45.1 IP) and 42 strikeouts/14 walks over 8 starts with Round Rock in 2023.

Vanasco, 24, owns no record and a 23.14 ERA (6 ER/2.1 IP) in 2 appearances/starts at Frisco this season. He opened the campaign on the RoughRiders’ Injured List while recovering from surgery on a torn meniscus, but was activated on May 20. The Rangers have seven days to trade, release, or outright Vanasco to the minor leagues.

Following Monday’s transactions, the Rangers remain at the 40-man limit on the Major League roster, along with four players (Spencer Howard, Brett Martin, Jake Odorizzi, and Glenn Otto) on the 60-day Injured List.

May 27: The Texas Rangers today announced the following roster moves prior to Saturday’s game in Baltimore:

Right-handed pitcher Dane Dunning placed on Major League Baseball’s Paternity Leave List.
Infielder/outfielder Ezequiel Duran placed on 10-day Injured List, retroactive to Wednesday, with mild right oblique discomfort.
Outfielder Travis Jankowski activated from 10-day Injured List.
Left-handed pitcher Cody Bradford recalled from Round Rock (AAA).

Dunning, who had originally been scheduled to start Sunday’s series finale in Baltimore, may remain on MLB’s Paternity Leave List for a maximum of 72 hours. He has a 4-0 record with a 1.67 ERA (8 ER/43.0 IP) and 26 strikeouts over 12 games/4 starts for Texas in 2023, including 2-0 with a 1.59 ERA spanning 4 starts since he was moved to the rotation in early May. Dunning and Minnesota’s Sonny Gray (54.1 IP) are the only pitchers in Major League Baseball this season who have logged 40-or-more innings pitched without allowing a home run.

Duran’s only game on the road trip came in a start as the designated hitter on Tuesday at Pittsburgh. He has batted .301 with 7 home runs and 23 RBI over 40 games for Texas this season, starting games at shortstop (team-high 24), designated hitter (5), left field (4), and third base (1). The first date Duran would be eligible to return is June 3.

Jankowski was on the Injured List from May 8-26 with a right hamstring strain, as he will be seeking his first action with Texas since May 7 at Los Angeles-AL. He batted .300 (3-10) with a double, 2 RBI, and 2 walks over 3 games on injury rehabilitation assignment with Round Rock (AAA) this week. Over 25 games with Texas this season, the veteran has batting .309 (21-68) with 5 doubles, a triple, 9 RBI, and 5 steals.

This will be the second career Major League stint for Bradford, who had been scheduled to start for the Express tonight in Albuquerque. He was originally on the roster for a single day earlier this month, as he made his MLB debut in a start on May 15 vs. Atlanta (L, 5.0 IP, 7 H, 6 R-ER). Bradford has spent the balance of the season with Round Rock, posting a 6-1 record with a 0.99 ERA (5 ER/45.1 IP) and 14 walks/42 strikeouts over 8 games/starts. He has the best ERA, opponent batting average (.176), and WHIP (0.93) among Pacific Coast League qualifiers, ranking among circuit leaders in wins (T1st, 6), innings (5th, 45.1), and strikeouts (7th, 42).

Following today’s transactions, the Rangers remain at the 40-man limit on the Major League roster, along with four players (Spencer Howard, Brett Martin, Jake Odorizzi and Glenn Otto) on the 60-day Injured List.

May 26: Ezequiel Duran was out of the starting lineup for a second straight game as the Texas Rangers opened a three-game series at the Baltimore Orioles on Friday. 

Duran missed Wednesday's finale at the Pittsburgh Pirates with what Rangers manager Bruce Bochy called "back tightness."

Duran suffered the injury during his final at-bat Tuesday against Pittsburgh. He is still considered day-to-day. The Rangers appear to be erring on the side of caution, even though the Rangers had an off-day on Thursday between series.

The Rangers will likely decide how to address Duran's injury on Saturday or Sunday, according to reports from Baltimore. 

May 24: Ezequiel Duran was held out of the lineup for Wednesday's game with Pittsburgh with what Rangers manager Bruce Bochy called "back tightness."

The Rangers pinch-hit for Duran during Tuesday's game. Bochy said the tightness was in Duran's back near his rib cage. The injury happened during Duran's final at-bat on Tuesday. 

The Rangers consider Duran to be day-to-day. The team has an off-day on Thursday before starting a series with Baltimore on Friday. 

May 17: The Texas Rangers announced the following roster moves ahead of Wednesday’s game against the Atlanta Braves at Globe Life Field:

Shortstop Corey Seager activated from 10-day Injured List
Catcher Sam Huff optioned to Triple-A Round Rock

Seager has batted .359/.469/.538/1.008 (14-39) with one home run, 4 doubles, and 4 RBI over 11 games with Texas this season. He was on the 10-day Injured List from April 12-May 16 with a left hamstring strain, an injury suffered while running out a fifth-inning double in his last game with Texas on April 11 vs. Kansas City. Seager played 3 games with Double-A Frisco on injury rehabilitation assignment from Thursday through Saturday, batting .250 (2-8) with a double, walk, and 2 RBI. He played 2 games at shortstop and one as designated hitter. This was the first Injured List stint in Seager’s two seasons with the Rangers.

Huff has gone 2-for-7 with one RBI over 4 games since he was recalled from Round Rock last Tuesday for his first stint with Texas this season. He has spent the rest of the year at Triple-A, batting .267 with 5 home runs and 20 RBI over 22 games with the Express.

Following today’s transactions, the Rangers remain at the 40-man limit on the Major League roster, along with four players (Spencer Howard, Brett Martin, Jake Odorizzi, and Glenn Otto) on the 60-day Injured List.

May 16: The Texas Rangers announced on Tuesday that they were recalling reliever Joe Barlow from Triple-A Round Rock and sending pitcher Cody Bradford back to the Express. 

Barlow has been at Round Rock since the start of this season. He was 2-0 with a 2.63 ERA with the Express in 11 apperances. 

He was the closer at the start of the 2022 season but a bout with blisters curtailed his season. He has a career record of 3-3 with a 2.81 ERA and 24 saves. 

Bradford made his Major League debut on Monday against Atlanta, taking the loss in a 12-0 Rangers defeat.  Bradford pitched five innings, giving up seven hits, six runs and two home runs. 

May 14: Texas Rangers outfielder Travis Jankowski may need "another week" before he starts a rehab assignment, manager Bruce Bochy said before Sunday's 11-3 win at the Oakland Athletics.

“He’s ramping it up, but he’s going to have to do the rehab and he’s not quite ready for that,” Bochy said, according to the Dallas Morning News.

Jankowski left a game with the Los Angeles Angels a week ago with a right hamstring strain. The Rangers moved him to the 10-day injured list on Tuesday and cane be activated Friday. 

If Jankowski needs another week before a rehab stint, he won't be ready to come off the IL later this week. He was batting .309 before the injury. 

May 13: Texas Rangers left fielder Josh Smith left Saturday's game with Oakland after taking a pitch off his left foot in the fifth inning. 

Smith had X-rays done at the stadium and those came back negative. The Rangers are terming the injury as left foot soreness.

After he was hit, he walked to first base with a noticeable limp. Bubba Thompson came on to replace Smith in the sixth inning. 

Smith went 1-for-1 with a run scored and is now batting .210 for the season. 

May 11: The Texas Rangers announced three moves on Thursday, in advance of their four-game series with Oakland.

One was expected. The Rangers made shortstop Corey Seager's move to Double-A Frisco for a rehab assignment official. 

The other impacted the bullpen. The Rangers called up John King and designated veteran Ian Kennedy for assignment. 

King is 2-1 with a 2.08 ERA with the Triple-A Round Rock Express this season, with nine appearances and two starts. With the Rangers he is 9-9 with a 4.01 ERA in 72 games spread across three seasons. 

Kennedy was the Rangers' closer in 2021 before he was traded to Philadelphia. The Rangers re-signed him this spring and he made the 26-man roster. Kennedy was 0-1 with a 7.20 ERA in 11 games. He had one blown save.

May 9: The Texas Rangers announced Tuesday that outfielder Travis Jankowski was moved to the 10-day injured list with a right hamstring strain.

In a corresponding transaction, catcher Sam Huff was recalled from Triple-A Round Rock. 

The IL move is retroactive to Monday and Jankowski could be available next week. He was injured in Sunday's 16-8 win at the Los Angeles Angels.

Huff is batting .267 with five home runs and 20 RBI for the Express. He spent parts of the 2020 and 2022 season with the Rangers, batting .263 with seven home runs and 14 RBI. 

While the move gives the Rangers three catchers, both Huff and Jonah Heim can slide into the DH role in the short term. The Rangers have enough depth in the outfield to go without Jankowski for a week.

May 8: Texas Rangers outfielder Travis Jankowski was out of the starting lineup Monday for the series opener at the Seattle Mariners. Jankowski left during Sunday’s 16-8 win at the Los Angeles Angels after experiencing right hamstring tightness.

Per The Dallas Morning News, the Rangers may bring in a player for Tuesday's game, so the injury could be serious enough to move him to the injured list. 

He started in left field against the Angels and reached base in the second inning on a fielder’s choice bunt. Jankowski later scored on Robbie Grossman’s sacrifice fly.

But as Jankowski crossed the plate and headed toward the dugout, he appeared to skip as if something might be tight. Josh Smith entered the game in left in the third.

Jankowski also left a game against the Cincinnati Reds on April 26 due to left hip tightness. He missed one game.

Jankowski is batting .309 with nine RBI.

May 5: The Texas Rangers traded relief pitcher Zack Littell for cash considerations to the Boston Red Sox, per multiple reports.

The Rangers signed Littell to a minor-league contract this offseason and he didn't make the big league club out of Spring Training, so he was not a member of the 40-man roster. 

Littell, 27, was pitching well for Triple-A Round Rock, carrying a 2.25 ERA. He pitched for the San Francisco Giants the last two seasons before being released.

Despite issues in the bullpen, especially the struggles of José Leclerc, the Rangers had no intention of promoting Littell. The right-hander had his contract selected to join Boston's 40-man roster.

May 3: Former Texas Rangers catcher Robinson Chirinos announced his retirement from baseball on Wednesday via a social media post. 

Chirinos played 11 seasons and the bulk of his career with the Rangers. He broke in with the Tampa Bay Rays in 2011 and then played for the Rangers from 2013-18, and then for another season in 2020. 

Gracias 🙏⚾️🫡 pic.twitter.com/PKlW9dBdef

— Robinson Chirinos (@robinson28ch) May 3, 2023

Chirinos also played for the Houston Astros, the New York Mets, the Chicago Cubs and the Baltimore Orioles. His last action was play for Venezuela in the World Baseball Classic alongside former Rangers teammate Martín Pérez.

He was a lifetime .226 hitter with 95 home runs and 306 RBI. 

April 28: The Texas Rangers are back in their Nike City Connect uniforms Friday night for the second of four games with the New York Yankees at Globe Life Field.

The Rangers are wearing the special edition unis for every Friday home game this season going forward. Texas is 1-1 in the City Connects so far, having split two games with the Oakland Athletics during the uniform debut weekend.

The Rangers (14-11) are on a season-high four-game losing streak. Texas is sending ace Jacob deGrom (2-0, 3.04) to the hill, with the Yankees (15-11) countering with Clarke Schmidt (0-2, 6.30).

First pitch is scheduled for 7:05 p.m. The roof will be closed.

April 24: The Texas Rangers and Clint Frazier have come to a mutual agreement to release the veteran outfielder from his minor league contract, according to MLB.com.

On April 28, the Chicago White Sox announced that they had signed Frazier and that he would be available for that night's game. 

Frazier, 28, hoped to earn a spot with the Rangers during Spring Training after signing a non-roster deal. He didn't and started the season with Triple-A Round Rock, slashing .250/.350/.442 in 15 games for the Express.

The former fifth overall pick spent the first five seasons of his MLB career with the New York Yankees and played only 19 games for the Chicago Cubs last season. 

The Rangers and OF Clint Frazier have come to a mutual agreement, and Frazier has been released from his minor league contract at Triple-A Round Rock.

The outfielder was slashing .250/.350/.442 with the Express this season.

April 23: Not only did Adolis García enjoy a historically-significant performance in Saturday's 18-3 blowout over the Oakland Athletics, a piece of his equipment will soon be headed to Cooperstown.

The City Connect batting helmet that García wore will be donated to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Well, that's once he can get a new helmet ordered and delivered.

The right fielder delivered a performance at Globe Life Field only seen three times in the modern era, as he went 5-for-5 with three home runs, eights RBI and five extra-base hits.

García doesn't have an extra helmet since it's a special model used as part of the Nike City Connect uniform collection. The Rangers will wear their City Connects for Friday home games throughout the rest of the season.

The City Connect batting helmet that Adolis Garcia wore in his 3 homer, 8 RBI, 5 extra base hit performance on Saturday will be donated to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. That is, once he gets a replacement ordered! pic.twitter.com/pe1BaAguPY

April 15: One of the biggest bright spots in for the Texas Rangers wasn't even supposed to make the team. According to the Dallas Morning News, manager Bruce Bochy told Travis Jankwoski when the team was still in Arizona that he would not make the team. 

However, Jankowski is not 6-for-16 this season and has been a menace on the basepaths for opposing teams. He has been a revelation for the ball club to start the season. 

April 14: The Rangers activated relief pitcher Josh Sborz from the 15-day injured list. The right-hander will be available in the bullpen for Friday night's series opener at the Houston Astros.

The move comes a day after the Rangers optioned fellow relief pitcher Taylor Hearn to Triple-A Rock, making room for Sborz on the 26-man roster.

The Rangers have activated RHP Josh Sborz from the 15-day Injured List, and he will be available in the bullpen for tonight's series opener in Houston.

— Texas Rangers PR (@TXRangersPR) April 14, 2023

April 13: The Rangers have optioned relief pitcher Taylor Hearn to Triple-A Round Rock, the team announced. The move comes on the heels of his Wednesday night performance against the Kansas City Royals in which he pitched two innings and allowed four earned runs. 

A corresponding move was not announced at the time of Hearn's demotion, but the team did say a move would be made ahead of Friday night's game with the Houston Astros. 

A likely candidate to replace Hearn on the 26-man roster is relief pitcher Josh Sborz.

April 10: Texas Rangers catcher Mitch Garver was moved to the 10-day injured list on Monday with a mild left knee sprain, the team announced. 

The Rangers recalled Sandy León from Triple-A Round Rock to take Garver's place on the active roster. 

To make room for León, the Rangers moved pitcher Spencer Howard from the 15-day injured list to the 60-day injured list. Howard has a right lat strain.

Garver missed most of last season with a right flexor tendon injury that required surgery. He's batted .263 with two home runs and six RBI as a designated hitter and part-time catcher. 

León is a lifetime .210 hitter who was with the Rangers in Spring Training and was designated to Round Rock at the end of camp. 

April 9: Texas Rangers reliever Josh Sborz began his injury rehab stint with a scoreless inning of relief for Triple-A Round Rock on Sunday against Sugar Land. 

The Rangers announced earlier in the day that Sborz would start his rehab assignment with the Express.

Sborz pitched in the third inning of the game. After Sugar Land's Grae Kessinger flew out, Sborz struck out both Dixon Machado and Pedro Leon swinging.

That was Sborz's first game action since March 22. He was moved to the 15-day injured list on March 30 (retroactive to March 27) with an ankle injury. He is eligible to return from the injured list on Tuesday.

Making a future move with Sborz is complicated by the fact that he is on the 40-man roster and out of minor-league options. 

April 8: Leody Taveras took another positive step in his injury rehab assignment by playing seven innings in center field for Double-A Frisco on Friday.

He went 0-for-3 with a strikeout at the plate after serving as the designated hitter Thursday. Taveras has gone 0-for-7 with a pair of strikeouts in his two appearances with the RoughRiders.

Taveras suffered a low-grade oblique strain during Spring Training. He's expected to be the Rangers starting center fielder once healthy.

April 7: Texas Rangers pitcher Jake Odorizzi underwent an arthroscopic debridement procedure on his right shoulder on Wednesday. The procedure will cause him to miss the entire season, per MLB.com. 

Odorizzi never pitched in Spring Training with what the Rangers called "arm fatigue." They placed him on the 60-day injured list to open the season.

The Rangers traded for Odorizzi in November, sending pitcher Kolby Allard to the Atlanta Braves. The Rangers are only on the hook for $2.5 million of Odorizzi's salary, as Atlanta is picking up the rest. 

In other updates, Rangers outfielder Leody Taveras will play in the outfield at Double-A Frisco on Friday as he continues to rehab from injury. He is eligible to come off the injured list at any time. 

April 6: Texas Rangers outfielder Leody Taveras has been sent to Double-A Frisco on injury rehabilitation assignment and is expected to start as designated hitter in the RoughRiders' season opener at home Friday night against Amarillo.

Taveras suffered a low-grade oblique strain during Spring Training and hasn't played since March 3. He's expect to be the Rangers starting center fielder once he's healthy and ready to return.

Taveras was placed on the 10-day injures list retroactive to March 27. The hope, according to general manager Chris Young, was that Taveras could join the Rangers on the first road trip of the season, which starts Friday at the Chicago Cubs.

Taveras took batting practice from both sides of the plate earlier this week.

Rangers OF Leody Taveras has been sent to Frisco (AA) on injury rehabilitation assignment. Taveras is expected to start as designated hitter in the RoughRiders' season opener tonight vs. Amarillo at 6:35pm CT in Frisco.

March 30: While not a transaction, there was a significant move during the Opening Day matchup between the Texas Rangers and Philadelphia Phillies. More like movement, actually.

With rain showers moving through the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex Thursday afternoon, the roof at Globe Life Field began to be closed after the conclusion of the third inning

The closing process was completed prior to the middle of the fourth and the roof remained closed for the rest of the game. It was the first time in the facility’s brief history (est. 2020) that the roof was opened or closed mid-contest.

The Rangers rallied to win 11-7 after being down 5-0 early.

March 29: Top 30 prospect Ricky Vanasco had meniscus surgery and is out 4-6 weeks. A member of the 40-man roster, the pitcher was injured fielding a ground ball last week during Spring Training.

In 2022, Vanasco went 3-5 with a 4.68 ERA. He made 23 appearances between Class-A Hickory and Double-A Frisco, all starts, pitching 92 1/3 innings. He gave up 89 hits, 53 runs (48 earned), 14 home runs and 52 walks. He struck out 118. He had a 1.42 WHIP.

The Rangers drafted Vanasco out of high school in the 15th round in 2017. His best minor league season was in 2019 – 1.81 ERA and 75 strikeouts in 49 2/3 innings in the lower levels of the organization. But Tommy John surgery put his career on hold at the end of 2020. He resumed pitching last season.

He was on the 40-man roster in 2022 because the Rangers liked his stuff so much they wanted to protect him from the 2021 Rule V Draft.

March 29: On the eve of Opening Day against the Philadelphia Phillies, the Rangers announced the following transactions:

- LHP John King optioned to Triple-A Round Rock

- RHP Dominic Leone re-signed to a minor league contract and assigned to Round Rock

- OF Dustin Harris option transferred from Round Rock to Double-A Frisco

March 28: Catcher Sandy Leon will re-sign with the Texas Rangers, per a report in the New York Post. 

The Rangers announced on Monday that they would release Leon, who was a non-roster invitee to spring training camp. Given his release, Leon had the chance to shop his services around the league. 

The move has not been officially announced by the Rangers. But should Leon follow through, he would give the organization additional depth at catcher behind Jonah Heim, Mitch Garver and Sam Huff, the last of which is on the 40-man roster but will star the season at Triple-A Round Rock.

Leon is a 10-year veteran and a .210 lifetime hitter.

The Rangers play their final exhibition game on Tuesday against the Kansas City Royals.

March 27: Former Texas Rangers outfielder Nomar Mazara was released by the Baltimore Orioles in another blow to a once-promising career. Considered one of the top prospects in baseball while coming up with the Rangers, Mazara has struggled mightily the last few years.

Since being traded by the Rangers after 2019 season, Mazara has played sparingly for three different organizations – Chicago White Sox, Detroit Tigers and San Diego Padres – over the last three years. He failed to get more than 181 plate appearances in each of those three seasons after having no fewer than 469 in his four years with Texas.

Mazara, 28, hit .261 with 79 home runs and 308 RBI with the Rangers. He was signed by the Orioles to a minor-league deal in December.

March 27: The Texas Rangers announced on Monday that they have released catcher Sandy Leon, who was a non-roster invitee to spring training camp. 

Leon is a 10-year veteran and a .210 lifetime hitter. 

The move underscores the comfort the Rangers have in the tandem of Jonah Heim and Mitch Garver. Heim will get the majority of the playing time, per manager Bruce Bochy, with Garver getting time at designated hitter when he isn't behind the plate.

The Rangers made the move in advance of its exhibition game on Monday with Kansas City.

March 25: The Texas Rangers have shut down pitcher Glenn Otto for three weeks as he prepares to be re-examined by team doctors on Monday in Arlington, per a report from Rangers Today. 

Otto, who won seven games last season and was a candidate for the bullpen, hasn't pitched in more than a week due to what the Rangers have called right lat tightness. 

Dr. Keith Meister, the Rangers' team doctor, will handle the examination. 

March 25: The Texas Rangers have informed reliever Joe Barlow that he will begin the season at Triple-A Round Rock. 

Barlow was a two-year veteran of the Rangers bullpen and, despite blister issues, led the club in saves in 2022 with 13.

He threw 8 1/3 innings of relief in Spring Training, going 1-0 with a 2.16 ERA. 

March 24: The Texas Rangers informed two players that they would be released and two other players that they would not be breaking camp with the team.

Manager Bruce Bochy made the announcement, at the same time announcing that pitcher Jacob deGrom would start on Opening Day. 

The Rangers informed pitcher Reyes Moronta and outfielder Joe McCarthy that they will be released. Both were signed as non-roster invitees for Spring Training. 

Moronta, a former San Francisco Giants reliever, threw in seven games and pitched 5 2/3 innings in spring, striking out five hitters. 

McCarthy went through Spring Training with the Rangers last season. He batted .258 with a home run and three RBI in 31 at-bats. 

Two other players won't break camp with the Rangers are first baseman Yoshi Tsutsugo and outfielder Clint Frazier.

Bochy said the two players have not been released and are weighing their options. 

Tsutsugo was a late arrival to spring due to visa issues and batted .240 with one home run and six RBI in 25 at-bats. 

Frazier was contending for a utility outfield role. He batted .244 with two home runs and five RBI in 41 at-bats. 

With those moves, the Rangers are now down to 39 players on their spring roster entering Friday's game with the Chicago Cubs. 

The Rangers have three more games in Arizona before breaking camp and returning to Arlington for two exhibition games with the Kansas City Royals, starting Monday at Globe Life Field.
