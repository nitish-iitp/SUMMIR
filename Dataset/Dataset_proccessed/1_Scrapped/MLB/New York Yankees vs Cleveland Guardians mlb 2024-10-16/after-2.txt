Heroes, zeros from Yankees’ Game 2 win over Guardians: Pen truly provides relief

Heroes, zeros and the inside pitch from the Yankees’ 6-3 Game 2 win over the Guardians on Tuesday night in The Bronx:  

Hero

For a unit that entered the postseason with some question marks, the Yankees’ bullpen has been nearly unhittable and on this night, picked up a lackluster Gerrit Cole, allowing one run in 4 ⅔ innings.

Zero

With Cleveland desperately needing a good start — and some length — from Tanner Bibee, the right-hander lasted just 1 ¹/₃ innings, putting the Guardians in a bad spot for the rest of the series.

Unsung hero

It would be easy to say Tim Hill, the little-known lefty, but he got a standing ovation after getting five key outs.

Key stat

1 Home run this postseason for Aaron Judge, which produced one giant sigh of relief from the Yankees, who’d seen his postseason struggles continue.

Quote of the night

“I’ve been booed here plenty of times. There’s been a lot of legends that’ve played here that have been booed. It’s just part of it. You can’t focus on that. You’ve got to go out there. They want to see you win. They want to see you do well. You’ve just got to focus on what you can control,’’

— Aaron Judge after hitting his first home run of these playoffs
