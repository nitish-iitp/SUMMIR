Baseball: In-form Seiya Suzuki homers to propel Cubs past Pirates

 KYODO NEWS - Aug 28, 2024 - 15:43 | Sports, All

Seiya Suzuki hit his 19th home run while going 2-for-4 with two RBIs and two runs scored as the Chicago Cubs came from behind to defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates 9-5 on Tuesday.

After getting four hits a day earlier, Suzuki kept his fine batting form going. He hit a 3-1 four-seam fastball from Jared Jones (5-7) with one on and no outs in the fourth inning for an opposite-field, two-run homer to right at PNC Park, tying the game at 2-2.

"The pitcher's fastballs have good velocity, and I went into the batter's box geared up for that," Suzuki said.

The Cubs scored five runs in the frame to turn the game around and Suzuki, who drew a walk in the first, singled with one out to spark a four-run fifth, scoring on a two-out bases-loaded walk by Dansby Swanson, who also hit a two-run homer.

"I hope to do my best to maintain this good condition heading into the remaining games," Suzuki said.

Elsewhere, Shohei Ohtani also went 2-for-4 with a pair of singles and a run scored as the Los Angeles Dodgers lost 3-2 to the Baltimore Orioles.

Yuki Matsui (4-2) allowed a walk in a scoreless inning of relief and earned the win in the San Diego Padres' 7-5 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.

Masataka Yoshida went 1-for-4 with a two-run first-inning single as the Boston Red Sox held off the Toronto Blue Jays 6-3.
