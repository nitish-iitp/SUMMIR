Optioned to Triple-A
The Royals optioned Bowlan to Triple-A Omaha on Wednesday.
Impact Bowlan was part of the roster maneuvering as Kansas City officially added its trade-deadline acquisitions to the roster. The righty's latest stint in the majors lasted just one day and he didn't make an appearance.

Promoted Tuesday
The Royals recalled Bowlan from Triple-A Omaha on Tuesday.
Impact The right-hander allowed four runs over 2.2 frames in a spot start for Kansas City in late April, but he's otherwise been with Omaha this season. Bowlan has a 4.93 ERA, 1.40 WHIP and 80:30 K:BB over 84 innings at Triple-A this season. It appears he's joining the big club as a reliever for the stretch run, considering he worked out of the bullpen in his last four appearances for Omaha.

Takes loss in debut
Bowlan (0-1) allowed one run on three hits and struck out two without walking a batter over two innings, taking the loss Wednesday versus the Tigers.
Impact Bowlan got the start in his debut and logged a short appearance, but the Royals' offense was shut out in the loss. The right-hander recorded a passable 105:45 K:BB over 102 innings between Double-A and Triple-A this season, but it came with a 5.91 ERA and 1.58 WHIP. Bowlan could compete for a rotation spot in 2024, but he likely needs a little more time in the minors.

Debuting Wednesday
Bowlan will open Wednesday's game against the Tigers, Anne Rogers of MLB.com reports.
Impact Bowlan's start Wednesday will mark the first appearance of his major-league career. The 26-year-old righty was rather unspectacular in the minors this season, recording a 5.91 ERA and 1.58 WHIP through 102 innings between Double-A and Triple-A. Though he'll have the benefit of facing a Tigers offense that ranks second-lowest in MLB in team OPS (.679), Bowlan isn't likely to offer much from a fantasy perspective.

Called up by Kansas City
Bowlan was called up from Triple-A Omaha on Tuesday.
Impact Bowlan was with the Royals during major-league spring training but was unable to earn a spot on the Opening Day roster, but he could now have the chance to make his big-league debut. The 26-year-old had a 5.24 ERA, 1.55 WHIP and 58:32 K:BB across 67 innings for Omaha in 2023.

Optioned to Double-A
The Royals optioned Bowlan to Double-A Northwest Arkansas on Friday.
Impact Bowlan gave up one earned run through three innings during spring training, but a 6.92 ERA and 1.74 WHIP in Double-A last season indicate the 26-year-old righty still needs time to develop in the minors.

Healthy again at Double-A
Bowlan (elbow) has given up 10 runs (eight earned) on 12 hits and three walks while striking out nine across 7.1 innings in his two starts since being activated from Double-A North...
Impact After undergoing Tommy John surgery early last summer, the 25-year-old right-hander looks to be healthy again. He's been rusty in his first two outings since returning to action for Northwest Arkansas, with keeping the ball in the yard -- he's allowed four home runs in two starts -- proving to be a challenge in particular. Though Bowlan is one of the Royals' better pitching prospects, he likely won't be a realistic option to join the big-league rotation until 2023.

Pitching in rehab games
Bowlan (elbow) has made five starts for the Royals' Arizona Complex League team, posting a 3.60 ERA, 1.80 WHIP and 9:3 K:BB across 10 innings.
Impact Bowlan continues to build up from the Tommy John surgery he underwent last spring. He's about 13 months removed from the procedure, so he remains on the expected timeline. He'll likely continue to make rehab starts in Arizona and could move up to a lower-level full-season affiliate before ultimately joining Double-A Northwest Arkansas some time in the last two months of the campaign.

Throws bullpen session
Bowlan (elbow) completed a bullpen session Tuesday, Anne Rogers of MLB.com reports.
Impact Bowlan underwent Tommy John surgery early last summer, and Tuesday's bullpen session was his first time back on the mound. The 25-year-old still has a significant way to go in his recovery, and he should continue building up his arm in hopes of being cleared for game action during the second half of the 2022 campaign.

Protected from Rule 5 draft
Bowlan (elbow) was added to Kansas City's 40-man roster Friday.
Impact While Bowlan made just four starts at Double-A last season, he seemed poised for a breakout campaign before needing Tommy John surgery in late-May/early-June. If he can make a full recovery, Bowlan could pitch in minor-league games before the end of the 2022 season.
