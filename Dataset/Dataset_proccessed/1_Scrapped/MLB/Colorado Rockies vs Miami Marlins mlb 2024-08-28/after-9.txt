Today’s Headlines

 

Philly Special

In the first of two potential World Series previews we had today, the Phillies shut out the Astros as Aaron Nola cruised through seven scoreless innings of only four hits and a walk allowed, while striking out six. Facing Justin Verlander, Philadelphia’s offense came alive with a four-run third, capped by Nick Castellanos‘ three-run homer even as today featured no notable world events. The early outburst was more than enough, as Houston was held to only singles and walks, never threatening to make a game out of it. Philadelphia’s second four-game winning streak in the past two weeks suggests that the team may be catching fire at the right time, especially after their mid-season slump.

 


The Birds Prevail

 

In a tense contest that also featured championship hopefuls, the Orioles barely outlasted the Dodgers to take a 3-2 win in their series opener. Even as their starter Cole Irvin could not escape the fifth inning, Baltimore’s bullpen was stellar with 4.2 scoreless innings in which they limited LA to only two hits and a walk. Closer Seranthony Domínguez put the winning run on base, but managed to get the final three outs in dramatic fashion. On the other hand, LA pitching was almost as good, but Jack Flaherty was felled by a Ramón Urías two-run homer in the fifth that provided the winning margin for the Orioles. With the Padres winning in St. Louis, the Dodgers’ division lead stands at a mere three games, while the Orioles picked up a game on the Yankees to inch closer to the AL East top spot.

Vintage Corbin and his Crew(s)

 

On paper, a matchup between reigning AL Cy Young Gerrit Cole and beleaguered lefty Corbin Burnes seemed a bit lopsided. If you add the offense each of them have, it would appear that Cole and the Yankees could simply cruise to another win. And yet, Corbin somehow took some of that leftover 2019 magic to spin his best outing of the year, limiting the powerful Bombers to two walks and two hits across six scoreless innings, while striking out six. While his contract has been an unmitigated disaster for the franchise and his MLB future is a mystery, the 34-year-old at least had this chance to be the hero for a day. His veteran presence was complemented by Washington’s youth movement, as Dylan Crews got his first major-league hit, along with a run and a stolen base, while Andrés Chaparro hit his first career homer. Even as the Nationals’ bullpen made it interesting, they held on for a surprising 4-2 win.

Best Moments From Yesterday

 

All Square 

With the AL Central being feckless for many years, it seems fair that people have almost ignored its current version. However, we may be seeing the tightest division race unravel before our eyes, as the Royals have come all the way back to tie things up with only 29 games to go. At the same time, Cleveland’s collapse could be one to remember (even as they still seem like a lock to play in October), as they seized control of the division since early April and have been in first place for 154 days, while opening up a 9-game lead as late as June 25. Today’s win for the Royals included an early exit from their starting pitcher due to injury, a 134-minute rain delay, and six pitchers who combined to limit Cleveland to only one run, three hits, and two walks, while an early Paul DeJong got things going for the eventual 6-1 win. While the average lead in all other divisions stands at 4.5 games, the race for the AL Central may become one of September’s key storylines.

The Marlins, Man

 

In a clear contrast to the aforementioned games of top squads, the 47-84 Marlins faced the 49-83 Rockies in a true clash of awfulness. What appeared as a classic play-out-the-string game at least a chance to become something because of Coors Field shenanigans, which is exactly how it turned into a truly entertaining game. Colorado took early advantage of Marlins pitching and built a 6-0 lead that would be safe in any other stadium, but Miami chipped into the deficit gradually to make it 6-4 by the sixth, at which point the Rockies scored twice to regain a more comfortable four-run margin. It would stay that way until the top of the ninth, when the Marlins suddenly became a murderers’ row, going double-single-walk-double-homer to stun the home crowd, as Jesus Sanchez cheerfully rounded the bases. The 8-4 deficit had suddenly turned into a 9-8 lead, which would be the final score. In true Coors fashion, the final box score showed both teams combine for seven doubles, two triples, and six homers, including the first career hit for Griffin Conine, son of Mr. Marlin himself.

Central Perks

In the fifth inning of a 2-2 tie, Thairo Estrada stepped up to the plate and appeared to give San Francisco the lead with just one swing. Instead, Brewers center fielder Blake Perkins took a good route, tracked the ball, and timed his jump perfectly to create a true home run robbery. According to the broadcast, this was Perkins’ fourth such robbery of 2024, which leads the league. In true baseball irony, the very next batter hit a no-doubt homer to right, giving the Giants the lead in a game they would ultimately win by one run. As a bonus from this game, make sure to check out this Tyler Rogers strikeout.

Game Recognize Game

In a matchup of young hotshot center fielders, ROY favorite Jackson Merrill took on Victor Scott II and immediately put him to the test. With a man on second and a chance to add to the early Padres’ lead, Merrill hit a deep fly ball to left center, which appeared ready to land for an extra-base hit. However, Scott II had other plans, sprinting at full speed and making an acrobatic catch to end the inning and rob Merrill. With his pitcher and teammates in awe and ready to congratulate Scott II, Merrill had no choice but to join the line and tip his cap to his center field cohort. Expect to see both of them making spectacular plays for years to come.

Dance Dance Revolution

 

Regardless of the product on the field, there is something about Philadelphia and its mascot that tends to create highlights by itself. To wit, take a look at the Phanatic taking part of this dance routine during today’s game. Just the thought of doing that in full mascot wardrobe is remarkable, but to actually make it funny and entertaining while the actual dance squad stayed in character was a display of professionalism all around. As it is often suggested, the Phanatic is the best mascot in sports by a wide margin.

Injuries and Other Moves

 

⚾ The Giants’ dwindling playoff hopes took a major hit today, as the team announced upcoming IL stints for two veteran pitchers. It started with the confirmation that Robbie Ray’s hamstring strain will require a trip to the 15-day IL, as he had sustained the injury during last Sunday’s game. The bad news continued with the announcement that Jordan Hicks is also being placed on the 15-day IL but with right shoulder inflammation. While both hurlers had been inconsistent and Hicks had been part of the bullpen lately, San Francisco does not have many optimal options to fill out their spots.

⚾ Reds lefty Nick Lodolo has been placed on the 15-day IL with a left middle finger sprain. This will mark Lodolo’s fourth trip to the IL in 2024, though all of them have been for different injuries. The lack of consistency has certainly affected his performance, as Lodolo sports a 4.76 ERA for the season. The Reds have not provided a timetable for his return, and this absence adds to the significant injury woes in their rotation, as Hunter Greene and Andrew Abbott are on the IL, too. 

⚾ Royals starter Michael Lorenzen left today’s game after pitching only 1.2 innings against the Guardians. The team announced that he suffered a left hamstring strain, though the severity of it is still unknown. With Kansas City in the thick of the playoff race, they will sure be hoping for a speedy recovery.
