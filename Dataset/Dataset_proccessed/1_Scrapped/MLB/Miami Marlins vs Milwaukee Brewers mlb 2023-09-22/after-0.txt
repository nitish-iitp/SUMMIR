Brewers clinch 2023 playoff berth with rout of Marlins: How dominant pitching got them here

The Milwaukee Brewers punched their ticket to the 2023 postseason with a 16-1 rout of the Miami Marlins on Friday night. Here’s what you need to know:

This marks Milwaukee’s fifth playoff berth in six seasons and its first since 2021.
Christian Yelich accounted for 5 RBIs in the blowout victory with two home runs, the first of which capped a 12-run second inning. First baseman/DH Rowdy Tellez pitched the ninth and recorded the final three outs of the game.
The Brewers improved to 88-66 on the season and hold an eight-game lead over the Chicago Cubs in the NL Central.

The Athletic’s instant analysis:

Brewers ride dominant pitching into postseason

The Brewers barrelled into the postseason Friday with their rout of the Marlins in Miami. After missing a wild-card spot by one game last season, the Crew is back in the playoffs for the fifth time in six seasons with a familiar formula: dominant pitching.

Milwaukee’s staff had the lowest opponents’ batting average in the majors heading into Friday, at .225, a credit both to stingy pitching and airtight defense. As starting trios go, it’s hard to get much better than Brandon Woodruff, Corbin Burnes and Freddy Peralta — and closer Devin Williams leads a deep bullpen.

These Brewers aren’t exactly Harvey’s Wallbangers of 1982 (ask your parents), but Yelich is having his best season since 2019 and homered twice Friday night. Veteran deadline acquisitions Mark Canha, Josh Donaldson and Carlos Santana have added some offensive thump. Milwaukee likely won’t score like this again (16 runs is their season high), but if they do just enough hitting, their pitching could make them a very dangerous team this October as they seek the first championship in franchise history. — Kepner
