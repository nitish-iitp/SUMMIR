Astros’ Chas McCormick ‘really disappointed’ to be placed on injured list with hand fracture

HOUSTON — Houston Astros outfielder Chas McCormick fractured a small bone in his right hand and will be placed on the injured list.

McCormick sustained the fracture after running into the right field wall in pursuit of a foul ball during Tuesday’s 4-3 loss to the Oakland A’s. After the game, McCormick said he “jammed” his right hand, but further imaging Wednesday revealed a small fracture at the base of his right index finger.

“It sucks,” McCormick said Wednesday. “I’m just really disappointed. I just want to be out here trying to help the team win, especially toward the end of the season going into the playoffs. It’s a disappointing season overall and just not the way I wanted this to happen.”

McCormick described his fracture as “not a serious thing,” but did not have a concrete timeline for his return. McCormick said, “Everything else feels good, it’s just picking up a bat” that is difficult.

McCormick vowed to be back at the end of the season, but with 17 games and 18 days remaining, it will be a difficult task. McCormick must spend a minimum of 10 days on the injured list before he can be activated.

If McCormick cannot return, it will mark a fitting end to his miserable season. The 29-year-old outfielder batted .211/.271/.306 across 267 plate appearances, failing to build upon his breakout in 2023.

McCormick’s spiral helped to create an outfield carousel Houston still hasn’t settled. Veterans Ben Gamel and Jason Heyward were brought in as reinforcements while McCormick’s struggles deepened. Upon Heyward’s arrival earlier this month, the Astros optioned McCormick to Triple-A Sugar Land in hopes he could harness some consistency with some swing adjustments.

McCormick’s stint in the minor leagues lasted two games. Jake Meyers’ paternity leave opened a spot on the Astros’ active roster and McCormick seized it, going 9-for-23 across seven games in September. That manager Joe Espada started McCormick in every game — even upon Meyers’ return — demonstrated the belief Houston’s coaching staff and organization has in McCormick despite his pronounced struggles.

“I was feeling like myself, finally, and this happened,” McCormick said. “It’s disappointing.”

The Astros did not announce a corresponding move for McCormick’s impending move to the injured list, but Trey Cabbage profiles as the most logical choice. McCormick’s absence will be more difficult for the Astros to absorb given Kyle Tucker’s slow reintroduction to right field.

Tucker still hasn’t played defense since returning from a fractured shin on Sept. 6. The team plans to play him in right field at some point during this weekend’s series in Anaheim, Calif., but it still won’t be in an everyday capacity. Without McCormick in the mix, Houston will rely on a mix of Gamel, Heyward and Mauricio Dubón to occupy its corner outfield spots.
