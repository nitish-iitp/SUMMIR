Francisco Lindor ends Blue Jays' no-hit bid with a homer in 9th

Francisco Lindor of the New York Mets blew a home run during the ninth inning against the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Center in Toronto, Canada, breaking up a no-hit bid from Bowden Francis.

Lindor's homer tied the score 1-1 for the Mets before the team scored another five runs, including a triple shot by Francisco Alvarez. The Jays scored one run later, but it was not enough to reverse the situation.

"It felt really good," Lindor said after the 6-2 victory. "It was one of those hits that I could tell the vibes in the dugout were lifted. Everything was going his way until the last pitch he threw."

Lindor hit the homer on Francis' 111th pitch of the season and it was the second time for the 28-year-old to throw over 100 pitches in one season since his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut in 2022.

"With that many pitches, I felt like I had to empty the tank with heaters and let him put the ball in play," Francis said. It was the second time in four starts Francis lost a no-hitter on a leadoff homer in the ninth inning. Back on August 24, Taylor Ward of the Los Angeles Angels did it as well.

As a result, Francis became the first pitcher to lose two no-hit bids during the ninth inning in one season since Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan with the Texas Rangers in 1989.

"It sucks for him that it's happened twice in the same fashion," the Jays' manager John Schneider said after Wednesday's game.

Having secured their 80th win of the season, the Mets (80-66) are leading the Atalanta Braves (79-67) by one game in the race for the final National League wild-card playoff spot.
