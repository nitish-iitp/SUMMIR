Dodgers Pitcher Clears Out His Locker Between Games in Atlanta

The Los Angeles Dodgers are preparing for Sunday’s series finale against the Atlanta Braves. The Dodgers are looking to avoid the sweep to the Braves with the first pitch set at 4:10 pm PT.

While the Dodgers are focused on not getting swept, one of their top pitchers, right-handed ace Tyler Glasnow, no longer has a locker in Atlanta.

Fabian Ardaya of The Athletic shared via Twitter/X.

It’s unclear what this means moving forward, but it could mean that Glasnow is heading back home to Los Angeles.

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts announced on Saturday that Glasnow has a sprained right elbow and is “highly unlikely” to pitch again this season. The news is a devastating blow to the team’s World Series expectations and raises serious concerns about its preseason rotation.

“It’s a big blow,” Roberts said. “Looking at what he meant for our ballclub, what he’s done for us, what we expected him to do — certainly there’s going to be a cost. But we gotta move on and we will. We have a lot of capable people. I feel bad for Tyler because he did everything to stay healthy and get back, and it just wasn’t going to happen.”

Glasnow was set to be a top pitcher in the Dodgers’ rotation in October, but he will most likely not pitch until the 2025 season. The 31-year-old has been out since Aug. 11 with what the team described as elbow tendinitis.

He had seemed to be close to a return before suffering another setback that essentially ended his season. The right-handed pitcher was warming up for a two-to-three-inning simulated game prior to the Dodgers series opener on Friday. It was expected to be the final step to a return, but instead, he had to be shut down because of elbow discomfort as he approached his 25th throw from the bullpen.

The Dodgers traded for Glasnow in Dec. 2023, giving up two promising young players in starter Ryan Pepiot and outfielder Jonny DeLuca. L.A. didn’t stop there as they signed Glasnow to a five-year, $136.6 million extension. The hope was for Glasnow to pitch in the biggest stage for L.A., but now that will have to wait, and it could massively hurt L.A.’s World Series chances.

The Dodgers will look for production from guys like Bobby Miller and Walker Buehler and hope for the return of Gavin Stone from the IL to step up big-time.

DO NOT EXPECT ANY PITCHING HELP FROM BOBBY MILLER. AS WE SAID MONTHS AGO, HE DOESN’T HAVE THE MECHANICS, COMMAND, OR EXPERIENCE MENTALLY TO CONTRIBUTE ON A HIGH MLB LEVEL, ESPECIALLY IN ‘MUST WIN’ PLAYOFF GAMES. STOP B.S.ING YOURSELVES DODGER FANS. MILLER’S A DOUBLE-TRIPLE A THROWER WHO’S NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME! HE’S A THROWER, NOT A PITCHER, & YOU CANNOT TRUST HIM ON THE MOUND IN CLUTCH GAMES VS TOP MLB TEAMS! ENOUGH OF THE BOBBY MILLER POTENTIAL. HE’S A GOOD TALKER, BUT NOT RELIABLE ON THE MOUND. TRADE HIM IN A PACKAGE TO THE CUBS & BRING CODY BELLINGER BACK TO PLAY CENTER FIELD!

No they’re not. You have to keep Muncy, Outman might figure it out in the minors
Don’t forget he was the 3rd runner up for rookie of the year. Get rid of Kiki ,
Taylor, and Barnes.

Bellinger is a free agent again this year. And if the Cubs could trade him, he would not be eligible to play in the playoffs. That would help a lot now wouldn’t it. Miller just needs to control his emotions. When he is calmm he pitched well. When he gets upset he becomes wild. Give him a break. The Dodgers know more about what he needs than you do!

Dodgers just got a bad break this year with its pitching staff and all the injuries. One wonders why so many pitchers are getting surgeries that keep them out all season. The rest of the team is coming together and doing a great job. Don’t count the Dodg

How is it possible that this website and ESPN keep referring to a potential 3 game sweep and are not aware that is a 4 game wraparound weekend set? Duh!
OTOH, what a welcome development to have been able to watch such a good game today, as well as the Emmys tonight. Spoken, of course, as a relieved DirecTV subscriber.

The team also has one of the highest payrolls in MLB, and it’s been that way virtually the entire tenure of Roberts. You are supposed to win the WS every once in a while when the owners spend the big bucks. Most of us don’t care how many times we take the division or have the best record in baseball heading into the playoffs if a WS ring isn’t in the program. Maybe Roberts will head to Cooperstown as the winningest manager in history with an asterisk stating the fewest WS titles.

Finally the voice of reason, Robert’s is not a winner! And with the money this organization throws around on Talent, Yamamoto, maybe great under Roberts – nothing, Shoei, whatever, can’t pitch, but he can authorize his translator to get 2-3million outta’ the bank to pay gambling debts? I mean this is all under Robert’s watch that’s his management style I guess. Taylor, Muncy, and a dysfunctional pitching staff and athletes all this doesn’t produce confidence, or championships so bounce that guy, please. I wonder just how many championship’s would Bocce have brought to LA with the team’s Robert’s has had since 2017?

When I was growing up the Yankees were the best team money could buy. Well that nick name has passed to the LA dodgers. Next year they will dig deeper into their pockets and sign Max Fried. Sometime your pockets will be turned inside out. You mortgage the future for today and time to pay the piper will catch up to you all.

The Braves have a (not very apologetic) wife beater on their roster, and they make it work.

Dodgers are not going to advance in the playoffs. No pitching. I laughed pretty hard when Kershaw went down with a toe! Too funny. Time to clean house. Maybe get rid of the trainers. They sure the hell aren’t doing much “training.”

Every team in baseball is dealing with the trend of increasing pitching injuries, and the Dodgers have had it the worst the last few years, by far. I could put some of the blame on Roberts overworking his starters, especially his rookies, but that is beside the point. There are a lot of experts out there trying to figure out the reasons – higher velocity, more use of stressful pitch types, greater intensity as hitters are better, etc. But the reality is that the game has changed, and teams had better learn to change with it. I contend that teams – I hope starting with the dodgers, will adapt some new models of managing their starting pitching roster, primarily to limit the number of innings and number of pitches.
—
I offer the following suggestion, which will get lots of laughs and opprobrium from arm chair experts, but I will make it anyway. Start with the standard, CW model that most teams use: 13 pitchers, comprised of 5 starters and 8 relievers; each starter starts the 1st inning and tries to go as long as possible (used to be 9 inning, rare to go beyond 7 today), with great value, and contract money, placed on the number of innings. When the starters falter, or get beyond 100 pitches, bring in the bullpen.
—
I propose a couple of key changes. First would be an expanded use of openers. Rarely does a game go without using relief out of the bullpen. Why not use some in the 1st inning instead of 6-9? Use a lockdown reliever to get past the first 3 batters the first time, let the starters pitch innings 2-7 or 2-8. Teams are starting to do this more, why not make it a consistent strategy?
—
Next is what I will call “team starters”. Instead of 5 starters and 8 relievers, why not reverse that and have 8 starters? Too late this year for the Ds, but even without Kershaw and Flaherty you can easily see 8 starters next year already under contract. Team them up to pitch 4 innings each – Ohtani and Stone, Glasnow and Yamamoto, Buhler and May, Gonsolin and Sheehan, or others waiting in the wings.
—
I can hear the objections now – most important being buy-in by the starters, who would have to give up some glory of being “THE guy” and basing their millions on pitching late into games. They would have to embrace a concept of team first. But you could point out that what they give up in glory they would gain by a longer and more productive career, with less time spent rehabbing. I’m also guessing that this would result in improved stats for each starter, improving their value on the market. They would have to get used to not starting the 1st inning, especially if you combine this with more openers. Another objection is cost, as starters are much more expensive than relievers – but, hell, we are paying these starters anyway to NOT pitch and spend their time in the weight room. It could SAVE money in the long run.
—
But think of the gains. The most important is that each starter would have many fewer pitches per game, which I am guessing will be found to be more important than total pitches per year, and this scheme could actually result in more pitches per year factoring in less time on the IL. Chances are much better of having a full lineup come October. They could be more willing to go all out each inning instead of pacing themselves to go long. Their recovery time would be less so you could easily go with 4 two-man teams. There is less chance of facing an opposing team the third time through the lineup, which is where a lot of pitchers fail. You could stagger the lineup to put in a lefty and righty so the opposing team couldn’t stack their position players based on a particular pitcher. You could stagger them so a hard thrower would follow a finesse pitcher. You would have only 5 relievers, but you would need fewer since the starters would take their place (and next year the Ds could still have 6 relievers if Ohtani is classified as a DH).
—
And you could change it up in multiple ways. If the first starter is lights out one night with a low pitch count, let him go an extra inning or two. Some pitchers you could let pitch in the regular fashion. Some games would go be 5-3 innings or even 6-2 (or the reverse). Your relievers will still be there when necessary. Flip the starters in the order so that each would get the glory of the win after 5 innings. If some start to falter, the other can take on a more traditional role, or you could call up replacements from the minors.
—
Yeah, this is radical, and some people will call it stupid. But something has to change, the old model is failing. Each year the Ds stagger into the postseason with a rotation that was not there at the beginning of the year, populated with other teams castoffs and rookies. It is getting really frustrating. Some team is going to adopt some changes like this, I’d like the Dodgers to give it a try.
