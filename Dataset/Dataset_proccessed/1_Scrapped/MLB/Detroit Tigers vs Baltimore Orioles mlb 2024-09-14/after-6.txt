DETROIT -- Blanked by ace Corbin Burnes, the Detroit Tigers’ ninth-inning rally fell short in a 4-2 loss to the Baltimore Orioles on Saturday night at Comerica Park.

Burnes gave up only two hits over seven shutout innings as the playoff-bound Orioles (84-65) evened the weekend series with the playoff-chasing Tigers (76-73).
