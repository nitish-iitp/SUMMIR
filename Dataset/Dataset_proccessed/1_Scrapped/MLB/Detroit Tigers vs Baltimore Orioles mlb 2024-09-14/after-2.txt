NEW YORK — Hot for more than a month, the Tigers are making a late push to get to the playoffs for the first time in 10 years.

The Tigers pulled to within 3.5 games of the last American League wild card after making it 21 wins in their last 30 games Friday night. In their 1-0 win over the Orioles at Comerica Park, the Tigers were four outs away from the majors’ first combined perfect game and had a no-hitter until two outs in the ninth when Gunner Henderson broke it up with a triple.

Tyler Holton, the Tigers’ fourth pitcher, struck out Anthony Santander to end the game and hand the Orioles a fourth loss in five games. The only run of the game came on a first-inning homer by Kerry Carpenter off Zach Eflin.

RESTORING THE GLORY

Baltimore, which is 23-27 since July 9, lost more ground in the AL East standings. The first-place Yankees rallied for a 5-4 win over the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium to increase their division lead to three games, the highest it’s been since June 14.

The Yankees trailed 4-0 before scoring five in the seventh on a Gleyber Torres RBI single and grand slam by Aaron Judge, whose MLB-leading 52nd home run ended his career-long homer drought at 16 games.

Elsewhere, the Mets won 11-3 in Philadelphia to stay a game up on the Braves for the third NL wild card. The Braves beat the Dodgers 6-2 in Atlanta.

The Brewers’ NL Central lead is up to 10 games after they won 2-1 in Arizona and the second-place Cubs lost 9-5 to the Rockies at Coors Field.

The Royals closed to within three games of the first-place Guardians in the AL Central and increased their lead over the Twins to 2.5 games for the second wild card.

The Guardians lost to the Rays 3-1 in Cleveland and the Twins were 8-4 losers to the Reds in Minneapolis.
