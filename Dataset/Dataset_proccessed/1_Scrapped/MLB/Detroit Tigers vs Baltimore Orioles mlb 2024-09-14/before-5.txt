Baltimore Orioles vs Detroit Tigers Prediction 

Detroit was able to get the win in game one of this series with an outstanding pitching performance, and they continue to make a push in the AL Wild Card race. The Tigers are 38-35 at home, while the Orioles are 41-32 on the road this year. Baltimore has lost five of their last six games and they are fading in the AL East. The O’s are going with Corbin Burnes, who has been outstanding in his last few starts. Detroit hasn’t announced a starting pitcher yet, but it could be Ty Madden. The Tigers have had great pitching this season, regardless if they go with a starting pitcher or a bullpen game, but this Orioles lineup is not easy to navigate. I think Burnes will continue his dominance here and I like Baltimore -1.5 in this game.
