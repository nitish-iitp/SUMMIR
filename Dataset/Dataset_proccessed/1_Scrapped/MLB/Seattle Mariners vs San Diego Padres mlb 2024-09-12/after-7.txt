SEATTLE MARINERS

Seattle Mariners starting pitcher Bryan Woo was stylin' and profilin' when he took the mound in Wednesday's 5-2 win over the San Diego Padres.

The right-hander donned a pair of Nike cleats customized to feature wrestling legend Ric Flair, whose signature catchphrase matches his last name.

WOO!!<br><br>Mariners pitcher Bryan Woo's custom Ric Flair cleats go way too hard 😤💪 <a href="https://t.co/tdeTM0ZEkg">pic.twitter.com/tdeTM0ZEkg</a>

True to form, Woo applied the figure-four leglock to San Diego's offense. He allowed two earned runs and struck out five batters in 6.2 innings of work.

Singles from Cal Raleigh and Luke Raley put Seattle up 3-0 in the third and then J.P. Crawford hit a two-run double to pad the home team's lead in the sixth. The Padres got two runs in the seventh courtesy of a Fernando Tatis Jr. home run and an RBI single from Xander Bogaerts. But the Mariners' bullpen shut the door from there.

Wednesday's performance added to an excellent season so far from Woo. He's 8-2 with a 2.38 ERA and a 3.35 FIP in 19 starts. His 156 ERA+ is by far the highest among Seattle's regular starters, per Baseball Reference.

As one of the best heels in the business, Flair reveled in getting one over on his opponents and their fans. The WWE Hall of Famer would certainly be proud of how Woo has consistently stymied opposing batters this year.
