Today's Rays vs Padres predictions are based on world-class modelling and betting expertise to give you the best possible advice every time.

Making use of the edges seen on Stats Insider is pivotal to being profitable in the long run.

Even though the Rays are more likely to cover the line, our best bet of Padres -1.5 is based on the chance of that happening, as projected by our predictive analytics model, and the best odds available.

Furthermore, despite the Under being more likely to hit in this game, Over 8.5 is our best bet because of the better odds ($1.91) that are available from TAB.
