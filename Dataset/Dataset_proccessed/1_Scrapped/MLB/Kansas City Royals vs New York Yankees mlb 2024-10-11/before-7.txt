Benches cleared during the bottom of the sixth inning of ALDS Game 4 between the New York Yankees and Kansas City Royals at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City, Mo. on Thursday.

The Royals had a runner on first with nobody out and Michael Massey at the plate in the bottom of the sixth trailing the Yankees 3-0. Massey hit a ground ball to first baseman Jon Berti, who stepped on first for the out and threw to second in an attempt for a double play.

Yankees shortstop Anthony Volpe tagged out Maikel Garcia for the double play. Things got a little tense due to Volpe tagging Garcia multiple times to ensure he had the out. Volpe then patted Garcia on the back to signal that all was good, but Garcia still was staring down the Yankees over the extra contact. Yankees third baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. came over to investigate, and then players from both benches and bullpens came over.

The entire issue was quickly defused and turned out to be much a fuss about nothing. But the matter showed that when it comes to the playoffs, the players are dialed in and not messing around.

The Yankees went into the game leading the series 2-1.
