Tampa Bay Rays vs Philadelphia Phillies Prediction 

Philadelphia is coming off of an interesting series split with the Marlins, but they have played very well over the last few weeks. The Phillies are 47-25 at home this year, while the Rays are 34-34 on the road. Tampa Bay has struggled to score runs this year, but they did enough to take two out of three against the Orioles over the weekend. The Phillies have a much better starting pitcher and they have been great at home, so I am taking them to win by at least two runs.
