Chicago, which has the worst record in baseball at 31-101 and is 4-30 since the All-Star break, is looking to end a four-game winless streak.

The Rangers entered the first game of the three-game series with a two-game losing streak.

TRAINER’S ROOM

Rangers: RHP Jacob deGrom (elbow surgery) retired all six batters he faced in his second rehab start for Triple-A Round Rock on Tuesday night. The two-time Cy Young Award winner, who hasn’t thrown a pitch in the majors since April 28, 2023, struck out two while throwing 16 of 24 pitches for strikes. The plan was for deGrom to throw a maximum two innings or 40 pitches.

White Sox: 3B Yoan Moncada (adductor strain) and RHP Michael Soroka (shoulder strain) were scheduled to begin rehab assignments with Triple-A Charlotte on Tuesday. … The club added INF Jake Amaya to the active roster a day after claiming him off waivers from Houston and recalled RHP Prelander Berroa from Charlotte. INF Bryan Ramos was optioned to Triple-A and RHP John Brebbia was designated for assignment.
