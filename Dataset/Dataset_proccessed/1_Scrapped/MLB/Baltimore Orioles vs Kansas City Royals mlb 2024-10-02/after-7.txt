KANSAS CITY ROYALS
Bobby Witt Jr., Royals Applauded by Fans After Sweeping Orioles in 2024 MLB Playoffs

The Kansas City Royals finished off a two-game American League Wild Card Series sweep of the host Baltimore Orioles with a 2-1 victory on Wednesday evening.

After the game, the Royals social media trolled the Orioles with an homage to The Wire:

Kansas City Royals
@Royals

You come for the crown you best not miss.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HEYHEYHEYHEY?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#HEYHEYHEYHEY</a> <a href="https://t.co/JXadJiUjNc">https://t.co/JXadJiUjNc</a> <a href="https://t.co/r7yMaLbfrr">pic.twitter.com/r7yMaLbfrr</a>

Bobby Witt Jr.'s two-out infield RBI single, which scored Kyle Isbel, put Kansas City ahead 2-1 in the sixth inning. Witt's blazing speed proved to be the difference and helped vault the Royals to the AL Division Series, where they will meet the New York Yankees.

Kansas City got on the board in the first inning when Vinnie Pasquantino's RBI single scored Michael Massey.

Royals starter Seth Lugo cruised through the first four innings but got in trouble in the fifth when Cedric Mullins led off with a homer to tie the game at one.

Baltimore Orioles
@Orioles

ENTERTAIN US, CEDRIC MULLINS <a href="https://t.co/vMvkJTc4Tx">pic.twitter.com/vMvkJTc4Tx</a>

A Ramón Urías single and a Gunnar Henderson walk put two runners on before Lugo committed an error on a bunt attempt from Jordan Westburg, loading the bases with no one out.

Lugo got Anthony Santander to pop out before Angel Zerpa took over. The Orioles' rally died after Colton Cowser struck out and Adley Rutschman grounded out.

The Royals bullpen dominated the Baltimore lineup, throwing 4.2 shutout innings while allowing just one hit and one walk while striking out six. It continued a phenomenal stretch from the relievers.

Going back to September 21st, the Royals bullpen has allowed 14 hits and one earned run in their last 40 innings.<br><br>Read that again.

Lucas Erceg got his second save in as many nights, striking out Henderson to end the game.

Silence the noise. 🤫<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HEYHEYHEYHEY?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#HEYHEYHEYHEY</a> <a href="https://t.co/gy0G7FFpdW">pic.twitter.com/gy0G7FFpdW</a>

The result certainly excited Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who is also part of the Royals' ownership group.

Mahomes was also impressed with Witt's wheels.

The 24-year-old Witt just enjoyed a phenomenal season that included an MLB-high .332 batting average and 211 hits. Witt amassed 32 home runs and 109 RBI while stealing 31 bases and scoring 125 runs. He posted a .977 OPS, and his 9.4 WAR (wins above replacement) was good enough for second in the American League, per Baseball-Reference.

And now he's excelling in the playoffs. Witt was also responsible for Game 1's lone run thanks to a sixth-inning RBI single that scored Maikel Garcia.

Bobby Witt Jr. joins Jimmie Foxx as the only players in AL/NL history to drive in the game-winning run in each of their first two career <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Postseason?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Postseason</a> games.<br><br>(H/T <a href="https://twitter.com/EliasSports?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EliasSports</a>) <a href="https://t.co/gIAZMFxqq7">pic.twitter.com/gIAZMFxqq7</a>

@SlangsOnSports

at 24 years &amp; 110 days, Bobby Witt Jr. is the 2nd-youngest player in postseason history to have a go-ahead hit in the 6th for later in consecutive postseason games, older than only:<br><br>Cody Bellinger in 2017 WS G4-5 (22y, 107-108d)<br><br>h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/EliasSports?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EliasSports</a>

The lights aren't too bright at all for the superstar in his first-ever playoff appearance, and Witt (and the rest of the Royals) got much-deserved love on social media.

Bobby Witt Jr. is becoming one of my favourite players to watch.

One team had Bobby Witt Jr. and the other didn't.

Bobby Witt Jr. might just be carving himself into baseball legend. The Royals were VERY smart to sign him long term. <a href="https://t.co/GaNraETSCt">https://t.co/GaNraETSCt</a>

Bobby Witt Jr is the best player in baseball

Bobby Witt Jr tryna get to the World Series

@Hockfan445

Bobby Witt Jr. is an incredible player. He drove in the go-ahead run in both games of his 1st career postseason series.

@YaBoyyyJohn

The Royals are a very good team with really good starting pitching in Cole Ragans and Seth Lugo in particular. Lucas Erceg is elite out of their bullpen, Bobby Witt Jr. is a flat out superstar, Vinnie Pasquantino is criminally underrated, and Salvy is still very good and owns us

The way I see it the <a href="https://twitter.com/Royals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Royals</a> are playing on house money right now so just enjoy the moment and let's have some fun Kansas City.

@rosestreakks

Baseball Samurai
@LKRWS

The Kansas City Royals are the first team in MLB history to lose 100 games in one season, then win a playoff series the year later…If you fall get back up and keep fighting

The Royals will now travel to New York to begin the best-of-five ALDS. Game 1 will be at Yankee Stadium on Saturday at 6:38 p.m. ET.
