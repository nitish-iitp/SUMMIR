The following is a complete list of every new TV and streaming episode, special, movie, and more airing on September 11, 2023. New streaming titles are listed first, followed by an hour-by-hour network TV and cable schedule, and ending with the day’s sports schedule. For sports and most other live programming, make sure to adjust the time to your time zone (times listed are Eastern/Central). Series and season premieres are in bold.
