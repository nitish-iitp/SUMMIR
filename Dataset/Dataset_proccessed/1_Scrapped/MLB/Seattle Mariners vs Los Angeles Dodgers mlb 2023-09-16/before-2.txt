Dana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), opened up about the recent death of both his parents during an interview with Piers Morgan released on Thursday.

White, 54, had not yet revealed the passing of his estranged parents and does not like to speak about them, but he humored Morgan when asked if their soured relationship helped drive him to become successful.

"I would say yes, absolutely," White said. "My relationship with my parents has definitely made me who I am today in many different ways. Not just in life and in business, but as a father too. So, I wouldn't change my upbringing, not one thing about it. I wouldn't change any of it."

White then dropped the bombshell about his parents recently dying, shocking Morgan and viewers alike, but not as much as when he admitted to having "almost no feelings" about their death.

"I'm good with it, I'm good with everything," White said. "I focus a lot on my kids and my relationship with them, and I've sort of put my relationship with my parents behind me. I didn't wish any ill will on either one of my parents, but no, when they passed away I had almost no feelings about it, to be honest with you."
