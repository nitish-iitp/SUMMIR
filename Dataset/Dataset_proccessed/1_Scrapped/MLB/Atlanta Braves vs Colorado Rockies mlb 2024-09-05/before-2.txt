Stats Insider's Braves vs Rockies betting tips are based on complex modelling and wagering intelligence to give you the best possible advice 24/7/365.

Making use of the edges published here at Stats Insider is one of the keys to being a profitable punter in the long run.

Even though the Braves are more likely to cover the line, our best bet of Rockies +1.5 is based on the probability of that happening, as suggested by our predictive analytics model, and the best odds available.

Furthermore, despite the Over being more likely to hit in this game, Under 8.5 is our best bet due to the better odds ($1.91) that are available from TAB.
