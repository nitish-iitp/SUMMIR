NEW YORK (AP) — Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte was scratched from Sunday’s game against the New York Yankees because of an illness.

Marte was in Arizona’s original lineup as the leadoff hitter, then was scratched shortly before the scheduled first pitch. Arizona moved catcher Gabriel Moreno to the leadoff spot and Geraldo Perdomo from shortstop to second.
