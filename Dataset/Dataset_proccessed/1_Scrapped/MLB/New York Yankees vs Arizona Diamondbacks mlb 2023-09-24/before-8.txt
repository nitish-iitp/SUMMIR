Florida Gators wide receiver Ricky Pearsall Jr. made an incredible, one-handed catch halfway through the first quarter of their 22-7 home victory over the Charlotte 49ers that reminded fans of Odell Beckham Jr.

Pearsall, 22, made the reception from quarterback Graham Mertz. The WR did not even flinch as three defenders closed in on him in a flash, holding on to the ball for a new set of downs.

That catch allowed Pearsall to finish the contest with a game-high 104 receiving yards on just six catches, but did not score a TD.

Mertz, 22, threw for 259 yards and a touchdown on 20-for-23 completed passes, including the wild catch.

Odell Beckham Jr. catch

Beckham, 30, is always mentioned when a player makes an incredible, one-handed catch, as this was not the exception.

"The catch" OBJ made was in a loss to the Dallas Cowboys when he played for the New York Giants in 2014.

Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver George Pickens recently made a similar reception during Thursday Night Football against the Cleveland Browns.
