Tigers-Dodgers Series Finale Delayed By Giant Bubble & Flying Goose At Dodger Stadium

The Los Angeles Dodgers had their five-game winning streak snapped with a 4-2 loss to the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday, but the series finale at Dodger Stadium nevertheless featured a couple of memorable moments.

With the Dodgers trailing 1-0 in the top of the third, Bobby Miller stepped off the mound as a giant bubble floated over the outfield. Umpires would not allow play to resume despite James Outman informing them it was just a bubble and signaling for the game to pick back up.

It almost immediately popped, but still captured the attention of nearly everyone in the ballpark.

Then in the bottom of the seventh inning with David Peralta up at the plate, a flying goose briefly delayed the game as it circled around Dodger Stadium to loud cheers. Peralta called time after fouling off a pitch from Miguel Díaz that nearly hit the goose earlier in the at-bat.

The incident brought back memories of the Dodgers’ National League Division Series Game 2 matchup against the San Diego Padres last year when a goose landed just behind second base while Gavin Lux was batting in the eighth inning.

The goose remained settled into shallow right field as Lux roped a single down the line and Trayce Thompson walked. A wild chase then ensued as the goose flew away and landed near the Dodgers’ on-deck circle.

When the grounds crew got close to the bird, it flew away again and landed to the right of third base. The goose was eventually captured in a trash can and taken off the field before becoming a rallying cry for the Padres in their NLDS upset.

Dodgers celebrate Miguel Cabrera

The Dodgers’ series against the Tigers gave them one final opportunity to see Miguel Cabrera as a visiting player, and they recognized the future Hall of Famer during a pregame ceremony on Monday.

Brusdar Graterol, J.D. Martinez, Miguel Rojas and Peralta represented the Dodgers in presenting a Hollywood Star to Cabrera and donation for his Miggy Foundation. “It was pretty special,” Rojas said of being part of the ceremony.

“Especially being a Venezuelan baseball player and knowing what Miguel Cabrera accomplished, the way he started his career really young and being 40 years old, to accomplish what he did throughout his career, he deserved that.

“He’s been one of the best hitters in our generation and he’s going to forever be remembered as one of the best hitters to ever play this game. I’m really happy Miggy is getting recognized by everybody. He deserves it. I’m so happy and proud to be Venezuelan, because I know he’s going into the Hall of Fame. And I’m happy to say Miguel Cabrera is my friend.”
