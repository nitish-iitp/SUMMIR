Aaron Judge Homers as Yankees Inch Closer to World Series Berth

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - OCTOBER 15: Aaron Judge #99 of the New York Yankees rounds the bases after hitting a two-run home run in the seventh inning against the Cleveland Guardians during Game Two of the American League Championship Series at Yankee Stadium on October 15, 2024 in New York City.

The New York Yankees are closing in on their first World Series appearance in 15 years. And they can thank slugger Aaron Judge, who has finally shaken off the cobwebs of his October swoon, crushing a two-run homer in the Yankees 6-3 win over the Cleveland Guardians at Yankee Stadium.

Through two games of this American League Championship Series, it has been a total mismatch. While the Yankees haven’t been clicking on all cylinders, they are doing just enough to beat a Cleveland team that can’t get out of its own way.

No better example than in the bottom of the first inning of Game 2 when Cleveland’s Bryan Rocchio dropped a pop-up by Judge, allowing Gleyber Torres to score the game’s first run.

That was only the beginning of the Yankees onslaught. Alex Verdugo’s RBI double and Judge’s sac fly in the second inning made it 3-0 Yankees as the Bronx was getting ready to erupt.

Finally, in the bottom of the seventh inning, Judge ripped the proverbial roof of the ‘House that Jeter Built’ when he crushed a two-run bomb to Monument Park in dead center to make it 6-2.

And don’t say that Mets fans are the only ones who know how to party on a home run. Yankee Stadium exploded with jubilation when Judge’s ball went past the outstretched glove of Cleveland center fielder Lane Thomas.

On the hill, Gerrit Cole did just enough to help win the game for the Yanks. As has been the case for much of the season for Cole since coming off the I.L., he struggled with control but was still effective enough. He held the Guardians to a pair of runs on six hits while walking four and striking out four. He lasted only 4.1 innings.

The Yankees bullpen, on the other hand, continues to be very effective. Clay Holmes got the victory as he continues to succeed in his new role. Tim Hill and Tommy Kahnle were excellent in the seventh and eighth innings, and Luke Weaver, despite giving up a run, closed the door on Cleveland.

NEXT:

The Bombers hit the road for Cleveland with Game 3 set for Thursday night. Clarke Schmidt is expected to get the ball for the Yankees, against Matthew Boyd. First pitch is at 5:08.

MUST-READ BOOKS BEHIND 7 OF YOUR FAVORITE MOVIES & TV SHOWS 

If there’s something here you decide you just must have, we’ve provided links to the product websites.  When you click on the link and make a purchase, Beasley Media Group may earn a commission. We are an Amazon Associate and earn from qualifying purchases. 

Ever watched a movie or TV show and found yourself wanting for more? Or ever have a friend says, “It’s not as good as the books!” This is because many of our favorite on-screen stories are based on must-read books! If you feel like 2 hours or 3 seasons are not enough for you, you can read the books to satisfy your curiosity and to know more about the characters you have come to love. 

Aside from the above-mentioned, there are other reasons why sometimes, the books are always better such as:  

Unlimited Imagination 

In books, you are the casting director, the line producer, and the cinematographer. You can imagine the scenes without worrying about the budget. Unlike in movies or TV shows where the books are adapted based on the movie’s budget or interpretation of the director. The bias of the director affects the way the books are translated into the silver or big screen. 

Deeper Character Development

Since books are not restricted to a run time, books dive deep into characters’ thoughts, emotions and backstories. This is the reason why book fans turn into rabid fans when their favorite characters aren’t fleshed out in the movies or TV shows, or a significant plot point wasn’t included. Sometimes, it’s even obvious that the actors and actresses have not read the source material, aka the must-read books, making the fans more furious. 

Richer World Building

Books literally have the pages to create intricate worlds with history and culture that adaptations often have to exclude. You can get lost in the world of a book in a way that movies or TV shows rarely allow. 

Pacing and Detail

Books let you enjoy every detail at your own pace. You can linger on a page, or a plot point for as long as you like, unlike in movies and TV shows where details are often rushed to fit a limited runtime.  

Subplots and Side Characters

Due to the limited runtime, adaptations often cut characters or simplify subplots to streamline the story. In books, these elements add complexity, giving the story more depth.

Faithfulness to the Source Material

How many TV shows and movies have been accused of not being faithful to the source material? Adaptations often change or omit key elements, leaving out details that made the book or source material special in the first place. 

Emotional Connection

The time you spend reading a book often creates a deeper emotional connection with the characters and the story. The journey through a novel can make the highs more exhilarating and the lows more heartbreaking, something that’s hard to emulate in a two-hour movie or a season of TV (that’s why these must-read books are better!)

Inner Monologues

Books let you into characters’ minds, providing inner monologues and thoughts that give you a deeper understanding of their motivations and conflicts. Adaptations often lose this internal perspective, relying on dialogue and action to convey what’s going on since watching a character have an inner monologue is boring in movies or TV shows.  

Room for Interpretation

Books allow for more personal interpretation. Without the visual and auditory elements provided by movies and TV shows, readers are free to interpret scenes, character emotions, and even endings in their own way, creating a more personalized experience. Hello, fan fiction writers!

Timelessness

Some of the classic literature and must-read books are still relevant and widely read. While special effects in movies might become outdated and TV shows may suffer from dated cultural references, the written word remains timeless. 

The Lord Of The Rings By J.R.R. Tolkien

Dive into the epic fantasy world of Middle Earth with J.R.R. Tolkien’s legendary trilogy. The books offer an even deeper exploration of the characters, history, and intricate details of this beloved universe.

Gone Girl By Gillian Flynn

If you were captivated by the twists and turns of the Gone Girl movie (kudos to the casting director making Rosamund Pike as the lead), the book will take you on an even more thrilling ride. Gillian Flynn’s writing adds layers of depth to the characters and plot, making it a gripping page-turner you won’t be able to put down.

I Am Number Four By Pittacus Lore

This is one of the movies based on a book I’ve read that I feel robbed of, although Teresa Palmer’s portrayal of Number Six is total badass. The book series follows John Smith, an alien teenager on the run from intergalactic enemies. The movie captured the action, but the book delves deeper into John’s struggle to blend in while discovering his extraordinary powers.

Twilight By Stephenie Meyer

If you were swept away by the romance between Bella Swan and Edward Cullen in the movies, you’ll find even more to love in the original Twilight series. While it’s rare for a movie to be better than the book, there’s one exception in Breaking Dawn Part 2—the faceoff between the Volturi and Team Cullen features a scene that shocked fans.
