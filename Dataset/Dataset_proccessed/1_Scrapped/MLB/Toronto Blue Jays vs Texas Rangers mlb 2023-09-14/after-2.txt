TORONTO – Robbie Grossman has spent most of the last decade in the major leagues. He has appeared in the postseason three times. He would like more.

He’s doing something about it.

The veteran outfielder/DH has emerged as a surprising catalyst for a Rangers offense that had stalled amid a rash of injuries. In the process, he’s gone from platoon player to a regular at the season’s most important time. Grossman began Thursday’s game slashing .323/.452/.613/1.065 in September. He had homers in consecutive games on Tuesday and Wednesday.

“This is a fun time of year to be playing important games,” Grossman said Thursday ahead of starting for the sixth consecutive game. “To be right in the middle of it is what you hope for. I’m having fun.”

Grossman will be tested over the final two-plus weeks of the season. A switch-hitter, he is historically far better against left-handed pitching than right-handed. Starting with Thursday’s game against Toronto’s Kevin Gausman, the Rangers were tentatively scheduled to face 10 consecutive right-handers if rotations hold up.

Grossman entered Thursday with a .565 OPS against right-handed starters this season, including a .268 OBP. Since August 1, though, thanks to good discipline at the plate, he’d posted a .361 OBP against right-handers.

“He hasn’t just done it with the bat,” manager Bruce Bochy said. “He’s just finding ways to get on base. It’s been quality at-bat after quality at-bat.”

Evan has covered the Rangers since 1997. He has twice been named one of the top 10 beat writers in the country by the AP Sports Editors. His passions outside of covering baseball are his wife, Gina, his two step kids, two crazy dogs & barbecue. Let's not discuss the cat. Evan graduated from Georgia State University, but oddly is a Georgia fan.
