MLB Playoffs 2024
Patrick Mahomes

Patrick Mahomes is all-in on the Kansas City Royals’ playoff run.

The Royals entered the fifth inning of Game 3 of their ALDS series against the New York Yankees trailing 2-0. But Kansas City quickly tied the game on Yankees starting pitcher Clarke Schmidt via an infield single by Adam Frazier, a double by Kyle Isbel, and then a triple by Michael Massey.

The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Mahomes was in attendance at the game wearing a custom-made “Mahomes” No. 15 Royals jersey. After Massey’s game-tying hit, the TBS broadcast showed Mahomes getting so hyped in the luxury box. Mahomes immediately got up in the face of his friend Gehrig Dieter, a big Yankees fan, and started talking some friendly smack to him.

Dieter is a former Chiefs wide receiver who won Super Bowl LIV alongside Mahomes before retiring in 2022. He was named after Yankees icon Lou Gehrig, so needless to say, his allegiances run deep.

As for Mahomes, his father was a former MLB pitcher and he himself played baseball through his sophomore year at Texas Tech. Several years ago, the three-time Super Bowl MVP Mahomes also pulled a notable business move with the Royals.
