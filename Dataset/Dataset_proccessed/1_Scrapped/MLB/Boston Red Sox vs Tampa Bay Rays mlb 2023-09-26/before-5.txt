NFL. Bucs lose despite WR Mike Evans' circus catch, CB Dee Delaney's elite INT
NFL. Eagles fans conjure conspiracy theory to cope with Taylor Swift dating Travis Kelce

Philadelphia Eagles superfan Bradley Cooper visited Raymond James Stadium for a Monday Night Football clash against Tom Brady's former team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which is relevant because the two men are currently involved in a sort of love triangle with Irina Shayk.

Cooper, 48, invaded Brady's old stomping grounds and posed for a photo alongside Eagles tackle Lane Johnson, who shared the moment on social media after his team's road victory.

"To a night we will never forget," Johnson captioned the post, along with an eagle emoji.

Johnson, 33, seemingly met Cooper somewhere in the locker room area, possibly right by where Brady celebrated his seventh Super Bowl ring.

Philadelphia defeated Tampa Bay 25-11 and the crowd at Raymond James Stadium, including Cooper, made it feel like a home game for the Eagles.

Does Bradley Cooper like Tom Brady?

Shayk, 37, has a child with Cooper and is currently casually dating Brady, but reportedly would still want to marry the actor if he so chooses.

Brady, 46, is coming off a divorce late last year from Gisele Bundchen, with whom he shares two children, so the retired NFL quarterback isn't looking for anything serious.

As far Cooper's relationship with Brady, the actor reportedly respects him, and only cares about Shayk being happy.

Cooper and Shayk were present at US Bank Stadium in 2017 for Super Bowl LII to witness the Eagles defeat Brady's New England Patriots.
