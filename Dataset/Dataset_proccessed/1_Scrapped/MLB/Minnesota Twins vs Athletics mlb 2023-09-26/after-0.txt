The 2023 MLB regular season officially ended yesterday (Sunday, October 1). That means that we are now ready for the beginning of the 2023 MLB Postseason.


The postseason will start with four best-of-three Wild Card series, featuring all three Wild Card winners vs. the team that won their division and did not earn a first-round bye.


ESPN platforms will exclusively televise the 2023 MLB Wild Card Series, with games beginning tomorrow (Tuesday, October 3), with action on ABC, ESPN2 and ESPN.


Tuesday's Wild Card Series action begins at 3 p.m. (ET) on ABC with Game 1 of the series in the American League, as Marcus Semien and the Texas Rangers (No. 5 seed) visit Wander Franco and the Tampa Bay Rays (No. 4 seed), from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. The winner of this Wild Card Series will face off with Cedric Mullins and the No. 1 seed Baltimore Orioles in the ALDS. Longtime play-by-play commentator Sean McDonough will provide commentary, with analysts Jessica Mendoza and Tim Kurkjian, alongside reporter Coley Harvey. McDonough, Mendoza, Kurkjian & Harvey will be on the call for the entire Texas-Tampa Bay Wild Card series, including Game 2 & Game 3, if needed.


Later that afternoon, Carlos Correa and the AL Central champion Minnesota Twins (No. 3 seed) host Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and the Toronto Blue Jays (No. 6 seed) in Game 1 of their best-of-three series from Target Field in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The winning team from this series moves on to the ALDS to face Jose Altuve and the No. 2 seed Houston Astros. The game is scheduled to begin at 4:30 p.m. (ET) on ESPN. Michael Kay (play-by-play), Alex Rodriguez (analyst) & Alden González (reporter) take the call from Twin Cities. Kay, Rodriguez & González will also perform commentary for Game 2 and potential Game 3 as well.


In primetime on Tuesday night, the National League Wild Card series gets underway from American Family Field in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as Ketel Marte and the Arizona Diamondbacks (No. 6 seed) battle Christian Yelich and the NL Central champion Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the best-of-three Wild Card series. The winner faces Mookie Betts and the No. 2 seed Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLDS and the loser's postseason is done. The game, which will start at 7 p.m. (ET) on ESPN2, features Jon "Boog" Sciambi (play-by-play), Doug Glanville (analyst) & Jesse Rogers (reporter) on hand to describe the action. Sciambi, Glanville & Rogers will also cover Game 2 & if necessary, Game 3 of this particular series.


The final Wild Card Series begins on Tuesday night at 8 p.m. (ET) on ESPN, when Bryson Stott and the Philadelphia Phillies (No. 4 seed) hosts Jazz Chisholm Jr. and the Miami Marlins (No. 5 seed) for the opening game of this best-of-three series to determine which team faces off with Ronald Acuna Jr. and the NL's top seed, the Atlanta Braves, in the NLDS. The "Sunday Night Baseball" team of play-by-play announcer Karl Ravech, analysts David Cone and Eduardo Pérez, and reporter Buster Olney narrate from action from Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Ravech, Cone, Perez & Olney return for Game 2 & a potential Game 3 as well.


Then on Wednesday, all four series will have a Game 2, with Rangers-Rays on ABC at 3:00 PM (ET), Blue Jays-Twins on ESPN at 4:30 PM (ET), Diamondbacks-Brewers on ESPN2 at 7:00 PM (ET) & Marlins-Phillies on ESPN at 8:00 PM (ET).


If needed, the potential Game 3 for each series will be contested on Thursday afternoon/night, more details to be provided at a later time.

@Mark T. Joe Davis, John Smoltz & Ken Rosenthal are on the call for the Orioles vs. Rays/Rangers ALDS on FOX/FS1. Adam Amin, AJ Pierzynski, Adam Wainwright & Tom Verducci are on the call for the Astros vs. Twins/Blue Jays ALDS on FOX/FS1. Not sure about the NLDS announcers for TBS yet.

Tamir's Message to All Blog Readers
Hello, everybody! Thank you so much for taking some time out of your day to come visit tamirmoore.blogspot.com. Before you read and/or comment on any articles that I write about various sports that I cover (MLB, NBA, NHL, WNBA, college sports, etc.), I invite you to take a moment to read my mission statement for this website. This website, tamirmooreblogspot.com, was primarily designed by me to provide me a place to produce regular articles regarding sports, a particular aspect of life that I enjoy and spend a lot of my free time covering/watching. Writing is something that I has always loved to do since I was a little kid. And this blog was the perfect platform to share my immeasurable love for sports with all of you. With that in mind, I personally invite you to take the time to go through the various articles that I wrote throughout the course of this blog's history (2015-present). If you read a particular article and find something of interest to you, please do not hesitate to leave a comment on that article! Furthermore, all comments on this website have to be approved by me before I permit the comments to be posted for the entire website community to see. The reason for this is because people assume that this blog is like a sound-off box, meaning that you can basically say whatever comes to mind without any rational thinking or consideration whatsoever. Make sure you carefully think about your comments and the impact that remark could have not only on you, but the other blog readers. If you guys have any prevalent comments or concerns about this website, please contact me as soon as possible by either writing a comment on the article itself that you are reading or by email: tamirkmoore14@gmail.com. However, I will not tolerate any form or disrespectful behavior or unfair/unjust vitriol criticism on this website at all. If you say something towards me (or fellow blog readers) directly or indirectly that is considered hostile or inappropriate for the particular discussion on a article page, you will face severe consequences including being banned for visiting and commenting for this website. These consequences will be strictly enforced, so think twice before you make a mindless decision. In simple words, if you make appropriate, relevant, and respectful comments on here, then I have no problem with that. Plus, please stay on-topic as much as possible. It is okay to go off-topic depending on the type of material that you are talking about. Thank you! And I hope that enjoy reading and commenting on this website! Have a great day! - Tamir Moore, Administrator & Author of tamirmooreblogspot.com
