Julian Aguiar


Today will be just the 4th start in the big leagues for Aguiar. The first two starts were solid, but the last time out Oakland scored six runs on 10 hits – including three home runs – against him in just four innings pitched.

This season Aguiar has pitched much better against right-handed hitters. While he’s not holding them to a much lower average, he’s walking them less and not allowing them to hit for nearly as much power. Lefties are doing better across the board and have twice as many home runs against him as righties do.

Justin Verlander


Injuries have kept Verlander off of the mound a bit this season. He didn’t make his first start until the third week of the season, and then he missed nearly all of June before also missing all of July and the first three weeks of August. He’s made just two starts since his return and allowed six runs in 10.0 innings while facing the Red Sox and Phillies.

Right-handed hitters have been more successful against Verlander this year. They are hitting for a far higher average and that’s helping them carry a higher on-base percentage and slugging percentage. Lefties are walking more and making contact at a similar rate, but they aren’t hitting for much average. And they’ve got a weird set of power splits with seven home runs, but just one double and one triple.

News and Notes

Blake Dunn called up, Dominic Smith DFA’d

Cincinnati made two roster moves prior to the game today. They called up Blake Dunn from Triple-A Louisville. He’s taking the spot on the 26-man roster of Dominic Smith, who has been designated for assignment. Dunn has hit .293/.367/.354 since August 1st for Louisville and has nine steals in that time. Smith has only spent 11 days with the Reds, but he went 5-26 (.192) during his time with the club.

Once again, the GM has to remove a player from the team that the manager kept playing, no matter how bad they were doing. (Moose/Renfroe/Bader/ now Dom Smith)

Smith as a pick up didn’t make sense to just about anybody.
Not as a current player for a playoff run.
Not as a player for the future either.

At least Renfroe/Bader were an attempt (very weak attempt) to add a player that at least had a little previous success.

RedsFanInFL 09/02/2024

Agree. It’s baffling how often this happens. I asked in yesterday’s game thread why Rosario was being taken out for Smith when Rosario hit an HR off a tightly the day before and had made good contact with a bade hit in Sunday’s game. Even the TV announcers seemed a little surprised.

RedsFanInFL 09/02/2024

HR off a righty

VaRedsFan 09/02/2024

Watching some Brew/Cards (only game on).
Brewer announcers said that before EVERY GAME, Brewer coaches go over pickoff moves of the pitchers that they will be facing.

Maybe Red’s coaches do this also. And it’s just not reported by any of the announcers, or Day, Lecure, Welsh, Brian G., or Annie.

The Brewers demonstrated that it’s possible to aggressive and smart baserunners at the same time.

DaveCT 09/02/2024

It’s been reported earlier this year by the broadcasters that the Reds are one of the few teams that have pre-game base running meetings before every game.

Objectively, the team approach for all guys they deem capable of stealing is to push the envelope of leads. Given the organizational philosophy of team speed, this is to be expected. That’s pretty much stating the obvious for all teams, but for a team emphasizing stolen bases as much as the Reds, it may be emphasized much more.

I think one thing we’ve seen this year is the very different aptitudes of players in stealing not to mention base running. In other words, it may not be all coaching. It may mean some of our guys just aren’t very good base runners, be it because of internal clock, acceleration/burst, awareness, age/inexperience, etc.

.

VaRedsFan 09/02/2024

There’s a great documentary on MLB Network about Greg Maddux.
Highly recommended.

LDS 09/02/2024

Probably called Dunn up to keep Hinds company on the bench

Jim Walker 09/02/2024

+500. Did you lift this thought off my X account?

https://twitter.com/jn_walkerjr/status/1830691852594635006

LDS 09/02/2024

No, I don’t have a Twitter account. It is however an obvious question.

Anthony 09/02/2024

Sad yet Funny how Dom Smith went from VET SAVIOR…to DFA so quickly. Following in the footsteps of Will Myers, Hunter Renfroe, Mike Ford, Austin Slater and soon Ty France if there were any players left to fill our roster. ..Guys who the mainstream rhetoric excited the casual fan only because the name was somewhat familiar but were all done woth mlb glory

Jim Walker 09/02/2024

The timing of this move struck me as a bit curious. Unless the rules have changed and I missed it, because he was let go after 1 September, he is not playoff eligible for any team that may pick him up now. This may well impact his ability to hook up with another team.

VaRedsFan 09/02/2024

JV walks the 1st 3 batters for the first time in his career.
TJ Sac Fly
France – 2 out rbi single.

That seems better than average for this team to get 2.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

I call that an awesome start !

DaveCT 09/02/2024

I like Ty France. He can make good baseball plays. He’s slso faced Verlander a ton while with Seattle.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Lineup looking much better today than two days ago, but we are facing Verlander, who while he has seen limited action this year, he’s still Verlander. I hope the Reds get to him early !

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Houston goes down in order in the top of the 2nd, 2-0 Reds.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

India keeps things alive with a base hit, 2 down, and Elly at the plate… But Verlander gets him to fly out after going 1-2 with two curve balls in the zone.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Heyward keeping the at bat alive by swinging at two balls out of the zone, and then takes ball 4 inside.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

McCormick doubles putting men on 2nd and 3rd, no outs.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Aguiar gets Altuve to ground out to short, 1 down.

Ksdavis 09/02/2024

And the Astros didn’t go on contact on a ball hit right to the shortstop

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

The Bases are loaded… and Y Diaz singles home two, score tied at 2 a piece.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Aguiar pitched one up and zone … needed to keep it low to get a dbl play.

Frankie Tomatoes 09/02/2024

Andrew are you auditioning for John Sadaks job?

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Just wanted to keep things moving. I get into the game this way.

Frankie Tomatoes 09/02/2024

Not that there is a lot of conversation today with people likely out on the grill (I have steaks ready to go in about 45 minutes!) but just giving a play by play really hampers any ability to follow the conversations that otherwise would be happening.

Everyone reading this thread is already following the game and knows what is happening.

VaRedsFan 09/02/2024

Agree Frankie.

DaveCT 09/02/2024

Agreed, Frankie. Andrew, it may be good for you. It is not necessarily good for others. It’d be best to refrain. No offense. Perhaps you could do this on social media instead?

Hanginwithem 09/02/2024

Thanks, Frankie

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Now first and second at the top of the third, men on 1st and 2nd with two outs.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

And Sam Moll replaces Aguiar with Singleton at the plate…

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Interesting that Bell let him pitch to Pena, but pulls him with two outs and Singleton at the plate.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Friedl, Stephenson, and Steer to lead off for the Reds 3rd… We need to get some back !

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Stephenson, Friedl, and Steer, sorry about that.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Umpire corrected on his missed call on the first pitch.

DW 09/02/2024

Oh good…he is managing the third inning like it is the 7-9th again. Great opportunity for a young starter to get some important experience, but no. He still thinks playoffs are probable enough I guess.

Doug Gray 09/02/2024

Aguiar, in his early 20’s, is pitching on short rest. He was never going deep in this game. In fact, we should probably be questioning the stupidity of starting him today. The Reds are like 16 games out of first place and they started Aguiar on short rest.

DW 09/02/2024

I didn’t realize he was on short rest. That does make a difference and a bit more sense. I still would have liked to have seen him given the chance to battle through it, and finish the inning, though.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Stephenson on first with one out…

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Steer takes the count full, but can’t do anything with a fastball, 2 outs.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

France doubles, it’s now up to Fraley with men on second and third with two outs.

Mound visit with the count 2-2… Fraley goes the other way, but grounds out to short.

Frankie Tomatoes 09/02/2024

Would have been huge to have gotten a hit with two guys in scoring position there against Verlander. The Reds already in the bullpen and could have used the breathing room.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Sam Moll gets the first two in the top of the 4th, Heyward now up.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Four Sweepers to Heyward, count 1-2, and he gets the groundout to end the Astro 4th.

VaRedsFan 09/02/2024

I sometimes dream that Lodolo will one day throw a back door slider like the one Moll just threw.

Lodolo has the skill to make it curve that much, but doesn’t seem to use it.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Verlander vs. Espinal … He gets ahead with two fastballs, and strikes him out on a slider down and away. 1 out.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Rosario singles, and India lines out, 2 down.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Elly shows good discipline and gets a walk… runners on 1st and 2nd.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

3 pitches close to the zone, and then Stephenson misses another one out of the zone for Strike three. Verlander is tough.

Jim Walker 09/02/2024

I do believe Verlander just pitched around EDLC even though it ultimately moved a runner into scoring position.

He then K’s Ty Steve making it a good move.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

We’re onto the top of the 5th with Spiers on the mound, score tied 2-2.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

And now 2 down with a strike out of Altuve…

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

3-2 to Alvarez, and he gets him with a sweeper … Spiers throws his balls way off, but comes in when he has to. 3 outs.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Verlander dispatches Friedl on 4 pitches… Whew, 1 down.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Steer gets a fastball to hit, but grounds to third, and France then singles on the first pitch…

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Verlander pitching away to Fraley… then gets a call in for Strike two, but he singles on the 6th pitch, moving France to Third. The killer F’s strike !

Jim Walker 09/02/2024

The more I see of Ty France the more I like him. He is under team control for 2025 but would cost a bundle as an arb eligible guy who is making $6m+ this year.

DaveCT 09/02/2024

Completely agree. I’ve watched France a bunch here on the Left Coast (PNW). He’s just a gamer. Plus, his ability to hit to right field in GABP, IMO, increases his value, whereas in Seattle’s T-Mobile Park, not so much. Getting guys like France, India, Steer, Espinal who can grind out at bats not only is important for run production (especially for the once and future big bats), but sets an excellent example for our youngsters. I’ll take Ty France as a corner guy/DH for 16 mil.

Jim Walker 09/02/2024

How many years for $16m? Got to be more than 1. I was thinking maybe 3 years at an AAV of $6m i.e. $18m guaranteed. Or maybe 2 yrs at $16m with a player opt out after 1. Make it $6m the 1st year but an additional $3m payout if opts out. That would guarantee him $9m for 1 year or $16m total if he stayed in.

DaveCT 09/02/2024

No clue, Jim. I actually misread your 6 mil for 16 mil. Shows what I know, lol.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Fraley steals second, 2-2 to Espinal… and Espy does it bringing in two ! Reds up 4-2.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

you know that 2-2-2 is a baseball jinx. You just saw it broken on a flair to right.

Frankie Tomatoes 09/02/2024

Just before friends are supposed to get here I got to see the Reds grab the lead! Enjoy the rest of the game everyone. It’s time for me to get these steaks on the grill and drink a few beers with my friends.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Ort replaces Verlander, but Rosario singles to bring in Espinal, who had stolen third.

Reds up 5-2.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

If memory serves, the Reds swept Houston around father’s day last year, in Houston. The press asked Dusty how that could happen, It just happens, was all Dusty could say. Houston went on the win the Division, but the Rangers won the world series.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

A double play erases the leadoff single, 2 down, Spiers on the mound.

GreatRedLegsFan 09/02/2024

Rosario, France and Espinal, all hitting the ball well from the right side. However, looking forward to 2025, there’s no apparent room in the roster for any of them as the IF, assuming everybody is back healthy, will be full with CES, India, McClain, Marte, EDLC and JC.

Ksdavis 09/02/2024

Everyone being healthy is the issue. Matt McClain was supposed to begin rehab two weeks ago – He has not started yet. Given Marte mental lapses and lackluster approach at times I wouldn’t necessarily expect him to be given the job. Unless the front office is bound and determined to prove that trade. I expect India to be moved. France if he can recapture his 21 and 22 offensive stats would make a good DH

DaveCT 09/02/2024

I think both Marte and CES start at AAA to regain their hitting strokes. Let them hit their way back to the ML’s as they did a year ago.

Jim Walker 09/02/2024

Maybe somebody gets traded. Maybe some guys start the year at AAA.

Hard to think Espinal will not be (at least) the backup middle IF guy regardless.

Also, they subtly seem to be moving past Benson which could open 2 spots, one his, the other obligatory platoon parter required for him.

VaRedsFan 09/02/2024

You forgot Candy

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Spiers walks singleton, and is looking a bit shaky out there… and walks the next batter, men on 1st and 2nd. 2 outs.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

The Astros put up a left pinch hitter to face Spiers… and my internet connection went down. The Astro’s loaded the bases but failed to score in the 6th.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Ferguson in to pitch for Houston… Stephenson on first, 2 outs.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

And Steer goes down swinging for the third out. Reds up 5-2 after 6.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Spiers on the mound again for the Astro 7th…

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

I would have to wonder why after the last inning.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

first three outside the zone, and then walks Altuve on the 5th pitch.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Anybody up throwing in the bullpen ?

Doc 09/02/2024

Good thing Krall acquired France, Espinal and Rosario.

VaRedsFan 09/02/2024

Or what?
They might have finished last?

Jim Walker 09/02/2024

Hopefully, the guys who seem entitled as “regulars” are sitting up and taking note of those 3 not to mention Krall.

Harry Stoner 09/02/2024

And Smith and Buchanan and Ford and Martini and Wenzdel and Soto and Montas and Candelario and….

The front runners / second guessers always come out of the woodwork when some gets a hit.

And conveniently forget trying to run Espinal out of town on a rail earlier in the season.

Rob 09/02/2024

They were free, waiver wire guys. He is All In on those type guys. Cheap and free gets his attention.
But get somebody a level better than that requiring your #14 prospect in exchange, and that never happens.

Just look at the small market Royals and Brewers in comparison. Both give up prospects in exchange for Lorenzen and Montas as to bolster their pitching depth down the stretch. We trade away a #4 starter rather than acquiring one. Not an endorsement of Frankie’s financial value; just saying he could be pitching 6 innings of 3-4 run baseball every fifth day. Seems like we would pay a fortune for that a couple of weeks ago. But we got guys like Kelly and Buchanan who we DFA after 1 performance.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Full count to Alvarez and he doubles, men on 2nd and 3rd, no outs.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

no, one out.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Pagan comes on to face Y. Diaz…

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Diaz brings in one with a sac fly… score now 5-3. 2 outs.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Pagan firing away with 3 straight fast balls … and gets Pena for out number 3.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

France, Fraley, and Espinal to lead things off for the Reds in the bottom of the 7th.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

France singles, Fraley lines to short, and Espinal singles; men on first and second one out.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

and a wild pitch moves the runners up to 2nd and 3rd… but Rosario goes down on strikes, 2 outs.

Oldtimer 09/02/2024

Reds playing well today. Except for Friday night, they have played well all weekend.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

India takes ball 4 on a 3-2 count loading the bases for Elly.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

But he goes down on a questionable call for strike three…

Onto the Astro’s half of the 8th.

magi210 09/02/2024

The Flex-O-Zone strikes again on Elly.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Pagan remains on the mound for the 8th…

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

and gets Singleton to fly out for the first out in the 8th.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

followed by two quick outs by Gamel, and Whitcomb. no runs, no hits, no errors in the Astro half.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Whitney on the mound to face Stephenson, Friedl, and Steer for the Reds’ 8th.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Friedl starts things off with single, one down.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

And the always dangerous Spencer Steer talks a walk.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Dunn replaced France (who had 4 hits on the day) as a pinch runner, and is now at the plate… I’m going to say that Dunn should have bunted there … but he goes down on strikes, with no dbl play.

Jim Walker 09/02/2024

So, is Dunn up with the Reds to hopefully play his way into useful trade fodder or for a real look at how he might fit with the Reds?

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

He needs to show something besides speed to play with the Redlegs.

Jim Walker 09/02/2024

He can’t be either getting caught looking at a 3-2 pitch like he just did.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Fraley takes the count to 3-2 with 2 on and 2 outs… Fouls off ball 4, and then strikes out swinging.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Who closes for the Reds today, that is the question.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

And Pagan was throwing hard so he’s back out there !

JB 09/02/2024

Just tuned in and Dunn is hitting. Hinds must be thinking wth do I have to do.

Jim Walker 09/02/2024

I’m wondering if the whole Dunn call up could have been because Hinds dinged himself on the game winning dash and dive into home plate Sunday; but, they don’t want to sit him down for the 10 day IL stint.

Doug Gray 09/02/2024

Hit better would be a good place to start.

Since July 19th he’s hitting .163/.246/.245 with 40 strikeouts in 110 plate appearances.

I just don’t understand the amount of people saying he needs to play more right now. He’s not slugging his body weight over the last six weeks.

Jim Walker 09/03/2024

Not disagreeing with you but why was he brought up ahead of Dunn and Wiemer in the first place then?

Doug Gray 09/03/2024

The day that the Reds called up Hinds, Wiemer was hitting .143/.250/.179 in 17 games since being acquired. So Hinds was hitting better, maybe?

Don’t really know why he got the call ahead of Dunn, who was hitting better. But perhaps it was something as simple as they wanted Dunn to keep his good streak going instead of sitting him on the bench – which is the role that they called Hinds up to fill. Of course a week later Dunn is now up in that same kind of role it would seem.

Jim Walker 09/02/2024

Something is not right with TJ Friedl.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Can you see it in how he moves ? He’s been on the IL three times this year.

Jim Walker 09/03/2024

Maybe he needs to be on the IL now instead of on the field. In the month plus 1 week since his latest return from the IL, his OPS is sub .700 (.675) with OPS in the mid 80’s.

Yes, he has made an outstanding catch or 2; but, he has looked uncharacteristically uncertain on many routine (for him) plays. He has missed on several balls which looked like plays he normally makes. He looks less than sure on virtually every ball hit his way that isn’t a moonball can of corn.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

Pagan featuring a splitter to Altuve, man on 2nd, one out. And Altuve is called out on a pitch middle-outside, like they usually do.

magi210 09/02/2024

I do not understand why Wilson needs to be in this ballgame.

H.B. 09/02/2024

If this doesn’t work Bell should be FIRED tomorrow. Bell sucks either way.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

They bring on Wilson to face the lefty Alvarez… one out to go.

Andrew Brewer 09/02/2024

they let Heyward take third… Wilson’s first two pitches are nowhere near the zone… and Alvarez lines out to Center, REDS WIN ! 5-3

Tom Diesman 09/02/2024

Thanks Andrew, best game thread here this season!

Harry Stoner 09/02/2024

True.

We didn’t miss your snarky bloviating at all.

People, we are not going to have this. Do not do this. It’s a future warning for everyone.

Doug Gray 09/02/2024

This feels incredibly uncalled for. You’re gonna have to sit on the sidelines for a few days for this.

Oldtimer 09/02/2024

Interesting trivia. Babe Ruth had more shutouts and more complete games in his career (5 or 6 years) as a Red Sox pitcher than Verlander has had in his career.

Votto4life 09/02/2024

That is interesting. I suppose Ruth’s accomplishments were in the dead ball era. May explain it a bit. Still impressive considering how much longer Verlander has pitched.

Christy Mathewson pitched 3 shutouts in the 1906 (I think) World Series. Doubt we will ever see that record broken.

Oldtimer 09/02/2024

Reds had Mathewson at the very beginning and then at the end of his career. He won 1 game as a Red.

December 15, 1900: Traded by the Cincinnati Reds to the New York Giants for Amos Rusie.

July 20, 1916: Traded by the New York Giants with Bill McKechnie and Edd Roush to the Cincinnati Reds for Buck Herzog and Red Killefer.

So that 1900 trade likely never happened. You can read about that here – https://www.redreporter.com/2016/12/23/14048650/did-the-reds-actually-trade-christy-mathewson

But the Reds DID have a young Babe Ruth and gave him back. So that’s fun.

Interesting. Baseball Reference should make a correction. I like the 2016 trade better. 3 HOF-ers to the Reds.
