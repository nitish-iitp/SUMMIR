Shifting to bullpen
Matz will be available out of the bullpen going forward from Sunday, Katie Woo of The Athletic reports.
Impact The left-hander returned from the 60-day IL as a starter Tuesday in Milwaukee and allowed three runs over 4.2 innings, but he'll be shifted to the bullpen with Lance Lynn (knee) on the cusp of rejoining St. Louis' rotation. Matz has a 6.12 ERA, 1.61 WHIP and 24:12 K:BB across 32.1 innings this season and is now likely to operate as a long reliever.

No-decision in return
Matz did not factor into the decision in Tuesday's 7-4 win against Milwaukee, allowing three runs on three hits and one walks over 4.2 innings. He struck out seven.
Impact In his first appearance since April 30 due to a back injury, Matz surprisingly flashed the ability to punch out hitters, posting a season-high seven strikeouts generated via a solid 14 whiffs. However, the veteran southpaw struggled to limit damage against the first-place Brewers, as all three hits he yielded went for extra bases (two home runs and one double). Prior to this outing, Matz had pitched to a 6.18 ERA, 1.73 WHIP and 24:12 K:BB across 32.1 innings this season, so this performance did represent progress despite his inability to escape the fifth inning. The 33-year-old's future in the rotation is uncertain as Lance Lynn (back) is on a rehab assignment and could overtake Matz's spot.

Drawing start Tuesday
Matz will start Tuesday's game in Milwaukee, Derrick Goold of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports.
Impact Matz was activated from the 60-day injured list Sunday and available out of the bullpen for the Cardinals' win over the Yankees. He was not used, however, and the team has opted to give him a spot start while they push other rotation members back. Matz seems likely to shift back to a relief role after Tuesday's outing, although it's possible he earns additional starts if he pitches well.

Activated, may fill bullpen role
The Cardinals reinstated Matz (back) from the 60-day injured list Sunday.
Impact Matz will rejoin the big club for the first time since early May after he completed a lengthy recovery from a lower-back strain and the subsequent setback he experienced in June. He restarted his rehab assignment Aug. 1 and built up to five innings and 85 pitches over the course of six outings at Triple-A Memphis, but Matz doesn't appear as though he'll be reclaiming a spot in the St. Louis rotation in September. Miles Mikolas is starting Sunday's series finale against the Yankees, while John Denton of MLB.com relays that Andre Pallante, Sonny Gray and Erick Fedde are listed as the Cardinals' three starters for the team's upcoming series in Milwaukee. While St. Louis could expand its rotation to six men, Lance Lynn (back) is poised to make a rehab start Sunday and could be activated later this week to fill a potential opening. As such, Matz could be relegated to a multi-inning role out of the bullpen.

Activation expected for weekend
Matz (back) is traveling with the Cardinals on the road trip starting Friday and is expected to be activated from the injured list during the weekend, Jeff Jones of the Belleville...
Impact If activated as expected, it seems Matz will be added as the extra pitcher when rosters are expanded Sunday. The southpaw completed his sixth rehab start Tuesday with Triple-A Memphis in which he gave up two eared on five hits over three innings. It still remains to be seen or reported if he will return as a starter in the rotation or long reliever. A factor that may play a part in that decision is JoJo Romero's health, who was reported as a bit more sore than his usual.

Completes sixth rehab start
Matz (back) struck out three batters and gave up four runs (two earned) on five hits and no walks over three innings in his rehab start Tuesday with Triple-A Memphis.
Impact Matz tossed 64 pitches (45 strikes) in his sixth rehab start, with the Cardinals deliberating scaling back his workload Tuesday after he tossed 85 pitches and five innings his last time out for the Triple-A club Aug. 21. Though Matz is expected to return from the 60-day injured list to make his next appearance with the Cardinals, a decision hasn't been made whether he'll slot into the rotation or serve as a multi-inning option out of the bullpen. Per Chris Kirschner of The Athletic, the Cardinals have already confirmed their starting pitchers through Sunday, so if Matz does in fact rejoin the rotation, he won't take the hill until at least Monday's series opener in Milwaukee.

Dialing back workload on rehab
Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said Monday that Matz (back) will have his pitch count scaled back to 65 in Tuesday's rehab start with Triple-A Memphis, Lynn Worthy of the St. Loui...
Impact That's after he threw 85 pitches in his last outing with Memphis. The idea behind reducing Matz's workload is to keep him flexible for a variety of roles when he rejoins the Cardinals, as it sounds like he could be used as a starter or a reliever or both. Tuesday's rehab appearance is expected to be the final one before Matz is activated from the 60-day injured list. He's been out since late April due to a herniated disc in his back.

Next rehab start coming Tuesday
Matz (back) will make another rehab start Tuesday with Triple-A Memphis, MLB.com reports.
Impact The upcoming start is expected to be the sixth and final outing of Matz's rehab assignment before he returns from the 60-day injured list. According to manager Oliver Marmol, the Cardinals are targeting Matz for around 90 pitches Tuesday, which suggests the left-hander remains in consideration for a spot in the big-league rotation once activated. Though St. Louis might expand its rotation to six men in September, Matz could still wind up heading to the bullpen if the Cardinals elect to keep Andre Pallante in the fold as their No. 6 starter. The Cardinals are currently running a five-man rotation that includes Pallante, but Lance Lynn (knee) appears poised to make it back from the IL shortly before Matz.

Likely needs another rehab start
Matz (back) is expected to make one more minor-league rehab start prior to being activated from the 60-day injured list, Lynn Worthy of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports.
Impact On Wednesday, Matz made his third rehab start for Triple-A Memphis, striking out three batters in five innings and giving up four earned runs on nine hits and one walk while pushing his pitch count up to 85. Though Matz looks to be fully stretched out at this point, the Cardinals may want to see a sharper outing from the lefty before bringing him back from the IL. According to John Denton of MLB.com, Cardinals president of baseball operations John Mozeliak previously floated the idea of the team using a six-man rotation down the stretch, though Matz could still find himself as the odd man out for a starting role once he's activated. Lance Lynn (knee) looks to be tracking toward a return from the IL around the same time as Matz, and current fifth starter Andre Pallante (3.81 ERA and 1.20 WHIP in five starts since the All-Star break) may be pitching well enough to keep his spot in the rotation.

Making rehab start Wednesday
Matz (back) is scheduled to throw about 90 pitches in his rehab start with Tripel-A Memphis on Wednesday, John Denton of MLB.com reports.
Impact Matz has a 1.38 ERA, 0.92 WHIP and 11:3 K:BB across 13 frames in his four previous rehab outings, and Wednesday's start is likely to be his last before being reinstated from the injured list. The left-hander will be fully stretched out as a starter, though his official role upon being activated has yet to be determined. Cardinals president of baseball operations John Mozeliak indicated the club could move to the six-man roster with Lance Lynn (knee) also on the cusp of returning from the injured list.

One more rehab start needed
Matz (back) will require one more minor-league rehab start before being activated from the 60-day injured list.
Impact Matz struck out six in 4.1 scoreless innings during a rehab outing with Triple-A Memphis on Friday, but hasn't been deemed ready to return. Despite being on the shelf since May 3, Matz shouldn't have any restrictions once activated from the injured list considering he threw 76 pitches Friday. Following the trade deadline acquisition of Erick Fedde, it's unclear who'll be the odd man out in the St. Louis rotation once Matz is healthy.

No back pain in Sunday outing
Manager Oli Marmol told reporters Monday that Matz did not feel any back pain following his rehab outing with Triple-A Memphis on Sunday, John Denton of MLB.com reports.
Impact Matz came away with the no decision Sunday after allowing one run on two hits while striking out three across four frames. His next rehab appearance will take place Friday, and the plan is for the 33-year-old southpaw to pitch five innings and approximately 75-to-80 pitches. Matz has not pitched for the Cardinals since late April due to a herniated disc in his back, though he could be on his way back to the big club if he comes out of Friday's outing unscathed.

Impact Matz's outing met the team's expectations in terms of both number of pitches and innings. Assuming he avoids any setbacks, he should be in line for a few more rehab outings before being activated from the injured list -- likely to rejoin the rotation.

Beginning rehab assignment
Matz (back) will begin a rehab assignment Thursday and is expected to throw about 30 pitches over two innings, Lynn Worthy of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports.
Impact The left-hander is hoping to return from the injured list sometime in August, and beginning a rehab assignment at the start of the month should give him a chance to make that happen. Matz has sidelined since late April and will likely need a least a few rehab starts before rejoining the Cardinals.

Hoping to return in August
Matz (back) is hoping to return sometime in August, Derrick Goold of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports.
Impact The left-hander threw his second bullpen session Saturday since resuming a throwing program. Matz has been on the injured list since May 3 due to a lower-back strain and had to be pulled off his initial rehab assignment in June following a setback. He'll need another rehab assignment before returning and any timetable at this point is very rough.

Throwing off mound Saturday
Matz (back) will throw a bullpen session Saturday, Katie Woo of The Athletic reports.
Impact Saturday will mark the second time Matz has thrown off a mound since he moved to the 60-day IL in late June. If he's able to get through his next session without any issues, the Cardinals may clear him to face live hitters before sending him back on a minor-league rehab assignment shortly afterward. The 33-year-old southpaw has been on the injured list since May 3 due to a lower-back strain, and his recovery has been slowed by a setback he suffered during a rehab appearance.

Shut down multiple weeks
Matz (back) suffered a setback during his most recent rehab start Sunday at Double-A Springfield and will be shut down from throwing for the next two weeks, Katie Woo of The Athlet...
Impact Matz reported soreness in his back during the third start of his rehab assignment. Though the veteran southpaw looked to be on the cusp of a return from the 15-day injured list, the setback will result in Matz having to restart his throwing program once the two-week shutdown period is over. According to Woo, the Cardinals estimate that Matz could return within 4-to-6 weeks in a best-case scenario, meaning that he can be ruled out through the All-Star break.

Prior to the aggravation, he was closing in on his return to the Cardinals, as Sunday was his third rehab start. It's unclear how much longer Matz will be sidelined, but there should be more clarity once he's further evaluated.
