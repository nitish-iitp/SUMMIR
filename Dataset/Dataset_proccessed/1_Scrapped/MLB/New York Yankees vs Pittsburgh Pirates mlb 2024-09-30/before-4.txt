Lindora The Explorer

When his team needed it most, Francisco Lindor embraced the superstar role and came through in a big way, leading the Mets to a 5-0 victory in a must-win game. Lindor kept the Mets’ playoff hopes alive, stealing 2nd in the 1st inning and getting New York on the board after an RBI single by Brandon Nimmo. He later added another stolen base and his 32nd HR of the season, a solo shot in the 6th. Lindor probably will not win the NL MVP award, but he has had an MVP worthy season for the Mets as they are one win away from a playoff birth.

 

Let’s see how the other hitters did Sunday:
Brendan Donovan (STL): 2-3, HR, R, 2 RBI, 2 BB. 

Utility man Brendan Donovan got the Cardinals on the board first with a solo HR (his 14th) in the 3rd inning and followed it up with an RBI single in the 5th. Donovan came on strong during September, hitting .345/.400/.549 over the last month. The 27-year-old set career highs in numerous categories this season after playing 153 games and looks to have a secure role going forward for St. Louis.

 

Nate Lowe (TEX): 2-4, HR, 2 R, 2 RBI, BB. 

It was a disappointing season for the Texas Rangers and Nate Lowe, but he finished strong with his 16th HR in the team’s 8-0 win over the Angels. Injuries hampered Lowe a bit this season and perhaps a nice long offseason will help him get back to his 2022 form when he hit .302/.358/.492 with 27 HRs.

 

Randal Grichuk (ARI): 2-5, HR, 3 R, 2 RBI. 

It is crazy that the two World Series teams from last season could miss the playoffs entirely just one year later. That is the fate that is awaiting the Diamondbacks barring a sweep by either the Mets or Braves in today’s doubleheader. Randal Grichuk helped ensure that the possible last game of the season was a good one for Arizona with his 8th inning 2-run HR. The 33-year-old was outstanding over the last month of the season, hitting .344/.391/.797 with 8 HRs.

 

Eugenio Suarez (ARI): 3-5, HR, 2 R, 2 RBI. 

It feels like I have written up a blurb for Eugenio Suarez every single week over the last two months and here we are again. Suarez hit his 30th HR of the season off Padres knuckleballer Matt Waldron in the 7th inning and his 10th in the last 30 games. It would be a bummer if Arizona got eliminated Monday, because it would be fun to see this dynamic offense in action in October again.

 

Lenin Sosa (CHW): 3-4, HR, 3 R, 3 RBI, BB. 

One guy I am sure I have not written up once this year is Lenin Sosa of the Chicago White Sox, but no better time to start than the last game of the season. The 24-year-old infielder hit his 8th HR of 2024 as the White Sox closed out their dreadful season with a win. Sosa actually played very well over the last week, hitting .348/.400/.696 with 2 HRs.

Cal Raleigh (SEA): 2-4, HR, 2 R, 2 RBI. 

What an impressive season for Cal Raleigh. The 27-year-old switch hitting catcher smashed his 34th HR and collected his 100th RBI of 2024 in Sunday’s win over Oakland. Raleigh passed Hall of Famer Mike Piazza for the most HRs by a catcher in his first 4 seasons and he has quietly become one of the most productive offensive backstops in baseball.

 

Trent Grisham (NYY): 2-4, HR, R, 3 RBI. 

Who knows if Trent Grisham will get any playing time in the playoffs, or even make the roster, but he showed up for the last game of the season, hitting a 1st inning 2-run HR off Pirates lefty Bailey Falter. It will be interesting to see how the Yankees configure their postseason roster, but if he ends up making it Grisham does have some solid October experience with the Brewers and Padres.
