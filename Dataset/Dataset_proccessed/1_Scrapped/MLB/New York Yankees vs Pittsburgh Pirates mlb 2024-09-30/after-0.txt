On a rain-soaked day that carried into the evening, Alex Verdugo stepped up in a pivotal moment, delivering a two-run single in the eighth inning to lift the Yankees to a 6-4 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates at Yankee Stadium. The win sealed an impressive 94-win season for the Bronx Bombers.

Verdugo reflected on the Yankees’ confidence heading into the postseason, pointing out the strong chemistry in the clubhouse. He emphasized the trust among teammates and their belief in what they’re capable of achieving, setting the stage for what he expects to be a thrilling playoff run.

“I think we’re in a good spot,” the Yankees outfielder said after the game. “Everybody is really confident with each other and with themselves. We know what we can do as a team. We understand the job at hand and what we have to do for the playoffs, so it’s going to be fun.”

His words confirm that the  New York Yankees, as they wrapped up their 162-game regular season, continue to hold firm to their “championship or bust” mindset—a tradition that has defined the franchise since the days of George Steinbrenner. For the Yankees, the real season begins now: the playoffs.

With the best record in the American League, the Yankees are now focused on the American League Division Series. They await the winner of the Orioles-Royals AL Wild Card Series, with the ALDS scheduled to begin on Saturday at Yankee Stadium.

Yankees right-hander Clarke Schmidt echoed the optimism within the team, stating they feel prepared to face any opponent. Schmidt pointed to the Yankees’ depth and talent as reasons for confidence, boldly declaring that he believes they are the best team in baseball, a claim they hope to prove as the postseason unfolds.

“I think we match up great with everybody,” the Yankees pitcher explained. “Obviously, we’re very talented, top to bottom. I personally think we’re the best team in baseball. I think we’re going to set out to try to prove that this postseason.”

Yankees’ overconfidence or a reality?

As the New York Yankees gear up for the American League Division Series, the team’s pitching rotation is beginning to take form. While Gerrit Cole and Carlos Rodón are set as the first two starters, the identity of the third starter remains a point of contention. This uncertainty heightened the stakes of Sunday’s game, with Clarke Schmidt and Luis Gil vying for the role.

After Gil struggled the day before, giving up a career-high four home runs, Schmidt took the mound on Sunday. He pitched four-plus innings, allowing four runs on three hits, issuing four walks, and striking out five batters. Despite missing three months due to a right lat strain, Schmidt finished the season with an impressive 2.85 ERA across 16 starts.

Manager Aaron Boone acknowledged the team’s favorable dilemma in choosing between Schmidt and Gil, noting both pitchers’ capabilities. He mentioned that a thorough discussion would be necessary to determine the best option for the team.

“It’s a good decision we have in front of us, because both guys are very capable,” he remarked. “We’ll hash it out and talk through it and try to do what’s best for the club.”

Schmidt conveyed his flexibility regarding his potential playoff role, emphasizing his primary goal of winning a World Series. He stated he is ready to contribute in any way necessary to help the team achieve that objective, “I’m trying to win a World Series, whatever it takes.”

His final game took place under difficult weather conditions, with rain persistently falling throughout the early afternoon. The inclement weather raised concerns among players from both teams about whether the game would go on as planned, leading to discussions about possible contingency plans that could have required the Pirates to remain in New York overnight.

While acknowledging the adverse weather, Schmidt also took responsibility for his performance, admitting that his execution fell short regardless of the conditions. He expressed surprise that the game was completed given the challenging environment.

Manager Aaron Boone opted to rest Aaron Judge for the final game of the regular season due to wet field conditions. From the bench, Judge wrapped up his bid for the American League Most Valuable Player Award, finishing with impressive numbers: a .322 batting average, a .458 on-base percentage, and a .701 slugging percentage across 158 games.

Judge topped Major League Baseball in several key categories, including home runs (58), RBIs (144), on-base percentage, slugging percentage, OPS (1.159), and walks (133). He also led the American League in extra-base hits (95) and total bases (392).

Boone reassured that Judge would have plenty of preparation opportunities during the week, with extensive practice sessions planned. He expressed confidence in the decision to rest Judge for this game.

Trent Grisham, who filled in for Judge, made a notable impact with a home run and three RBIs in the Yankees’ victory. Boone shared a lighthearted moment, revealing that assistant hitting coach Pat Roessler joked about Grisham’s performance, calling it nice to have a “real” number two hitter. Boone praised Grisham’s ability to drive the ball and his overall contribution to the game.

In the ninth inning, Clay Holmes secured his 30th save of the season, becoming the first Yankee to reach this milestone since Aroldis Chapman in 2021. Holmes, who has faced challenges this season with 13 blown saves, had recently been removed from the closer role.

With a five-day break before the American League Division Series begins, the Yankees face the challenge of keeping players ready. Boone detailed plans for at least two full team workouts at Yankee Stadium, along with additional time for simulated matchups between batters and pitchers.

Verdugo likened the upcoming break to an All-Star break, stressing the importance of maintaining energy and intensity during practices leading up to the ALDS. He emphasized the team’s responsibility to stay sharp during this critical period.
