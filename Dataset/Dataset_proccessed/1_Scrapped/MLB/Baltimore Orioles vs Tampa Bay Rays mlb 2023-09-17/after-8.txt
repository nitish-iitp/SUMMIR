What began as a “oh no the sky is falling” moment on Thursday night (after a 4-3 loss) became a we’re back where we were when this series started moment on Sunday night as the Baltimore Orioles defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 5-4 in 11 innings. The Orioles have secured their spot in the 2023 Postseason, are back on top of the AL East by 2 games, own the tie-breaker over the Rays and took four more days off of the 2023 season calendar. Thirteen games remain in the season and then we will have an #OrangeOctober.

Make no mistake, Sunday’s game had all the elements and drama of a playoff game. Trailing 3-1 after 7 1/2 innings, the Orioles plated a run on an Adley Rutschman (3 for 5, 1 2B, 1 HR, 2 R, 2 RBI) homerun that travelled 401 ft. to centerfield at 102.6 mph.

The Orioles tied the game in the bottom of the ninth. Austin Hays (2 for 4, 1 RBI) singled with one out, Jorge Mateo (0 for 0, 1 R) pinch ran for Hays and scored the tying run from first on an Adam Frazier (2 for 4, 1 2B, 1 RBI) double.

Both teams scored in the tenth inning and then chaos at Camden Yards erupted. DL Hall (2-0) retired the side in the top of the inning and passed the game to his teammates. Rutschman started the inning as the “ghost runner” and advanced to third on a Ryan O’Hearn (1 for 4, 1 R) sacrifice bunt; it was O’Hearn’s first ever career sac. bunt. Cedric Mullins (0 for 4, 1 RBI) sealed the deal with a sacrifice fly to center that went just a modest 337 ft. and a ball that Tampa’s Manuel Margot didn’t even attempt to make a play on. That run made a winner of Hall.

Lost in all the late game drama was the start Dean Kremer gave the team. Kremer pitched 5.0 innings, allowing 1 run, a Brandon Lowe homerun in the first inning, on 2 total hits while walking 2 and striking out 5. Following the moerun Kremer retired the next ten Tampa Bay batters until issuing a walk to Josh Lowe in the fourth inning.

Five bullpen pitchers collectively bent (5.0 IP, 3 R, 3 H, 1 BB, 1 K) but didn’t break before turning the game over to Hall and getting the Orioles in the playoffs for the first time since 2016.
