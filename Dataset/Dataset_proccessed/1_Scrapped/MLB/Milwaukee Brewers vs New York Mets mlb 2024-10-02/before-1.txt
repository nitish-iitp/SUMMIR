Nothing in sports feels like October baseball. We get to be a part of it (again). Going to embrace the randomness, the terror, and the joy today. It will be a peak emotional experience, and that's worth cherishing, whatever the outcome.

I can't quite believe that after watching, writing about and delving into the minutiae of this team for 162 games that I'm this excited for tonight. I'm in work and on the edge of my seat with butterflies.

Severino allowed 11 hits, 6 runs, 3 earned and 6 K in 5 IP against Milwaukee on March 30.

Brewers won 7-6. Hoskins had three hits, including his first HR of the year.

Bauers went 0-5 that game with 4 K but surprisingly still has 1.178 lifetime OPS against Severino.

Freddy is Ready!

His pitches will be Steady!

Mets batters will have legs of Spaghetti!

Severino will be so upset that he will need Beano!

Peralta went 6 IP allowing just a HR to Marte on March 29 against Mets. 8 K only 1 H and 1 BB. Brewers won 3-1.
 

The Met with most success against Peralta is: Jesse Winker. 1.146 OPS in 19 career PA.

I think he had something like 19" IVB on his fastball that game, I remember getting insanely excited about it!

May not get that sort of movement today but we live in hope

Well said my friend.  October baseball, it's hard to explain to a non baseball fan.  Every pitch, which seems like a minor part of the game to an outsider, can be excruciating.  I recently watched the 30 for 30 on the 86 Mets, which is a three part series.  It was fantastic and left me with one of my now favorite baseball quotes of all time.  I'll leave it here for all of us to remember as we watch the Brewers in October.




"Baseball does this sometimes. It consumes you and then you realize that strange and extraordinary things are happening.  In some ways it will seem inevitible in the end but seem impossible while they are happening."

Maybe being back in Milwaukee will help him recapture 2023 Winker?

I was looking at Winker's stats the other day - crazy how he had a really solid year and then just fell off the table in September. May that continue this week...

Like McCutcheon, a career Brewer killer even when he's in a Brewers uniform.

Ticket supply cheap and plentiful. This game won't be anywhere close to a sellout.

$100 tickets going for $30. Do people just not care about the Wild Card round or a combination of when the game starts on a weekday?  In the 2010’s they were sold out almost immediately.

I'm so torn, the game will be over by the time I'm off work.  Do I check the score or just watch it from the beginning after work....

The timing does suck, I'm sure that's a big factor.

Club level $36 with fees on the secondary market. That's over $100 less than the initial public onsale.

It's a product of (1) game start time and (2) we're such consistent winners that the opening round is no longer a novelty. 

Just looking at ticket sales, it's going to be an upper-30,000s crowd, I doubt anyone will even notice that there are a few thousand unsold seats. It will be a loud, energetic crowd.

I don't blame people for waiting for the NLDS/NLCS (if we win...).
