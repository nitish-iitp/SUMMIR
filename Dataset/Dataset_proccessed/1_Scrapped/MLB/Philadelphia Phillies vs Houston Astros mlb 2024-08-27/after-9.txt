Brandon Marsh homered for Philadelphia, which won its third straight. The Phillies entered leading the NL East by six games over Atlanta, while Houston began play 4 1/2 games ahead of Seattle in the AL West.

“I thought we fought and kept after it,” Phillies manager Rob Thomson said.

Shay Whitcomb had a pair of RBIs for Houston, which defeated Philadelphia in the 2022 World Series.

With runners on first and second and no outs, Harper lined the first pitch he saw from Hader (6-7), a 96 mph sinker, to right field to score automatic runner Kyle Schwarber. Hader struck out the side in order in the ninth, finishing the inning by getting Schwarber looking on a sinker.

“Happy it got through and happy to win the game,” Harper said.

Matt Strahm (6-2) worked a scoreless 10th for Philadelphia. He got help on the final out from center fielder Johan Rojas, who made a diving catch to rob Yainer Diaz of a base hit that would have scored the automatic runner.

“He got a pretty good jump, and he closes on it as good as anybody,” Thomson said. “A lot of guys don't make that catch.”

Philadelphia scored 22 runs while winning a pair of games over the weekend at Kansas City. But the Astros limited the Phillies to Marsh’s fifth-inning, opposite-field drive off Ronel Blanco and Nick Castellanos’ RBI single in the sixth before Harper came through in extra innings.

Phillies players mobbed Harper after he rounded first base, celebrating a victory to start a seven-game homestand against the Astros and the Braves.

“Big at-bats by everybody and the bullpen did their job,” Harper said.

Whitcomb put Houston in front with a two-run, two-out single in the fourth off Zack Wheeler.

“Just one hit away, but our at-bats were really good,” Houston manager Joe Espada said.

Wheeler gave up six hits in six innings with six strikeouts and two walks.

“It's fun,” Wheeler said. “Two good teams going at it.”

Blanco lasted 5 2/3 innings and allowed two runs on seven hits with five strikeouts and two walks.

Trainer's room

Phillies: Placed left-handed reliever José Alvarado on the restricted list for a personal matter. The 29-year-old Alvarado has a 4.30 ERA in 56 appearances this season. He has converted 13 of 16 save opportunities. Philadelphia recalled right-hander Michael Mercado from Triple-A Lehigh Valley.

Up next

Astros RHP Justin Verlander (3-3, 3.92 ERA) opposes Phillies RHP Aaron Nola (11-6, 3.45) as the series continues Tuesday night.
