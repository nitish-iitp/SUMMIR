Dodgers fans are losing their minds over Shohei Ohtani - and they're not taking any chances on missing out. By early Wednesday morning, die-hard supporters were already staking their claim outside Dodger Stadium, ensuring they'd be among the lucky few to snag one of those coveted Ohtani bobbleheads. The catch? They showed up more than EIGHT HOURS before the game even started!

With the first pitch scheduled for 7:10 PM PT, you'd think fans would be strolling in around dinnertime. Nope. By 11 AM, the line was already snaking around Chavez Ravine, and it only got crazier from there. Reporters on the scene couldn't believe their eyes as the Dodger faithful gathered en masse, clearly prioritizing the prized figurine over catching the opening innings against the Orioles.

The bobblehead frenzy is no joke. These aren't just any collectibles - we're talking about Ohtani holding his dog, Decoy, in two different versions: a standard edition and a gold-plated variant. With only 40,000 up for grabs, it's easy to see why fans are willing to endure the summer heat and wait hours just for a shot at taking one home.

If history is any indication, these bobbleheads are going to be worth their weight in gold - literally. Back in May, the Dodgers unleashed an Ohtani statuette that sparked absolute chaos. Traffic was a nightmare, and fans were forking over hundreds, if not thousands, on the secondary market for those limited editions.

The hype is so real that the Dodgers are bracing for a crowd north of 50,000. And while that might sound like a great turnout, it also means thousands will be going home empty-handed. If you've got a ticket but haven't hit the line yet, well, good luck - you're going to need it.

In a city where traffic is a daily struggle, Ohtani has managed to create a whole new level of gridlock. Fans are treating this like the sports memorabilia equivalent of a Black Friday sale, camping out for hours, all for a tiny figure of the Japanese phenom and his furry friend.

For those who don't score a bobblehead, the secondary market is likely to offer some consolation - if you're willing to pay the price. But for true fans, nothing beats the thrill of walking out of the stadium with one in hand, knowing you braved the madness and came out victorious.

So, if you're still debating whether to head to the stadium early, here's the bottom line: wait too long, and you'll be left out in the cold. These bobbleheads are the hot ticket in town, and Dodger fans aren't messing around.
