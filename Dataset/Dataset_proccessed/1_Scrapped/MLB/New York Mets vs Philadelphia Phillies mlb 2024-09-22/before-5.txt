Philadelphia Phillies vs New York Mets Prediction 

New York continues to be one of the best teams in the MLB over the last two months and they will look for the series win here. The Mets are 45-35 at home this year, while the Phillies are 40-37 on the road. The Phillies have a huge lead in the NL East and they are starting Zack Wheeler, who has been an elite starting pitcher over the last three months. Megill has been solid for the Mets recently, but I trust Wheeler way more. Take Philadelphia to get the win here.
