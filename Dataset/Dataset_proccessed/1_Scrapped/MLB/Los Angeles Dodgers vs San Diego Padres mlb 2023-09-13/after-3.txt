Dodgers Highlights: Kiké Hernández, Will Smith, Freddie Freeman & Kyle Hurt Against Padres

Freddie Freeman had a big performance on his birthday to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to an 11-1 win over the San Diego Padres.

The teams now play a rubber match Wednesday night with the Dodgers looking to avoid losing their first series to the Padres during the regular season since July 21-23, 2023.

Max Muncy’s sacrifice fly in the first inning put the Dodgers ahead 1-0, which Freeman added onto in the third inning with a two-run home run. Freeman went xx-for-xx on his 34th birthday.

The night’s mariachi led Dodger Stadium in serenading Freeman with “Las Mañanitas” — happy birthday — between innings. Freeman’s third hit of the game put two on in the fourth inning and was followed by Smith hitting his first home run since August 29.

Chris Taylor created more separation in the seventh inning on an RBI single with the bases loaded and James Outman added a sacrifice fly. J.D. Martinez contributed with a two-run base hit off Rich Hill in the eighth inning to put the Dodgers into double digits.

Dodgers prospect Kyle Hurt makes debut

After seven strong innings from Lance Lynn, the Dodgers handed the ball to prospect Kyle Hurt for his MLB debut. Hurt was called up Tuesday with Victor González getting optioned to Triple-A Oklahoma City and Gus Varland transferred to the 60-day injured list.

Hurt retired the side in order in the eighth inning, breezing his way through facing Fernando Tatis Jr., Juan Soto and Manny Machado. Hurt then finished off the win by striking out the side in the ninth.
