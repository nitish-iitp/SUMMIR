Texas Rangers shortstop Corey Seager hit another milestone on Tuesday, recording 1,000 career hits with a single in the fourth inning against the Toronto Blue Jays.

Moments later, Seager scored the first run of the game when Robbie Grossman homered for a 2-0 Rangers lead in a critical game in the American League Wild Card race.

Texas won 6-3 over the Blue Jays, improving to 80-64 with its fourth straight win and surpassing Toronto (80-65) for second place in the Wild Card standings.

Seager, in the midst of an incredible offensive season in spite of missing approximately six weeks due to injuries, finish the game 3-for-4 with one RBI and two runs scored. He's slashing .341/.402/.657.

During the Rangers’ last homestand, Seager hit his 30th home run of the season. It marked the second 30-homer season of his career and with the Rangers (career-high 33 last season).

He became the third player in Texas history with at least 30 home runs in each of his first two seasons with the team, joining Alex Rodriguez and Adrián Beltré.

Earlier this season he reached 150 career home runs and 500 career RBI in the same game against the Cleveland Guardians on July 14.

His 67 extra-base hits in his first 100 games this season set a Texas record over that span, overtaking the 63 by Juan González in 1996.

He also had at least 20 home runs and 30 doubles in his first 74 games, becoming the second player in the modern era (since 1900) to do so, per the Elias Sports Bureau. The other was Joe Medwick with the 1937 St. Louis Cardinals.

Seager has been named the Rangers Player of the Month twice this season, including August when he slashed batting .337/.407/.704/1.111 (33-for-98) with 10 home runs, six doubles, 21 runs and 22 RBI in 24 games.

He became the fifth Rangers hitter ever to have at least 10 home runs and a slash line of at least .330/.400/.700 in a month, joining Rodríguez (three times), Gonzalez (twice), Rafael Palmeiro (twice) and Josh Hamilton.

Only one player — Los Angeles Dodgers slugger Mookie Betts — had more home runs in August (11) than Seager. He also became the first Rangers shortstop to hit 10 or more home runs in a month since Rodríguez did it in August 2003. Rodríguez had 15 that month.
