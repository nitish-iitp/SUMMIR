Reds sent Nick Martini to Triple-A on a rehab assignment
 Doug Gray  09/14/2024 21

The Cincinnati Reds have sent outfielder Nick Martini to Triple-A Louisville to begin a rehab assignment. He last played on July 6th against Detroit, going 1-3 with a walk. He injured his thumb sliding into second base early in that game and a few days later would wind up having surgery to repair ligament damage.

After spending time out in Arizona where he had recently began playing in informal games during instructional league, Nick Martini is now ready to take the next step on his rehab plan and get into games against far more advanced pitching at the Triple-A level.

At the time of the injury, Martini was hitting .212/.272/.370 through 163 plate appearances with five home runs, nine walks, and 38 strikeouts. After hitting two home runs on Opening Day, and following that up with a double in his only plate appearance in the next game, the outfielder went into a slump and he never really came back out of it.

Please don’t add him to the roster. Not sure what value he would add. The Reds would probably send Dunn down to AAA but in no world does Martini add value or deserve a spot in 2025

LDS 09/14/2024

I don’t know his contract status going into 2025, but I agree, it’s time to move on.

Oldtimer 09/14/2024

He is a better hitter than Dunn. He can DH, play 1B or OF. If healthy, let him play.

LDS 09/14/2024

Sheldon’s article on MLB has Krall teasing fans that he’ll be serious this off season. I’ll believe it when I see it.

Oldtimer 09/14/2024

I’m not a Bell fan (as manager) but if the Reds make it to 80 W this year with all the injuries and other distractions (all five SP in April not pitching now; McClain, CES, Candelario not playing now; etc) I think that would merit another chance in 2025.

Reds fired Mayo Smith in mid 1959. He won WS at Detroit in 1968.

Reds fired Sparky in 1978. He won WS at Detroit in 1984.

Dick Sisler was decent Reds manager in late 1964 and 1965. DeWitt fired him and replaced him with Don Heffner. Oops.

I wonder what the 1966 Reds might have done with Sisler as manager and this lineup.

1B Johnson/Coleman. 2B Helms. SS Cardenas. 3B Perez. INF Ruiz. LF Rose. CF Pinson. RF Harper. OF Shamsky. C Edwards/Pavletich. SP Maloney. Ellis. Nuxhall. Jay. Arrigo. CL McCool. RP Nottebart. Davidson.

LDS 09/14/2024

No. You can’t look only at this season. You have to look at the totality. And that’s been an abysmal failure.

Mauired 09/14/2024

The Bell excusers will find six different excuses for six different seasons on why it’s not his fault. He may finish out his contract with 8 seasons and a losing record, and a few people will advocate that he should be extended. Some people are addicted to losing.

Oldtimer 09/14/2024

I am NOT a Bell fan. But only 2022 was an abysmal failure. Bryan Price, yes. Wall-to-wall, soup-to-nuts, a complete failure as manager.

Brian 09/14/2024

Wow I was able to name most of those by their first name…I’m old..lol

David 09/14/2024

Mayo Smith was a manager for the Detroit Tigers that had Mickey Lolich and Denny McClain (won 30 games in 1968, but Lolich was the WS pitching hero). I think somewhere in Jim Bouton’s book “Ball Four”, that the Detroit Tigers pitching coach in 1969 told Bouton that Mayo Smith was the dumbest manager in ML baseball.
Sometimes a manager just falls into it, and sometimes they’re lucky and sometimes they’re good. I really have no idea what kind of manager David Bell really could be, because for the most part, the Reds have not really had an over-abundance of talent.
And really, that falls on Top Management to open the pocket book and hire free agents or pay guys to stay, these days.
I actually have to give Bell, Krall and Johnson some credit for piecing together a pitching staff after Greene, Lodolo and Abbott were all sidelined. I really expected the Reds to collapse.

VegasRed 09/15/2024

I appreciate your historical perspective OT but I often question how relevant it is.

The Reds stink now! And in the last few years. And basically throughout this regime’s near two decades, with. Rey small exceptions.

I’m a long time fan but revisiting past glories just doesn’t do it for me now.

I want to see big changes. Best would be a new owner and that isn’t happening. But changes in the on field management and better FA acquisition would be very welcome.

You can’t really compete with nearly all rookies and a handful of mediocre or less vets. This team needs quality hitting day in and day out in the outfield.

And power and run producing in the infield corners.

Much much better fundamental play on the bases, in the field and situational hitting.

Playing Benson and Marte game after game this year was a joke—just literally no excuse for that.

We need a serviceable back up catcher.

Krall, the owners and bell and his staff all stunk it up this year.

History has some really great memories but I want to see a solid mlb team compete in 2025.

Bill J 09/14/2024

And we believe in the Easter Bunny.

David 09/14/2024

I think Martini going to AAA to rehab is more of an obligation based on the MLB agreement with the Player’s Association.
Teams can’t “stash” physically able players on the IL indefinitely. If Martini is healthy enough to play, the Reds have to send him somewhere to play. The AAA season is over in about 10 days. That may be where he ends up with the Reds.

Mauired 09/14/2024

Not sure if he’s even good enough to start on Louisville next year since the outfield should be Dunn, Hinds, and Hurtubise again. Martini might have to go back to the Dinos in Korea.

MK 09/14/2024

Really can’t see Farmer or Wilson having a role with this team in ‘25. So cut them now, bring up Maxwell and Heatherly to see what they can do. What would it hurt? This is the disadvantage to the smaller September roster sizes.

Ksdavis 09/14/2024

Heathery has an 8.47 ERA. Why in the world would you bring him up?

Oldtimer 09/14/2024

LOL.

Mauired 09/14/2024

I’ve been pleasantly surprised by Farmer. I didn’t want them to bring him back this year but he’s been a solid guy in the pen all year.

As far as Wilson goes I still don’t understand why they elected to keep him and get rid of Young. Young is younger, better, and has 2-3 years of control. But it’s fine next year they can go with Suter and Moll.

JayTheRed 09/14/2024

I never understood the Young move either. I have always been a fan of his in the bullpen since he came to the Reds.

Frankie Tomatoes 09/14/2024

Jacob Heatherly has 51 walks in 39 innings in AA. No one wants to see how bad that would hurt to watch against big leaguers. It would be like that Bugs Bunny cartoon with the team just walking around the bases.

JayTheRed 09/14/2024

Famer? He has been one of the biggest surprises of the season. He has done a very good job. I’m hoping they can get him back next year.
