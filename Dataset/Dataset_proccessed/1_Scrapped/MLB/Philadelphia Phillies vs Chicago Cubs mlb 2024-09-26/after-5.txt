PHILADELPHIA — Even as the season began to wind down, even as the Cubs’ playoff hopes fizzled into an impossibility, Cody Bellinger didn’t let his mind stray too far ahead. Even in conversations with his agent, Scott Boras, they put off the decision he’ll eventually have to make on the opt-out he could exercise after this season.

“[Boras] is like, dude, just finish out the season, have fun, we’ve got plenty of time to talk after the season,” Bellinger said this week during the Cubs’ final road series.

“I’ve got to talk to my wife, I’ve got to think about my kids, I’ve got to think about my family, I’ve got to think about myself. And I don’t have time to think about that during the season.
