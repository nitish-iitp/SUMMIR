Making the playoffs? Check.

Winning the division? Check.

Clinching one of the byes? Check.

Now it’s all about grabbing that top overall seed. You have to wonder if playing the for that top seed is something that will benefit a team that will have to sit for a few days. Having something to play for is probably good for them as they continue to chase a goal instead of resting players, throttling down on pitchers. It’s what the Braves did two years in a row and they went out quickly in the playoffs. Maybe this will benefit the Phillies.

On to the links.

Phillies news:
It’s a goal the team has had all year: they really wanted that first round bye.
Want to relive the Trea Turner standing ovation comeback story? If you have Netflix, you’re in luck.
MLB news:
Hurricane Helene has derailed the Mets-Braves series and forced a possible doubleheader on Monday.
In case you were wondering (and I know you are) - yes. The White Sox really are that bad of a baseball team.
The Orioles are getting some reinforcements at just the right time, even if they’re getting bad news about one of their arms.
