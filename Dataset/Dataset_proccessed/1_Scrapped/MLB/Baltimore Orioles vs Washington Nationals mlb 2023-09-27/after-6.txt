Game 159 lineups: Nats at Orioles
 By Mark Zuckerman Masn Nationals September 27, 2023, 3:26pm  Comments

BALTIMORE – Sure, the Nationals would love to win a game against the Orioles before season’s end. But first, they’d like to just score a run against them.

These two teams have played 27 innings against each other so far in 2023, and the Nats have yet to score in any of them. They’ve gone 0-3 by a combined score of 6-0, having twice been shut out 1-0, including Tuesday night here at Camden Yards. So perhaps tonight’s the night they finally see somebody in a curly W helmet safely cross the plate.

Patrick Corbin gets the ball for his final start of the season. The left-hander has been better this year, to be sure. But he still enters with a 5.13 ERA, 1.466 WHIP and league-leading 14 losses. In order to end his season with a sub-5.00 ERA, Corbin would need to either go seven innings allowing one earned run or five scoreless innings.

The Orioles, by the way, have a chance to clinch the American League East title tonight. They need to win and have the Rays lose to the Red Sox, so there will be plenty of scoreboard watching taking place at Camden Yards.
