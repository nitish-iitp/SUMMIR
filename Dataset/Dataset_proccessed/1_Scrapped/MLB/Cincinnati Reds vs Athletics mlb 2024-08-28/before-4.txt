Breaking down notable hitting performances from yesterday’s games.

HITTER RECAP
8/28/2024
Tovar The Great

Rockies SS Ezequiel Tovar looked poised for a historic night after hitting a solo shot in the 1st inning off Marlins starter Roddery Munoz, and then a two-run HR just one inning later. Tovar did double later in the game, but would have to settle for just the 2 HRs on Tuesday. After an impressive rookie season, the 23-year-old has taken it to a new level this season with a Tulo-esque 21 HRs and a .271/.296/.455 hitting line. His BB/K ratio (0.11) will have to improve during his career to maintain these numbers, but the future looks bright at SS for Colorado.

 

Let’s see how the other hitters did Tuesday:
Jesus Sanchez (MIA): 2-4, HR, 2B, R, 4 RBI, BB. 

It is crazy to think that Jesus Sanchez is now the longest-tenured Miami Marlin on the active roster. So it was only fitting that Sanchez would be the one to hit a clutch 3-run HR in the bottom of the 9th to cap an insane comeback after Miami entered the inning down 8-4. There was certainly some trade interest in the powerful Sanchez at the Trade Deadline and it will be interesting to see if he stays with Miami through the offseason. Despite a poor BB/K ratio (0.25), Sanchez has set a career-high with 17 HRs and 56 RBI in 2024.

 

Seiya Suzuki (CHC): 2-4, HR, 2 R, 2 RBI, BB. 

I don’t think enough people appreciate the season that Seiya Suzuki is having. Perhaps it is the shadow that Shohei Ohtani casts on all Asian players or Shota Imanaga’s impressive rookie season on his own team, but Suzuki has put together a very impressive campaign for the second year in a row. The 30-year-old now has 19 HRs to go along with a career-high 11 stolen bases and a .276/.348/.494 line.

 

Dansby Swanson (CHC): 1-2, HR, 2 R, 3 RBI, 2 BB. 

The same can’t be said for Dansby Swanson, who has struggled for the majority of 2024 resulting in being moved down the lineup. He came through in a big way on Tuesday, following up Suzuki’s 2-run HR with one of his own and effectively ending Pirates phenom Jared Jones’ night. Swanson just hasn’t been the same hitter since coming over from Atlanta and has essentially taken him out of fantasy consideration.

 

Oneil Cruz (PIT): 4-4, 2B, 2 RBI, SB. 

Another weird and disastrous season for the Pittsburgh Pirates took another weird turn this week when the team announced that Oneil Cruz would be moving from SS to CF immediately and for the foreseeable future. Cruz has never played OF in his life and while he certainly has the athleticism to succeed there, it is a major change to put on a budding superstar still completing his first full MLB season. Nevertheless, it hasn’t seemed to affect Cruz at the plate as LHP Justin Steele and the Cubs bullpen couldn’t get him out on Tuesday. Known primarily for his power, Cruz does have elite speed as well and has started to steal more bases lately, with 7 in his last 15 games.

 

Jarren Duran (BOS): 2-4, HR, R, RBI. 

While Aaron Judge and Bobby Witt are easily the top MVP candidates, if we were only looking at the 2nd half of the season it would be hard not to include Jarren Duran in that conversation. Since winning the All-Star Game MVP, Duran has been unbelievable hitting .324/.388.655 with 9 HRs and 10 steals in just 145 at-bats. For context, he had a very nice 1st half with 11 HRs and 22 steals in 402 at-bats. This guy has been one of the biggest breakout stars of the 2024 season and is leading the charge for a pesky Red Sox team that still has playoff aspirations.

 

Max Schuemann (OAK): 3-4, HR, 2B, R, 2 RBI. 

The Oakland A’s certainly do not have playoff aspirations and are in “Let’s see what we have for 2025” mode. I’m not sure how 27-year-old infielder Max Schuemann fits into their plans, but he showcased some pop on Tuesday with his 7th HR of the season and a double. As a 27-year-old rookie and former 20th-round pick out of Eastern Michigan, Schuemann doesn’t seem to have long-term upside, but his moderate combination of power and speed could be interesting to watch for A’s fans over the last month.

 

Luis Arraez (SD): 3-5, R, RBI, SB. 

It is kind of weird to say, but Luis Arraez is having a down year with just a .305 average, his lowest since 2021. What is actually a little alarming is his career-low .337 OBP, which doesn’t even come close to his previous career-low of .357. Not exactly what the Padres were hoping for when they acquired the leadoff man but he came through on Tuesday with 3 hits and his career-best 7th stolen base of the season.

 

Paul Goldschmidt (STL): 3-3, HR, R, 2 RBI, BB. 

Speaking of down years, unfortunately, we may be witnessing the cruel nature of time finally stealing away Paul Goldschmidt’s baseball talent. The 36-year-old has been demoted all the way down to the 7th spot in the St. Louis lineup and is hitting .231/.292/.394 on the season. His previous worst was his first season in St. Louis in 2019 when he hit .260/.346/.476. But we got to catch a glimpse of former MVP Goldy on Tuesday as Padres pitching couldn’t get him out and he launched his 20th HR of 2024.

 

Yandy Díaz (TB): 2-4, HR, R, RBI. 

One of the few Tampa Bay veterans that did not get traded at the deadline, Yandy Díaz’s solo HR against Seattle last night proved to be the game-winner for the Rays as they defeated the Mariners 3-2. I don’t think Diaz will ever match his incredible 2023 season of .330/.410/.522 and 22 HRs, but he is still a very tough out with modest power at the top of the lineup.
