Reds’ Rebuilding Crossroads
The Reds are at a crossroads. They tore things down in 2021-22. It was a rebuild but they had a head start. They were rebuilding earlier and drafted people like Hunter Greene in 2017, Jon India in 2018, and Lodolo in 2019.

Rock bottom was 2022 at 100 losses. Since then two seasons of generally around .500. They could just continue as per usual. But they could also follow the path of post-2019 when they went into FA market to get substantial veteran additions.

To be sure, that was not very well executed. Moustakas and Shogo didn’t work out. Castellanos had the player options and he pulled the rip cord. But at least they did bite the bullet then and try for immediate improvement.

I’m an old poster, and I’m getting weary of all this. I watch clips from other teams, great excitement, tense and exciting games with much on the line. I don’t live in Cincy, they are just an old habit, and frankly it all seems rather silly at times.

So I’m hopeful they choose the path of elevation of the team for right now. For me at least, the moment is here.

Re: Reds’ Rebuilding Crossroads
This is the off season to make that plunge to be a contender again. Reds have two generational talents in Greene and Cruz. Also have a decent base around them but still need some upgrades with the bats and pitching. Upgrades that are going have to be obtained through free agency or shrewd trades. Will they do it? I don't hold out much hope they will. I expect more dumpster diving and relying on unproven young players like Marte and CES to carry the load. I will say if they don't go for it this off season then it will never happen. Because you will never have a better opportunity.

It really does feel like a crossroads situation. Good post , as usual.

Re: Reds’ Rebuilding Crossroads
Dan Symborski over at Fangraphs just had a post with a similar thrust.

I maintain the biggest missing piece is a star-level corner 1B/OF bat. Could be FA, more likely via trade. Unfortunately, there just aren't very many of them out there. Heck, Steer is on pace to be a top 30 OF with ~2 WAR this year. Soto was my dream 2 years ago and remains so, but I know there's not a snowballs chance in.. yeah.

Maybe Vlad Jr.? Maybe you can give a big package of prospects to the Tigers for Riley Greene. Maybe you sign Profar in FA in hopes he 's found something real. Teoscar Tavares isn't a bad fit , but not exactly a hallmark of reliability. Some will say Santander, but that looks like Moose/Candy 3.0 to me.

In any event, I think the fundamental truth remains that this org putting together a playoff caliber team is a function of player development and health. As disappointing as that feels every winter, pretty much everything else is on the margins. If we can't win 86 games without a Soto, we can't win 92 with him. And we're not getting a Soto.
Games are won on run differential -- scoring more than your opponent. Runs are runs, scored or prevented they all count the same. Worry about scoring more and allowing fewer, not which positions contribute to which side of the equation or how "consistent" you are at your current level of performance.

It’s a shame because most of us try for excellence in our endeavors. It’s hard to accept a team that seems to be a community service/financial play for owners with no goal beyond break even annual finances and some degree of relevance. At some level they want to win, but aren’t very committed to it.

I could be much harsher in tone because I’m getting fed up with it all. But, as you say, the opportunity is there right now. So we’ll give them one more chance, as we have many times before, LOL.

Re: Reds’ Rebuilding Crossroads
I wish I knew the answer. It's easy to say what should have been done after what was done didn't work. There are clearly guys in the lineup who don't belong (at least yet) no matter how high the hopes. Guys hitting below .200 and OPSing in the .500s don't belong in the lineup. It's a long season but at some point, the cord needs cut.

Pitching is solid.

McLain coming back will really help. CES... ?

A couple of bats in the outfield is where I'd go.

The biggest change, and maybe only for the sake of change, is at the manager spot. See if a new guy can get a better result.

Re: Reds’ Rebuilding Crossroads
I like Tyler O'Neill as FA target. We'd probably have to take on the risk of offering an injury-prone player a LTC, but it's probably our best chance at a true needle-moving OFer within our tax bracket. Still might be too expensive for Phil's blood though.

I'm not counting on CES or Marte for anything. McClain I have higher hopes for, but nothing guaranteed there either, really. If you add a healthy O'Neill to the current lineup, that's not too bad. Add a 2023 McClain on top of that, now we're cooking. If one or both of CES/Marte put it together, that might be something special.

We definitely don't need another low-OBP bat off a career year signed to a multi-year deal.

Re: Reds’ Rebuilding Crossroads
They are simply going to have to trade for or sign a quality bat. I don't care if he hits left handed or right handed. Whoever they get will need to have a impact.
They need at least one. I'd prefer two quality relievers. One left handed one right handed. To go with Santillan, Moll and Diaz.
They need to sign or trade for a quality starting pitcher. One that has a good health history.
You simply can't go into the season relying on just Greene, Lodolo and Abbott.

They need to be healthy. Injuries are inevitable with all teams. But they can't survive with as many as they had this season.
If they can add a top 50 arm to the rotation a proven bat to the lineup a couple good late inning relievers and stay relatively healthy. They will compete.

If more than one of these things on my list doesn't happen we will be looking at another season like this one.
I believe if they add those pieces have luck with health they will compete for the postseason. If not they won't. They have little margin for error.

The elephant in the room for me is the remaining tenure of Elly de la Cruz. He’s a unique and potentially All-Time talent - the likes of which the Reds rarely possess. Building a team around him in the next five years should be the goal.

Sign Alex Bregman and Pete Alonso. Trade Marte, CES, and whatever it might take to land a rental SP.

That team wins 90+ games (and has a $160MM payroll). You will pay for it hard in 4 or 5 years when Bregman and Alonso are old and expensive - but by then, you’re ready to rebuild anyway.*

*I know this isn’t going to happen. The Reds would never ever ever sign a player like Bregman or Alonso from the open market. Calculating the chances of them signing both will cause your TI-83 graphing calculator to burst in to flames. I’m just saying… if they waste Elly’s tenure and then trade him in the 2028 offseason for a couple of high-A blue-chippers, it’s gonna be a bummer.

The one player I would love to have bat after Elly is Soto. He would easily hit 50 homeruns. I would either defer alot of money or offer a opt out after year 3. Gives them 3 chances to win a Championship.

Re: Reds’ Rebuilding Crossroads
The Reds need to improve in all areas to become a serious contender. Offense, Defense, Starting Pitching, Relief Pitching, Situational play, high leverage, low leverage... In spite of the massive steps forward from Greene and EDLC, the Reds seem much farther away now than they did a year ago at this time. It seems they have a reasonable core with 3 starters, 5 or 6 position players and some relievers here and coming, but I just don't get a sense that they will add to that group with anything meaningful. It's more frustrating and demoralizing than the 100-loss team they had in 2022.

Telling me there's no chance is much better than toying with my affections.
All my posts are my opinion - just like yours are. If I forget to state it and you're too dense to see the obvious, look here!

Re: RedsÂ’ Rebuilding Crossroads
I don't think it's a crossroads at all. It is the moment. Either they rise or they fail.

The team has an ace, a superstar, some good complementary players, a pitching pipeline - and a ticking clock. With health, the team would have been right there this year.

Even on a Rays/Brewers/Guardians be-decent-every-year (and hope for late season magic) model, the team is entering its prime.

I would not look for big trades and hope not to see them. The team needs its depth. Nor can there be any "normal" big multiyear FA signings, as 2026 and later already will see salary crunches.

But creative one-year and opt-out deals? Basically, a couple of Castellanoses? Those should be the Reds' goals.

I don't know whether Soto would do 1/60 or 2/115, with a chance to be a FA again in a year - but I'd ask, that's for sure. [Ohtani's present value AAV is 46.]

More realistically, the best 2-year bat they can get, Montas and a couple of Suters.

Re: RedsÂ’ Rebuilding Crossroads
I've griped about it all season. The Reds need to address starting pitching. After Greene, Abott, and Lodolo (unless they blow up) is not enough. Get some MLB pitchers and quit bring up the AAA guys who are not ready. I don't know what the coaches are doikng, but I see a lack of discipline on the basepaths. Elly just pushes it too far. He gets picked off, he takes to many chances. He's not coached to be smart? He's young and all that, but sometimes he just doesn't get it. He will, but he needs a manager who will crack the whip. Oh yeah, get rid of the manager and his Little League ways (he's family and that won't happen). The bullpen is average, but ditch Diaz. He is erratic and his blown saves prove it.

You can hope that these kids will develop, but probably that will be hit and miss.They need veteran leadership--one of the reasons I wanted Joey around.

Maybe they will catch fire these last few games, but losing 3 of four to Pittsburgh is horrible. I notice tonight, they allowed 18 rns tonight. Time to quit trading for midling pitches and go for the gold. Pioe dream. They are too cheap.

I want the Reds to trade for Brett Rooker.

Sign Flaherty or similar.

Give Santillan a few closer shots down the stretch.

They have like nothing on the books, there is no “impending salary crunch” lol

Extend Elly so people can stop talking about 5 years ticking down. Make some real trades. Make some real signings. Act like a big boy ballclun. Stop shopping at the baseball player TJ Maxx.
