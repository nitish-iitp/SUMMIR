Yankees’ Anthony Misiewicz ‘alert and oriented’ after taking comebacker to head vs. Pirates

New York Yankees reliever Anthony Misiewicz is “alert and oriented” after being hit in the head by a line drive from Pittsburgh Pirates second baseman Ji Hwan Bae in the bottom of the sixth inning Friday, the team announced. Here’s what you need to know:

The ball came off Bae’s bat at 100.6 mph and hit Misiewicz squarely on the left side of his head. The left-hander immediately dropped to the ground, writhing in pain on his hands and knees.
Misiewicz stood up under his own power and was taken off the field on a cart. He was assessed by Pirates team doctors and taken to a local hospital for further testing, the Yankees said.
A runner came home on the play, tying the score at 3-3 (New York went on to win 7-5). Right-hander Zach McAllister took over for Misiewicz on the mound.

What to know about Misiewicz

Misiewicz, 28, had only been a Yankee since the team claimed him off waivers from the Detroit Tigers on July 6. The Yankees called him up to the majors on Sept. 10, and prior to Friday, he had made two scoreless appearances in pinstripes. The lefty has played in parts of four MLB seasons with five teams, including three with the Seattle Mariners. A Michigan native, the Mariners picked him in the 18th round in 2015. — Kuty

Yankees’ unfortunate injury run continues

The Yankees are having an awful season in which they’ll miss the playoffs for the first time since 2016 and might even end under .500 for the first time since 1992. Injuries have been a big reason why. Specifically, shocking injuries, like what happened tonight to Misiewicz.

The team has used 26 injured list stints, and Misiewicz seems all but destined to be No. 27, which would tie them for the third-most in the majors with the San Diego Padres and the Minnesota Twins, according to Spotrac.

Injuries to their two most important bats happened in stunning fashion. First baseman Anthony Rizzo was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome two months after the Padres’ Fernando Tatis Jr.’s upper thigh collided with Rizzo’s head on a back-pick attempt in May. And in June, star right fielder Aaron Judge fell through a wall in right field at Dodger Stadium making a brilliant catch while his right foot crashed into a portion of exposed concrete at the bottom of the wall. It resulted in a torn big toe ligament for Judge.

Additionally, legendary Yankees play-by-player John Sterling was hit in the forehead with a foul ball while he was on the radio in June. Sterling, then 84, was fine and continued to call the game with a bandage over his eye. — Kuty

What they’re saying

Yankees manager Aaron Boone said via the YES Network that Misiewicz left the stadium “in good spirits” and apparently “in a pretty good spot.”

Boone said that Misiewicz was “pretty aware and pretty alert” when he spoke with him as he sat on the ground. Boone also said it appeared Misiewicz knew where he was and was capable of answering questions from the trainers.

Starting pitcher Gerrit Cole said he was “sick to (his) stomach about it.”

“I’ve been hit in the head on that mound, not quite like that, but I’ve seen some other guys get smoked. You’re just praying for him, hoping he’s all right.”
