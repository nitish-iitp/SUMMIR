According to Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, a 100.6 mph liner from Ji Hwan Bae hit the relief pitcher in the side of his head in the bottom of the sixth inning. 

Misiewicz, who was replaced by Zach McAllister, was carted off the field. He was alert and talking to trainers. The game resumed after the injury delay. 

Scary, scary moment here. Ji Hwan Bae hits a line drive up the middle at 100.6 mph. It hits Yankees reliever Anthony Misiewicz in the left temple/ear area. He's down, obviously not in good shape and getting carted off.

There has been no update on Misiewicz's condition.
