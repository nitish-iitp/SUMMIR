The New York Yankees were down to their last out before rookie shortstop sensation Anthony Volpe saved the day.

Facing Tigers closer Alex Lange, Volpe turned a hanging sinker into a game-tying three-run home run. Volpe’s blast tied the game 3-3 and was his 20th home run of the year.

Volpe’s home run also gave him a 20-20 season.
