 Doug Gray  09/19/2024 92

Julian Aguiar


It’s only been six starts in the big leagues for Julian Aguiar, but he’s been inconsistent over that span. The last two starts have been good ones as he’s allowed just three earned runs in 11.0 combined innings.

The splits in the big leagues for Aguiar show that righties make a lot more contact, but thus far have hit for less average and less power than their left-handed counterparts. The sample size is pretty small, though.

Chris Sale


The likely Cy Young Award winner this year, Sale has been outstanding as he’s bounced back from several years of injuries. He made seven All-Star games in a row from 2012-2018 and finally got back to another one this year. On June 1st he allowed eight runs while giving up two homers in 4.0 innings to Oakland. Since that day he’s posted a 1.89 ERA in 105.0 innings and given up just two home runs.

On the surface the splits aren’t as big as you’d imagine they would be. Righties only had a 44 point advantage in OPS against Sale. But teams have sent more than five times as many righties out to face him – meaning just the absolute best of the best lefties in the game get to hit against him, and they are not hitting.

Glad to see Dunn in the lineup. Would like to see Hinds in there too. Officially eliminated…get the young guys a look and some experience.

Redsvol 09/19/2024

I agree DW. I’d like to see Hinds and Dunn over Fraley, Rosario and Frield from here on. Give them some experience so they lock in what they need to work on during off season. It’s clear Fraley and Frield have been nursing injuries all year.

Randy in Chatt 09/19/2024

+1 million

Oldtimer 09/19/2024

Dunn has shown nothing so far. Hinds has shown little beyond his first week or so.

Mauired 09/19/2024

Good point. After a couple weeks of MLB at bats these guys should be producing already.

Oldtimer 09/19/2024

No. The pennant and wild card races are still going. The Reds should play their best players to try to win. That simple.

What would the last two weeks of September show anyway?

You should apply for Reds manager the next time the job opens up.

Mauired 09/19/2024

Do they take online applications? I might be out of town.

RedsGettingBetter 09/19/2024

Well, this lineup is very weak to face Sale but the Reds have no more practically, and they are eliminated for everything this season. One interesting thing is to see what Aguiar can do today against the Braves lineup and maybe Dunn how will figure out Chris Sale…I will be glad if they aren’t no-hit so they won’t be the only team being no-hit twice this season

Doc 09/19/2024

One out of two isn’t bad.

Kevin H 09/19/2024

Would like to see Hinds get more playing time. Hopefully soon.

Mark Moore 09/19/2024

Well, that’s certainly a lineup 

BK 09/19/2024

@Doug, reference your article below … How was Legumina optioned and not placed on waivers for exceeding being optioned five times in a season?

https://www.redlegnation.com/2024/09/08/cincinnati-reds-place-sam-moll-on-the-injured-list-recall-casey-legumina/

Tom Diesman 09/19/2024

I confirmed that was his 6th option this year, but can’t find the loophole if there is one.

Thanks, obviously there is a loophole or two. Perhaps Spring Training (first option) or double headers don’t count. Who knows?

Mark Moore 09/19/2024

Missed T-1st getting back out to my office. Glad to see we handled it well.

Now let’s see if we can get to Sale at all. Looks like a gorgeous day there.

Mark Moore 09/19/2024

Olson hits good pitches let alone cookies.

Thrall and Cowboy saying Sale could be thinking that 1 run early is enough.

Kevin H 09/19/2024

A non strike 3 call turns into a homerun. Yet MLB will do nothing about the inconsistencies of mlb strike zone.

RedsGettingBetter 09/19/2024

The whiff% is very high on the Sale’s pitches…It seems the Reds can’t make contact…impressive

Kevin H 09/19/2024

Yeah his ability to change speeds and locate his pitches is tough to adjust too.

Sale is real deal

Kevin H 09/19/2024

GABP homerun special. Love the band box that is GABP.

Mark Moore 09/19/2024

My casual following amidst meetings and other work just became a whole lot more casual.

Then again, those swipes by Dunn and India driving him in does help.

Tom Diesman 09/19/2024

Now we got something rolling. Time for us to take advantage of one of those GABP specials.

Mark Moore 09/19/2024

Oh so close … figures that would happen.

Tom Diesman 09/19/2024

Bummer, France is most likely the only guy on the roster that gets doubled up on that one.

greenmtred 09/19/2024

Maile?

Mark Moore 09/19/2024

They could walk it over and get Maile.

Tom Diesman 09/19/2024

France is 25.1 ft/sec sprint speed, Maile is 25.5.

Roger Garrett 09/19/2024

Could we see him pitch and catch in the same game?Stay tuned.

Mark Moore 09/19/2024

Thanks Tom. Both are way faster than I am 

RedsGettingBetter 09/19/2024

Rosario was hitting above .300 when landed on the Reds. He’s been atrocious since

Roger Garrett 09/19/2024

Sale doesn’t give you many chances and we already had the one which is more then I expected we would get.Braves may not make the playoffs but if they do Sale will be hard to deal with for sure.

RedsGettingBetter 09/19/2024

Aguiar made big mistake hitting Harris II and Soler with no outs to face Ozuna..He couldn’t today

Roger Garrett 09/19/2024

This one is over and its pretty much what was expected today.Reds got the first one and that one hurt the Braves chances but they bounced back.Wish them the best.One time long ago when the Reds were good and good for a long time the Braves were awful.Times have changed.

Mark Moore 09/19/2024

This got ugly in a hurry. I don’t care if it was Chris Farley on the mound now. That’s a HUGE hole we’ve dug.

Seems like the Bravos might just be playing with some purpose 

RedsGettingBetter 09/19/2024

GABP is very small to Olson or the Reds pitching doesn’t know how to pitch against him… I think Aguiar and Zulueta pitches had horrible locations

Tom Diesman 09/19/2024

I’d agree on Aguiar’s HR pitch to Olson, but Zulueta’s HR pitch to him barely nicked the inside corner, and he might not even have got the strike call on it.

Mark Moore 09/19/2024

In an act of what must be pure mercy on this old Reds fan, MLB.tv just barfed on my laptop and went black. I don’t think I shall tune in again.

Catch you all tomorrow, RLN friends.

Roger Garrett 09/19/2024

Yep sure would like that feeling again while I still can feel.Gone for today.GO REDS

Tom Diesman 09/19/2024

Way to go Dunn. Have yourself a day young man!

RedsGettingBetter 09/19/2024

Aguiar couldn’t pitch well but Dunn has figured out Sale…

RedsGettingBetter 09/19/2024

Today the Braves are facing triple-A pitching….

Dennis Westrick 09/19/2024

Just finished my last meeting at work this afternoon! If somebody told me the Reds would score 2 runs and run up Sale’s pitch count to 90+ pitches thru five innings I would have told them they’re crazy!

That’s the good news! The bad news is that the “real” Braves showed up this afternoon and have pounded Reds pitching to the tune of 11 runs thru 6 innings! Yikes!

RedsGettingBetter 09/19/2024

Three 3-run homers have been enough

Laredo Slider 09/19/2024

Braves announcers yucking it up: “Great American Small Park.”

Dennis Westrick 09/19/2024

Even with today’s rout, we (Reds fans) get the last laugh! Reds win season series over the Braves 4 to 2!

RedsGettingBetter 09/19/2024

But 4 losses against the Reds hurt them a lot right now

Dennis Westrick 09/19/2024

Absolutely! When the Braves miss out on the 3rd and final NL Wild Card spot by one game they can blame the Reds!

Andrew Brewer 09/19/2024

The question right now is: Can the Reds hold the Braves to a scoreless frame here ?

Andrew Brewer 09/19/2024

And they do !

Dennis Westrick 09/19/2024

Mission accomplished!

Kevin H 09/19/2024

With a healthy McLain Friedl, and CES.

As well as the starting staff. I think this reds team would of won 90 games.

Through all the injuries and everything they have still managed to win 74 up to this point. A success? No, however all things considered….

Dennis Westrick 09/19/2024

Look at the bright side! We could be White Sox fans!

Kevin H 09/19/2024

Absolutely!!! Yikes

Justin T 09/19/2024

CES played this year and looked awful. Him and McClain have less than a full year in the bigs and you think that would have made a 10 game difference? TJ has played quite a bit as well. They are good players but definitely not in the “difference maker” category. This team played like they were disinterested for the majority of the season, 90 wins was never in the cards.

Andrew Brewer 09/19/2024

Dunn two for two today with a homerun off Sale… Really happy for him !

Andrew Brewer 09/19/2024

And now Maile is 2 for 3 … go figure !

Andrew Brewer 09/19/2024

Today’s lineup reflected the next game against our Division foe Pirates. We will want to beat them …

Andrew Brewer 09/19/2024

The Braves replace pitchers with two outs and two on and Ty France coming to the plate … They are up 11-3, but apparently are taking no chances

DataDumpster 09/19/2024

Reds working hard to eliminate that run differential now down to +8. Earlier in the season, Krall said that their large positive margin when the record was about the same as indicated an improving chance the team’s fortunes would trend positive. Wonder what they will say when it most likely goes negative? I don’t know how somebody can make an ancient geometry equation into a baseball “metric” but somehow doesn’t consider that a 10-25 (approx) single run game record isn’t the main cause…thereto pointing directly at the field manager’s questionable lineup constructions, bullpen usage, lack of emphasis on fundamentals, giving up on close games, Sunday rest days, lack of game specific strategy instead of rigid percentage plays, wild baserunning, lack of team identity and consistency, etc. and all the other associated decisions that contribute to the losing “Bell ball” model as currently employed.

Dennis Westrick 09/19/2024

Spot on! The Reds pathetic W-L record in one-run games combined with their record on Sundays plus most other days that end in “Y” far overshadows any positive run differential!

Justin T 09/19/2024

This is the best comment ive seen all year and explains it perfectly.

Dennis Westrick 09/19/2024

The Reds are staying true to form today! In most, not all, of their losses this year, they have 10 or more strikeouts! Today they have 11 thru 7 innings with 7 LOBs and 2 for 10 with RISP!

Hard to score or drive in runs when you strike out! Just sayin’!

Andrew Brewer 09/19/2024

Liebrandt out for another inning ? And it shows … another blast for the Bravos.

Dennis Westrick 09/19/2024

With 5 HRs today and counting, I bet the Braves would love to play all of their games at GABP!

Jim Walker 09/19/2024

My Reds highlight of the day was seeing about the disaster and turning to Gameday to look over the box score instead of actually watching. In the process, I found the new Gameday 3D. It looks to me like a work in progress but with AI and that additional work it might grow to be a thorn in the backside of those teams and companies blocking DTC streaming and local MLBTV access. I hope so.

Andrew Brewer 09/19/2024

Good to see Marte tag one for his first hit of the day !

RedsGettingBetter 09/19/2024

Rosario is doing nothing in this team… horrendous

JB 09/19/2024

9 for 52, .173 average. Glad he keeps playing. SMH

Andrew Brewer 09/19/2024

(8) four seam fast balls to Dunn, and he gets called out on a ball just outside…

RedsGettingBetter 09/19/2024

bad ump call for strike 3 for Dunn… unlucky

Tom Diesman 09/19/2024

Yeah, it’s a shame the umpire took his perfect day away from him on a bad call.

Andrew Brewer 09/19/2024

Who will the Reds put on the mound for the 9th ? Well, it can’t be Maile because he’s catching.

Andrew Brewer 09/19/2024

A 4th inning for Leibrandt …

Andrew Brewer 09/19/2024

OMG, a homerun with two on, makes it 15-3 …

RedsGettingBetter 09/19/2024

Another 3-run homer , just unbelievable… The run differential is in jeopardy…

RedsGettingBetter 09/19/2024

Leibrandt just living the experience to thow in a big league game but he doesn’t belong

The Duke 09/19/2024

He’s happy to be here for every $4400 game check for rookie minimum.

Kevin H 09/19/2024

Anyone who puts on a MLB jersey belongs. Kudos to him for battling today.

Andrew Brewer 09/19/2024

He takes the count full on De La Cruz with two outs in the 9th… and Elly refuses to make the last out, giving Hinds another at bat.

Andrew Brewer 09/19/2024

And that’s a wrap, Braves leave their mark on the Reds 15-3.

Tom Diesman 09/19/2024

Braves had it going strong today. Great day for Blake Dunn. Let’s sweep the Pirates this weekend.

Dennis Westrick 09/19/2024

Yes! Need to sweep the Pie-Rats or win 2 of 3 a least to ensure the Reds don’t end up in the NL Central Division cellar!

Dennis Westrick 09/19/2024

Last time I checked, there are 27 outs per side in a standard 9-inning baseball game!

Going into the bottom of the 9th inning, the Reds had 13 strikeouts, just less that 50% of the outs!

Never lost faith that the Reds could surpass the 50%+ mark with Benson due up!

Benson did not disappoint! Who says Benson is an underachiever?

Roger Garrett 09/19/2024

Six homers allowed and 4 three run shots I believe.I vote we just read the wrap up,avoid any post game,avoid any videos unless its the ones with Dunn,stay away from ESPN and MLB and move on to tomorrow.All in?

Oldtimer 09/19/2024

I’ve always thought Cincinnati sports “fans” are among the worst anywhere, with Reds fans on top of the list. RLN provides some evidence to support my theory.

How many cities with fewer than 500K population have a pro sports team? How many have TWO? Not very many answers either question.

Jim Walker 09/19/2024

OT>>> I come with a population of 2.5m for Hamilton, Clermont, Warren, Butler, and Montgomery counties in Ohio plus Boone and Campbell counties in Ky. I’d guess those are all in Cincinnati’s 60 minute drive market. I could have have added my home county (Greene in OH at ~170K and Clark, OH at 136K and pushed that total to nearly 6m) and still been within 60-70 minutes for all. And I didn’t add any Indiana counties because I am not familiar with them.

RedsMonk65 09/19/2024

Jim — I like the way you put things!

CI3J 09/19/2024

The Cincinnati Metropolitan area, which is the number you want to look at if you want to judge a city’s TRUE population, is made up of 2 million+ people.

I’m not even sure why you are talking about this, though.

Justin T 09/19/2024

In 1947 and 1963 the Reds were known to have the best fans in baseball. They ended up winning the series in 75 and 76 because of it.

VegasRed 09/19/2024

OT you are the quintessential fan this ownership counts on, so congrats on that. I am happy you are happy with everything this organization does, even if you are grumpy/ disgusted or frustrated by every other co-fan who fans differently than you do.

Seriously, I’m glad somebody who is a bona fide, die hard reds fan is satisfied with what this regime is serving up. Cheers, Sir!

Mike W 09/19/2024

Dang! I played golf this morning and then was busy with the stock market and just now looked today on my ESPN app to see what time our game was today — only to learn we already played! From the box score I can see the misuse/over use of our RPs the last couple of days left us with very few pitching choices. I see 3:40 PST tomorrow. Watch out Pirates, here come the Reds! (Thank God the Pirates have lost their last 3, or we’d be in last place.)

Mike W 09/19/2024

As of right now only 8 of the 30 MLB teams have been eliminated from playoff contention. Unfortunately the Reds are 1 of those 8. Even more embarrassing, the 1st place team in our division (Brewers) has the worst 1st place record in the NL and we’re still eliminated! Please sell the team Bob, or at least announce the promotion of Mr. Bell to a (high paying) front office job.
