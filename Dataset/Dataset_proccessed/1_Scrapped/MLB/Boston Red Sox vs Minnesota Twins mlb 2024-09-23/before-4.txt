Boston Red Sox vs Toronto Blue Jays Prediction

I’m leaning toward the Red Sox. Houck is just 0-1 in his last three starts, but he hasn’t pitched too badly overall. In the defeat, Houck put up four earned on five hits and a walk in 5.0 innings versus the Mets. In the two other games, he’s got 10.0 innings with one earned on seven hits and two walks combined.

On Sunday the Sox had a couple of sizable wins to cap off the series in style. Boston notched 11 hits in game one, then followed it up with 10 more in the nightcap. The Red Sox only used two pitchers in game two as well, so they should be in decent shape behind Houck on Monday.
