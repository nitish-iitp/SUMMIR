OAKLAND, Calif. — The American League wild-card race is wild with a week to go in the regular season.

With the Royals and Twins collapsing after having a stronghold on the second and third spots for weeks, the Tigers have taken advantage and the Mariners still have hope with the Rays and Red Sox still longshots instead of being eliminated.

On Sunday, the Tigers jumped the Twins into a playoff position and tied the Royals for the second and third wild cards.

RESTORING THE GLORY

The Tigers gained ground by winning 5-4 in Baltimore while the Royals lost 2-0 to the Giants in Kansas City and the Twins were hammered by the Red Sox in both games of a doubleheader at Fenway Park, 8-1 and 9-3.

The Royals have dropped seven in a row, the last six at home. Over the weekend, they were outscored 13-1 while being swept by Giants.

Heading into the final week, the Orioles have a four-game cushion for the first AL wild card, the Royals and Tigers are tied for the second and the Twins are a game back. The Mariners are two games out of a spot, the Red Sox and Rays four back.

Kerry Carpenter was 2-for-2 with a homer and two RBI for the Tigers in their win over the Orioles, who have lost 10 of their last 14.

In the Red Sox sweep, Triston Casas was 3-for-4 with three homers and seven RBI in Game 1 and Romy Gonzalez hit a three-run homer in the nightcap.

The Twins have lost four of five and 13 of 19.

The Mariners blew a shot to get to within one game of a wild-card spot by not holding a 5-0 sixth-inning lead against the host Rangers, who pulled out a 6-5 home victory on a ninth-inning, walk-off single by Marcus Semien.

Elsewhere …

-- Aaron Judge hit home run No. 55 in a 7-4 Yankees win in Oakland that completed a weekend sweep and cut their magic number to one for winning the AL East. They can clinch this week by winning one of three games when the Orioles are in the Bronx on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights.

-- The Mets moved into a tie with the Diamondbacks for the second NL wild card and prevented the Phillies from clinching the NL West with a 2-1 win at Citi Field. The Mets have the tiebreaker with Arizona and are two games up on the Braves heading into a three-game series in Atlanta.

-- The Braves stayed two games out of an NL wild-card position by winning 5-4 in Miami.

-- The Padres’ magic number for a playoff berth is one after they scored three in the eighth to rally for a 4-2 win over the visiting White Sox, who were handed loss No. 120 to tie the ‘62 Mets for the most since 1900.

-- Shohei Ohtani was 4-for-5 with his 53rd homer plus his 54th and 55th steals in a 6-5 Dodgers comeback win over the Rockies in Los Angeles. The NL West-leading Dodgers stayed three games up on the second-place Padres heading into three head-to-heads this week at Dodger Stadium. If the Dodgers win the series, they’ll clinch the division.

-- The Guardians’ 2-1 loss in St. Louis left them two games behind the Yankees’ for best AL record. The Yankees also have the tiebreaker.

-- The Diamondbacks blew an 8-0 lead in losing 10-9 to the host Brewers, who scored four in the eighth to turn a 9-6 deficit into 10-9 lead that held up.

-- Star closer Josh Hader allowed four ninth-inning runs after entering with a 6-5 lead and the AL West-leading Astros lost 9-8 at home to the Angels to remain five games ahead of the second-place Mariners. The Astros can claim the division this week at home with one win in three games against Seattle.
