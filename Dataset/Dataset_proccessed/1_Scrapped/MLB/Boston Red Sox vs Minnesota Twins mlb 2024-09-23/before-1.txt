Latches on with O's
O'Neill signed a three-year, $49.5 million contract with the Orioles on Saturday, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports.
Impact O'Neill enjoyed a breakout campaign after moving to Boston in 2024, slashing .241/.336/.511 with 31 home runs and 61 RBI across 473 regular-season plate appearances. Much of the 29-year-old's success came against southpaws, whom he posted a 1.179 OPS against in 156 plate appearances. Now in Baltimore, O'Neill will likely form a platoon in one of the corner outfield positions, filling in for either Colton Cowser or Heston Kjerstad against left-handed starters.

Sitting for regular-season finale
O'Neill is out of the Red Sox's lineup Sunday against the Rays, Christopher Smith of MassLive.com reports.
Impact The Red Sox will start Jarren Duran, Ceddanne Rafaela and Wilyer Abreu in the outfield for the regular-season finale. O'Neill battled multiple injuries this season, and unless he pinch hits Sunday, he'll end his first year in Boston with a slash line of .241/.336/.511 with 31 home runs and 61 RBI across 473 plate appearances.

Out of Boston's lineup
O'Neill is not in the lineup for Friday's game against the Rays, Chris Cotillo of MassLive.com reports.
Impact O'Neill has been in and out of the lineup lately, making just two starts over the last six contests. He missed the first two of those tilts with a back injury, although it's not clear whether the back is a factor in his two other absences. Jarren Duran is in left field for the Red Sox on Friday.

Not in Tuesday's lineup
O'Neill is absent from the lineup in Tuesday's game versus the Blue Jays, Jen McCaffrey of The Athletic reports.
Impact O'Neill returned to the lineup Monday at designated hitter after missing both ends of Sunday's doubleheader with a back issue. It's not clear whether it's his back that's keeping him out of Tuesday's lineup. Jarren Duran and Wilyer Abreu will be in the corner outfield spots for the Red Sox.

Returns to lineup Monday
O'Neill (back) will start at designated hitter and bat fourth in Monday's game versus the Blue Jays.
Impact O'Neill sat out both ends of Sunday's doubleheader against the Twins due to a back injury, but he's feeling well enough to hit in Monday's contest. With O'Neill handling DH duties, Masataka Yoshida is getting a breather.

Remains out for Game 2
O'Neill (back) is out of the lineup for the second game of Sunday's doubleheader with the Twins, Mac Cerullo of the Boston Herald reports.
Impact The Red Sox will give O'Neill both ends of the twin bill off as he deals with what manager Alex Cora described earlier Sunday as minor back tightness. Jarren Duran will occupy O'Neill's typical spot in left field for the second game of the doubleheader.

Nursing back tightness
Red Sox manager Alex Cora said Sunday that O'Neill is dealing with some minor back tightness, Mac Cerullo of the Boston Herald reports.
Impact O'Neill is not in the lineup for the first game of Sunday's doubleheader against the Twins, although Cora didn't rule him out for the nightcap. Consider O'Neill day-to-day for the time being.

Sitting out first game
O'Neill is not in the lineup for the first game of Sunday's doubleheader against the Twins, Mac Cerullo of the Boston Herald reports.
Impact O'Neill will surely be back in the lineup for the nightcap, but he will begin the first game of the twin bill on the bench. Jarren Duran is in left field and Ceddanne Rafaela is in center for the first contest.

Resting Saturday
O'Neill is out of the lineup for Saturday's game against Minnesota, Jen McCaffrey of The Athletic reports.
Impact O'Neill had made 17 straight starts, likely making Saturday's absence from the starting nine nothing more than an off day. O'Neill is hitless in his last 15 at-bats, but he had homered six times in nine games before the slump. Jarren Duran, Ceddanne Rafaela and Wilyer Abreu fill the outfield from left to right.

Clobbers 31st homer
O'Neill went 1-for-4 with a two-run home run Sunday against the Yankees.
Impact O'Neill's two-run blast was the culmination of a nine-pitch at-bat and represented the only runs the Red Sox would muster on the day. The homer was O'Neill's 31st of the season, the second time he's reached the 30-homer threshold in his career and leaving him just three shy of matching his career high that was set in 2021.
