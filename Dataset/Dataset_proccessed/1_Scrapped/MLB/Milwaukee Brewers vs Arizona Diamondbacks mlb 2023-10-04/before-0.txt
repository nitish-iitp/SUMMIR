Players who "grew" in the offseason and are now "6'11" 
Quote

Post#1 » by cupcakesnake » Tue Oct 3, 2023 8:37 pm

Every year there's casual quotes from coaches, teammates or various other team officials indicating a growth spurt.
Seems like it happens every couple seasons with Jayson Tatum (he must be 7'2" now just like Jonathan Kuminga!). Last offseason it was Ant growing to 6'6" (but he never looked any different by my eye).

The guys I've heard it this offseason so far are Scottie Barnes and Jaden McDaniels.

- Jaden is 23 and was 6'9" barefoot when drafted. So he's around 6'10.5" in shoes so this isn't really a stretch, even if he didn't grow.
- Scottie is 22 and was 6'7" barefoot when drafted. He's have to legit grow 2+ inches for this claim to even be defendable. It's not impossible at his young age, and his near 7'3" wingspan already have him big man size.

Anyone else hearing about any mythological growth spurts? Any believable ones?

Barnes is trolling. Who grows 4" over a summer at 22 years old?

The rumor amongst Rockets fans two months ago was that Alperen Sengun had grown from 6'10'' to 7' or maybe 6'11'', but I think maybe everyone has walked all of that talk back.

Clippers go on a 15-0 run right after this, and eventually win the game.

Lebron measured 6'7.25" w/o shoes at 18 years of age. He clearly looks taller than that now, even though nobody ever made claims about some magical summertime growth spurt.

There were stories about a "summertime" growth spurt for KG. To me KG grew between 1-2 inches about 2 years after being drafted. He clearly looked taller.

Paul George allegedly went from 6' 7.75" to 6'9" a couple years after being drafted. I dunno about this one. I kind of put it in the same boat as Ant Edwards. He really didn't look any taller.

AD I think definitely grew. He measured out at 6' 9.25" w/o shoes at the combine, but he pretty much looks eye to eye with most 6'11" guys. Of course he'll probably deny this because he doesn't want to play center.

With Kuminga now at 7'2", Tatum is probably 7'4" by now.
Brian Geltzeiler: You see Mark Jackson getting a head coaching job as early as next year?

Adrian Wojnarowski: Not if people make calls on him. Not if an organization is doing their homework and knows all the things he brings with him.

The only real one that I remember being real was Hedo Türkoğlu from being 6’8 to being 6’10.

They standardised heights a while back to be barefoot measurements (i.e. not include shoes)


Interestingly, these measurements are of player's heights without their shoes and are rounded to the nearest inch. Since the players don't play without shoes, many of the NBA's players have lost some height on their official records.

Alpi came in 6'10 barefoot and he was one of the youngest players in his draft (had just turned 18 IIRC). After two years, he claims to be 6'11 barefoot - which is a 7 footer for most of NBA history (they used to measure players in shoes). That's pretty reasonable. Rockets officially listed him 6'11 yesterday.

If you watch his rookie games vs his games with Turkey last month, he's clearly taller. To me at least.

Supposedly Ousmane Dieng is now 6'11. Not too hard to believe given he was 6'10 last year and only recently turned 20.

Nba is like online dating. Everybody adds 1 or 2 inches to their actual height. SMH.
