The Milwaukee Brewers once again failed to win a playoff series as they lost two consecutive games against the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 2023 Wild Card Series.  Despite having post-season appearances in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2023 they have not won a playoff series since their magical run in 2018.  Following the teams early exit fans took to social media to express their frustrations.

Milwaukee Brewers fans are furious with the teams early 2023 post-season exit after being swept by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the Wild Card Series.  

 

Sick of hearing about this team’s “success.” So glad we got this 27 hour bite of the apple.

Though Counsell could’ve made some better decisions here and there, he only could’ve done so much. The offense scored 5 whole runs and the pitching gave up 11. Maybe he could’ve squeezed out a few more runs, but the execution still wasn’t there. That’s on the players.

Major notes.

Brewers had horrible batted ball luck. Lots of balls right at defenders.

Roster construction and usage was poor by CC. If we weren’t going to use some bats, get an extra arm. Too many poor L/L match ups.

Woodruff injury was a non factor.
