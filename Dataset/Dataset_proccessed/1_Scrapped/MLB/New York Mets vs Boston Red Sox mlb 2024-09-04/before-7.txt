Boston Red Sox vs New York Mets Prediction

I’m leaning Mets. It’ll depend on what the starters do, though. Megill is 1-0 in his last two appearances with two earned in 7.1 innings combined. As for Houck, he gave up six earned in 6.0 innings on August 25 to the Diamondbacks but came back with 6.0 clean frames versus Detroit in his next start.

On Tuesday the Mets got a nice start from David Peterson, who went 6.0 frames with one earned and 11 Ks. Overall the pen wasn’t terrible (though Jose Butto gave up a run) and the three homers on offense certainly helped. I think New York’s got a good chance at another W on Wednesday.
