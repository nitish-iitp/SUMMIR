St. Louis Cardinals vs Milwaukee Brewers Prediction

I’ll stay with the Brewers. Rea hasn’t been spectacular over his last two starts though, notching seven earned in 10.2 innings. That said, Rea is 2-0 in his last three combined with seven earned in 17.2 frames. As for Gray, he’s 1-1 in his last pair with six earned in 12.0 innings.

On Tuesday the Brewers got three RBI off a pair of homers, however not much else was happening offensively. A lot of guys saw use out of the bullpen, so it’ll be important for Rea to have a lengthy start Wednesday. Should be another good one.
