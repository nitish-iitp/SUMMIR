SAN DIEGO PADRES
MLB Playoff Picture 2023: Updated Standings, Wild Card After Padres Eliminated

Another payroll giant was eliminated from playoff contention Thursday night.

With the Miami Marlins 4-3 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Padres were mathematically eliminated from being able to clinch the final wild card slot in the national league despite going 8-2 over its last 10 games.

At 163 million, the Padres have the third-highest payroll in MLB. They join No. 1 and No, 2 in the New York Mets and New York Yankees, respectively, in being eliminated from the playoffs.

Much like the Mets, San Diego's performance was extremely disappointing considering its 2022 campaign, having made it all the way to the NLCS and coming within three wins of appearing in the World Series.

But now, they'll be watching from the sidelines as their rival Los Angeles Dodgers try to capture another title.

Here is the current playoff picture following the Padres' elimination.

Considering the number of elite level players on its roster like Fernando Tatis, Manny Machado, Xander Bogaerts, among others, it's incredible to believe that this Padres squad couldn't make the postseason.

But this season has showed that payroll doesn't mean much if an organization isn't able to execute with it.

The Arizona Diamondbacks, Tampa Bay Rays and Baltimore Orioles are all in the lower third of MLB in terms of roster cost and have all punched their tickets to the postseason.

The Orioles are set to be the No. 1 seed in the American league and they have the third-lowest payroll in MLB.
