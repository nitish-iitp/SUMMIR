ARLINGTON — Ahead of Game 3 of the ALDS, Rangers fans already had their sights set on the next round.

With the Rangers leading the Orioles 2-0 entering Texas’ first home game of the series, fans in the Globe Life Field concourse were fairly confident the team would clinch the sweep Tuesday night. That meant sights were set on the ALCS set to begin this weekend and who the Rangers would play.

The Houston Astros lead the Minnesota Twins 2-1 in their ALDS series and have a chance to clinch Wednesday at 1:07 p.m. The Twins would have to win two more, including Game 5 in Houston on Friday.

With the Rangers set to hit the road regardless of opponent, fans were split on whether they wanted their beloved team to make the quick trip over to Houston or travel up north to face Minnesota.

Jayce Jenkins, a lifelong Rangers fan and Arlington resident, didn’t hesitate when saying he wanted the Rangers to face their divisional rival next round.

“They’ve owned the AL West,” he said. “They’ve had our number this year. If we’re going to go to the World Series, I want to go through Houston.”

However, Erik Harding of Fort Worth wasn’t as enthusiastic. He said he’d much rather the Rangers face the Twins.

“We didn’t do too good against Houston this year,” he said. “I think it would be really cool for the state of Texas, but there’s something about when somebody’s got your number.”

The Astros beat the Rangers in nine of 13 meetings this season and narrowly clinched the division title. The Twins beat the Rangers in five of seven contests.

Rangers fans on X, formerly known as Twitter, were just as split. A Dallas Morning News poll saw the Twins take a slight advantage with 51.6% of the votes. Some said they wanted an easier road. Others said they wanted revenge.

While Wednesday or Friday will ultimately decide where the Rangers head next, many fans said their team will be ready to take on whichever hand they’re dealt.

“It doesn’t matter,” Andy Osteen of Arlington said. “Bring it on.”
