FanDuel Baseball Promo Offer: 30% Profit Boost for MLB Same Game Parlay on 8/30/24
FANDUEL STAFF
5mo

We're approaching the home stretch of the 2024 MLB regular season, but there's still plenty of time to get in on the action at FanDuel. With all 30 teams playing tonight, FanDuel is offering an MLB Profit Boost to ALL customers.

All customers get a 30% Profit Boost to use on a 3+ leg Same Game Parlay wager on any MLB game happening August 30th!

There are several marquee matchups to consider for this boost, headlined by a National League East clash between the Atlanta Braves and Philadelphia Phillies. Philly is firmly atop the division, while Atlanta holds a three-game advantage for the final Wild Card spot.

This will be the 11th head-to-head matchup of the season between the division rivals. The Braves hold a 6-4 advantage on the season, but the Phillies won last night's series-opener, 5-4. Reynaldo Lopez (7-4, 2.02 ERA) is scheduled to start for Atlanta with Ranger Suarez (11-5, 2.82 ERA) toeing the rubber for Philly.

First pitch is slated for 6:41 pm ET. Here are the current Braves-Phillies odds on FanDuel Sportsbook.
