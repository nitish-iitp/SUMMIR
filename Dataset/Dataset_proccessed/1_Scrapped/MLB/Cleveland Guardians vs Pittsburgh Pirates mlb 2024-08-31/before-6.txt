Losing out on playing time
DeJong is out of the lineup for Monday's game against the Tigers.
Impact DeJong looks to have lost hold of a regular spot in the Kansas City infield, as he'll hit the bench against a right-handed starting pitcher (Reese Olson) for the fourth time in the last five games. Adam Frazier will enter the lineup at third base in place of DeJong, who is getting on base at a .154 clip with a 30.8 percent strikeout rate since the start of September.

Sitting down Saturday
DeJong isn't in the Royals' lineup Saturday versus Pittsburgh.
Impact DeJong will sit for the second consecutive game after going 3-for-21 with an RBI and eight strikeouts to begin the month of September. Maikel Garcia will step in as Kansas City's third baseman and bat eighth.

Idle Friday
DeJong is out of the lineup for Friday's game against Pittsburgh.
Impact DeJong is out of the lineup for the third time in four games, with Adam Frazier slotting in at third base Friday. Since being dealt to Kansas City, DeJong has slashed .239/.294/.467 across 30 games. However, he's merely 3-for-19 in September.

Sitting amid slump
DeJong is out of the lineup for Wednesday's game against the Yankees.
Impact DeJong will hit the bench for the second time in three games while he's gotten off to a 3-for-19 start to September. Since joining the Royals ahead of the trade deadline, DeJong has put together a respectable .244/.300/.478 slash line, so the team likely isn't ready to pull the plug on him just yet as a near-everyday player.

Absent from lineup
DeJong is not in the starting lineup for Monday's game against the Yankees.
Impact DeJong has gone 3-for-26 with one home run, 13 RBI and 13 strikeouts over his last eight games, and he will begin Monday's series opener on the bench. Maikel Garcia will start at third base and bat seventh.

Sitting Friday
DeJong is not in Friday's lineup against the Twins.
Impact DeJong has seemingly taken over the primary third base duties of late, with Maikel Garcia often manning second base and Michael Massey seeing time at designated hitter. In Friday's arrangement, however, DeJong is the odd man out against righty Zebby Matthews.

Homers in Friday's loss
DeJong went 1-for-3 with a two-run home run and a walk in Friday's 3-2 loss to the Astros.
Impact DeJong's game-tying homer off Josh Hader in the top of the ninth inning was just the second hit of the game for the Royals. Over his last 13 games, DeJong has gone 14-for-45 (.311) with five homers, three doubles, 10 RBI and 10 runs scored, though he's struck out 19 times in that span. For the year, DeJong is at a .238/.289/.458 slash line with 24 homers, 55 RBI, 52 runs scored, two stolen bases and 17 doubles over 124 games between the Royals and the White Sox. His recent results are encouraging, but a continually high strikeout rate makes him prone to regression.

Goes deep again in win
DeJong went 1-for-2 with a two-run homer and a walk in Tuesday's 6-1 victory over Cleveland.
Impact The Kansas City infielder opened the game's scoring when he launched a 395-foot, two-run homer off Gavin Williams in the second inning for his fifth long ball with the Royals. DeJong continues to swing a sizzling bat with his new club, hitting .304 (17-for-56) with 12 RBI, 10 runs scored and 7:20 BB:K across 19 games. He is playing roughly two-thirds of the time as he splits at-bats on the infield with Maikel Garcia and Michael Massey. Overall, DeJong is slashing .239/.290/.458 in 427 plate appearances this season while playing for the Royals and White Sox.

Goes yard in nightcap
DeJong went 2-for-4 with a solo home run, a walk and an additional run scored in a 9-4 win over the Guardians in Game 2 of Monday's doubleheader.
Impact DeJong didn't play in the matinee, but he was able to make an impact while starting at third base in the nightcap. The infielder has gone 11-for-32 (.344) with three homers, three doubles and six RBI over his last nine contests. For the season, he has a .238/.288/.450 slash line with 22 homers, 51 RBI, 48 runs scored, 17 doubles and two stolen bases over 120 games between the Royals and the White Sox. DeJong is not an everyday player in Kansas City, but he hasn't been limited to platoon duties since Maikel Garcia occasionally shifts over to cover second base.

Taking seat for first game of day
DeJong is out of the lineup for the first game of Monday's doubleheader with the Guardians.
Impact Maikel Garcia will step in at third base while DeJong heads to the bench for the opening game of the twin bill. Since being acquired from the White Sox on July 30, DeJong has slashed an impressive .280/.339/.520 over 17 games with the Royals, which has resulted in him poaching some playing time in the infield from Garcia and Michael Massey.

On bench, but picking up playing time
DeJong is out of the lineup for Wednesday's game against the Angels.
Impact DeJong will hit the bench after he had started in five of the past six games while going 7-for-20 with two home runs and two doubles. Though he'll give way to Maikel Garcia in the series finale, DeJong may be the Royals' preferred option of the two at third base while he's swinging a hotter bat at the moment. Garcia has turned in a weak .575 OPS since the beginning of August and was on the bench in each of the Royals' previous three matchups with right-handers.
