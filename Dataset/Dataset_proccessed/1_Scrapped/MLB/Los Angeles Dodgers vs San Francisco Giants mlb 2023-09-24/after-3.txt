Dodgers Highlights: Clayton Kershaw, J.D. Martinez, Max Muncy & More From Win Against Giants

The Los Angeles Dodgers received five scoreless innings from Clayton Kershaw and added onto their lead throughout the night in a 7-0 win against the San Francisco Giants.

J.D. Martinez lit the spark for the Dodgers offense in the second inning with his 31st home run of the season. Martinez followed that with a two-run double in the third.

Freddie Freeman’s 57th double brought in Austin Barnes and Max Muncy added an RBI single that extended the Dodgers’ lead to 5-0 in the fifth inning.

The Dodgers capped off their scoring on a two-run double from Mookie Betts in the seventh inning.

That gave Betts an MLB-record 105 RBI out of the leadoff spot. The previous record belonged to Charlie Blackmon, who had 103 RBI as the leadoff man during the 2017 season.

“It seems like every night we’re eclipsing milestones as individuals. Mookie’s season is near unprecedented,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after the game.

The run support was more than enough for Kershaw in an encouraging performance that was followed by scoreless work from Joe Kelly, Michael Grove and Caleb Ferguson.

Kershaw only allowed two hits and issued two walks. He finished with five strikeouts and was aided by David Peralta making a diving catch to end the fifth inning.

Kershaw moved into second place all-time in Dodgers franchise history with 210 career wins. He entered the night tied with Don Drysdale.

Dodgers NLDS games

Coupled with the Milwaukee Brewers losing earlier in the day, the Dodgers clinched a first-round bye and will begin the 2023 MLB postseason in the National League Division Series.

Game 1 of the NLDS is at Dodger Stadium on Saturday, October 7, with Game 2 scheduled two days later. If necessary, Game 5 of the NLDS would be back at Dodger Stadium on October 14.
