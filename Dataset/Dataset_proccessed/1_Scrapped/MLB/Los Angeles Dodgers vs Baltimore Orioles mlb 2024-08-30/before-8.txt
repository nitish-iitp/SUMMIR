Shohei Ohtani had a very big day in L.A., Ken looks at the Brewers’ unlikely rookie ace, the Nationals are budding like cherry blossoms in D.C. and we tell you about Charlie Morton’s 183 apologies. I’m Levi Weaver, here with Ken Rosenthal — welcome to The Windup!

Ohtani Day in L.A.: What would you do for a bobblehead?

By the time Shohei Ohtani’s dog Decoy delivered the first pitch, it was more than eight hours after the line for entry had already begun outside Dodger Stadium. Eight hours! Why? It was Shohei Ohtani bobblehead night.

Not just any bobblehead — it featured both Ohtani and Decoy. Forty thousand were scheduled to be given away, with a limited number of them being special all-gold inserts. 

With 53,000 tickets sold, a few folks decided to get an absurdly early start to make sure they didn’t miss out.

But it wasn’t the only Ohtani collectible news of the day. The Japanese superstar has now signed a “long-term” deal with Fanatics allowing the company — which owns Topps — the exclusive right to feature Ohtani in a Dodgers uniform on trading cards, including on-card autographs and game-used memorabilia.

It’s not Fanatics’ first exclusive deal with a global superstar. LeBron James and Tom Brady are already on the roster. Mark Puleo has all the details — with quotes from David Leiner, president of trading cards at Fanatics Collectibles — in today’s story.

As for the on-field action, Ohtani didn’t let his patient fans down: He went 2-for-4 with a solo home run and two stolen bases in the first-place Dodgers’ 6-4 win over the 77-57 Orioles. He’s now sitting at 42/42 in his quest to become the first 50/50 player in big-league history.

Ken’s Notebook: From ‘no chance’ to ace

From my feature story today: 

He was No. 80 in spring training, a non-roster invitee, one of the first players the Brewers cut.

“He was not one of our top 25 pitchers,” Milwaukee manager Pat Murphy said, which seems hard to believe, considering that rookie right-hander Tobias Myers is now arguably the ace of a first-place team with nine-game lead in the National League Central.

Murphy, though, was not exaggerating.

The Brewers invited 32 pitchers to spring training. They re-assigned three to minor-league camp in their first round of cuts on March 5. They shipped out three more on March 10, including Myers.

“I really didn’t know much about him,” said Murphy, who is in his first season as Brewers manager after spending eight years as their bench coach, “other than I knew he had no chance to make the team.”

Myers’ expectations also were low. The Brewers are his sixth organization. In 2022, he went 1-15 with a 7.82 ERA pitching for three different clubs at Triple A. His goal this season was to reach the majors. If it happened, he figured it would be in the role he and the Brewers discussed in spring training — long relief.

Brewers general manager Matt Arnold had slightly higher expectations, thinking Myers eventually could figure into the rotation mix. The team in November 2022 signed Myers to a two-year minor-league deal with precisely that idea in mind. Yet, even after Myers showed improvement at Triple A last season, the Brewers declined to add him to their 40-man roster, exposing him to the Rule 5 draft. Not that it was much of a gamble. Every team passed on Myers rather than pay $100,000 for him with the requirement that he stay on the major-league roster all season.

Myers, 26, seemed destined to remain on the fringes, just as he had for eight professional seasons. He was traded three times, designated for assignment by a fourth club, released by a fifth. He kept going, making 20 or more minor-league starts in 2018 and each season from 2021 to ‘23. But his brief stint with the Brewers in major-league camp was typical of his spotty career. In eight innings, Myers had a 7.88 ERA.

It turns out, though, he was with the right team — a team that suffered one pitching injury after another early in the season, creating opportunity even for a journeyman who wore No. 80 in camp.

Vibe Check: Is something brewing in D.C.?

I don’t want to overreact just because the Nationals won a series against the Yankees. After all, it came on the heels of a series loss to Atlanta, and the Nats are now just 61-73 (1 1/2 games worse than the Pirates, for context).

They’re not good. But they’re getting closer.

The call-up of top prospect Dylan Crews on Monday was the latest bit of excitement, but not the only cause for optimism for a franchise that has gone 278-402 in the four-plus years since winning the 2019 World Series.

In the intervening years, the Nats have undergone a massive roster overhaul. Here is a list of every player who played for the Nats in both 2019 and 2024: Patrick Corbin and Tanner Rainey. End of list. (Although Carter Kieboom has been in Triple A all year).

The vision is starting to take shape, though:

CJ Abrams — who came over in the Juan Soto deal — is still just 23. He has waned in the second half, but had an OPS of .860 as recently as July 7.
James Wood has held his own in his debut season; the 21-year-old went into last night’s game with an OPS+ of 130 (or, at .803, 30 percent higher than the league average). He also stole three bases last night, his ninth, 10th and 11th of the year.
Luis García Jr. isn’t far behind him, with an OPS+ of 122. After debuting just after his 20th birthday, he’s in his fifth MLB season.
Jacob Young’s OPS (.656) isn’t all that impressive, but the 25-year-old’s defense in center field is excellent, and he stole his 31st base of the year last night.
Crews, 22, hit his first home run (and second double) last night, and has a 1.235 OPS after three games.

As David Aldridge noted earlier this week, there are yet steps to be taken before Washington is ready to contend for real. But the early signs of a contender are starting to sprout.

Hit Man: Charlie Morton, the polite assassin

I don’t know if you’ve taken a pitched baseball off your actual sinew and bones lately, but a reminder: It really hurts. I once saw a shirtless Shin-Soo Choo in the Rangers clubhouse the day after taking a fastball to his right shoulder blade, and the volleyball-sized bruise had tendrils creeping in every direction like a Lichtenberg Figure of pure human suffering.

It’s been at least a half-decade, and the specter of that ghastly contusion still haunts me. But the bigger impression: It cost him a whole zero days on the IL. He was in the lineup later that night.

If anyone ever accuses a big-leaguer of being “soft,” that creeping fractal of misery is always at the front of my mind when I vehemently disagree. Seeing that sort of thing changes a person.

Charlie Morton has been in a lot of big-league clubhouses, certainly witnessing more than a few of those bruises. Maybe that explains this story from Dan Brown, as Morton now sits at 183 batters hit — ninth on the all-time list. 

💬 “I’m a human being who has empathy,’’ Morton said. “I can remember thinking, like, now you gotta wake up with a bruise. Or maybe I did something to a bone. You’re going to roll out of bed with a black-and-blue mark somewhere because I drilled you.”


As Brown — and Morton — note in the story, long gone are the rough-and-tumble days of head-hunting or completely shrugging off a hit-by-pitch as a routine part of the game. As players change teams more often, the fraternal nature of big-leaguers has become a bit less siloed.

Brown does a great job of illustrating something I come back to often: The game is played by humans. Tough, tough humans. And increasingly, humans who remember the humanity of their opponents.

Handshakes and High Fives

Speaking of teams on the come-up: The Detroit Tigers are starting to put things together.

As Emmanuel Clase continues to put up video game numbers in Cleveland, Zack Meisel asks: Could a reliever ever win a Cy Young Award again?

Spencer Arrighetti came six outs short of a no-hitter for the Astros, but a Jose Altuve steal of home was the spark the Houston offense needed.

Tommy Pham was the sentimental spark of the deadline for the Cardinals. As they continue to slide out of contention, would they put him on waivers? And while we’re asking: Would the Phillies eat the rest of Taijuan Walker’s contract?

The Cubs swept the Pirates, but remain cooked … right?

Eno Sarris gives you his starting pitcher rankings for the rest of the season.

I don’t know how WAR is calculated, but if it is literally “wins above replacement,” Travis Jankowski’s should be a +1.0 after last night. One-run lead, two runners on and Andrew Vaughn hits what should have been a walk-off home run for the White Sox …

… and the Rangers won 4-3.
