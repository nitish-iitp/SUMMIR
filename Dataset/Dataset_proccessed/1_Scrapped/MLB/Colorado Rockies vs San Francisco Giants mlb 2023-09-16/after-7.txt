What you need to know for Saturday's MLB games

We certainly don't go out of our way to stream pitchers against the Houston Astros, but we're making an exception for Cole Ragans (rostered in 52% of ESPN leagues), who has pitched like an ace since joining the Kansas City Royals' rotation. Across nine starts, the left-hander holds a 1.69 ERA and 0.99 WHIP with an 11.7 K/9, notching a pair of double-digit strikeout performances. He has also allowed just two runs in his last four starts combined. Yes, Houston's offense is scary. However, there are some pitchers that you start regardless of matchup, and that's how Ragans should be treated right now.

Another super talented young hurler in a tough matchup, Grayson Rodriguez (35%) is set to square off against the Tampa Bay Rays on Saturday. While the Rays are obviously a tough customer, posting a 110 wRC+ so far in September, G-Rod has been awfully good in his own right, delivering a 2.55 ERA and 1.06 WHIP over his last nine starts. During that stretch, he held opponents to three or fewer runs in all nine outings. The fact that he's rostered in just 35% of ESPN leagues is a little baffling.

Andrew Abbott (46%) is in the midst of a rough patch, holding a 6.09 ERA since the beginning of August, but he still finds himself as a potential streamer on Saturday versus the New York Mets. He was initially scheduled to pitch against the Detroit Tigers earlier this week, and that matchup was much more favorable for the lefty. That said, the Mets have been slightly below average against left-handed pitching this season (96 wRC+), so this isn't a spot we necessarily have to avoid. There's some risk here because of the Mets' recent hot hitting, but there's strikeout upside here, too.

J.P. France (23%) has been somewhat up and down of late. Since the middle of August, he has four starts with two or fewer earned runs allowed. However, he also has two outings where he served up 5+ runs, including getting blasted by the Boston Red Sox for 10 runs in just 2 1/3 frames. That type of inconsistency doesn't necessarily make him an ideal streamer, but Saturday's matchup against the Royals is hard to pass up. After all, the Royals rank 23rd in MLB with an 86 wRC+ over the last 30 days, with a 7.2% walk rate that ranks them bottom-five. The hope is that France can take advantage of the soft landing spot.

On the hitting side, the Cleveland Guardians find themselves in an appealing spot against Dane Dunning, one of the day's lowest-ranked hurlers. The right-hander has been slammed for an 8.14 ERA over his last five games, surrendering multiple home runs in three of them. Josh Naylor (71%), Andres Gimenez (52%), Bo Naylor (2%), and Kole Calhoun (1%) all have the platoon advantage in this weekend matchup.

Starting pitcher rankings for Saturday

Pitchers are ranked in order of their Forecaster/Daily Notes projected fantasy points (FPTS), using ESPN's standard scoring system (2 points per win, minus-2 per loss, 3 per inning, 1 per K, minus-1 apiece per hit or walk allowed, minus-2 per earned run allowed).

T: The pitcher's handedness. OPP: Opposing team. RST%: The pitcher's roster percentage in ESPN leagues. ML: Caesars Money Line. O/U: Caesars Over/Under for runs scored. For the projected stat line, W% is the team's win probability using ESPN projections, IP is innings pitched, ER is earned runs allowed and K is strikeouts.

If a team is planning on using an "opener" to start their game, but will rely on a "bulk pitcher" to follow him on the mound after 1-2 innings, the bulk pitcher is listed and indicated with an asterisk.

Bullpen usage watch for Saturday

By Todd Zola

For the fifth time this season, Alexis Diaz recorded five outs in an outing as he collected his 37th save in last night's Cincinnati Reds 5-3 win over the Mets. Diaz only needed 22 pitches to get through the 1 2/3 inning effort, but he had tossed a total of 35 pitches working back-to-back on Tuesday and Wednesday, so the 57 pitches Diaz has thrown over the prior four days jeopardizes his availability for tonight's tilt, though it can't be ruled out since the righty has pitched four out of five days twice already this season. Diaz's support case has also pitched a lot lately with Lucas Sime and Buck Farmer the top candidates to step up if Diaz is given a day to recover.

On Thursday, Devin Williams recorded his 34th save with a perfect frame without any strikeouts. Last night, WIlliams collected his 35th save by striking out the side. Williams used 11 pitches two days ago and another 15 last night, plus 13 on Tuesday, giving him 30 over the previous four gays. Wiliams appeared on three straight days earlier in the year, but it was coming out of the break when he was well rested. While it isn't a sure thing Williams will be held out today, the safe play is reserving him, with Joel Payamps likely filling in as the Milwaukee Brewers closer.

Coors Field is not only trouble for starting pitchers, but relievers as well. Last night, San Francisco Giants closer Camilo Doval incurred its wrath with the Colorado Rockies scoring a pair in the bottom of the ninth to walk it off 3-2. Doval recorded only one out while yielding two hits and a walk. He threw 15 pitches, which came two days after tossing 12 on Wednesday. Doval's usage this season indicates he'll be available for one, but probably not both games of today's doubleheader. Tyler Rogers and Taylor Rogers are risky, but they're both rested and candidates to pitch at least once, if not twice today with holds and perhaps a save a possibility.

Rockies reliever Justin Lawrence hurt his ankle during a delivery last night, leaving Tyler Kinney as their primary closer. Kinney hasn't appeared since Wednesday, so he could pitch twice today.

Jordan Romano garnered his 34th save last night, using 14 pitches in the process. He was appearing with four days' rest, so Romano will be ready if called upon today to log his 35th save, which would tie his career high set last season.

Relief Pitcher Usage Chart

This chart lists the pitchers rostered in at least 50% of ESPN leagues who have been most heavily used recently, signaling they might be unavailable today. Rst% is the player's ESPN roster percentage; the listed date is the pitcher's pitch count from the previous day; P3 is the pitcher's total pitch count from the previous three days; Rest is the pitcher's days of rest; Strk is the number of consecutive days the pitcher has worked.

Best sub-50% rostered hitters for Saturday

Best and worst hitters from the day are generated by THE BAT X, a projection system created by Derek Carty using advanced methods like those used in MLB front offices, accounting for a variety of factors including player talent, ballparks, bullpens, weather, umpires, defense, catcher pitch-framing and lots more.

Mitch Haniger (SF, RF -- 6%) at Kyle Freeland and Peter Lambert

Thairo Estrada (SF, 2B -- 43%) at Freeland and Lambert

THE BAT X's Best Stacks for Today

San Francisco Giants at Peter Lambert

Colorado Rockies vs. Keaton Winn

Atlanta Braves at Bryan Hoeing

Prop of the Day
Cole Ragans O/U 4.5 strikeouts (-155/+120)

PROJECTION

THE BAT sees Ragans putting up 4.4 strikeouts for this matchup on average, while projecting him to exceed his player prop total 45.3% of the time. THE BAT believes there is positive value on the UNDER with an expected value of $20.30.

Note: Expected Value is a measure of how good a bet is, factoring the probability that it will win versus the odds the book is providing. If you were to wager $1.00 100 times on a bet with an Expected Value of $25, you would win some and you would lose some, but in the end you would expect to come away with $25 in profit on your $100 investment.

FACTORS THAT FAVOR THE OVER

Cole Ragans has a large reverse platoon split and should be aided by facing seven opposite-handed hitters today. -

Ragans's 96.1-mph velocity on his fastball this season is a notable 4.6-mph spike from last year's 91.5-mph figure.

FACTORS THAT FAVOR THE UNDER

The Houston Astros are forecasted to have the least strikeout-heavy batting order of all teams on the slate.

John Libka projects as a "hitters umpire" and is expected to be calling pitches today.

Kauffman Stadium grades out as the #29 park in the league for strikeouts, per THE BAT.

As far as temperature and humidity are concerned, the third-most favorable hitting weather on the schedule is expected for this contest.
