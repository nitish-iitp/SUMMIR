Texas Rangers All-Star shortstop Corey Seager exited the Rangers’ game against the Angels with a right forearm contusion Tuesday after being hit by a Reid Detmers pitch in the fifth inning.

Seager remained in the game after trainer Matt Lucero checked on him, but was removed in a platoon swap as the Rangers were down 9-1 in the bottom of the sixth. Josh Smith replaced Seager, Ezequiel Duran replaced Robbie Grossman, Travis Jankowski for Adolis Garcia, Austin Hedges for Jonah Heim. Even Marcus Semien was given rest innings.

So while Seager left the game, Texas was effectively surrendering the game. A good time for the Rangers to start any treatment for Seager.

I think the fact the Rangers pulled a lot of guys at same time as Seager lets you know that they were pretty much just surrendering the game. And, as I mentioned, going to get the treatment started on Seager's bruise.

Corey Seager already missed time twice this season with injuries. He missed a month with a hamstring strain in April and May and hit the IL again in late July with a thumb sprain.

As the Rangers are in a tight playoff race, and lead the AL West over Seattle and Houston, keeping Seager healthy in a losing game would be a priority.
