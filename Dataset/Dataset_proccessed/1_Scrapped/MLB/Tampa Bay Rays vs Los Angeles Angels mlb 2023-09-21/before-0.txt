In a concerning development for Inter Miami, Lionel Messi had to be subbed out before the first half ended in their game against Toronto FC in MLS action on Wednesday night.

According to Gaston Edul and Vero Brunati, Messi has been dealing with a right hamstring strain that kept him out of games against Ecuador with the national team and against Atlanta United last Saturday.

Messi wasn't the only one to leave this game in the first half. In fact, he was the fourth player substituted. Victor Vazquez was replaced by Brandon Servania, who also had to leave just 14 minutes after coming on for Toronto.
