Padres pull Blake Snell after 7 no-hit innings vs. Rockies: Did the effort boost his Cy Young case?

The San Diego Padres pulled starter Blake Snell after he tossed seven no-hit innings against the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday. Here’s what you need to know:

Snell racked up 104 pitches, striking out 10 batters and walking four. Robert Suarez entered the game in relief with the score tied at 0-0.
The 30-year-old Snell had gone seven or more innings in just two previous starts this season and hadn’t thrown more than 113 pitches.
This is the second time in his career the lefty finished with seven no-hit innings, also doing so on Aug. 31, 2021, at Arizona.
The Padres lost a combined no-hitter in the top of the ninth when Josh Hader allowed a leadoff single to Brendan Rodgers. San Diego won the game on a walk-off two-run home run by Xander Bogaerts.

The Athletic’s instant analysis:

What Snell did

In what may have been his final home start at Petco Park, Snell strengthened his resume ahead of free agency. He also bolstered his case as the apparent frontrunner for the National League Cy Young Award.

Snell’s ERA is down to 2.33, almost half a point lower than any other qualifying pitcher in the majors. He is the first Padre to record consecutive outings of at least six scoreless innings with one hit or no hits allowed. He’s also the first big-league pitcher to do so this season.

Over his last 22 starts, Snell has logged a 1.26 ERA. He is attempting to become the seventh pitcher to win a Cy Young Award in both leagues. — Lin

Why Snell was pulled

Because his pitch count was already above 100, and because free agency beckons. There, Snell could command a contract approaching $200 million. The Scott Boras client has spent the summer putting together a lengthy demonstration in run prevention.

With his tendency to throw a lot of pitches, he also has yet to work into the eighth inning. Tuesday, Snell and the fourth-place Padres opted not to risk injury by pushing him further. Snell is scheduled to start the first game of San Diego’s season-ending road trip. — Lin

What they’re saying

“This game will be forgotten about after tomorrow’s game,” Snell said. “I need to be healthy, I need to pitch and I need to be accountable to throw when it’s my turn to pitch. That’s what’s most important.”

Backstory

The 2018 American League Cy Young Award winner and current NL candidate for the accolade entered the day leading the majors with his 2.43 ERA — but also his 93 walks. Snell has tossed 174 innings in 2023, second-most in his career only behind the 180 2/3 during his Cy Young campaign with the Tampa Bay Rays.

The Padres, eliminated from NL West contention, are 5 1/2 games back of a wild-card spot after Tuesday’s action with a 74-78 record.
