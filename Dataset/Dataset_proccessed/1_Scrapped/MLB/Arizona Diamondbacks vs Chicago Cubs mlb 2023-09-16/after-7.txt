PHOENIX — Manager David Ross tried out a new batting order Saturday, with switch hitter Ian Happ reclaiming the leadoff spot for the first time this season.

“Right now, you’re doing anything you can to help the team win,” Happ said.

Ross said the move had a lot to do with Arizona’s bullpen construction as he anticipated matchups after Diamondbacks starter Zach Davies. With switch hitter Jeimer Candelario (strained lower back) on the injured list, batting Happ leadoff let Ross put left-handed hitter Mike Tauchman in the seven-hole. Cody Bellinger hit cleanup, so all three left-handed bats, including Happ, were scattered throughout the lineup.
