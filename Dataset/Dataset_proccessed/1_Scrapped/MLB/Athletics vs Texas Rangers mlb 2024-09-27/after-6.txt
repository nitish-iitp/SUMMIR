Jacob deGrom’s final start of 2024 lets Texas Rangers breathe sigh of relief
After 16 months of elbow surgery rehab deGrom is finally back for good. “It’s nice to know we’ll have a healthy Jacob deGrom next year,” Bruce Bochy said.

ANAHEIM — For the Understatement of the Year, Rangers’ version, we offer this whopper from Bruce Bochy after Game 160 Friday.

“It’s nice to know we’ll have a healthy Jacob deGrom next year,” he said.

DeGrom wrapped up his Rehab and Recovery Tour Friday with four innings against the Los Angeles Angels in the Rangers’ 5-2 win. In his three-start stint to put all the thoughts of elbow surgery behind him, deGrom allowed two runs in 10⅔ innings. He struck out 14 and allowed a homer. Most impressive: A guy throwing 98 mph fastballs and 90 mph sliders and coming off 16 months of rehab post surgery allowed exactly one walk over his three starts. Not bad for simply checking boxes. Imagine what he can do when the focus is execution rather than just proving to himself he’s healthy.

“I felt like this was the best one,” deGrom said after the game. “Early on, I noticed that they were trying to look down and away. So I made an adjustment and was able to pitch up a little bit. My slider felt better. All in all, it just felt like the best one.

“The goal was to get out there and make a few starts and we were able to do that. Everything felt good and it felt like stuff was getting better each time. So it’s a good feeling going into the offseason and getting ready for next year.”

If there was anything to ask about it, it was this: DeGrom threw only 53 pitches in four innings, which ran contrary to what Bochy had laid out as the pre-game plan. He’d said the plan was four five innings or 75 pitches. But, as is the process with guys coming off elbow surgery, sometimes you just decide to not push anything. DeGrom said he felt fine. The Rangers decided that completing four innings of work for the first time was enough of a step. And they’d call it a year.

Now, the next step: To plan the offseason. DeGrom, as you may know, is a pitching freak. He doesn’t like to take more than two weeks off from throwing during the offseason when he’s healthy. But that doesn’t account for throwing a 16-month rehab into the mix. He said he and the Rangers will discuss a program. It could include a couple of extra weeks of rest and then jumping into a throwing program at perhaps a distance of 60 feet instead of 45 feet to start.

There will be time to sort through that. In the meantime, deGrom — and the Rangers — can rest easier. He goes into the offseason healthy. And the Rangers go into the offseason with a true No. 1 starter to place atop their rotation.
