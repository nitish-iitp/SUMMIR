TUCSON, Ariz. (13 News) - The Arizona Wildcats football team moved up in the AP Poll.

The Wildcats moved to Number 20, up one spot from the team’s preseason ranking of 21.

The move follows the Wildcats opening week 60-39 win over New Mexico.

Noah Fifita threw for 422 yards and four touchdowns as the team opened the Brent Brennan era with a 61-39 rout of New Mexico at Arizona Stadium late Saturday, Aug. 31.

Tetairoa McMillan had 304 receiving yards and four touchdowns and was named the AP player of the week.

It was Brennan’s first game as head coach of the Wildcats after spending the last seven seasons at San Jose State. The Wildcats went 10-3 last season in the final year under Jedd Fisch, who took over at Washington.

Arizona will host in-state rival Northern Arizona next week. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 7.

New Mexico, which went 4-8 last season, plays at Auburn next week.
