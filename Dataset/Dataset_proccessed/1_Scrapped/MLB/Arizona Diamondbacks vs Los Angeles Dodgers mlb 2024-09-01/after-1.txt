Randal Grichuk hit a three-run homer in Arizona’s eight-run second inning, Brandon Pfaadt struck out 10 and the Arizona Diamondbacks routed the Los Angeles Dodgers 14-3 on Sunday.

The Dodgers won the series’ first two games by jumping on Arizona early.

The Diamondbacks returned the favor in bashing fashion on Sunday, sending 11 batters to the plate against Justin Wrobleski (1-2) in the second inning.

Eugenio Suárez homered and had two RBIs, and Geraldo Perdomo hit a two-run double in Arizona's big inning. Pfaadt (9-7) was solid after being staked to the big early lead, helping Arizona move back within five games of the Dodgers in the NL West.

The Diamondbacks had 17 hits to end the Dodgers' four-game winning streak. Los Angeles closed out the game with infielder Kiké Hernández pitching the eighth inning.

Wrobleski was added to the roster as a September callup to give the rotation an extra day of rest following Clayton Kershaw's trip to the injured list with a bone spur in his big left toe.

The rookie left-hander's return to the big leagues did not go well.

The Diamondbacks jumped on Wrobleski in the second inning, starting with Grichuk's leadoff double. Suárez, Jose Herrera and Jose Bell each had run-scoring singles in the inning.

With his bullpen already taxed, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts left Wrobleski in the game and Suárez put Arizona up 9-0 with a solo homer in the third. Wrobleski managed to work his way through 5 1/3 innings and was pulled after Corbin Carroll's run-scoring single put Arizona up 10-3.

Wrobleski allowed 10 runs on 10 hits with two strikeouts and two walks.

Pfaadt allowed a run on a groundout in the fourth inning and was chased with two outs in the sixth after giving up two more runs, including one on Austin Barnes' RBI single. Joe Mantiply struck out Shohei Ohtani looking to end the inning. Ohtani went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts.

Pfaadt allowed three runs on eight hits and walked two.

Carroll went 2 for 4 with a walk to reach base in 40 straight starts, breaking Arizona's single-season streak, set by Jay Bell in 1998.

ROSTER ADDITIONS

The Dodgers also added RHP Michael Grove and OF Andy Pages to the roster as September callups before the game. RHP Ben Caparius was optioned to Triple-A Oklahoma City after earning his first big-league win with a scoreless inning Saturday night.

Arizona recalled RHP Slade Cecconi and Of Jorge Barrosa from Triple-A Reno.

TRAINER'S TABLE

Diamondbacks: RF Lourdes Gurriel Jr. left the game hobbling on his left leg after trying to beat out a double play to end the sixth inning.

UP NEXT

Dodgers RHP Jack Flaherty (10-6, 3.07 ERA) faces Diamondbacks LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (2-0, 5.06) in Monday's series finale.
