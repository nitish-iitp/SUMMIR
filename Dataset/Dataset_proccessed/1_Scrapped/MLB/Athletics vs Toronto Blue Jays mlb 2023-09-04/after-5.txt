Zack Gelof was just named the AL Rookie of the Month for his hot August. Esteury Ruiz has surpassed 50 steals in his rookie year. This year might be bleak for the Oakland Athletics, but the future is bright.

And one of those young players believes things will be different in 2024 for the A’s.

Before he was placed on the team’s bereavement list, Lawrence Butler spoke to the media about the future of the A’s organization.

“The A’s have a really bright future. People might think of us as a laughing stock of the league this year, but next year is going to be a whole different story”

Butler was called up to the major on Aug. 11, 2023. In just 23 games with the Oakland Athletics, the first baseman and outfielder has hit four home runs with an .246 batting average and an on-base percentage of .268.

Along with Butler, Gelof and Ruiz, there’s also Tyler Soderstrom. The Turlock native made a brief appearance for the A’s earlier this summer before being sent back to Oakland’s Triple-A affiliate, the Las Vegas Aviators. Oakland’s top prospect played 27 games in the majors before returning to the minor leagues.

“His next opportunity when he comes back, I think he’ll be better for it,” Oakland Athletics manager Mark Kotsay said after explaining the move to send Soderstrom back to the minors.
