The Reds, the Guardians, bunting, and unwritten rules
 Doug Gray  09/26/2024 84

Two nights ago the Cleveland Guardians beat the Cincinnati Reds. That win gave Cleveland a 1st round bye in the playoffs. After the game it appeared on the Guardians social media that the players were celebrating in the clubhouse wearing shirts that said “Cincinnati is in Kentucky”. It appears that those were likely photoshopped by the social team. Last night in Cleveland the Guardians once again topped the Reds. But this time it was the social media team doing a little bit of trolling at the expense of Cincinnati’s baseball team. Cleveland was going with a bullpen day, but that bullpen had a perfect game going through the 6th inning. TJ Friedl led off the 7th with a bunt base hit to break things up. The social media team for the Guardians said this:

Breaking up a perfect game through 6.0 on a bunt? Kentucky Reds behavior.

To be honest, it’s a good troll job with the “Kentucky Reds” thing. But it’s the bunting with a perfect game thing that I’d like to focus on a bit. It’s sort of, kind of an unwritten rule that you shouldn’t bunt at a certain point in a no-hitter/perfect game. Why that is…. well, baseball players like to cry a lot about getting their feelings hurt. It’s why there are so many “unwritten rules” in the game. They can’t handle their emotions well, so they make up these “rules” along the way to justify them throwing a baseball at someone in retaliation for hurting their feelings. Because they are toddlers.

But with TJ Friedl’s bunt there’s a lot more to it. It was a 2-run game at the time. Getting on base means the tying run is at the plate. The “no bunting” rule should be off of the table in this kind of scenario no matter what the inning is.

More specifically to the bunt is that the Guardians players should have absolutely known this was potentially going to happen. TJ Friedl is arguably the best bunt-for-a-hit guy in all of Major League Baseball. He’s been known for his bunting since the time he was in the minor leagues. Way back in 2018 I wrote on the digital pages of Redleg Nation an article titled: TJ Friedl: The Bunt King? and it was all about how to that point in his minor league career he had laid down 75 bunts and turned them into hits 44 times.

This year, injuries have kept Friedl off of the field a bit. And they’ve kept his speed down a little bit, too. As a result, he has bunted less often than he has in the past. Still, since 2022 began, the Reds outfielder had 25 bunt hits entering the game last night. That’s more bunt hits than six entire teams in the same time frame. The rest of the Reds roster during that time had only had 12 bunt hits.

Cleveland’s players either had this information or their team failed them for not giving them this information in the scouting report. Does that mean the Guardians social media team had the information? No. And I really don’t expect them to have that kind of knowledge about opposing team’s players. It’s not their job. Their job is to provide fans with information (be it gameday information, highlights, or some semblance of customer service/support) and get “engagement”. They knocked that last one out of the park last night. It’s got all of Reds-fandom talking and retweeting and replying, and some big dummy (me, I’m the dummy) writing articles about it.

This has been edited to reflect that the shirts were likely photoshopped on a different celebration in the clubhouse by the social media team.

Friedl did nothing wrong. May I remand Cleveland folks that Northern Ohioans are often just Kentuckians who didn’t make it all the way to Michigan.

Good line!

Tremendous!

Don 09/26/2024

You know what…if you don’t want to allow a hit on a bunt, make a play or pitch him up high in the zone. Just won’t whine about it. As you said, Doug, it’s no secret that Friedl is a great bunter. If Luke Maile tried to lay one down, maybe you are a tad upset, but regardless just be a man. There are guys on the other side who want to win as much as you do and they are doing whatever they can do see that through. That is kinda how this game works.

docproc 09/26/2024

These kinds of unwritten rules are just stupid. Friedl’s bunt was perfectly placed and timed.

SteveAReno 09/26/2024

Who wants a batting average of .586 like TJ Friedl had with his bunts? Given the high strikeout rate and nowhere close swings, more Reds need to learn how to bunt more frequently if we want baserunners and to score more runs.

2020ball 09/27/2024

ew, bunts 

I can assure you its not the lack of bunting thats hurting this team, they should probably work on the real reasons first.

Laredo Slider 09/26/2024

I’m old school, don’t break up perfect games with a bunt. BUT, score matters…with Reds down 2-0 Reds needed base runners. Still, if I’m Freidl I’d get ready to wear one when these teams play in ’25.

greenmtred 09/26/2024

And if I were Friedl and a Cleveland pitcher tried to hit me for, essentially, playing baseball the right way, I’d bust his jaw. Maybe if the Reds were down 9-zip in the 9th, you figure the bunt is in poor taste. But maybe not: it isn’t the Reds job to preserve a Guardians no-hitter.

RickDinSD 09/26/2024

Considering that over a third of the Guardians roster aren’t even U.S. citizens, the whole “Kentucky” thing is an exceptionally lame troll job. Yet, honestly what I would expect out of Cleveland.

Doug Gray 09/26/2024

After initially believing they were photoshopped shirts, someone(s) convinced me that they weren’t. Then, after publishing this, someone else convinced me that I was right the first time and I’ve edited and updated the article to reflect that it’s highly likely those shirts didn’t exist.

Dan 09/26/2024

OH! Really?

Kurt Frost 09/26/2024

I under the radar pull for Cleveland when they’re not playing the Reds merely by the Ohio connection with Cincinnati. As a Kentuckian, I’m confused by what they’re implying with the Kentucky Reds thing. Are they attempting to insult me?

Rick 09/26/2024

Kurt, I’m a proud Ky. guy too. I took that as an under handed slap to our Reds, and also to our state. This coming from a city of loser’s known as; Cleveland! Lol

greenmtred 09/26/2024

They are, but they don’t know any better.

jmb 09/27/2024

Yes. My father was born and raised in Cincinnati and lived 90%+ of his life in southern OH. Up until about 2000, he always referred to KY as “backward,” the entire South as well for that matter. OH was industrial, the South wasn’t. I haven’t heard him say that for a long time now. In his old age, he repeats lots of things that used to be true but aren’t any more. But for whatever reason, he no longer thinks of or talks about the South as backward. Regardless, that sentiment must still exist in OH.

MBS 09/27/2024

@Rick, Northen Ohio does act like the southern portion of the state is lesser than them. It happens in Kentucky to. Most people in Northen Kentucky think less of the lower half of the state. The reverses are true as well, “the mistake by the lake” etc…

It’s simple tribalism.

doofus 09/26/2024

Klugo, nice insight.

tseramid 09/26/2024

I can understand the frustration of an opposing batter trying to bunt for hit during a perfect game *if* the pitcher in question is the starter who is throwing the perfect game. As a former player, if I had a once in a lifetime kind of pitching performance where noone could touch my stuff only to have a player try to sneak their way onto first with a bunt, I’d be frustrated. Not frustrated enough to throw at someone, mind you… but frustrated.

All that goes out the window, though on a bullpen day. You are not wrecking any one player’s historic day. A bullpen perfect game is more like — the other team simply can’t hit that day. And while that describes the Reds every day, there is a lot less special about a bullpen perfect game IMO. So, bunt away!

MK 09/26/2024

Heck with that, two-out in the ninth I’m breaking it up with a bunt.

still a red 09/27/2024

I’m with you. The unwritten rule should be that I will do anything legal to break up a perfect game…bunt, take a walk. It can’t be a perfect game if the other team plays along.

Reaganspad 09/27/2024

Yea, really. I wonder what Ty Cobb would think of that. Or Pete Rose. I think TJ is the kind of player that India thinks we need more of

Andrew Brewer 09/26/2024

Yep, bullpen day; my thought exactly. The unwritten rule didn’t apply.

And slaps at Kentucky aren’t handed out well from the Mistake on the Lake.

VaRedsFan 09/26/2024

Nearly everything I’ve read was that there’s no issue with bunting in a close game even if there’s a no-no going. Cleveland announcers even said it was a good move. TV talking heads have to put a topic out there just so they can get a 2-sided discussion. Then they can start yelling at each other, and talking on top of one another. I love when they do this, as it’s an easy move to change the channel. (Unless the remote is on the other side of the room).

Westfester 09/26/2024

This is just lazy by the Cleveland Social team. FC Cincy has been called KFC by the Crew (Precourt did nothing wrong!) since the club’s creation. Come up with your own insults, mistake by the lake!

BK 09/26/2024

Did any Guardian players complain, or is this just social media seeking the spotlight that rightfully belongs to the players? Congrats to the Guardians on another outstanding season. Let’s hope that by sharing a facility with them in Goodyear, at some point, their penchant for winning rubs off on the Reds.

Guardians Fan 09/26/2024

There’s no actual story here. No Guardians players complained about the bunt, and Vogt made clear in his post-game presser that he had no issue with it whatsoever. It was just a joke by a social-media guy. That’s it.

And of course the celebration was photoshopped. They had clubhouse celebrations after clinching the playoffs and then again after clinching the division. They didn’t do one for clinching the Ohio Cup. Again, it was a joke by a social-media guy.

Melvin 09/26/2024

Michael E 09/26/2024

Nearly all “unwritten” rules are stupid and sometimes dangerous.

The one I recall and maybe this is NOT MLB but pre-pro? I don’t know. THe one I grate at is don’t try to time the pitcher with practice swings in the on-deck circle.

I did that my whole life. IF the pitcher is any good, he’ll still have the edge (he knows what he’s throwing, I didn’t), but I am certain I saw a player get beaned for just that, thoguht it was pros, maybe it was MiLB though?

I think in such a case the pitcher and managed should be suspended without pay for 30 days.

Now, for bunting, I kind of get it, it feels like a slightly easier way to get a hit when the traditional way has escaped a team. That said, to me, ANYTHING in the rule book, i.e. legale, should always be available.

I also grate at mid-game stealing in a blowout.

Now, stealing in the 9th with a big lead? Bunting in the 9th during a perfect-game or no-hitter down more than say 4 runs in a not-quite-do-or-die game? Yeah, that is weak sauce. Still legal and probably shouldn’t be any on-field repercussions, but admittedly kind of weak. I am still not ALL-IN on being against it though. Might a valid reason (a slight by he opponent or opposing pitcher in the same gam, maybe purposely walking your best hitter 3 times or beaning him in obvious fashion).

Michael E 09/29/2024

Found it

Ben Christensen Beans Batter in On-Deck Circle
7 of 10
A first-round pick by the Chicago Cubs in the 1999 MLB draft, Ben Christensen put together a 20-1 record in his college career at Wichita State and looked to be headed for big-league stardom.

Facing Evansville in a late-season game, third baseman Anthony Molina stepped into the on-deck circle, and Christensen noticed Molina was timing his pitches while he warmed up. In what can only be described as atrocious, Christensen uncorked a warm-up pitch right at Molina, who turned and caught it in the left eye.

His eye was crushed, and he needed 23 stitches to close the injury. Christensen defended himself by saying pitching coach Brent Kemnitz had taught his pitchers to throw near batters who attempted to time them. The two settled out of court, but Molina would never play again and Christensen never saw the major leagues.

Michael E 09/29/2024

“Christensen defended himself by saying pitching coach Brent Kemnitz had taught his pitchers to throw near batters who attempted to time them. ”
So maybe not an unwritten rule, but definitely something SOME coaches/players abide by (hopefully a very tiny minority as it is just a game).

LDS 09/26/2024

Don’t bunt in a perfect game is like getting in the ring with Muhammad Ali and saying don’t hit me. That’s Friedl’s job. Anything else simply diminishes what a perfect game would have been.

greenmtred 09/26/2024

Excellent, LDS.

old-school 09/26/2024

Well put LDS. Do your job. End of story.

Enquirer article yesterday back and forth on Bell replacement options.
Wittenmyer noted he was the Cubs beat reporter when David Ross was there.

“Ross might actually be the best fit for this team of all of those guys. And just imagine how motivated he would be to come into this situation in the Cubs division. Having covered him in Chicago, I saw a players’ manager with a good bedside manner who at the same time did not put up with poor preparation or breakdowns in fundamentals. He’s also a former catcher, who pitcher’s loved throwing to.”

Interesting first hand account on Ross regarding preparation/fundamentals/accountability.

doofus 09/26/2024

I like catchers as managers.

doofus 09/26/2024

Catchers especially those that have played along time know the game. They are smart.

Melvin 09/26/2024

Wonder how good Barnhart would be as a mananger.

Reaganspad 09/27/2024

I would like David Ross to be our manager. Perfect fit

MBS 09/27/2024

@LDS, I get the unwritten rule, since perfect games are so rare that it’s a shame to lose one by a bunt. However, I agree with you and the theme of the article. If you have a chance to win a game, and at the time we did, you need to generate offense anyway you can.

If it was the 8th or 9th, and we were losing by 4 or 5, then I would have agreed with them that it was a BS play.

2020ball 09/27/2024

I fail to see why it is ever a wrong play, the whiny old school rules need to die.

Jim Walker 09/26/2024

This whole affair strikes me as the sort of thing that goes on when a game has no real meaning for either team. I recall as a kid when I asked my dad why the Reds kept playing after they were mathematically eliminated. He said because other teams they playing still were in the race to win the pennant.

Me being me even back then, I pointed out that not *every* team they would be playing would still have a chance to win the pennant. He shrugged and said something about tickets had been sold and people were planning to attend etc et al.

And here we are.

MK 09/26/2024

First time I ever heard about this unwritten rule was about 30-years ago when Padre’s catcher Ben Davis bunted to break up the whiner Curt Schillings no-hitter. Back in the sixties it happened all the time. It isn’t slo-pitch softball bunting is allowed.

Maybe the Mistake on the Lake Name-changers should work on fielding bunts.

JB 09/26/2024

It is the top of the 7th in a 2-0 game. Is it a rule now that you cant bunt at a certain time in a game ? Friedl walked in the 9th so I’m pretty sure the players and coaches on the Guardrails could have cared about the bunt because they didn’t drill him then. Media always creating something that isn’t there. I hate Cleveland and they need to get ready for their regular beat down by the Yankees in the playoffs.

Nicole Cushing 09/26/2024

The only thing Friedl did wrong is that he forgot to call time out and perform “the griddy” after reaching first.

Seriously, the Guardians (and, apparently, MLB as a whole) needs to be okay with competitors competing.

Mark Moore 09/26/2024

DataDumpster 09/26/2024

Year| Total Pitchers Used|10+Relief App| 10+ Relief ERA
1975 12 4 all under 3
1990 17 5 all under 4
2023 38 12 none under 3

Good relief pitchers are hard to find. Using more pitchers is not the answer. Too bad Dr. Mike Marshall didn’t have the social skill to get his studies more accepted. In 1974, the screwball pitcher had 106 relief appearances and won the Cy Young award before eventually pitching in 724 games.

David 09/26/2024

Marshall had some interesting theories about arm strength, condition and pitching.

But eventually he did burn his arm out. It happens to everyone, sooner or later.

Nolan Ryan is a freak (not being insulting) being able to throw as long as he did, as hard as he did. He is literally one in a hundred million.

Optimist 09/26/2024

Well, Bob Feller and Walter Johnson, so that’s 300 million.

David 09/26/2024

Agreed on “Rapid Robert” Feller and Walter “Freight Train” Johnson. But they were born in an earlier generation.

There are one or two guys that come along each generation that are just such anomolous talents that there is no comparison to them.

still a red 09/27/2024

Nolan Ryan wrote a book on exercises, etc. to stay healthy…so I think beyond being a freak of nature, he worked at being a freak.

greenmtred 09/26/2024

Well, Gentlemen and Lady, after reviewing these comments, I’d say that that’s the Guardians told good and proper.

Really excellent article! Didn’t realize TJ was quite so proficient at the bunt. Hope he can stay healthy next season and get more of those, along with more steals.

Outlander22 09/26/2024

Love the Reds and still playing with heart. Saddened me same Guardian commentators said it wasn’t even a rivalry one night then next game, we should have just stopped playing so they could have a no no. We don’t stop playing in baseball. I saw a lot of miscues in Guardian defense that were barely mentioned.
Although the season didn’t turn out like we hoped, I still enjoyed some amazing games that showed heart and willing to play hard. I loved the amazing plays, incredible defense, wonderful steals, homers, and comradery too. Loved TJ’s exciting plays and hope he feels stronger every day. Some really good players hung in there this year with a lot of overall injuries and limited regular pitchers. Thumbs up to TJ, Tyler, India, Steer, Espinal, Marte, and of course Elly. Love seeing that smile Elly. Team with a heart. Look forward to next year and maybe Barry Larkin as a devoted and much loved manager. Go Reds.

Rednat 09/27/2024

Off topic. But i was glad Oakland got the win today. At least they gave the fans one last good memory. Im sure there were a lot of tears shed.
I know its been tough to be a Cincinnati sports fan of late but i cant imagine what it must be like for the people in Oakland.
Just hope a similar situation doesnt occur in cincinnati down the road. This is the first year in my life that i do believe its in in the relm of possibilities that the reds could leave town one day.if they cant turn it around in the next few years i could see fans jumping ship at this point.

Melvin 09/27/2024

There’s no reason to move from Cincinnati. All a new owner would have to do is put a winning product on the field and fans would come from all over. That’s been proven time and time again. He would have to do the same thing somewhere else with no guarantees of attendance.

TR 09/27/2024

Last season proved what you said. Based on the size of the population, Cincinnati is one of the five best baseball towns in America.

Mark Moore 09/27/2024

Plus MLB ownership cartel wanted a presence in Las Vegas. They would be hard-pressed to snub their noses at the first professional baseball city IMO. There are weaker markets they could cannibalize to move a team.

+5,000 Melvin

MBS 09/27/2024

Also let’s stop acting like there are going to be markets that are much better than Cincinnati that are without a baseball team.

I think NY, LA, and CHI all have 2 clubs already.

Oldtimer 09/27/2024

It nearly happened in 1968. The Reds were going to move to San Diego under Bill DeWitt but the city ponied up and built Riverfront Stadium and DeWitt sold the Reds for $7 million to a group of Cincinnati investors headed by Francis Dale of the Enquirer.

Yep. $7 million bought the Reds in 1966. Howsam became GM in 1967. Sparky became manager in 1970 and Riverfront Stadium opened. The BRM was born.

Dan 09/27/2024

Off-topic question – If Bob Howsam had never been GM of the Reds, would the Reds be an “almost always bad” franchise, historically?

I know we get occasional love as having a “storied history” or whatever – and yes, it’s partly the “first professional baseball team” thing.

But if we had just some average GM from the late 60’s thru the late 70’s… would the Reds overall history just be mostly bad?

Reaganspad 09/27/2024

Yup, and Bay Area should have 2 teams. Oakland should have moved to San Jose, but the Giants have such a hold on the market and veto’d that. they forced Oaklands hand.

I was living in the bay and had 1/4 share A’s tickets from 87-90. Got my World Series Tickets. 1st game, dot racing on the scoreboard the Red dot won. I went crazy….

I wouldn’t want to go to an A’s game today. Oakland has become like a city in Syria. Only InNOut Burger to ever close did so this year. was on Hegenberger right by the stadium. Had to have 3-4 security folks and still was a risk. So sad…

BK 09/27/2024

The chances of the Reds moving in the next 15 years are low, but it’s not out of the question. Oakland has declined significantly as a city over the last two decades. Unsurprisingly, they lost both their NFL and MLB franchises. Metro areas such as Nashville, Austin, and Raleigh/Durham are experiencing double-digit annual population growth.

Maximizing the potential of the Reds franchise in Cincinnati will take a regional approach. A regional approach requires the franchise to attract out-of-town businesses/private individuals to make up a significant chunk of season ticket holders–teams can’t budget for walk-up crowds. This means the team needs to be perceived as competitive every year (like St. Louis).

Chronic losing won’t work in Cincinnati. We can’t expect an individual or group of investors to simply pour money into the franchise year after year to make the team competitive with the NY, Chicago, and LA franchises. The team will need to be more competitive to drive the likelihood of the franchise moving lower. India was right; this offseason is important. Krall has publicly stated they want to build sustained success, and I believe that’s the right approach. It’s time for Krall to demonstrate that he can deliver.

So the Indians in 2015 can do it, but the Reds cant.

I love Tito’s post game quotes. Take it up with me if you have problem.

greenmtred 09/27/2024

It’s possible that Brandon Phillips named the wrong team the WLB’s. More likely, though, that there’s more than one team that deserves the name.

Reaganspad 09/27/2024

I hate the Cardinals. The baseball team, not the bird. The birds are cool but I do not understand how they do not make it to be west coast.

The Cardinals uniforms are the best in baseball, those birds on the bat. So undeserving for those WLB’s

Elly was on deck. Get on base anyway you can, then one swing from Elly, and it’s 2-2.

Chuck 09/27/2024

Friedl is payed to try to help the club win games. Doesn’t matter the situation. In terms of unwritten rules comment and no hitter if every time late in game opposing players go to plate with opponent tossing a no hitter and give in to allow the no hit to occur there would be a ton of no hitters thrown in baseball. This is the stupidest Comment ever made. Typical of Cleveland. I’ll be sure to root against them now.

docmike 09/27/2024

Oh my goodness. What a bunch of crybabies. I would love to never again hear about the “unwritten rules” of baseball.

The unwritten rules are universally stupid. The point of a baseball game is to try to win, and that is accomplished by two things: scoring runs, and preventing the other team from scoring runs.

What is wrong with bunting for a hit to break up a no-hitter? It’s a legitimate way for a batter to reach base, and I would argue that it requires more skill than a routine grounder that happens to find a hole. Again, if the objective is to try to win the game, then a batter trying to get on base should be applauded, not scorned. Good for Friedl.

Similarly, the rule about stealing when you’re up big is ridiculous, too. I don’t care if my team’s up by 8 runs in the 9th. I’ve seen teams make big comebacks before. If a player can help ensure that my team wins the game by stealing his way into scoring position, then by all means, do it.

Oh, and if a Cleveland pitcher decides to throw at Friedl in retaliation? Suspend him 20 games. Put an end to that kind of nonsense. We’re talking about players’ careers, I have no tolerance at all for intentionally hitting the batter.

greenmtred 09/27/2024

Agree.
