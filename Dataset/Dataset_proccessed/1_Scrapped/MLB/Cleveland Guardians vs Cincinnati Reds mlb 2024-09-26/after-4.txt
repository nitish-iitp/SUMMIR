12 SECONDS REMAINING

NEW YORK -- Jazz Chisholm Jr. stood at the top step of the dugout, his palms raised skyward in amazement. Aaron Judge had just homered for a fifth consecutive game, and by all indications, the Yankees captain had tossed his bat aside expecting a routine flyout.

That’s how things are going right now for Judge, who hit his Major League-leading 58th home run off the Orioles’ Bryan Baker in the seventh inning of the Yanks’ 10-1 victory on Thursday evening, which clinched the American League East for the Bombers.

“Like I’ve said before, he’s out there playing video games while all of us are out there working,” Giancarlo Stanton said. “It’s been incredible to watch. The guy is phenomenal, and I get a front-row seat for it.”

The two-run drive, a Statcast-projected 394-foot blast that left Judge’s bat at 110.9 mph, came with Juan Soto aboard and gave the Yankees a 9-0 lead. Judge has seven homers in his last 12 games (since Sept. 13).

“He’s just so good,” manager Aaron Boone said. “More really good at-bats tonight; I feel like the last week to 10 days, he’s started to really lock back in. That ball he hits tonight, I thought it was a fly ball to left-center and it just kept going and going. It’s Aaron Judge. It’s greatness in front of us.”

It marks the second time in Judge’s career that he has homered in five straight games, matching his output from July 29 through Aug. 2, 2020.

Per MLB.com’s Sarah Langs, Judge is the first player in Yankees history with multiple home run streaks of at least five games in his career.

Don Mattingly holds the franchise record, having homered in eight consecutive games from July 8-18, 1987. Roger Maris homered in six straight games from Aug. 11-16, 1961, and Lou Gehrig homered in six straight from Aug. 28-Sept. 1, 1931.

Judge also previously homered in four consecutive games on three occasions: Sept. 3-7, 2022; May 22-25, 2024; and Aug. 20-23, 2024.

His 58 homers are the fifth-most by a Yankee in a single season, trailing his 62 homers in 2022, Maris’ 61 homers in 1961, Babe Ruth’s 60 homers in 1927 and Ruth’s 59 homers in 1921.

“When it all comes down to it, it’s about the people you have in this room,” Judge said. “It always comes down to people. You’ve got good people in here, great players, you’re going to go out there and do your best.”
