Boston Red Sox vs Detroit Tigers Prediction

I’ll probably lean toward Boston. Houck does need to bounce back from his last start, though. On August 25 versus Arizona, Houck posted a loss with six earned runs in 6.0 frames. In his two starts prior however, Houck had a combined 12.2 innings and four earned with no decisions.

On Thursday the Sox had a pretty awful time at the plate, with only Danny Jansen and Nick Sogard getting on base. Otherwise the pitching wasn’t too bad. Boston’s bats obviously need to find some life Friday.
