Surging Star Gives Padres An Edge In Tight Wild Card Race
September 16, 2024
Drew Arellano

As San Diego’s September weather cools down, Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr. is heating up on the field and becoming a key factor in the Wild Card race. Despite concerns that Tatis could’ve missed the rest of the season, the 25-year-old superstar returned from the injured list a couple of weeks ago and has become an X-factor during the most important stretch of the Friars’ season.

Fernando Tatis Jr. Gives Padres an Edge in Tight Wild Card Race

Since his return, Tatis has slashed .279/.295/.535, though it wasn’t smooth sailing at first. While he made solid contact from the start, he struggled to elevate the ball, grounding out at a staggering rate of 70%. Even his most significant hit in his first week back—a walk-off single in the tenth inning against the Detroit Tigers on September 4—was a grounder that luckily found a gap in the left side of the infield.

However, things have changed for Tatis during his first road trip since returning. Not only is he making hard contact, but he’s also started to elevate the ball consistently. In the past five games alone, he’s launched four home runs, racking up eight RBI and six runs in the process. He stayed hot on Sunday against the San Francisco Giants, smashing a pinch-hit go-ahead home run in the eighth inning to give the Padres a 2-1 lead that eventually resulted in a 4-3 extra-innings victory for San Diego. It was his first career pinch-hit homer.

Tatis has been ultra-aggressive at the plate, swinging early and often, and has yet to draw a walk since his return. While this approach has led to some wild swings and strikeouts, it’s been paying off recently. On the defensive side, he hasn’t missed a beat, adding to his highlight reel with jaw-dropping home run robberies, sliding catches, and outfield assists. His Platinum Glove is on full display, reminding everyone why he’s one of baseball’s best outfielders.

With Tatis firing on all cylinders, the Padres have a not-so-secret weapon to help them separate from other National League postseason contenders.

How It Impacts the NL Wild Card Race

Tatis’s resurgence couldn’t come at a better time for the Padres. His offensive spark gives San Diego a deeper lineup at a crucial stage in the season, while his elite defense completes their all-around game. This newfound completeness gives them an edge over other NL Wild Card hopefuls, significantly boosting their chances of securing the top spot and hosting a home series in the postseason.

The competition is stiff, with the Arizona Diamondbacks, Atlanta Braves, and New York Mets all still in the mix. The DBacks boast a powerful offense but have struggled on the mound, potentially slowing their momentum. The Braves, while playing well, face a steep climb due to the Padres holding the regular-season tiebreaker. Meanwhile, the Mets have been on a hot streak, but they face one of the toughest remaining schedules, including matchups against the Philadelphia Phillies, Braves, and Milwaukee Brewers.

The Padres, on the other hand, are sitting pretty. FanGraphs currently pegs their postseason odds at 98.4%. With Tatis settling back into his electrifying form, San Diego isn’t just eyeing a Wild Card spot—they’re looking to clinch the top spot and set themselves up for a deep postseason run.

Last Word on Tatis Jr.

The Padres are still proceeding with caution regarding Tatis’s workload. Manager Mike Shildt has implemented “scripted” days off to help Tatis gradually ramp up, especially since he didn’t have a rehab assignment before rejoining the lineup. The team is keeping a close eye on his health after his extended absence, but Shildt is optimistic, saying Tatis feels good and is making positive strides. If Tatis continues on this trajectory and the Padres eventually let him loose, San Diego will be a very dangerous team to face in October.

Stability in the Leadoff Role is Crucial for the Phillies

January 10, 2025

The Philadelphia Phillies should not change who is in the leadoff spot in 2025. Kyle Schwarber should remain in the role after his statistically interesting 2024 season. Schwarber set a major league record for leadoff home runs last year. However there has been some discussion this offseason that the Phillies might move Schwarber out of the leadoff spot. Phillies manager Rob Thomson has indicated this offseason that someone else might be the Phillies leadoff hitter in 2025. Bryson Stott will most likely take over the role if the Phillies go ahead with it, given the way their roster is constructed. […]
