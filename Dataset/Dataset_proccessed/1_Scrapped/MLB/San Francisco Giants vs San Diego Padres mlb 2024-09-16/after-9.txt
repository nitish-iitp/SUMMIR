Just one week ago, San Francisco Giants outfielder Heliot Ramos told reporters that he wanted to be the first right-handed hitter to ever dunk a splash-hit home run into Oracle Park’s McCovey Cove.

On Sunday afternoon, the 25-year-old did just that.

Ramos drilled a 3-2 pitch from San Diego Padres pitcher Robert Suarez–a 100 mph fastball–over Levi’s Landing and into McCovey Cove, making him the first right-handed hitter in Oracle Park’s 25-year history to accomplish the feat.

The game-tying blast occurred in the bottom of the ninth inning of an eventual 3-2 Giants loss, but Ramos’ opposite-field pop provided fans with a silver lining to what has overall been a disappointing season for San Francisco.

Following the game, Ramos met with the media to share his thoughts on his one-of-a-kind homer, stating that he “was always positive” that he could reach the Cove.

“I always knew that I had that oppo juice, but it looks impossible just by looking at the wall and the weather here,” Ramos said. “I was like, ‘I don’t know, but I might be able to do it.’ I was always positive that I was going to do it. And I wanted to do it. This is a big organization. It has a lot of great legends and all that. For me to be the first one to do it, it’s insane to me.”

MLB home run king Barry Bonds made McCovey Cove a point of interest for Giants fans as the slugger mashed 35 of his home runs into the San Francisco Bay.

Ramos’ home run increased the Splash Hit counter to 105, with 104 of those hits coming from the left side of the plate.

For now, Ramos stands alone. Maybe this won’t be the final time we see the All-Star reach the Cove during his tenure in black and orange.
