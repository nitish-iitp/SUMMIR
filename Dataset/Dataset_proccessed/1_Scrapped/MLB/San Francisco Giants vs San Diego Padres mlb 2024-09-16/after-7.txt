David Peralta singled in a run and scored the eventual game-winner in a two-run 10th inning and the visiting San Diego Padres rode their pitching to beat the San Francisco Giants 4-3 and complete a three-game sweep Sunday afternoon.

The Padres (85-65) remain atop the National League wild-card race with just two weeks remaining in the regular season.

After the Giants had tied the score in the ninth on a leadoff home run by Heliot Ramos, Peralta led off the 10th with a single to left off former San Francisco closer Camilo Doval (5-3) to drive in automatic runner Jake Cronenworth.

Giants vs. Padres recap

After Luis Arraez’s double, Peralta scored the second run of the inning on Donovan Solano’s RBI groundout.

Adrian Morejon retired all three men he faced in the last of the 10th, allowing a sacrifice fly to Michael Conforto along the way, to record his second save. Despite blowing his save opportunity, the win was credited to Robert Suarez (9-3), who served up Ramos’ 21st homer.

The Padres took a 2-1 lead when Fernando Tatis Jr. led off the eighth with a first-pitch, pinch-hit home run, his 18th of the season.

The pinch-hit appearance was just the eighth of Tatis’ five-year career and second this season. He had doubled in this year’s previous effort. The homer was the first of his career as a pinch hitter.

Suarez and Morejon were the fifth and sixth pitchers, respectively, used by the Padres, who had shut out the Giants (72-78) in the first two games of the series.

Martin Perez threw five scoreless innings but gave up a game-tying solo homer to Donovan Walton to lead off the sixth. The homer was Walton’s first of the season.

Perez allowed two hits and one run in five-plus innings with one walk and two strikeouts.

Manny Machado drove in San Diego’s first run of the game with a sacrifice fly in the sixth, scoring Arraez, who had led off the inning with a single off Giants reliever Spencer Bivens.

San Francisco starter Landen Roupp was pulled after five shutout innings, giving up two hits and two walks. He struck out four.

Peralta and Arraez had two hits each for the Padres.
