CINCINNATI (ENQUIRER) - When Cincinnati Reds starting pitcher Brandon Williamson first felt soreness in his left shoulder, he thought he’d take a few days off from pitching, rehab the injury and be back in the Reds’ rotation in no time.

Williamson felt the injury during his final spring training appearance in March. What he didn’t know at the time was that he had a Bennett lesion in his shoulder. He went on a rehab assignment in June, stopped it because he was still in pain and found himself on a long path back to the big leagues.

On Sunday, as the Reds avoided a sweep against the Milwaukee Brewers with a 4-3 win on a walk-off single by pinch-hitter Santiago Espinal, Williamson made a strong return. While pitching on a pitch count, he allowed two runs in 3 ⅓ innings, but one of the runs should have been unearned and charged as an error on third baseman Noelvi Marte.

Williamson felt the injury during his final spring training appearance in March. What he didn’t know at the time was that he had a Bennett lesion in his shoulder. He went on a rehab assignment in June, stopped it because he was still in pain and found himself on a long path back to the big leagues.

On Sunday, as the Reds avoided a sweep against the Milwaukee Brewers with a 4-3 win on a walk-off single by pinch-hitter Santiago Espinal, Williamson made a strong return. While pitching on a pitch count, he allowed two runs in 3 ⅓ innings, but one of the runs should have been unearned and charged as an error on third baseman Noelvi Marte.

Williamson resumed his rehab assignment on Aug. 27 and allowed one run in 2 ⅔ innings. Usually, pitchers on rehab assignments report to the big league clubhouse right after their final rehab outing. But Williamson wasn’t announced as Sunday’s starter until late Saturday night.

Williamson wasn’t built up to throw 100-plus pitches, so his return was an abbreviated outing. But he threw a lot of strikes, struck out five batters, threw a very effective cutter and kept the Reds in the game. He picked up a Reds’ pitching staff that’s running out of starters.

Last year, Williamson was the Reds’ most consistent starter. He didn’t show the flashes of potential that Hunter Greene and Andrew Abbott showed, but Williamson looked like a pitcher the Reds could build with. He mixes and matches five pitches and has an unorthodox throwing motion for a left-hander.

The biggest concern with him has always been his left shoulder. In 2022, when Williamson was in the minor leagues, he said that his shoulder was the reason for his disappointing season.

When Williamson’s shoulder injury popped back up in 2024, Reds manager David Bell said that Williamson would explore all of his options, including season-ending surgery. Williamson opted to rehab his injury, and his approach paid off with a strong return to the big leagues.
