Milwaukee Brewers vs Cincinnati Reds – September 1, 2024
 Jim Walker  09/01/2024 59

Greetings! Welcome to September. The Reds open the month with the final game of their current 4 game  series versus the Brewers at GABP.  This is a game of last chances for the Reds. It is their last chance for their first win of the series and also their last chance to notch to a fourth win of the season against the Brewers who have won 9 of  a dozen games against the Reds in 2024.

Brandon Williamson

Brandon Williamson will make his injury delayed 2024 MLB debut today. Back on March 17, Williamson was removed from a spring training game due to “shoulder soreness”.   He subsequently went on a minor league rehab assignment May 14 but was recalled from rehab without being reactivated on June 7.  By this point in time, his injury was described as a “shoulder strain”.

Following a summer of shoulder rest and treatment, Williamson made a rehab start at Class AAA Louisville  on August 27. In this appearance he completed 2.2 innings of work without allowing a run.

To refresh memory, Williamson came to the Reds organization from Seattle in March of 2022 as part of the trade which sent Jesse Winker and Eugenio Suarez to Mariners. He had been a second round choice by Seattle (#59 overall) in the 2019 June draft. Williamson first saw MLB action last year with the Reds. In 2023, he made 23 MLB appearances, all starts, as a regular in the Reds rotation beginning in mid June through the end of the season.

Splits (2023)


Righthanded hitters slugged significantly better against Williamson but had a 3% lower OBP driven by a lower batting average.

Splits	PA	H	2B	3B	HR	BB	K	AVG	OBP	SLG
RHH	401	90	24	1	16	31	83	.245	.305	.446
LHH	90	21	  2	0	  2	  8	15	.266	.337	.367

Pitch Usage

Williamson is not a power pitcher. He needs his stuff to be working if he is to be effective. His arrival at MLB was slowed by a lack of control which he finally overcame at AAA last season. However with his paucity of game pitching in 2024, control may be an issue for him today.

Usage	37.2%	29.8%	10.2%	6.4%	16.5%
Tobias Myers

Tobias Myers is in his MLB rookie season at age 25 after being the #181 overall pick (6th round by Orioles) in the June 2016 draft. Myers had bounced though  no less than 5 organizations without seeing MLB action before landing with the Brewers as a free agent in November of 2022.

Coming into today, Myers has made 21 appearances with the Brewers this season, all but one of them in a starting role.  The Brewers are an even 10-10 in the games he has started, compared to the team’s overall .588 winning percentage. In Myers last 5 starts, the team is 2-3; but, he has been the pitcher of record in only 1 game, a loss.

Splits


Myers has almost exactly the same number of  batters faced from both sides of the plate. LH batters clearly do better against him across the board except in doubles but more than make up the difference in home runs.

Splits	PA	H	2B	3B	HR	BB	K	AVG	OBP	SLG
RHH	227	44	8	0	8	10	61	.208	.252	.359
LHH	213	50	5	1	17	18	45	.262	.330	.408

Pitch Usage


Like Brandon Williamson, Myers is not a power pitcher. He works the cutter off his 4 seam fastball and also has the full slider to use in that mix at a third speed.

	4-seam	Cutter	 Slider	 Curve	Change
Velo	92.9	89.3	85.5	77.5	81.1
Usage	40.1	23.9	20.6%	3.8%	11.0%
Bullpens
Reds

Tony Santillan and Fernando Cruz threw 30+ pitches Saturday night figure to be unavailable. David Buchanan is off to DFA land in the latest “churn and burn” move. Buck Farmer and Justin Wilson both threw between 20-25 pitches Saturday. Given the short turnaround, they also may be unavailable. Keep in mind the Reds need to cover not only 9 innings today but also on Monday ahead of an off day Tuesday. To this end, Brent Suter has been activated which will hopefully ease the load on others.

Brewers

Brewers closer Devin Williams threw 32 pitches Saturday coming off of an appearance on Friday. If he sees action today, he really is the superman he looks to be versus the Reds. Aaron Ashby went 2 innings (37 pitches) on Saturday and should also be among the spectators today.

News and Notes

It is roster musical chairs time (don’t forget since this is Sept 1, they are adding two chairs instead of taking any away. Thus the lack of corresponding moves to match all three additions below). Unsurprisingly, David Buchanan joins what Doug has coined the pitching “churn and burn” rotation creating the necessary spots to retrieve Brandon Williamson from the 60 day IL to active status. The team also activated Jake Fraley and Brent Suter from the injured list.

New month, same old Reds! Fully expect the Brewers to complete the 4 game sweep! Hope I’m wrong and the Reds can find a way to win just one game in this series!

Gonna have a pleasant distraction today as I will be visiting with my grandkids!

greenmtred 09/01/2024

Have a great day with them, Dennis Certainly better than watching what will unfold at GABP.

Oldtimer 09/01/2024

Try to be positive. Just once. Yesterday you predicted Montas would pitch a no-hitter or at least a shutout. He did neither. The Reds battled back and a chance in the 9th but the Brewers 1B made a nice defensive play to end the game. He was a Red in 2022.

Oldtimer 09/01/2024

Reds won. No sweep.

Moon 09/01/2024

I think Maile threw 25 pitches Friday and might be available today if needed.

greenmtred 09/01/2024

I doubt that those 65mph curves, slurves or whatever they are take too much out of him.

RedsMonk65 09/01/2024

Stupid question and slightly off-topic: Why are the Reds beginning a home series vs. the Astros tomorrow (Monday), then taking an off day, then completing the series Wednesday and Thursday? I know it’s been on the schedule that way from the beginning, but just wondered why. I understand why they do that for Opening Day — to allow for a possible rainout. Maybe something similar — allowing for a possible Labor Day rainout?

Oldtimer 09/01/2024

Could be but maybe more so just the vagaries of scheduling. It is not a bad question at all.

Jim Walker 09/01/2024

Yeah, “Just because” as one of my tech instructors once told our class when some logic in a Windows interface made no sense.

You are probably right about the scheduling routine. There are rules about how many consecutive days a team can play and how far they can travel without a day off and the like. When a team is sitting at home and draws a strange off day it seems weird; but, the schedules have to work for all 30 teams so that happens from time to time to facilitate somebody else.

Frostgiant 09/01/2024

They want Labor Day crowd I Imagine. Kids out of school

RedsMonk65 09/01/2024

Thanks. I suspect this is one of those mysteries in life where the correct answer is “all of the above.”

Randoxu1 09/01/2024

Of course Hinds sits again while Marte continues to play. Stares at balls he hits and doesn’t run, continually makes errors in the field and another base running blunder last night not scoring on a double play. Does Bell hold him accountable, no he rewards him by playing him everyday. Totally unacceptable. If you respond and say he’s young and learning that’s bull, it’s basic fundamentals, tired of this guy and Bells no discipline on this team

Daytonnati 09/01/2024

A clown show.

Mark A Verticchio 09/01/2024

3 hits and 0 runs , only David Bell’s Reds.

Eddiek957 09/01/2024

Three hits no runs no bueno

VaRedsFan 09/01/2024

That might be Jake’s best swing this year.

RedsMonk65 09/01/2024

Bats alive!

docproc 09/01/2024

The fact that Marte is in the starting lineup today tells you everything you need to know about the managerial ineptitude of David Bell. An absolute travesty.

MuddyCleats 09/01/2024

Great 2 see Williamson pitching again. Some wild misses, but a lot of quality strikes especially inside! Nice FBs up & then in. Turning over his FB low & away, screwball effect & then choking it more on the change up. Couple of cutters mixed in w/ a curve or two! P I T C H I N G – WOW

Jim Walker 09/01/2024

So after I hit the publish button on this preview mess, I had some errands to tend to. I get back and see the Reds have 2 runs on 5 hits and the help of a couple of Brewers errors.

So in a sentence or 2, what happened (or didn’t) 

Thanks

Harry Stoner 09/01/2024

Marte has got the stand-there-and-watch thing down even when he doesn’t hit the ball.

RedsMonk65 09/01/2024

Had to step away briefly. Another tight game. It seems Williamson had a decent outing for first time back. Reds need to pile up some more runs — please!

Matt McWax 09/01/2024

Reds almost unmasked Myers, lots of hard contact. He’s probably a bit overrated, the Brewers seem to get good ERA’s out of such guys.

Mark A Verticchio 09/01/2024

The Brewers have run all over the Reds this series. This team has so many problems it’s ridiculous. If management cares at all they have to break it down, somewhat, and start next year with new leadership. There is no way they can bring Bell back and expect things to change. The Red’s have some solid pieces they just need a strong leader to teach them how to use what they have and go out and add on what they need to complete this team.

Jim Walker 09/01/2024

And yet save for 2 remarkable defensive plays by the Brewers to directly save runs, the Reds would have split the series.

There is a lot of spirit and desire among the Reds even with the depletion of talent. They need a hand at the tiller to focus and direct it more effectively.

RedsMonk65 09/01/2024

Good way to put it.

Jim Walker 09/01/2024

And I would not argue that Bell doesn’t deserve some credit for the spirit; but, from what I’ve seen, he doesn’t have the skill to focus and guide the effort he might have helped to inspire. A manager has to be able to do both, create and focus, or have a staff that can do the part he cannot.

Gpod 09/01/2024

this is a perfect example and reason Bell should be fired….he puts himself in the game when it’s not call for…..why would you pinch hit with Smith there….
un-explainable….don’t give me the lefty – righty thing

RedsFanInFL 09/01/2024

Think I was submitting a very similar response at the same time. Absolutely crazy move by Bell. Did he not see the HR Rosario had yesterday against a righty?

Gpod 09/01/2024

it’s like he thinks he has to inject his “genius” into every part of the game, non-stop. That was why I was so glad when MLB outlawed moving position players all over the field. Bell always was moving guys everywhere on the field becuse he thinks he knows all

RedsFanInFL 09/01/2024

It’s a beautiful day and Reds season effectively over. Noticed very little comments on the thread today. “Where are they gonna go?

Rosario with an HR against a righty yestersay, already with a single today, hitting .300 for the year. Of course Bell pinch hits for him in the 7th because it goes against his R-L match ups. Even the broadcasters seemed to be questioning the move

Gpod 09/01/2024

and Smith has no future with the Reds….that move alone tells you why Bell is a poor-poor excuse for a MLB manager

Jon 09/01/2024

What’s Marte’s future hold? Does he get written into a starting role again in 2025 as a Red? Does he begin 2025 as a bench player? Does he begin in AAA? Or does he get moved this winter as a change of scenery candidate in a larger trade?

VaRedsFan 09/01/2024

IMO, he should start the season in AAA.
He not only has to get his hitting back in line, but his fielding is atrocious, and from the outside looking in, his attitude, hustle, and baseball IQ all need some molding by a coach that doesn’t enable such nonsense.

It wouldn’t break my heart if he was traded as part of a package to get a big bat.
I don’t think they are trading him though.

Hanginwithem 09/01/2024

He got started off on the wrong foot and has failed to impress. His performance in spring training should write the script for next year.

DaveCT 09/01/2024

AAA. Possibly CES, too, until one or both get their strokes back. Let them hit their way back to GABP like they did a year ago. That said, there is a lot of talent there. Hold onto both.

Optimist 09/01/2024

For different reasons, but unless either lights up spring training AND impresses the staff with intangibles and readiness, they both go to AAA with the understanding a strong start there gets an early May callup. This shouldn’t be difficult.

Gpod 09/01/2024

this game has the “2024 1-run loss” feel all over it

DaveCT 09/01/2024

Both last night (Steer, Friedl) and today (EDLC), a Reds hitter in a key situation in the 9th inning has been put in a hole by a called strike that is clearly outside and a ball.

VaRedsFan 09/01/2024

It’s nearly 1 pitch per AB like that to Elly.
Atrocious.

Gpod 09/01/2024

why not bunt the guy over to 3rd?…..Is that impossible these days?

Justin T 09/01/2024

Especially when 1 run wins it.

Jim Walker 09/01/2024

Personally, whatever the general numbers indicate about bunting a guy to 3rd, in extra innings when the road team has not scored, unless the “free runner” is a terrible base runner, the home team should play for that run to close out the game.

Gpod 09/01/2024

so putting Smith in as a pinch hitter earlier in the game pays off nothing x 2….thanks Mr Bell

Beaufort Red 09/01/2024

No the playoff teams that play fundamental baseball do it all the time.

Beaufort Red 09/01/2024

No the playoff teams that play fundamental baseball bunt guys over all the time.

PTBNL 09/01/2024

You can say that again.

RedsMonk65 09/01/2024

C’mon Reds — beat these guys — just once!

Jim Walker 09/01/2024

And France ties the record of 3 putouts in an inning shared by hundreds (if not thousands) of catchers and 1B (and probably a few guys at other spots too).

RedsMonk65 09/01/2024

Yes — FINALLY!

Gpod 09/01/2024

a rare sunday win…..it’s like seeing Bigfoot

VaRedsFan 09/01/2024

Espy gets the walkoff single.
A bright spot in a dark week.

Luckily Payamps is not in a fielding position.

VaRedsFan 09/01/2024

Espy pinch hit for Marte.
A move Bell made, and most here would actually agree with.

Harry Stoner 09/01/2024

Message delivered and received, hopefully.

That’s a play Marte should stand and watch and learn from.

DaveCT 09/01/2024

Hinds is a monster athlete. He looked like a 240 lb fullback coming down the line.

And Santiago Espinal? Gamer.

Oldtimer 09/01/2024

Reds win. I thought they battled Brewers pretty well except for second game of DH.

Mark A Verticchio 09/01/2024

The sad thing is with just a break or two they could have easily won 3 out of 4 in this series, but that is the small margin between being good and being ,well, not so good.

Harry Stoner 09/01/2024

Pinch hitting Espinal for Marte hopefully sends a message to the young man.

I had a good feeling ‘Jim’ would come through.

Senor Clutch.

William 09/01/2024

Please remember that Marte hit well for the Reds last year. He might do better in AAA next year unless he has a strong Spring.
