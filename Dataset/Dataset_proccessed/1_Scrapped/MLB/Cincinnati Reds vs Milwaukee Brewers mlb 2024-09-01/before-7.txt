Europeans in the Majors & Minors: August Update
Posted on August 29, 2024 by Gabriel Fidler

By DZ. Filed Aug. 25, 2024.

One Italian was traded for a big leaguer at the MLB trade deadline, another allowed only three earned runs over the past two months, and a Dutchman turned his season around with ten scoreless appearances in his last twelve outings. Meanwhile, a different Netherlands pitcher and a Spanish hitter were released, both seeming to be casualties of the MLB’s new roster limitations, with new draft picks taking their roster spots. And a (the) German big leaguer is currently in playoff position as he approaches offseason free agency. Read more about Samuel Aldegheri, Alessandro Ercolani, Arij Fransen, Jiorgeny Casimiri, Frank Hernández, Max Kepler, and others below.

Key
Name (age*), organization, country, team.
*Age is as of Sept 1, 2024 (playing age this season).
Team Prospect Rankings: BA (Baseball America): #; FG (Fangraphs): #; MLB (MLB.com): #.

MLB (1)
Max Kepler (31), Minnesota Twins. Germany.
Kepler is having a solid season as the Twins’ everyday right fielder. Over the last month he’s hitting .259. His power production has tailed off from previous years, as he has only nine extra base hits in July and August and eight home runs on the season. He has played 101 games.

Triple-A (1)
Sem Robberse (22), St Louis Cardinals. Netherlands. Memphis Redbirds. BA: 11; FG: 8; MLB: 12.
After a two-month break due to injury, Robberse recently made two rehab starts totaling three innings in Single-A, with one strikeout, five hits, and an unearned run.

Double-A (3)
Samuel Aldegheri (22), Los Angeles Angels. Italy. Rocket City Trash Pandas. BA: 6; FG: 5; MLB: 8.
Since our last update, Verona’s own was involved in a high-profile trade deadline deal, one of two pitchers moving to the L.A. Angels in return for their big league closer. Now a Trash Panda, Aldegheri has made four starts in his new organization, striking out 25 and walking nine in 17.1 innings, on the way to a 5.19 ERA and 0-2 record. Overall, his numbers since moving up to Double-A include a 4.61 ERA in 21.1 frames, with 13 free passes, zero home runs allowed, and an eye-popping 39 punch-outs (12.8 K/9). He slots into the Angels’ Top 10 rankings at MLB.com after a No. 24 listing with Philly.

Adam Macko (23), Toronto Blue Jays. Slovakia/Ireland. New Hampshire Fisher Cats. BA: 16; FG: 6; MLB: 9.
Macko remains on the injured list since we last checked, but he made a rehab appearance for Single-A Dunedin on Aug. 24, pitching two innings. After almost eight weeks off the mound, the southpaw is likely to remain in the Florida State League to build back up to game strength.

Ernesto Wilson Martinez (25), Milwaukee Brewers. France. Biloxi Shuckers.
Martínez was on a tear when we last checked and, while he has continuing to play regularly, his offense cooled in August. He has had two doubles, a home run, and two stolen bases across 42 at bats this month, for a .214 batting average and .283 OBP. For the year, he has nine HR and 18 SB, hitting .263.

High-A (4)
Alessandro Ercolani (20), Pittsburgh Pirates. San Marino/Italy. Greensboro Grasshoppers.
Since returning from a brief injured list stint in early July, the righty has turned things up a notch. He has pitched nine games and 29.1 innings, with seven walks, 38 strikeouts, and four runs (three earned) allowed. Ercolani, who remains the youngest pitcher on his team’s roster, is 5-1 with a 3.34 ERA and 1.11 WHIP in 70 innings pitched.

Arij Fransen (23), Cincinnati Reds. Netherlands. Dayton Dragons.
In Fransen’s last 12 appearances since late June, he has allowed runs in only two of those games. He was 2-0 with a 1.10 ERA in July, and he has a 1.76 ERA thus far in August, while striking out a batter per inning on average. The righty had struggled the first two months of the season, but this stretch of successful multi-inning relief appearances brings his season ERA down to 3.32. He has a 3-3 record and three saves in 28 games across 62.1 innings.

Omar Hernández (22), Kansas City Royals. Spain. Quad Cities River Bandits.
Hernández is hitting .245/.310/.283 in August, bringing his season numbers back up to .216/.272/.261. He has stolen 14 bases in 17 attempts while catching a bit more than half of the River Bandits’ games in High-A.

Shervyen Newton (25), Kansas City Royals. Netherlands. Quad Cities River Bandits.
