David Buchanan called up, Reds DFA Evan Kravetz
 Doug Gray  08/31/2024 10

The churn-and-burn of pitchers by the Cincinnati Reds continued this afternoon. The club announced that they had called up right-handed pitcher David Buchanan and designated left-handed pitcher Evan Kravetz for assignment in order to create a spot on the 40-man roster for him. They also announced that Casey Kelly, who was a part of a churn-and-burn of pitchers earlier this week, cleared waivers and was outrighted to Triple-A. It was not stated whether he accepted that outright.

Cincinnati acquired David Buchanan earlier this week in a trade with Philadelphia. The Phillies will be getting cash considerations for their end of the deal. Buchanan had been pitching in the minor leagues for Philadelphia, making 22 appearances (16 starts) with Triple-A Lehigh Valley and one start for High-A Jersey Shore. The 35-year-old hasn’t pitched in the big leagues since making 35 starts for the Phillipes between the 2013 and 2014 seasons. From 2017-2023 he pitched in Japan and Korea before returning to the US this year.

This season in the minor leagues he posted a 4.51 ERA in his 109.2 innings pitched while allowing 123 hits and 13 home runs. Buchanan didn’t walk many hitters, handing out just 33 free passes. He also didn’t strike out many hitters as he racked up just 82 strikeouts against the 470 hitters he faced – that’s a 17.4% strikeout rate.

The last start for David Buchanan was on August 25th, so he should be fully ready to handle multiple innings if and when the Reds put him on the mound. That may be today as Cincinnati looks like it will be having another “bullpen day” with Fernando Cruz as the scheduled starting pitcher.

Evan Kravetz will be available to any team on waivers. The big lefty made his Major League Baseball debut on Wednesday when he threw 0.2 innings while getting two groundouts. The 27-year-old was a 5th round pick out of Rice back in 2019 and had worked his way up through the Reds farm system – spending all of 2024 in Triple-A with Louisville where he had a 3.40 ERA in 42.1 innings before his call up.

The Pequod in this case – always searching for the great white whale.

Now, wait a minute. Kravetz was starting to warm yesterday but the magic 8 run deficit was reached so they could go with Maile. So, his MLB experience is 2 batters on Wednesday and he gets a DFA so they can bring up another pitcher. Why would Bell do this? Just use the guy you have as an opener for is good as he can last. They can’t let some guys pitch more than an inning, Santillan can’t be a closer, pitch counts, handedness issues, and “throwing away” players after not getting a reasonable chance to show something all for the sake of some rigid set of “rules” and/or a miniscule if any statistical advantage. The “players coach”, sure.

Agree with you 100%. So frustrating watching Bell’s management of games

Here’s a trivia question for those who know the rules better than I do.

Can a player who is DFA’d and then outrighted to a minor league team, be re-selected back to the Major League roster in less than the 15 days that would be required if he were optioned?

I’m not sure, but I think the answer is yes. In other words, Buchanan could pitch tonight, be DFA’d tomorrow, and be replaced by Kelly who was just outrighted.

Rinse and repeat……

Jim Walker 08/31/2024

I’ve also been wondering what the turnaround is on being DFA/waived/outrighted and then allowed to come back to MLB. Had some stuff going here today and haven’t gotten around to digging.

My first impulse is the same as yours, why not, unless they’ve put in a rule to specifically stop the quick turnaround?

Oldtimer 08/31/2024

He will be the 59th Red so far this season.

SteveAReno 08/31/2024

Very welcome aboard David Buchannan. Your first outing against the vaunted Brewers was quite decent indeed.
