OLD TIMERS MAGIC CAN'T HELP THIS TEAM
Source: AP

Embarrassing. That's what the 9-2 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers is. You have the greatest Yankees of the modern baseball era in the house, and the 2023 Yankees just looked like a bunch of losers, because clearly they are. I tried to feel optimistic. I felt an ounce of life with the performance of the new Baby Bombers. But Saturday took the wind out of my sails. Thank God Coco Gauff won the US Open otherwise the day would have been a total loss. So despite having Old Timers in the house, their magic won't help this team.

"Gathered in their pinstripes, bathed in glories of yesteryear, the retired players spent some time in the home clubhouse. There was little advice that Jeter & Co. could offer the current group; for the most part, they knew nothing but winning during their time in the Bronx. The Yanks dropped their third straight game, falling to the Brewers, 9-2," reported MLB.com.

The 75th Anniversary of Old Timers Day drew a big crowd but rain delays, and just poor baseball sent them away. The bats were silent in front of the legends of the 90s and early 2000s.  This is unfamiliar territory for the 1998 Yankees. Hard to empathise when all you did was win championships.

“I run into New Yorkers every day,” Jeter continued, “and they’ll say thank you for the championships that we won. So it is a special feeling to be here at Yankee Stadium, introduced at the game formerly known as Old-Timers’ Day,” reported The New York Daily News. Thank you for all of the championships. Since he left, we have not seen any. The team hobbles into every season, without dramatic change thinking there will be change. It's ridiculous.

One shining star of the evening was Michael King, who is making a real case to becoming a member of the starting rotation next season. He struck out nine in five innings on Saturday and has an ERA of 1.08 in four starts since Aug. 24. Recall he volunteered to be stretched out and step into the starting role from his services in the bull pen. Now our pen let him down after he only gave up one earned run. 

The magic was back in the Bronx but it did not penetrate the 2023 dugout. Despite the pomp and circumstance and the thrill of seeing Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada, Andy Pettitte and Mariano Rivera back in pinstripes, it changes nothing about the 2023 Yankees. They still just stink.
