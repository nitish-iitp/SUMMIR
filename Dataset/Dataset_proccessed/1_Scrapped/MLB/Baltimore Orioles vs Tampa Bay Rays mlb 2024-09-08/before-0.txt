Tampa Bay Rays vs Baltimore Orioles Prediction 

Baltimore comes into this game after only scoring three runs in the first two games of this series, and they will need to find more offense if they want to win the series here. The Orioles are 42-32 at home, while the Rays are 33-34 on the road this year. Tampa Bay’s offense is one of the lowest scoring in the MLB, but they did erupt for seven runs on Saturday. Both of these pitchers have been solid recently and I think runs are going to be at a premium, so I am taking the under in this game.
