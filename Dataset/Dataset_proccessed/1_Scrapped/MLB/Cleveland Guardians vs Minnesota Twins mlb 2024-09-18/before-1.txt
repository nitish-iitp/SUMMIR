“These Championships cater specifically to club-level curlers who may not have the time or resources to compete at the professional level but who have the skills to represent their country at a higher level,” said Danny Lamoureux, CEO, Curling Canada. “The event opens an exciting avenue for these curlers to represent their countries and we appreciate Everest’s continued investment in the sport to provide all curlers with the opportunity to shine on a North American stage.”

“The prospect of competing beyond the national level is a game-changer for curlers who often reach a plateau unless they go professional,” said Randy Ferbey, six-time Canadian and four-time World Curling Champion, Canada Sports Hall of Fame Inductee, and Everest Curling Executive Committee Member. “This is welcome news for the entire curling community. It not only expands the opportunities for recreational curlers but also contributes to the growth and vibrancy of our sport.”
