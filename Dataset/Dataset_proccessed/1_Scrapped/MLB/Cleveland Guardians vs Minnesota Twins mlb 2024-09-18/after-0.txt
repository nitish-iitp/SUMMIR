Cleveland Guardians vs. Minnesota Twins, September 18, 2024
By Paul Hoynes, cleveland.com

CLEVELAND, Ohio – The Guardians couldn’t have asked for a better situation. They’d been held to two monster home runs by Josh Naylor over nine innings, but they still found themselves in extra innings.

Extra innings is a good place to be for the Guardians. On Wednesday night, they entered extras with an 8-3 record in overtime baseball, including a 5-2 mark at Progressive Field.
