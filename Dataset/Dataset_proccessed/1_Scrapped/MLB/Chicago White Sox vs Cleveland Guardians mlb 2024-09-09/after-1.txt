Cleveland Guardians vs. Chicago White Sox, Sept. 9, 2024
By Paul Hoynes, cleveland.com

CHICAGO -- The Guardians recalled rookie left-hander Joey Cantillo from the minors on Monday to start against the White Sox because scheduled starter Ben Lively needed a rest and Aaron Cobb couldn’t pitch because of a blister.

They were looking for a placeholder to give Lively a breather and buy some more time for Cobb to heal.
