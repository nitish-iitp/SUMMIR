3 keys to Rangers-Rays AL Wild Card opener: A Jordan Montgomery gem would go a long way
How should the Rangers attack Tampa Bay starter Tyler Glasnow? Which Texas star needs to return to form?

Here are three keys to the Texas Rangers’ AL Wild Card Series opener against the Tampa Bay Rays on Tuesday at 2:10 p.m. CT at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Fla.

A deep start from Jordan Montgomery

Well, duh. This is effectively the goal of each and every starting pitcher who toes the rubber.

But for the Rangers — and their corrosive bullpen — a long outing from Montgomery would benefit not just Tuesday’s game, but the entire series.

The bullpen numbers just aren’t pretty. Texas’ 4.81 relief ERA overall was the seventh-worst in baseball this season and dead-last among playoff teams. The Rangers converted just 47.6% of their save opportunities this season, the 13th-lowest mark since 1961, and blew 33 of their 63 chances.

The big picture importance: if the Rangers have to dive deep into their depleted bag of high-leverage relief pitchers in the first game of the series, it’ll leave them less options — or, at least, more slightly-fatigued options — for game two and a possible game three. The only thing worse than an unreliable bullpen is a spent one.

Montgomery is the man for the assignment. His 67 and 2/3 innings pitched since Aug. 1 rank fourth in the AL, and three of his last four starts have lasted seven innings.

Attack Tyler Glasnow’s off-speed stuff

Tampa Bay will start righthanded pitcher Tyler Glasnow on Tuesday. Glasnow, in his one start against the Rangers this season, pitched six innings of one-run, one-hit ball in June. He prioritized one of the Rangers’ weaknesses: fastballs.

Of Glasnow’s 84 pitches that game, 40 were fastballs. Texas’ lone hit against Glasnow (a Leody Taveras solo home run) came on a slider. That’s where Texas needs to capitalize.

Glasnow threw his fastball 43.6% of the time this season and used his slider 34.8% of the time. The Rangers accumulated 19.9 runs above average — the second-highest mark in MLB this season — against sliders. Since the start of August, they’ve had a negative run value (-4.2, the 24th-highest mark in MLB) against fastballs.

Get Corey Seager back on track

This feels like a no-brainer: when your All-Star, MVP candidate shortstop plays well, so does your team. When he doesn’t? It makes things a bit trickier.

Seager, who finished second to Tampa Bay’s Yandy Diaz for the AL batting title, slashed just .207/.270/.328 with two home runs in the final 15 games of the regular season. The Rangers went just 8-7 in that stretch and averaged 4.4 runs per game (down from their season average of 5.4) and scored two or less runs on seven occasions.

Texas was shutout twice in its season-ending series loss to the Seattle Mariners. Seager went hitless in both.

The good news: Seager, who slashed .327/.390/.623 with 33 home runs in the regular season, hasn’t been prone to many slumps this year. The better news: he has a history of raising his game in the postseason (see: 2020 World Series and NLCS MVP awards) and is 1 for 2 with four walks vs. Glasnow in the postseason, from when the two faced each other in the 2020 World Series.
