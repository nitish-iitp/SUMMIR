Arizona Diamondbacks vs Milwaukee Brewers Prediction 

Arizona was able to come in and win game one in this series on Thursday night with a great pitching performance, and they are 43-35 on the road this season. Milwaukee has struggled offensively over their last three games, but they are 44-31 at home this year. This game does mean a lot for Arizona, as they are fighting for an NL Wild Card spot with the Mets and Braves. The Diamondbacks are going with Gallen, who has allowed zero earned runs in his last two road starts. The Brewers are going with Rea, who was absolutely lit up in his last start. Arizona is the highest-scoring team in the MLB this season and I like them with Gallen on the mound here.
