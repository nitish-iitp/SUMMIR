Rangers prospect Evan Carter, fresh off his weekend debut, is starting to make an imprint on the big league lineup. He also made an imprint on a baseball and sent it flying over 400 feet.

Carter launched his first career big league home run in his first at-bat of the Rangers’ matchup against the Blue Jays on Monday. The no-doubt blast to right field tied the game at 2-2 in the third inning.

Carter, who logged his first career base hit in his debut game on Friday, hit 12 home runs this season for Double-A Frisco. This one was off the bat at 102.4 miles per hour and traveled 406 feet, according to MLB Statcast.

In his next at-bat he fought back from an 0-2 count and ripped a single, his third MLB base hit, to center field, then eventually scored what was the go-ahead run to give the Rangers a 3-2 lead. He’s contributed on defense as well, preserving the lead in the fourth inning by throwing out Blue Jays outfielder Kevin Kiermaier at home.

Carter, 21, was the Rangers’ second-round draft pick in 2020. He entered the 2023 season as the organization’s top prospect and was called up to the major leagues after the injury to Rangers outfielder Adolis Garcia.
