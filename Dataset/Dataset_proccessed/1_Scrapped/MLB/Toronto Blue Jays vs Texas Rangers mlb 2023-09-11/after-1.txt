This might be the most impressive number to sum up Evan Carter’s first week with Rangers
Rangers manager Bruce Bochy lauded the young outfielder’s ‘patience and discipline’ at the plate.

TORONTO — In just a handful of games, Evan Carter already has his first Major League hit, homer, stolen base and, not one, but two outfield assists.

This, however, might be his most impressive stat so far: A 3.4% chase rate.

Carter, who did not start on Tuesday because the Rangers were facing a lefty, has swung at only two pitches outside the strike zone amongst the 59 pitches he’s faced. One of those, a two-strike fastball in on his hands in his debut, was a hit. He has one swing and miss outside the zone.

“We’ve said, even going back to spring training, that the patience and discipline he had, at that time as a 20-year old, that’s not something that just happens,” manager Bruce Bochy said. “He’s worked at it. That’s what he does all the time. He tries to shrink the strike zone and make pitchers come to him. He doesn’t panic at two strikes. He just gives you quality at-bats. He’s advanced for his age. That’s why he is up here.”

He simply does not offer at pitches out of the zone and he doesn’t often miss at pitches in the zone.

In the minor leagues this season, at both Double-A and Triple-A, Carter posted a 19.7 chase rate (swings at pitches outside the zone, regardless of contact). At every level since the Rangers drafted him in the second round in 2020, he’s ranked in the top 10 percentile for lowest chase rate. Through his first four games in the majors, he had just six total swings and misses.

“I’m not trying to do too much, just trying not to expand the [strike] zone,” Carter said of his approach. “And I definitely think I’ve calmed down a little bit since [my first game]. When you get down to it, it’s just baseball. It comes down to just trying to relax and have fun with it.”

Evan has covered the Rangers since 1997. He has twice been named one of the top 10 beat writers in the country by the AP Sports Editors. His passions outside of covering baseball are his wife, Gina, his two step kids, two crazy dogs & barbecue. Let's not discuss the cat. Evan graduated from Georgia State University, but oddly is a Georgia fan.
