"First of all I want to ask Novak: What are you still doing here? Come on," joked Medvedev. "Jokes apart, third final [together], maybe not the last - I hope so because you're probably going to be in many more. I don't know when you are planning to slow down a little bit.

"I mean, 24. I feel like I have not a bad career and I have 20 titles. You have 24 Grand Slams. Wow."
