Royals shortstop phenom Bobby Witt Jr. wins American League batting title
Morning Headlines: Monday, Sept. 30, 2024

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - It hasn’t taken long for his Major League career to live up to the hype of a No. 2 overall pick.

Kansas City Royals star Bobby Witt Jr. won his first American League batting championship, finishing with a major league-best .332 average.

Witt, who took his first day off all season Saturday, went 1 for 4 in the Royals’ finale to finish at .332. Toronto’s Vladimir Guerrero was second at .323 and the New York Yankees’ Aaron Judge third at .322.

“It’s special and it’s an honor,” Witt said. “It’s something that wasn’t even a goal. You never think as a kid it would ever happen and now it happened.”

Witt’s accomplishment marks the first time a Royals has won the batting title since 1990. No Royal had led all of MLB in batting average since 1982, a mark that Witt also accomplished during his 2024 campaign.

The 24-year-old shortstop finished the regular season with 32 home runs, 45 doubles, 11 triples, 109 RBI, 125 runs and 31 stolen bases.

Judge had 58 homers to lead the major leagues for the second time after hitting an AL-record 62 in 2022. His 144 RBIs were the most in the majors since Philadelphia’s Ryan Howard had 146 in 2008.

Seven batters are hitting .300 or higher, which would be the fewest since a record low six in 1968. There were 55 in 1999 during the Steroids Era.

Boston outfielder Jarren Duran led the major leagues with 48 doubles and tied Arizona’s Corbin Carroll for the lead with 14 triples, the first time a player had a share in both categories since Lou Brock in 1968.

Among pitchers, this was just the fifth non-shortened season without a 20-game winner after 1871, 2006, 2009 and 2017.

Detroit’s Tarik Skubal and Atlanta’s Chris Sale top the major leagues with 18 wins each, though Sale might pitch against the Mets on Monday. Hampered by injuries, the left-hander totaled 17 wins over the previous five seasons.

Sale is on track to lead the NL in ERA at 2.38, with Philadelphia’s Zack Wheeler at 2.57. Skubal’s 2.39 mark led the AL.
