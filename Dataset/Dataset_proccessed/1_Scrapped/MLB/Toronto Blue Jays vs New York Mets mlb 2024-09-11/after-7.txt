Blue Jays’ Bowden Francis loses no-no in 9th on Francisco Lindor’s game-tying homer for Mets

TORONTO — Twice in one month, Blue Jays starter Bowden Francis carried a no-hitter into the ninth inning. And twice, a leadoff home run thwarted his chance at history.

After Francis fell three outs short of a no-hitter against the Los Angeles Angels last month when Taylor Ward homered to begin the ninth inning, the Blue Jays starter had a chance at a re-do Wednesday against the New York Mets.

The 28-year-old right-hander had no-hit the Mets through eight innings, despite only striking out one batter while throwing 108 pitches. With the Blue Jays leading 1-0, Francis had the daunting task of facing the top of the Mets order in the ninth if he wanted to etch his name in the history books and become only the second-ever Blue Jays pitcher to throw a no-hitter, after Dave Stieb.

Against Mets leadoff man Francisco Lindor, Francis got ahead 0-2, but a third-pitch 92-mph fastball caught too much of the middle of the plate and the Mets shortstop didn’t miss, launching a game-tying solo home run into right field that elicited groans from the 29,399 Blue Jays fans in the stands. But despite missing out on a no-hitter after being so close yet again, Francis walked off to a standing ovation from the Toronto faithful.

After Lindor tied the game, the Mets blew it open, scoring six runs in the ninth to author a dramatic — and meaningful — 6-2 comeback win, especially considering how they performed through eight innings. The win keeps the Mets in playoff position, sitting a half-game up on the Atlanta Braves for the National League’s third wild-card spot, with the Braves due to play the Washington Nationals on Wednesday evening.

Sean Manaea tipped his cap to Francis across dugouts in the ninth. “That was a crazy performance,” he said. “I’ve got to give respect where respect is due.”

Said Mets manager Carlos Mendoza: “He was on. He’s got a really good feel for pitching. The four-seamer at the top, we couldn’t square him up. He kept popping us up. …Nothing overpowering but just enough to miss barrels.”
