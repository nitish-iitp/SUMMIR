Dave Roberts Prioritizing Health For Dodgers Pitchers In Doubleheader Against Rockies

The Los Angeles Dodgers closed out their final homestand with a walk-off win over the San Francisco Giants and now travel to Coors Field for the start of a four-game series against the Colorado Rockies.

The teams are playing a split doubleheader on Tuesday, which presents some challenges to Dodgers manager Dave Roberts as he looks to keep his players healthy heading into the postseason. “I think we’re going to be able to manage the playing time on the position-player side,” Roberts began.

“Honestly, there’s guys that I want to play. So I think with the doubleheader, I’m sure Freddie (Freeman) is going to lobby to play both, and I’ll have a conversation with Mookie (Betts). But I think everyone else will just play one of two. We’ll see how James feels.

“For me, it’s more so the pitching and trying to get guys rest. But to be honest, we only have so many games left, and I want Mookie and Freddie to give a good run at this MVP.

“Everyone knows Colorado is a hitter-friendly place, and if they can throw out some hits, some homers, and it pads their stats and we win some baseball games, I’m all for that.”

The Dodgers will use an opener in the first game of the doubleheader — with Ryan Pepiot filling a bulk role — followed by Bobby Miller starting the nightcap.

After their series with the Rockies, the Dodgers head to Oracle Park for three final games against the Giants to conclude the regular season.

Dave Roberts: Dodgers reaching 100 wins would be special

At 96-59 entering their off day, the Dodgers need to go 4-3 this week to reach the 100-win mark for the fifth time since 2017.

Considering all the adversity they faced, Roberts believes the accomplishment would be extra special for the team this season. “Every year is different, but if we do reach that 100-win mark, that’s a big number,” Roberts said.

“You see this roster, see the youth, guys that just came on board this year and blended in, had really good years and contributed, looking at where the pitching and defense was at the first half of the year and where it’s at now, there’s a lot of improvements.

“So this is right up there at the top if we can get to the 100-win mark.”

Very important to maintain good player relationships.
Important mainly to predict financial commitments.
