St. Louis Cardinals vs New York Yankees Prediction

I might try the Cardinals in this one. Fedde took a loss to Cincinnati on August 13 with four earned in 6.0 innings, but he’s been pretty good since then. Fedde has given up just three earned in his last 11.2 innings but he’s also just 0-1 in his last two starts. Still, a decent showing here should set the Cardinals up down the stretch.

In their last series St. Louis got a nice performance from the pitching staff. After Sonny Gray (6.0 innings; one earned) the pen did a great job with 3.0 clean frames, no hits, two walks and three Ks. The Cardinals have gained some momentum over the last couple of days and could surprise on Friday.
