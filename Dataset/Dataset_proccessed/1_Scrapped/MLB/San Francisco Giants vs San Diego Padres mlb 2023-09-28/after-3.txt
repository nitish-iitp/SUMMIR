The San Francisco Giants have been officially eliminated from playoff contention following their 4-0 loss to the San Diego Padres on Tuesday, September 26.

It was a disappointing season for the Giants, who appeared to be formidable with the talent they have on paper, NBC Sports reported.

With the season over for the Giants, the blame game is expected to follow. At one point, San Francisco led the National League wild-card chase. But their trajectory changed in July, going 6-28 in their final 34 games on the road, SI.com reported.

One reason being singled out for the Giants' unfortunate twist of events is a Filipino card game called "Pusoy Dos." Also known as Filipino Poker, some Giants players allegedly spent more time playing the game than studying their opponents.

That includes Joc Pederson, who reportedly found pusoy dos more compelling than studying opponents, according to Andrew Baggerly of The Athletic.

Giants' problems more than just 'Pusoy Dos'

However, playing Filipino Poker was not the only distraction for the Giants. Players didn't seem bothered by the losses, with one player begging to ask how a major league clubhouse could listen to music rather than figure out how they lost.

Pederson is expected to become a free agent, although playing more pusoy dos seems unprofessional.

But the one in the hot seat will be Giants manager Gabe Kapler. With the failed MLB season plus word getting out that the team clubhouse is in disarray, the future of the 48-year-old with the San Francisco Giants does not look promising.

Kapler did take the blame for the Giants' woeful season via KNBR. But being in the final year of his contract, it will be interesting if San Francisco Giants chairman Greg Johnson still wants him back in the next MLB season.
