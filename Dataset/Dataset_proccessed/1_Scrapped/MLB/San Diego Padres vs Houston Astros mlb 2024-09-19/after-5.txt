The 2024 MLB Playoff dance card is starting to take their reservations.

The Milwaukee Brewers and the New York Yankees purchased their tickets to the dance with victories yesterday, with the former clinching the NL Central Division Title and the latter claiming at least a wildcard position. The Cleveland Guardians should be the next ones to clinch, likely today.
