Shota Imanaga dazzles with seven scoreless innings in Cubs' win over Nationals
“He’s been our best pitcher,” manager Craig Counsell said. “He’s been our best player; there’s no question about it. He’s just delivered, and he’s been a huge boost for us.”

Not even a rain delay could derail Shota Imanaga.

He adjusted his eating time, took short naps and went out and had another impressive start in the Cubs’ 5-0 win Sunday against the Nationals at Wrigley Field.

The left-hander continued his All-Star season by throwing seven scoreless innings with no walks and four strikeouts. He has allowed three or fewer runs in his last seven starts.
