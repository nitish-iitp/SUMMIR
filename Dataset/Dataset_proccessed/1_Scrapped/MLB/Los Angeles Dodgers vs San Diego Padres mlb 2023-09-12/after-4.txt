Padres Vs. Dodgers Game Preview: David Peralta Returns To Lineup

The Los Angeles Dodgers started their homestand in disappointing fashion and now need a win Tuesday night to avoid losing a series to the San Diego Padres.

The Dodgers have not lost a series to the Padres since June 21-23, 2021, when they were swept in three games at Petco Park. Overall this season, L.A. is 8-3 against San Diego.

The Dodgers enter play with their magic number to clinch the National League West at seven. Meanwhile, the Padres are inching toward an early offseason even with their comeback win on Monday night.

Lance Lynn takes the mound amid a stretch of struggling in his last three starts. After pitching to a 1.44 ERA through his first four outings after being traded to the Dodgers, Lynn has a 10.80 ERA and allowed eight homers in his last three starts.

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has continued to express his confidence in the veteran and the potential for Lynn to be part of their postseason rotation.

The Padres are essentially middle of the pack with 187 home runs this season, ranking 13th in baseball. Lynn’s 40 homers allowed are most in the Majors.

The Dodgers lineup looks to have success against Michael Wacha, who is enjoying another strong year. The right-hander is 11-3 with a 2.99 ERA and 1.17 WHIP across 20 starts in his first season with the Padres.

Wacha went 11-2 with a 3.32 ERA for the Boston Red Sox last year. He’s yet to face the Dodgers this season.

Mookie Betts is on the verge of breaking an MLB record for most RBI from the leadoff spot in a single season. He currently has 103, which is tied with Charlie Blackmon (2017).

Freddie Freeman is celebrating his 34th birthday on Tuesday, and to commemorate it, the Dodgers are distributing a replica jersey for the first 40,000 fans in attendance for the Dodger Stadium giveaway.

David Peralta is back in the Dodgers lineup after being somewhat limited in the series opener due to being hit by a pitch in the left elbow during Sunday’s game.

Kyle Hurt is available out of the Dodgers bullpen, and should he appear, it would represent the MLB debut for the prospect. Victor González was optioned to Triple-A Oklahoma City and the Dodgers transferred Gus Varland to the 60-day injured list as corresponding roster moves.
