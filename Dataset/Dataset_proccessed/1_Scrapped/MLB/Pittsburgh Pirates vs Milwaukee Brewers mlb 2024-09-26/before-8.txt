Milwaukee Brewers vs Pittsburgh Pirates Prediction

This is a great spot to take the Pirates to pick up another win here. Keller sits with an 11-11 record but he’s going to have a strong start here. The Brewers bats are going to be ice cold here, and that is going to be the difference here. The Brewers offense is going to really struggle to get going here, and Pittsburgh is going to end up on top. Back the Pirates on the money line to cash.
