New York Mets vs Atlanta Braves Prediction

Game 1 Prediction: The most important game in this doubleheader is game 1, as the winner clinches a playoff spot and can rest all of their players while saving a key starter. Megill has allowed just 4 earned runs in his last 20 innings, while Schwellenbach has allowed 9 earned runs in his last 29.2 innings. Both pitchers in great form and this will have the feel of a playoff game. Pitching and defense probably rules the way. I'm going with the under in the first game.

Game 2 Prediction: Game 2 is a pick you'd make based on the winner of game 1. Again, whoever wins the first game already clinches and is probably resting guys. I wouldn't expect Severino or Sale to start this game, depending on the winner of the first contest. It's strictly about making the dance. One of these scheduled starters would be saved for the wild card series. That gives the loser of game 1 a massive edge in game 2. So, my pick in game 2 is whoever loses the first game. Sorry, Arizona Diamondbacks.
