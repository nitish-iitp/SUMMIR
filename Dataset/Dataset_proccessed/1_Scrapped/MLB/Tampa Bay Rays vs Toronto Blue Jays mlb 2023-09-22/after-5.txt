The Rays, who have a comfortable lead in the wild-card race and have already clinched a playoff berth, started the day 1 1/2 games behind first-place Baltimore in the AL East. The Orioles, who own the tiebreaker, were at Cleveland on Friday night.

Rays All-Star left fielder Randy Arozarena exited after the fourth inning with right quadriceps tightness. He legged out a double in the first and scored the game's first run on Harold Ramirez's RBI single.

Tampa Bay center fielder Jose Siri missed his 10th straight game with a broken right hand. Another outfielder, Luke Raley, was placed on the 10-day injured list before the game due to a cervical strain.

Rays starter Tyler Glasnow (9-7) had given up just one hit and a walk until George Springer had a one-out single in the sixth.

After stealing second, Springer scored to tie it at 1 on Bo Bichette's single that deflected off the glove of diving first baseman Yandy Diaz. Alejandro Kirk picked up an RBI to make it 2-1 on the third consecutive walk by Glasnow, which ended his night.

Kevin Kelly replaced Glasnow and hit Matt Chapman with a pitch to force in a run, then allowed an RBI single to Varsho as Toronto took a 4-1 lead.

Mead got the Rays within 4-2 on his first career homer, a seventh-inning drive off Bassitt.

Glasnow permitted four runs, three hits and four walks over 5 1/3 innings. He struck out seven.

'It's not realistic': Former PM Chretien thinks Trump will back off trade war

Former prime minister Jean Chretien says U.S. president-elect Donald Trump is likely to walk back his threat of punishing tariffs and the resulting trade war with Canada, because the Americans are too reliant on a number of Canadian exports, namely in the energy sector.
