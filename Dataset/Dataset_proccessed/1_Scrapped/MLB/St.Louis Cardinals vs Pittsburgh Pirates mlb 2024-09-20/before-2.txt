Pittsburgh Pirates vs Cincinnati Reds Prediction

I’ll take the Reds here. Martinez is cruising along nicely these days. In his last three starts combined Martinez is 3-0 with just two earned over 18.2 innings on 11 hits and four walks. Cincinnati will be set up quite well if Martinez can keep it going.

On Thursday the Reds coughed up 18 hits to the Braves. Aguiar and Brandon Leibrandt each gave up seven earned runs in forgettable outings. If there’s good news Atlanta only used two arms out of the bullpen. They’ll need a bounce-back effort on Friday.
