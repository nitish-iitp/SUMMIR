Rays see low turnout for Game 1 of AL Wild Card

Rangers-Rays was the lowest crowd to see a non-COVID season postseason MLB game
GETTY IMAGES
The announced attendance of 19,704 for Game 1 of the AL Wild Card between the Rays and Rangers at Tropicana Field was "the smallest crowd -- not including the 2020 COVID bubble playoffs -- to see a major-league baseball postseason game." The Rays "drew fewer fans for the playoff opener than they had for 33 home games this season." John Romano wrote one could point to the 3:07pm ET starting time "in the middle of a work week with very little notice" as a reason for the low attendance, but "who can blame network executives for keeping the Rays far away from prime time after watching that train wreck of a game." The "relatively paltry crowd" was "a disappointment" after the Rays recently announced a financing plan to build a new ballpark on the Trop site (TAMPA BAY TIMES, 10/3).

The other three Wild Card Series games last night -- Blue Jays-Twins at Target Field (38,450), D-backs-Brewers at American Family Field (40,892) and Marlins-Phillies at Citizens Bank Park (45,662) -- all reached at least 98% ballpark capacity (SBJ).
