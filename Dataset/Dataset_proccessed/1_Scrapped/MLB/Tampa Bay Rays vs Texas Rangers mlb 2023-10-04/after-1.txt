In Rangers’ sweep of Rays, Adolis García backed up trash talk against longtime friend

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — They were friends first, teammates later and now rivals. They are passionate and full of emotion. And it just didn’t seem like the AL Wild Card Series could be completed without at least one of Adolis García or Randy Arozarena of Tampa Bay injecting electricity into the series.

Until Wednesday afternoon, though, the only jolt had been delivered by Arozarena’s mother.

She threw out a first pitch before Game 1. First time seeing her son play in the U.S. Afterwards, she got a hug from García, who has come to know her well.

On Wednesday, though, García added his own dash of panache. First, he’d ramped up the trash-talking a notch with a text to his buddy that Wednesday would be Arozarena’s last day of batting practice for the year. Turns out García not only can smack talk, he can layeth the smack down, too.

In the fourth inning, García stayed back on 1-1 cutter from Zach Eflin, ripped into it and drove it out for the game’s first run. He turned back towards the Rangers’ dugout, twirled his bat like a baton and then did a bases-stomping trot around the diamond. The Rangers went on to score three more times in the inning, taking the life out of Tampa Bay.

“I wanted to get the team going,” García said afterwards and between champagne baths. “A big homer in a big moment. It made me proud. I felt like now my dream is coming true. I got homer in the postseason and then we won. I’m happy.”

García and Arozarena knew each other in Cuba, but didn’t become close until both ended up in the St. Louis Cardinals’ organization as MLB minor leaguers. Eventually, they were pared off to the Rangers and Rays, respectively. Arozarena got off to the more electric start as a major leaguer, becoming a hero of the Rays’ run to the 2020 World Series and was Rookie of the Year in 2021.

Both players were All-Stars this past season and both participated in the Home Run Derby, giving them a chance to put their friendship on display for the entire country.

The playoffs, however, took things to another level.

Evan graduated from Georgia State University, but oddly is a Georgia fan.
