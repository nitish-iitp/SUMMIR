Obituary: Dick Tomanek (1931-2023)

RIP to lefty pitcher Dick Tomanek, who played for parts of 5 seasons in the majors in the 1950s. He died on August 11 at the Ames Family Hospice House in Westlake, Ohio. He was 93 years old. Tomanek played for the Cleveland Indians (1953-54, 1957-58) and Kansas City Athletics (1958-59).

Richard Carl Tomanek was born in Avon Lake, Ohio, on January 6, 1931. As a student at Avon Lake High School, he was a basketball letterman as well as a promising baseball prospect. He started six games in his senior year and threw four no-hitters, according to the Associated Press article announcing his signing with Cleveland in June of 1950. In fact, he allowed just seven hits in those starts and struck out a reported 143 batters, amounting to more than 2 K’s per inning. He reported to Pittsfield of the Canadian-American League and continued to throw the ball by batters. In an early appearance against Gloversville, Tomanek worked 3 innings in relief and struck out 7 batters. He also walked 1 and threw 2 wild pitches, indicating that he hadn’t harnessed his pitching ability just yet. Tomanek was selected as the Can-Am Rookie of the Year after finishing with a 6-8 record and 3.80 ERA, but only 87 hits allowed in 123 innings. He fanned 138 batters and walked 142, but those who saw him pitch loved his potential. Unfortunately, the potential would have to wait a few years, as Tomanek enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1951 and served until June 1952.

Tomanek pitched for the Parris Island Marines baseball team until he was discharged and rejoined the Indians organization. He was assigned to Class-A Reading and was used mainly as a reliever. Tomanek kept his strikeout rate up and improved his control. By 1953, he had returned to his starting role and won 13 games for Indianapolis of the American Association. He fanned 158 batters in 165 innings, walked 98 and tossed 10 complete games, including 3 shutouts. He was named to the AA All-Star Team and, most importantly, was promoted to the major leagues in September.

Cleveland purchased Tomanek’s contract on September 23 and gave him a start on the 25th against Detroit. He wasn’t perfect, as he walked 6 batters and gave up 6 hits, including a 3-run homer to Ray Boone. But Cleveland staked him to a lead with 4 runs in the third inning and didn’t let up, scoring 12 runs in total. Al Rosen homered twice for the Indians and scored the first run of the game by stealing home in a double steal. Tomanek fanned 6 Tigers and went the distance, getting the win in a 12-3 victory.

Cleveland manager Al Lopez was impressed by the rookie’s poise and favored him for a spot on the roster in 1954. “He was in serious trouble in each of the first four innings but pitched himself out of trouble every time and seemed to possess great confidence in his ability to weather each storm,” stated an AP article attributed to Lopez in the spring of 1954. “If he continues to improve his curve under the tutelage of pitching coach Mel Harder, he may become a very important man in our pitching plans this summer.”

Tomanek made the team but made just one appearance — a relief outing against the White Sox on April 17. He replaced Art Houtteman after the starter gave up 4 runs while retiring just 2 batters. Tomanek ended the first inning by getting Johnny Groth to foul out to the catcher, and then he threw a 1-2-3 inning in the second frame. Tomanek retired Orestes Minoso on a grounder in the third inning, but then Ferris Fain hit a solo homer and Bob Boyd walked. That was all for Tomanek, who allowed a run in 1-2/3 innings. It would also be his only appearance in the majors for the next couple of years. He was sent back to Indianapolis at the end of April so that he could get steady work. He pitched primarily as a starter for Indianapolis in 1954 and ’55 and was steady, if not as unhittable as he was in his first few seasons. He gave up more than a hit an inning and saw his ERA rise to 4.29 in 1954 and 5.25 in 1955. In 1956, Tomanek was involved in a collision at home plate after trying to score on a double. He broke a bone in his ankle and was shelved for several months. He returned near the end of the season and pitched very well. He carried that success over to the following season, as Tomanek rejoined Cleveland for 1957.

The 1954 Indians had captured the AL pennant, though Tomanek missed most of that excitement. The 1957 team, by contrast, would finish in sixth place in the American League, with a 76-77-record. Aside from a couple of spot starts, Tomanek pitched out of the bullpen, logging 34 appearances in total. His year was full of extremes; Tomanek gave up 6 runs in a couple of appearances in April but had a fine 2.41 in 9 games in May. He picked up a win against the White Sox on May 24 by retiring two batters after starter Bob Lemon injured a thigh muscle and had to leave the game. Tomanek would pitch well for stretches, then he would have an awful outing that would send his ERA soaring again. He ended 1957 with a 2-1 record and a 5.68 ERA.

Tomanek struggled to start the season in 1958, and manager Bobby Bragan went so far as to label the southpaw the team’s biggest disappointment. Not long after those comments, Tomanek threw 6 scoreless relief innings against the White Sox on May 16, and then he threw a 12-inning, complete game win against Boston on May 21. He struck out 7, walked 7, held Ted Williams hitless in 5 at-bats and threw an estimated 148 pitches. Bragan changed his tune quickly. “Tomanek has stuff probably second to no one but Herb Score on this team. And he’s always ready and eager to pitch,” the manager said.

“I heard about it,” Tomanek said of Bragan’s negative comments. “Maybe it did shake me up a little, made me more determined. At any rate I’m not doing anything different. My control has been a little better, and that always helps.”

Tomanek had a few more starts and ended up with a 2-3 record and 5.62 ERA when Cleveland and Kansas City made a trade on June 15. Tomanek, infielder Preston Ward and outfielder Roger Maris were sent to the Athletics in exchange for first baseman Vic Power and outfielder Woodie Held. Tomanek immediately paid dividends for his new team. He earned his first career save on June 20, throwing 2-2/3 scoreless innings against Boston in a 5-3 win. When given a spot start against the New York Yankees on July 18, Tomanek tossed a complete game, scattering 11 hits in a 2-1 win. One of his most dominant relief outings came against his old Cleveland teammates on August 10. Brought into the game in the eighth inning of a 2-2 tie with the bases loaded and nobody out, Tomanek promptly struck out Larry Doby, Rocky Colavito and Dick Brown. Maris clubbed a 2-run homer in the top of the ninth inning, and Tomanek finished the game with a scoreless inning, striking out 2 more batters to end up with 5 strikeouts in 6 batters faced. He won 5 games for Kansas City and saved 5 others to go with a 3.61 ERA. On the year, he had a 7-8 record and a 4.50 ERA, and those 5 saves were second-best on the A’s. Tomanek logged a career-high 130 innings and struck out 92 batters. He also led the American League with 9 wild pitches.

Having established himself as the top reliever in Kansas City, Tomanek immediately became the subject of offseason rumors between the A’s and their frequent trading partners, the New York Yankees. That trade never materialized, thanks to a sore arm that scuttled the pitcher’s 1959 season. He was battered to the tune of 9 earned runs allowed in 8-2/3 innings pitched in April and May. Tomanek spent more than two months on the disabled list, returning in early August. The layoff seemed to help, as he pitched better over the final two months of the season. He lowered his ERA to 6.53 by the end of the year and saved 2 games for Kansas City. The team cut ties with him in December, sending the pitcher to its Triple-A affiliate in Dallas. Tomanek spent most of 1960 as a starter, winning 7 games while losing 11 and striking out 172 batters. Kansas City then assigned Tomanek to the team’s new Pacific Coast League affiliate in Honolulu, but he turned down the chance to spent 1961 in Hawaii. He told management that his home and family were in Ohio, and if he couldn’t pitch in the Eastern U.S., he would give up baseball. No deal could be worked out, so Tomanek retired at the age of 30.

In parts of 5 seasons, Tomanek made 106 appearances, including 11 as a starting pitcher. He had a 10-10 record with 7 saves and a 4.95 ERA. He struck out 166 batters in 231 innings, and he threw 4 complete games. Tomanek finished second in the AL with 54 appearances as a pitcher in 1958, and he finished in the Top 10 for wild pitches three times.

Tomanek returned to his home in Ohio. He and his wife Maureen had four children: Maureen, Rex, Richard and Mary. They were married for 59 years before her death in 2014. According to his family-placed obituary, he worked for BF Goodrich for 28 years before retiring in 1992. He enjoyed traveling with Maureen and rooting for Ohio sports teams, including the Indians/Guardians. As far as baseball, his biggest claim to fame was being part of the trade that sent Roger Maris to Kansas City. When Maris won back-to-back MVP Awards and hit a record-setting 61 home runs in 1961, his brief time in Cleveland and Kansas City were well-documented, as were the trades that had brought him to the Yankees. Whenever the story of Maris needed to be retold, Tomanek was mentioned. But if you’re going to be remembered for being part of an infamous trade, it’s better to be on the winning side of the deal. Just ask Ernie Broglio, Jim Fregosi or Milt Pappas.

Tomanek is survived by his four children and their families.
