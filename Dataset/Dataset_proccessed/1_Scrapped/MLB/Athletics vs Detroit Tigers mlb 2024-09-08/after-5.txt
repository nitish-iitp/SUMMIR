8 SECONDS REMAINING

OAKLAND -- Lawrence Butler has been climbing up the A’s record books with a career-best hitting streak that has him chasing down some popular A’s figures from yesteryear.

One of those players ahead of Butler is a fan favorite in Eric Byrnes, who happened to be in attendance for Sunday’s series finale between the A’s and Tigers as part of Alumni Sundays at the Coliseum. Having spent six seasons with Oakland from 2000-05, Byrnes compiled an impressive 22-game hit streak in 2003 that stands as the second-longest by an A’s player since 2000.

With Byrnes joining the A’s television broadcast during the fifth inning of a 9-1 A’s loss to Detroit, the former outfielder sat back with color commentator Dallas Braden just several feet behind home plate and watched Butler move one step closer towards reaching his mark by slapping a two-out single the opposite way to left, extending the 24-year-old outfielder's hit streak to 18 games.

Byrnes excitingly talked up Butler's emergence mid-at-bat and was thrilled to hear from Braden how close Butler was to matching his streak from ‘03.

“I’m rooting for him,” Byrnes said. “I hope so. The ability to stay on the baseball and use the entire field, that’s why this guy is hitting right now. … He stays on the baseball all the way through. Short to it, long through it. … You see him. You see Elly De La Cruz. This is where I want the game to go.”

Longest hit streak by an A’s player since 2000:
Miguel Tejada (24) in 2002
Eric Byrnes (22) in 2003
Lawrence Butler (18) in 2024
Marcus Semien (17) in 2019
Mark Ellis (17) from 2010-11
Terrence Long (17) in 2000

The longest hitting streak in A’s franchise history belongs to Bill Lamar, who collected a hit in 29 consecutive games for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1925. When it comes to the Oakland era (since 1968), Jason Giambi’s 25-game hit streak in ‘97 stands as the longest.

While Butler -- who set a franchise record with a nine-game extra-base hit streak this past week -- takes pride in seeing his name among so much A’s royalty, there's another milestone he has his eyes on: 20/20.

Not since Coco Crisp in 2013 have the A’s had a player record a 20-homer, 20-steal season. Butler is already at 21 home runs, and after swiping his 14th base of the season shortly after his single on Sunday, he is certainly within reach of reaching 20 with 18 games remaining.

“Yes, it is,” Butler said when asked if a 20-20 season is on his mind. “You might see me running rampant these last couple of weeks because I’m trying to get it. It’s definitely a goal I want.”

Butler has been opportunistic in his baserunning. He has yet to be thrown out in his 14 stolen-base attempts, which is tied with Detroit’s Zach McKinstry for most stolen bases without being caught stealing in the Majors. This puts Butler on track for another franchise milestone, as the record for most stolen bases in a season without a caught stealing is 16 by Jimmy Sexton in 1982.

Butler credits his baserunning prowess to first base coach Bobby Crosby, who immediately provides insight on the analytics for the opposing pitcher and catcher upon reaching first base.

“Bobby Crosby helps me a lot over there,” Butler said. “He’s got the pitchers’ times and knows which catchers have a good pop time and the percentage of runners they’ve thrown out.”

In all, Butler is generating excitement around baseball as a player on the rise in what is his first full season as a big leaguer. Over what is the longest active hitting streak in MLB, Butler is hitting .392 (29-for-74) with eight home runs, seven doubles and 14 RBIs.

Going back to June 3 -- the date Butler often points out as when he underwent a mechanical adjustment involving his head movement at the plate at the suggestion of A’s director of hitting Darren Bush --Butler’s 19 homers are tied with Shohei Ohtani for third-most in the Majors over that span, trailing only Aaron Judge (21) and teammate Brent Rooker (20).

“Lawrence is really enjoying playing the game,” Kotsay said. “He’s learning how to prepare every day. … Darren Bush and him have really just developed a great relationship. Darren is a mentor for him right now and keeping him grounded in terms of the approach and the work that he’s put in in the cage. It’s great to watch right now.”
