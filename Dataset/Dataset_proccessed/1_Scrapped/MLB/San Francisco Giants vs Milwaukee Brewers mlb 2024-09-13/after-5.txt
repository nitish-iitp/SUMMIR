Frankie Montas threw six shutout innings, Jackson Chourio belted his 20th home run and the visiting Milwaukee Brewers finished off a 2-1 series win over the San Francisco Giants with a 3-0 triumph Thursday night.

With the win, the Brewers (84-62) increased their lead in the National League Central to nine games over the Chicago Cubs with just 16 games to play for both teams. Meanwhile, the Giants (72-75) fell 8 1/2 games back in their pursuit of the final NL wild-card playoff spot.

Montas (7-10) was in complete control in his six innings, allowing just two hits and two walks while striking out eight.

San Francisco’s only threat against the right-hander came when he issued two-out walks to Matt Chapman and LaMonte Wade Jr. in the fourth inning of a scoreless game. Montas then got Jerar Encarnacion to line out.

Down 1-0, the Giants also put two aboard against Brewers reliever Aaron Ashby in the seventh after a two-out error by shortstop Willy Adames. But this time, Brett Wisely struck out to end the threat.

Milwaukee’s first run was a gift delivered by Giants reliever Camilo Doval (5-2) in the seventh inning. The former closer walked Adames and, over the course of his next 11 offerings, threw three wild pitches to allow the baserunner to come around.

Doval was San Francisco’s third pitcher, after Hayden Birdsong had delivered five shutout innings and Erik Miller a scoreless sixth. Birdsong allowed two hits and one walk while striking out four.

Chourio gave the Milwaukee bullpen some breathing room with his homer, a two-run shot in the eighth that also scored Brice Turang, who had singled.

The 20-year-old became just the third Brewers rookie to hit 20 homers, joining Ryan Braun (34 in 2007) and Prince Fielder (28 in 2006).

The Giants made things interesting against Brewers closer Devin Williams in the ninth, bringing the potential tying run to the plate with one out after a single by Mark Canha and double by Encarnacion. But Williams locked down the shutout and his 11th save by striking out Grant McCray and getting pinch hitter Patrick Bailey to ground out.

Encarnacion was the only player in the game with multiple hits with a double and a single. The Giants out-hit the visitors 5-4.
