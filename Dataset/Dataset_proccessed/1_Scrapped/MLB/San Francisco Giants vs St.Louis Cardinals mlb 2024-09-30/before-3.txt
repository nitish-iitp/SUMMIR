UPFRONT
MLB attendance grows for second straight season

Major League Baseball is expected to finish this season with increased total and average attendance for the second straight year. It is the first time MLB attendance has grown two seasons in a row since 2011 and 2012.

Through Sept. 24, with five days left in the regular season, MLB had drawn 68,996,021 fans and was on pace to finish with 71.1-71.3 million fans, either of which would surpass the number from 2023. Per-game attendance was 29,398, a slight increase over the 29,283 from 2023. Notably, this year’s final total attendance is expected to end about 10% up from 2022, the last year prior to the implementation of rule changes designed to speed up the game and reverse MLB’s five-year attendance slide. 

MLB’s expected target would be up approximately 0.5%-0.75% year-over-year, barring a significant amount of lost gates in the final days of the season (such as two rained-out Mets-Braves games rescheduled for a Monday doubleheader that, at press time, may not be played). MLB attendance in 2023 was 70.7 million.

The average time of game in 2024 is also on track to improve; at 2 hours 36 minutes, it would be about four minutes faster than 2023 and MLB’s best in 40 years, compared to 2:35 in 1984. 

“It’s an important sign of the strength of our business that we had the big jump last year and were able to actually be up again this year,” MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told Sports Business Journal. 

Shorter games have led to increased attendance on work and school nights, with weekday attendance up 12% from 2022. Weekends are also up 7% over 2022 heading into the final days of the 2024 season. 

“It’s interesting. We look at our attendance against our average to date every day. It’s an ongoing thing,” Manfred said. “And one of the things that we noticed this year, early in the season, is usually your weekdays are lower, and then the average goes up because you have big numbers on the weekends. But we actually, early in the season, even before the kids were fully out of school, had weekdays that were drawing our average up. Which is really an interesting phenomenon, and I think supportive of the idea that families are finding it a more family-friendly activity.”

The weekend of June 14-16 marked MLB’s best-attended weekend since August 2008 for both total (1.69 million) and average (37,527) attendance.

Overall, 24 clubs have increased their attendance since 2022.

The Los Angeles Dodgers continue to be No. 1 in average attendance, drawing 48,563 fans to Dodger Stadium in Shohei Ohtani’s first year with the team. The New York Yankees (41,822), Philadelphia Phillies (41,516), San Diego Padres (41,118) and Atlanta Braves (37,581) rounded out the top five. The Padres drew a single-season franchise record 3.33 million fans to Petco Park in 2024, while the Phillies had their highest total at Citizens Bank Park since 2012. 

The Cleveland Guardians were on pace to top 2 million for the first time since 2017, while the Arizona Diamondbacks (2.19 million) had their highest total since 2008 and the Baltimore Orioles (2.28 million) had their highest since 2015. The St. Louis Cardinals were seventh in per-game attendance (35,532), but sill had their lowest non-pandemic figure since 1997.

The bottom five teams in average attendance included the Kansas City Royals (20,473), Chicago White Sox (17,955), Tampa Bay Rays (16,515), Miami Marlins (13,425) and Oakland A’s (10,771), who are leaving for Sacramento at season’s end. 

The White Sox, who through Sept. 24 had tied the Modern Era record for most losses in a season, had their lowest per-game average since 1999 (17,616).
