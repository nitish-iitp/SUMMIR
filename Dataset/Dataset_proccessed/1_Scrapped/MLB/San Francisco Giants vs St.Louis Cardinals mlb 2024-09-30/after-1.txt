Brendan Donovan homered, Alec Burleson drove in three runs and the visiting St. Louis Cardinals denied the San Francisco Giants a .500 season with a 6-1, season-ending victory Sunday afternoon.

Rookie Michael McGreevy (3-0) completed an unbeaten season with eight strong innings, helping the Cardinals take two of three in the series to wrap up a 6-2 year-ending run.

The Cardinals never trailed, scoring once in the third, twice in the fifth and three times in the sixth to go up 6-0.

Donovan’s homer, a solo shot, opened the scoring against Giants starter Hayden Birdsong (5-6) in the third. It was the leadoff man’s 14th homer of the season.

A pair of inning-opening walks by Birdsong led to the Cardinals’ scoring in the fifth. Donovan drove in his second run with a one-out single, after which Burleson plated his first with a single.

Birdsong was pulled after Burleson’s hit, charged with three runs on four hits in 4 1/3 innings. He walked three and struck out 11.

Despite getting just 13 outs, Birdsong’s 11 strikeouts were just one shy of his season-high, set in July against Colorado.

The visitors busted the game open in the sixth when Jose Fermin singled in a run and Burleson capped his big day with a two-run single.

The Giants denied McGreevy a shutout opportunity in the seventh when Brett Wisely singled home Casey Schmitt, who had doubled.

McGreevy left after a scoreless eighth, having allowed just the one run and five hits. He struck out six and didn’t walk anyone.

The 24-year-old made just four major league appearances this season, including three starts.

Donovan finished with two hits, two RBIs and two walks for the Cardinals (83-79), who began the day with a chance to tie the Chicago Cubs for second place in the National League Central.

Schmitt had two hits for the Giants (80-82), who took fourth place in the NL West.
