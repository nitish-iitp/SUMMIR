Lionel Messi odds to score a goal for Inter Miami, Argentina: Next match in MLS vs Toronto FC

Lionel Messi is still shredding opposing defenses from his new home in the USA, scoring goals in bunches in his first stretch of matches with Inter Miami.

The Argentine joined the South Florida club in June 2023, and made his debut the following month in the Leagues Cup, hitting the ground running and incredibly leading Inter Miami to the final. Messi was at the forefront of this push, scoring an insane nine goals in his first six games with the club.

Alongside former Barcelona teammates Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba, who followed Messi to Inter Miami, the Argentine has become a sensation in the United States. His huge contract, buffeted by endorsement deals with Apple and Adidas, helped convince him to join, and so far he says he is enjoying life at the club.

The Sporting News brings you a roundup of Messi's action in front of goal with Inter Miami since joining, including his betting odds to score a goal in his next match – which will come in the colors of Argentina.

Lionel Messi next match with Inter Miami, Argentina

The Messi Magic refuses to die, as Inter Miami conjured a massive comeback against FC Cincinnati to advance to the U.S. Open Cup semifinal.  Messi got his first taste of official MLS action against the New York Red Bulls, scoring a goal off the bench, but was stymied in his previous two matches against Nashville and Los Angeles FC – although Messi did grab two assists in that game.

Partially rested during the international break, and then rested again over the weekend against Atlanta United, the Argentine has returned to club duty to continue Inter Miami's playoff push, albeit with concerns around his fitness. Up next the league schedule is put on hold for a home game against Houston Dynamo on Wednesday, September 27 in the U.S. Open Cup final, as Messi has another chance to secure a trophy for Inter Miami.

The match kicks off at 7:30 p.m. local time in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Here's how that translates to time zones across the globe.

Lionel Messi odds to score goal in next match

Logging a goal in each of his first seven matches for the club, Messi is torching opposing teams in the USA. Inter Miami scored 22 goals collectively in those seven games, including a goal in the opening 25 minutes of every single match, and in the opening 12 minutes of all but one.

Last time out against Toronto FC, Messi was hauled off after just 37 minutes with what appeared to be an injury, but Inter Miami coach Gerardo Martino insisted it was simply a fatigue issue. He was rested against Orlando City, and will now hope to take the field for another Cup final despite the fitness concerns.

Lionel Messi odds to score goal for Inter Miami vs Houston Dynamo

The odds for Lionel Messi to score a goal anytime for Inter Miami against the Houston Dynamo in the U.S. Open Cup final have been released. Despite his fitness concerns, Messi's odds are still extremely muted, with the market backing the Argentine confidently.

However, be advised: it's no guarantee that Lionel Messi starts this match, despite there being a trophy on the line. Messi has suffered from what the club insists is "fatigue" and while they have maintained that the goal is to have him ready for this match, a report on Tuesday suggests that it will be "difficult" for him to start, and that the club is working to simply have him available off the bench if needed.

Odds updated as of Tuesday, September 26.

USA (BetMGM): -150 anytime, +250 first.
Canada (Sports Interaction): Goal scorer odds not available.
Australia (Unibet): 1.68 anytime, 3.85 first
India (Dafabet): Goal scorer odds not available.

Lionel Messi odds to score goal in past matches this season

Since joining Inter Miami, Lionel Messi has lit up opposing defenses, scoring goals in a variety of ways like only he knows how.

Messi scored at least one goal in each of his first seven matches for the club. When you tack on a goal for Argentina in the summer, that gave Messi an eight-game scoring streak for club and country before finding his first zero against FC Cincinnati in the U.S. Open Cup semifinal.

Now, 12 matches into his Inter Miami career, Messi has scored 11 goals for the club, with multiple goals in three of those games. If an individual had bet one unit on Messi to score in each game for club and country since he joined Inter Miami, they would have netted a profit of 1.61 units, with recent zeroes hurting that total.

Messi's goal against Philadelphia Union in the Leagues Cup semifinal was the second-longest goal of his career, with an official distance of 36.3 yards from the goal line.

Messi goals, stats for Inter Miami

Lionel Messi fit in seamlessly with his new team in Miami, lighting crowds on fire ever since he came off the bench to score a game-winning free-kick on his debut.

Incredibly, Messi's 11 goals so far for Inter Miami have already put him third on the club's all-time goal scoring chart, having played just 11 games so far. He needs 10 more to pull level with Inter Miami's second-leading career goal scorer, his current teammate Leonardo Campana. The leader, fellow Argentine international Gonzalo Higuain, tops the list with 29 goals, well within reach for Messi.
