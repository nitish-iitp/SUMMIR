When Can Dodgers Clinch 2023 NL West Title? Magic Number Remains 4

The Los Angeles Dodgers failed to lower their magic number on Monday and Wednesday, but they have inched closer to winning their 10th National League West division title in the last 11 years.

The Dodgers defeated the San Diego Padres in a blowout victory Tuesday, while the Arizona Diamondbacks fell to the New York Mets, 7-4. The combination of those two outcomes lowered the Dodgers’ magic number to clinch the NL West to four.

The Dodgers los the series finale to the Padres on Wednesday and now have an off day Thursday. They start a series with the Seattle Mariners on Friday before returning home for their final homestand of the season, beginning with facing the Detroit Tigers.

The Diamondbacks play the Mets through Thursday before hosting the Chicago Cubs in a series that starts Friday. Both the Diamondbacks and Cubs are fighting for an NL Wild Card spot, with the Cincinnati Reds, Miami Marlins and Giants all within 1.5 games behind them.

The San Francisco Giants wrap up a series with the Cleveland Guardians on Wednesday and then travel to Coors Field to face the Colorado Rockies on Thursday.

When can the Dodgers clinch the NL West?

The Dodgers could potentially clinch the NL West on Saturday with wins in their next two games, along with two losses each from the Diamondbacks and Giants in the next three days.

Because a few things would need to go right for the Dodgers to clinch Saturday, it seems more likely they would wrap up the division in their finale against the Mariners, or potentially at home next week.

Either way, the Dodgers have the NL West all but officially locked up.

How important is it for the Dodgers to avoid arbitration hearings with players like Alex Vesia?
Poll ends in 5 days • Vote below
Very important to maintain good player relationships.
Important mainly to predict financial commitments.
Not important; arbitration is just part of the process.
