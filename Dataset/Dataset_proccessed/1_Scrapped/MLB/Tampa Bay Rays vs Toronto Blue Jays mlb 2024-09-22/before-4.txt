Saturday, 10:07 p.m. ET – Triple-A National Championship Game
The International League champions take on the Pacific Coast League champions in a one-game showdown, live from Las Vegas Ballpark. It'll be the Omaha Storm Chasers (Royals) -- the first team to win crowns in three different Triple-A leagues -- facing the Sugar Land Space Cowboys (Astros), who swept their way to the PCL crown.

Royals No. 15 prospect Tyler Gentry has been a staple of the Omaha batting order throughout the year, collecting 41 extra-base hits and 59 RBIs.

Astros No. 3 prospect Brice Matthews missed time during the summer due to back spasms, but was torrid at the dish upon returning (1.065 OPS) en route to a Sugar Land callup in early September. The 28th overall pick in the 2023 Draft out of the University of Nebraska had a two-hit, three-RBI performance in Game 1 of the PCL Finals.

Astros No. 21 prospect Pedro León enjoyed the offense-friendly environs of the PCL in 2024, clobbering 24 homers en route to racking up 90 RBIs (with 29 steals to boot). Most significantly ahead of the final game on the MiLB calendar, León crushed a 465-foot homer at Las Vegas Ballpark on June 1 -- although that had nothing on his 479-foot tape-measure shot on April 27.
