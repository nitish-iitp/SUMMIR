The Chicago White Sox sure haven’t put the “win” in Windy City this season.

The team is putting the finishing touches on a season that has been bad. Like, really bad. Like, zit on your nose on prom night while the limo shows up with a flat tire and then you finally make it only to spill punch on your dress bad. The franchise’s social media team even seems to have thrown in the towel.

“FINAL: the other team scored more runs than us,” read a post on the team’s X account on Sept. 18 after the White Sox lost 4-3 in 13 innings to the Los Angeles Angels to drop their record to 36-117.

Commenters were amused by the post.

“This coulda just been your copy and paste tweet all szn,” one person wrote.

“It only took you guys until September 18th to have a little humor huh,” someone else commented.

“Must be a day that ends in Y,” joked another user.

“I don’t blame yall for just giving up,” another person wrote.

In a season filled with lows (the team tied the American League record with 21 losses in a row this summer), the White Sox may soon hit an all-time low. The record for most losses in a single season is 120, set by the expansion New York Mets in 1962, widely considered to be one of the worst teams in baseball history, if not the worst, with a record of 40-120. That's the most losses by a team in the modern era (since 1900).

The 2003 Detroit Tigers are second when they challenged the record books by going 43-119. The good news for White Sox fans, who are third on the all-time list and only two losses behind that Detroit team? The Tigers struggled in 2003, but made it to the World Series in 2006.

That optimism notwithstanding, the 2024 White Sox have been a mess, right from the start when they opened the season with a 3-22 record.

No player on the current roster who has amassed over 45 at-bats is hitting over .250. No pitcher has double digits in wins. They fired manager Pedro Grifol after they snapped that 21-game losing streak and replaced him with Grady Sizemore.

The White Sox are actually not far removed from being competitive. They won the American League Central in 2021, the last year they made the playoffs. White Sox general manager Chris Getz knew the team may have taken its lumps this year, but he didn't foresee the squad challenging the record for most losses in a season.

“If you would have told me we were going to end up flirting with the record, I would have been a little surprised,” he told MLB.com earlier this month. “Now if you would have told me prior to the year that we would have ended up with over 100 losses, 105, 110, I wouldn’t have been as surprised."

Getz remains upbeat about what's ahead for the White Sox, though.

“I view it as kind of the frustrating part of the story. But I also know that the future’s looking bright, and it’s going to make it just that much sweeter once we get there.”
