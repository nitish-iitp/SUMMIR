Tigers won’t make MLB playoffs for 9th consecutive season

For the ninth consecutive season, the Detroit Tigers will be at home during the playoffs.

That shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who’s been following the season. Still, it was made official on Friday evening when the Minnesota Twins clinched the 2023 American League Central Division title.

When the Tigers lost to the Oakland Athletics later Friday night, it also ensured that Detroit (72-82) would finish under .500 for the seventh consecutive season.

That’s not to say the 2023 season has been a dismal failure. There are more bright spots now than just six months ago and a path to competitiveness feels more realistic than it did at the start of the season.

The Tigers even managed to hang around in the division race longer than expected thanks in part to the weakness of the AL Central.

On July 4, the Tigers (37-46) were only 4 1/2 games behind the first-place Twins (43-43), the closest they’d been to first place on that date since 2014, when they were in first place.

The Tigers lost 1-0 in 10 innings that day -- coincidentally to the Athletics -- and then lost again. They never got closer to first place and were 10 games out by Aug. 7.

The Tigers still have the longest playoff drought in baseball, although they’re still tied with the Los Angeles Angels, who underachieved (again) in 2023.

Neither team has made the postseason since 2014.

The Seattle Mariners (2001) and Philadelphia Phillies (2011) snapped their playoff droughts last season. The Phillies would be back in the playoff field again in 2023 if the season ended today. The Mariners are just a half-game out of the final Wild Card spot and one game back in the AL West.

The last time the Tigers seriously contended for the playoffs was 2016 when they were eliminated on the final day of the regular season.

The organization launched a rebuilding in 2017 that has yet to pay dividends, and general manager Al Avila was relieved of his duties last August.

When the playoffs start in 10 days, the Twins will be looking to end a drought of their own: They haven’t won a playoff game since Oct. 4, 2004. Since then, they’ve lost an incredible 18 postseason games in a row.
