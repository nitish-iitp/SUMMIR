Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Forge FC Release Indigenous Logos as Part of Truth and Reconciliation Efforts
Tuesday, September 19, 2023Glenn Cook

The Canadian Football League’s Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Canadian Premier League’s Forge FC have released new Indigenous-inspired logos as part of their shared ownership group’s efforts toward truth and reconciliation.

The new logos were unveiled by the Hamilton Sports Group on Tuesday, September 19. They were designed by Indigenous artist Kyle Joedicke, who is Cayuga from Six Nations of the Grand River, Turtle Clan.

“I wanted to remain true to the identity of Hamilton and the identity of the teams while incorporating a style of art that is intrinsically Indigenous and very specific to our culture,” Joedicke told the Tiger-Cats’ website. “The most important part of this is visibility. It shows that Indigenous people are a part of the sporting community in Hamilton, just as Indigenous people are a part of every community in Hamilton.”

Both logos will be printed on T-shirts and sold through the Tiger-Cats’ and Forge’s online store. The proceeds from the shirts will be donated to the Hamilton Regional Indian Centre.

“Truth and Reconciliation is vital for Canadians and it’s important for our organization to do its part to recognize the tragedies of the past and the impact that is still being felt by Indigenous communities today,” said Matt Afinec, president of business operations and chief operating officer of Hamilton Sports Group.

UPDATE (September 22, 2023): The Tiger-Cats released a video on their social media accounts on Thursday, September 21, in which Kyle Joedicke talks about the story and inspirations behind the logos.

Saturday, September 30, is the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation in Canada. The Tiger-Cats host the Calgary Stampeders that day and will incorporate various Indigenous elements into their gameday presentation at Tim Hortons Field. The team has invited 250 Indigenous youth and families to attend the game, including those from Six Nations, Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation and surrounding communities.

Players from both teams will wear orange-and-white pre-game jerseys “in a unified acknowledgement of the tragedies of residential schools and as an unequivocal show of support for survivors and their families.” Halftime will feature a drum circle and a performance from two-time world champion hoop dancer Lisa Odjig.

The Tiger-Cats are also welcoming back former defensive lineman John Macdonald as their Alumni of Distinction for the September 30 game. Macdonald is Mohawk, Wolf Clan from Six Nations of the Grand River Territory and played for the Tiger-Cats from 2002 to 2004. He now works as a teacher at Pauline Johnson Collegiate and Vocational School in Brantford, Ontario, and also coaches the football team there.
