The San Francisco 49ers (2-0) are considered favorites (-10.5) according to the bookmakers ahead of their game against the New York Giants (1-1) on September 21 starting at 8:15 PM ET, airing on Amazon Prime Video. 

The 49ers are looking to continue their showing as the cream of the crop in the NFC, if not the NFL. While the Giants are hoping to shore up their defense after allowing 68 points in their first two games. 

Here's everything you need from a betting perspective on the game between the Giants and 49ers from the point spread, moneyline, total over/under and an expert pick from Jason McIntyre.

Georgia head coach Kirby Smart's father dies after New Orleans fall
Kirby Smart’s father, Sonny, died Saturday of complications from hip surgery after falling in New Orleans ahead of the Sugar Bowl.

The Giants are down two starting offensive linemen, and they feature RT Evan Neal who grades out at 70th among 71 tackles per Pro Football Focus. New York should be overwhelmed at the line of scrimmage. 

That’s what happened in the opener against the Cowboys, and the Giants were held to 2.6 ypp and shutout. 

Now that you remove Saquon Barkley, it gets terrifying. 

Maybe there’s a Brock Purdy mistake or two, or perhaps the Giants get some special teams luck, but if that doesn’t happen, I don’t see how the Giants score enough to cover the spread. 

With Purdy at the helm, the 49ers offense has topped 30 in seven of the last eight regular season games. And San Francisco is 7-0 straight up and against the spread in its last seven home games.

Look for the 49ers to cruise in this spot. 

PICK: 49ers (-10) to win by more than 10 points
PICK: Giants team total under 16.5
