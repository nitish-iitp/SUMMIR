Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard was spotted standing on the sideline at Folsom Field to support Deion Sanders and the Colorado Buffaloes in their highly-anticipated game against the Colorado State Rams.

Leonard, 32, is rarely seen out in public, so his presence is evidence of the incredible program Sanders has built in just a few months. Buffaloes are looking to move to a perfect 3-0 record on Saturday night after picking up solid victories the past two weeks.

Leonard is often seen wearing sunglasses when he does step outside his home, but wearing them at night at the stadium could be in solidarity with Coach Prime.

The NBA star was not the only celebrity in attendance. The "Deion effect" also brought out rapper Offset and many more famous names.
