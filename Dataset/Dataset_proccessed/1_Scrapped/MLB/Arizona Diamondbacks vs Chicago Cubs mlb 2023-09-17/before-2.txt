Nick is a 30-year Rockies fan and 40-year Mets fan, so is an old, sad individual. He is a former golf professional and current software engineer. As a long time lover of data and statistics, he enjoys exploring the intersection of baseball and analytics. He also loves writing about the Rockies' history, players, games, the stadium, and more. In his free time, he enjoys watching and attending sporting events with his family, hanging out with his dog, and drinking large amounts of good coffee.
