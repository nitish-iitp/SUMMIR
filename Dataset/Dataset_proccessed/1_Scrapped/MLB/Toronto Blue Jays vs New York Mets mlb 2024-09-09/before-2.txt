Mets Offense Struggled

The Mets offense really struggled on Sunday scoring only one run and that led to the defeat. Luis Severino went 6.2 innings, giving up five hits and one run. The Mets are averaging 4.78 runs while their pitching is giving up 4.36 runs per game. The offense is ranked 7th in the league, while the pitching is ranked 16th. They have a positive run differential of 0.42 which is 12th in the league. Pete Alonso has hit 31 home runs and driven in 79 RBIs so far this season. Getting the start for the Mets will be Paul Blackburn, who sits with a 5-4 record and an ERA of 4.66. In his last start against the San Diego Padres, he went 2.1 innings giving up ten hits and five runs. The Mets will take on the Phillies after this series.

Blue Jays Fell Short

The Blue Jays in the last game faced off against the Atlanta Braves and they ended up losing 4-3. Yariel Rodriguez went five innings giving up two hits and one run. The Blue Jays are averaging 4.25 runs, while their pitching is giving up 4.62 runs per game. The offense is ranked 17th in the league, while the pitching is ranked 22nd. Vladimir Guerrero has hit 28 home runs and driven in 98 RBIs during his season. 

Why the Blue Jays Will Beat the Mets
the Blue Jays have won four of their last five games as underdogs following a road loss.
The Mets have lost 14 of their last 16 road games against American League opponents following a loss.
The Mets have failed to cover the run line in 16 of their last 17 games as favorites against AL East opponents following a home loss.
The Blue Jays have covered the run line in each of their last four games as underdogs against National League opponents following a road loss.
New York Mets vs Toronto Blue Jays Prediction

The Mets will send Paul Blackburn to the mound, and that is bad news for their chances. In his last start, he gave up five runs and ten hits, and he’s going to be hit hard here. The Blue Jays might be only averaging 4.25 runs per game, but they are going to get the offense out to a fast start, and that will be the difference here. The Mets offense won’t have any answer. Back the Blue Jays on the money line to cash.
