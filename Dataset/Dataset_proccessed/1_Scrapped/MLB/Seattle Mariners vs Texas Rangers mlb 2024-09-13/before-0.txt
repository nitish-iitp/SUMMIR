Bucks Ownership Thread - Junior buys 10% 
Quote

Post#1 » by paulpressey25 » Thu Sep 12, 2024 4:03 pm

Let's have this separate thread for ownership discussions. We'll need it in the years ahead.

Current majority Bucks owners are Haslam, Edens, Dinan and Fascitelli. I believe those four own at least 98% in some unknown individual amounts.

Then you've got 1-2% owned by a bunch of local Milwaukee types. Their small shares were needed to help get the stadium built.

Now today we learn Junior is buying in 10% of the team. The question to ask is who from the big four above sold their shares to to him, and does that have any future impact? Would be great if our media could someone figure out who owns what percentages.

Junior story is here: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/12/junior-bridgeman-buying-stake-in-milwaukee-bucks-team-valued-at-4-billion.html

It would be nice to know the percentages. Same with the Brewers (we know Attanasio is majority owner but we don't know the percentage).

I believe Juniors name was mentioned when Kohl was selling. I don't think this is the start of him eventually taking control. He's 70. So is Haslam. But who he bought from would be good to know. May some of the smaller one's sold, like Rodgers.

I just hope Edens doesn't sell anytime soon.
I'm against picketing but I don't know how to show it.

I had no idea that Bridgeman had become such an entrepreneurial investor post-playing career. He's loaded - estimated $600M net-worth, which makes him one of the wealthiest retired athletes (this will obviously be dwarfed in years ahead given current contract values).

I knew he was incredibly successful as a franchiser, but not that successful.

CNBC just did a piece on it. Nothing to add really, they just talked about the upcoming TV deal being a factor. They mentioned Haslam has made a paper profit of 25% in a year. And they called us a really good team and a contender.

The MJS piece just regurgitated the CNBC piece and claimed Edens, Dinan and Haslam all own 75%, but I just don't see that being accurate. Then how much does Fascitelli own? Heck, he's been in all the owner PR shots for the past two years. And the big question is who sold their 10% to get Junior in the group.

Junior and Marques are cool. Hopefully that means Marques sticks around until he's Hubie's age.

Interesting to see that Lasry is putting a group together to bid on the Vegas expansion franchise (which we all know will happen along with Seattle). I always thought he didn't like sharing power with Edens, it makes sense he wants to run the show.

There are all sorts of stories we'll never get the answer to. Somewhat stunned Lasry is buying back in.Then again, he knows he won't be facing $30 million dollar capital calls to pay payroll and luxury tax bills. If I had to guess, he'll talk his way into a group with LeBron.

Someone with a decent stake had to sell to get Junior his shares. Maybe some day we'll learn who. And in selling, did that person also sell more share to the other owners to possibly position to cash out.

The Milwaukee Bucks will make a "major ownership announcement" Thursday with Jimmy Haslam in attendance.

Junior Bridgeman, a former player turned business mogul, was previously rumored to be buying a stake in team.

Please don’t leave us with just Haslem. Edens needs to stay on.

Hopefully the 10% is coming from Haslam's piece.

I missed it. Did they say where the 10% came from?
Why should you go to jail for a crime someone else noticed? You don't need double talk... You need Bob Loblaw.
