Missed opportunities and faulty relief pitching and defense cost the Mariners in a 5-4 loss to Texas last night…

Seattle didn’t capitalize on early baserunners and then gave up a 4-1 lead late as the Rangers rallied for a run in the 7th and 3 in the 8th to win a crucial American League West matchup…

 

Seattle and Texas meet for the second of four this weekend tonight at 7:10 on ROOT Sports Northwest.

Houston was also a winner yesterday, downing the A’s 6-3 to increase its lead in the A-L West to 4-and-a-half games over Seattle.

Colorado beat Detroit yesterday 4-2 and the Yankees clipped the Red Sox in 10-innings 2-1, so the Wild Card standings still have the Tigers 3-and-a-half back while the Mariners and Boston are 4-and-a-half back of Minnesota.
