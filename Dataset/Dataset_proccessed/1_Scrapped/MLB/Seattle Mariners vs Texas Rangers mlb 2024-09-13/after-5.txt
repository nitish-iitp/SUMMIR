After last night’s deflating 5-4 loss to open this four-game set against the Rangers, the M’s will look to get back on track tonight, though they’ll have to do it without Luis Castillo.

Lineups:

For the fourth straight game, the M’s are running out the same lineup. I wonder when the last time that’s happened was? Emerson Hancock will take the ball in La Piedra’s stead, making his tenth start of the season in a perfectly cromulent sixth starter role. He did go 6.2 innings in his last start in Tacoma on the 6th, so Dan Wilson is likely hoping he can make it through at least five frames tonight, six if we’re feeling lucky. To make room for Hancock on the active roster, Seby Zavala was designated for assignment.

As for the Rangers, Jacob deGrom will be making his long-awaited season debut. The transcendent righty put up a 1.54 FIP over six starts last year - a good reminder that while the injuries have piled up for him over the last few seasons, he is still as good as it gets on the mound when he’s healthy and available. The Mariners will undoubtedly have their work cut out for them tonight.

Game Info:

Tonight’s first pitch is at 7:10pm PDT, and can be consumed on all the usual platforms: Aaron Goldsmith and Angie Mentink will call the game on ROOT Sports NW, while Rick Rizzs and Dave Sims will broadcast the action on 710 AM Seattle Sports. For out-of-market viewers, the game will also be broadcast on MLB Network.
