MLB’s top 20 breakout players in 2023
By Jim Bowden
Sep 22, 2023

172

Every spring, I predict the players who I think are primed for breakout seasons, and every year I have my share of hits and misses. This year, I hit on Luis Robert Jr., who was No. 1 on my list, and George Kirby, who was my second-ranked breakout pitcher, but I missed on others who now deserve credit after impressive gains this season. (When I compile my list, my definition for a breakout candidate is simply a player I expect to perform at a dramatically higher level than their major-league track record, or to burst onto the scene and blow away the rookie field.) Here are 20 standouts who turned their potential into production in 2023 and made the biggest jumps among major-league players.

(Players are ordered by their FanGraphs WAR as of Sept. 21.)

1. Luis Robert Jr., CF, Chicago White Sox

WAR: 4.9

History tells us the average major-league player begins his prime years at age 25, and that’s what happened with Luis Robert Jr., who has established new career-highs in doubles, home runs, RBIs and stolen bases. His doubles have doubled, from 18 last year to 36 this year, and his home runs have nearly tripled, from 13 to 37. He’s also improved his Defensive Runs Saved from negative-4 last year to plus-5 this year.

2. Justin Steele, LHP, Chicago Cubs

WAR: 4.8

In March, how many of you had Justin Steele finishing top 3 in the National League Cy Young Award voting this year? Well, it appears that’s about to happen as he’s battling Padres lefty Blake Snell and Braves righty Spencer Strider for the award. Steele is 16-5 with a 3.00 ERA. His walks per nine innings have improved from 3.8 last year to 1.9 this year, and he’s allowed only 0.7 home runs per nine, the lowest rate in the league. His increased slider usage and command at the bottom of the zone have been key to his success.

3. Nico Hoerner, 2B, Chicago Cubs 

WAR: 4.5

Nico Hoerner took advantage of MLB’s new rules this season to nab a career-high 41 stolen bases, more than doubling his total from 2022. He has a .349 on-base percentage and 170 hits, up from .327 and 135, respectively, last year.

4. Zach Eflin, RHP, Tampa Bay Rays

WAR: 4.4

The Rays surprised the baseball world last offseason when they outbid the Boston Red Sox for Zach Eflin, landing him with a three-year, $40 million deal. He rewarded them with a breakout season, going 15-8 with a 3.44 ERA over 30 starts. He has reached career highs in wins, innings pitched (172 2/3), walk rate (3.5 BB%) and strikeouts (172) while leading the American League in WHIP (1.104) and posting his best ERA mark. His increased cutter and curveball have been difference-makers.

5. Ha-Seong Kim, 2B, San Diego Padres

WAR: 4.4

Would you have believed me in spring training if I’d told you Ha-Seong Kim would have a higher fWAR than Manny Machado and Xander Bogaerts this year? Well, he does. Kim had a solid 2022 season, but this year he’s increased his on-base percentage by about 30 points (to .356), hit a career-high 17 home runs, and swiped 36 bags, up from 12 a year ago. He’s also played elite defense at second base.

6. Isaac Paredes, 3B, Tampa Bay Rays

WAR: 4.2

Isaac Paredes has been a difference-maker for the Rays, setting new career highs in doubles, home runs, RBIs, runs scored, walks and OPS. Year over year, he increased his doubles from 16 to 23, home runs from 20 to 29, RBIs from 45 to 92 and runs scored from 48 to 66. He also boosted his OPS from .739 to .845.

7. Yandy Díaz, 1B, Tampa Bay Rays

WAR: 4.1

In Yandy Díaz’s first six years in the major leagues, he topped 10 homers twice: in 2019, when he hit 14, and in 2021, when he clubbed 13. But this year he’s blown past those numbers, setting career-highs with 20 home runs and 75 RBIs. He also has his best slash line, an impressive .324/.405/.508, and made his first All-Star team.

8. Chas McCormick, OF, Houston Astros

WAR: 3.9

Here’s the one I never saw coming. Last year, Chas McCormick slashed .245/.332/.407 with 12 doubles, 14 home runs, 44 RBIs and four stolen bases. This year, he’s batted .281/.361/.495 with 20 home runs, 65 RBIs and 19 steals. He also has a career-high 133 OPS+. Impressive.

9. George Kirby, RHP, Seattle Mariners

WAR: 3.9

This one I did see coming. George Kirby has some of the best command in baseball, and he leads the league in walk rate and strikeout-to-walk ratio. Kirby, 25, has logged 11 wins and a 3.58 ERA in 178 2/3 innings (29 starts).

10. Bryson Stott, 2B, Philadelphia Phillies

WAR: 3.9

Bryson Stott made the transition from shortstop to second base look easy after the Phillies signed Trea Turner last offseason. He also improved across the board offensively, raising his slash line from .234/.295/.358 last year to .282/.331/.424 this year, his doubles from 19 to 31, and his home runs from 10 to 15. He’s stolen 29 bases in 31 attempts, after swiping 12 bags a year ago.

11. Kyle Bradish, RHP, Baltimore Orioles 

WAR: 3.5

We all knew the Orioles had the offense to be a playoff team, but we didn’t know if they had the starting pitching. Kyle Bradish has answered that question, going 11-7 and ranking in the top six in baseball in ERA and WHIP. His year-over-year improvement in key metrics was impressive, as his ERA (4.90 to 3.01), wins (four to 11) and WHIP (1.402 to 1.071) have all gotten significantly better.

12. TJ Friedl, OF, Cincinnati Reds

WAR: 3.4

Coming into this year, TJ Friedl had never played more than 72 games in a season, nor had more than 258 plate appearances. But Friedl, who turned 28 in August, has figured it out this season and earned more playing time, as he’s slashing .272/.339/.440 in 524 plate appearances with 20 doubles, eight triples, 14 home runs, 57 RBIs, 65 runs scored and 24 stolen bases. No one had that on their 2023 bingo card.

13. Mitch Keller, RHP, Pittsburgh Pirates 

WAR: 3.2

Well, we all saw this coming — we just didn’t know it would be in 2023. Mitch Keller, a second-round pick in the 2014 MLB Draft, took nine years to develop before truly arriving this season (he debuted in 2019). He’s gone 13-9 with a 4.25 ERA and 204 strikeouts in 188 1/3 innings. He also made his first All-Star team. Better late than never!

14. Jesús Luzardo, LHP, Miami Marlins

WAR: 3.2

Here’s another example of a player reaching his prime years and putting it all together. Jesús Luzardo turned 25 last September and this year has delivered 10 wins, a 3.68 ERA, and 194 strikeouts in 166 1/3 innings over 30 starts. It is the first time in his five-year major-league career that he’s had more than 18 starts and 100 1/3 innings pitched. He’s here to stay now.

15. Patrick Bailey, C, San Francisco Giants 

WAR: 2.9

Patrick Bailey made his major-league debut on May 19 and quickly became one of the best defensive catchers in the sport, as he’s ranked by Statcast metrics in the 100th percentile in framing, the 95th percentile in caught stealing above average, and the 94th percentile in pop time. Bailey, 24, has a .319 average and an .894 OPS against left-handed pitchers.

16. Josh Lowe, OF, Tampa Bay Rays

WAR: 2.9

Last year, in his rookie season, Josh Lowe slashed .221/.284/.343 with 12 doubles and two home runs in 198 plate appearances. This year, the 25-year-old still has a shot at joining the 20 steals, 20 homers club in the final week. He’s slashed .281/.326/.481 with 29 doubles, 18 home runs, 75 RBIs, and 31 stolen bases in 34 attempts.

17. Lane Thomas, OF, Washington Nationals

WAR: 2.8

The St. Louis Cardinals are well-known for developing outfielders for other teams, such as Adolis García for the Texas Rangers and Randy Arozarena for the Rays, and it looks like they’ve done it again with Lane Thomas. Traded by St. Louis to the Washington Nationals for Jon Lester at the deadline in 2021, Thomas has put together a strong season, slashing .271/.320/.471 with 34 doubles, 26 home runs, 84 RBIs, and 19 stolen bases in 23 attempts. Year over year, he increased his doubles from 26 to 34, his home runs from 17 to 25, and his stolen bases from eight to 19.

18. Jack Suwinski, CF, Pittsburgh Pirates 

WAR: 2.3

Jack Suwinski won the Pirates’ center-field job this season and has delivered significant year-over-year gains in on-base percentage (from .298 to .338), doubles (11 to 20), home runs (19 to 25) and stolen bases (four to 13). He ranks in the 81st percentile in sprint speed and in the 80th percentile in outs above average. Most impressively, his Barrel% and Chase% are both in the 97th percentile, a positive sign for his future.

19. Kerry Carpenter, OF, Detroit Tigers

WAR: 2.3

Kerry Carpenter made his major-league debut last year as he hit .252 with four doubles, six home runs and 10 RBIs in 103 at-bats with Detroit. This year, he’s made his mark, in the clubhouse and on the field, slashing .292/.351/.501 with 20 home runs and 63 RBIs.

20. Dane Dunning, RHP, Texas Rangers 

WAR: 1.7

In 2021, Dane Dunning went 5-10 with a 4.51 ERA. In 2022, he went 4-8 with a 4.46 ERA. This year it all changed and he had his breakout, working as both a starter (23 starts) and a reliever (nine appearances). Overall, he’s gone 10-6 with a 3.78 ERA in 157 innings and he’s recorded a career-best walk rate.
