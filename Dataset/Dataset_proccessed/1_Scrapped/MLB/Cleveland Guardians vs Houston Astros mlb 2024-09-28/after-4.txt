CLEVELAND, Ohio – Ben Lively will make his 29th start of the season on Saturday night when the Guardians face Houston in the middle game of the final three-game series of the regular season.

After Saturday’s start it’s unclear what role Lively will take in the Guardians’ postseason. They earned a bye in the first round by capturing one of the top two seeds in the AL. They will host the ALDS on Oct. 5 and will need three starters, or two and a bullpen game, to get through the best-of-five series.
