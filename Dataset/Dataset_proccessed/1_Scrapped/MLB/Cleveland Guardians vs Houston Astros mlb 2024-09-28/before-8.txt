The ball that soared into the left-field stands at loanDepot Park in Miami to make Shohei Ohtani the sole member of MLB's 50-50 club is going up for auction this week.

Goldin, an auction house based in New Jersey, will open bidding on the historic piece of baseball memorabilia on Friday. The opening bid is $500,000. Potential buyers will have the opportunity to purchase the ball for $4.5 million through Oct. 9, one week before the auction is scheduled to end.

Should bidding reach $3 million before Oct. 9, the $4.5 million buy-it-now option will disappear.

The fan who ended up with the ball contacted Goldin the day after Ohtani's record night to set up the deal, Goldin CEO Ken Goldin told ESPN. According to Fox Sports 640's Andy Slater, the Dodgers offered the fan $300,000 but were turned down.

“It’s never easy to predict the price at auction of a piece without any comps to consider, but that’s also what makes it the ideal auction piece,” Chris Ivy, director of sports collectibles at Heritage Auctions, told Yahoo Sports' Jeff Eisenberg earlier this month before Ohtani's historic blast.

The Los Angeles Dodgers star hit his 49th, 50th and 51st homers and stole his 50th and 51st bases in a single game against the Miami Marlins on Sept. 19, bursting into history with a 6-for-6 game with three homers, two doubles, two steals, four runs scored and 10 RBI in a 20-4 Dodgers win that clinched Ohtani's first trip to the MLB playoffs.

Ohtani has not stopped since. With five games to play in the regular season, he is up to 53 homers and 55 stolen bases.

Should the historic ball sell for more than $1 million, it would join a unique list of pricey home run balls. Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball hit in 1998 sold for $3.05 million a year later. Aaron Judge's 62nd home run ball hit in 2022 sold through Goldin last year for $1.5 million. A home run ball off Babe Ruth's bat during the first MLB All-Star Game in 1933 sold for $805,000 in 2006.
