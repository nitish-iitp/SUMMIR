Fans lined up outside the Dodger Stadium gates nearly 12 hours ahead of first pitch for the Los Angeles Dodgers’ game against the Baltimore Orioles, and they were rewarded with a 6-4 victory.

However, the fans weren’t just there to watch baseball as it was Shohei Ohtani and Decoy bobblehead night, which was possibly the most sought after stadium giveaway ever. The fans who attended were also given an extra treat with an adorable first pitch from Decoy himself.

Things also started out even better as Ohtani homered in his first at-bat to start the Dodgers off with a 1-0 lead. It presented another storybook moment that has become more of a fifth sequel with how often Ohtani scripts those highlights.

However, the Orioles answered with a three-run second inning, thanks in part to a pair of mistakes from the Dodgers defense that put Walker Buehler in a tough spot.

Max Muncy made a throwing error and Will Smith didn’t throw to first on a wild pitch third strike, which set up Ramon Urías for a two-run double. Another run came around to score on a single from James McCann.

Buehler allowed another run in the fifth inning on a double following a walk, but overall it was an encouraging outing for the right-hander. He finished his outing with 4.2 innings thrown, allowing four runs (two earned) on give hits with four strikeouts to one walk.

If not for the errors, he would have been in position to complete five innings with just one run allowed.

Despite the Orioles offense having a quality game, the Dodgers offense was even better, which included a four-run third inning that gave them the lead.

Kiké Hernández and Shohei Ohtani singled before Mookie Betts drove in a run with an RBI single that cut the Orioles’ lead to 3-2.

Teoscar Hernández then unloaded on a pitch for his 28th homer of the season to put the Dodgers up 5-3. It was another clutch and electric moment for Hernández, who has set himself up for a significant contract after the season.

The Dodgers also added another run in the fifth inning when Ohtani reached on a fielder’s choice, stole a base, advanced on an error, and then scored on an error.

The Dodgers bullpen had a great day following Buehler with Anthony Banda pitching 1.1 innings while escaping a jam, followed by Ryan Brasier and Alex Vesia combining to pitch a scoreless frame.

Evan Phillips worked the eighth with a perfect inning, and Michael Kopech recorded the save in the ninth with two strikeouts.

Shohei Ohtani joins MLB history

Aside from all the hype over Decoy and his bobblehead night, Ohtani also went on to homer and steal two bases. His home run was his 42nd of the season, and his stolen bases gave him 42 total as well.

That made Ohtani the second player in MLB history to reach the 42-42 mark in a single season. Alex Rodriguez had the first 42-42 season in 1998 when he hit 42 home runs and stole 46 bases for the Seattle Mariners.

No player has ever reached 43 home runs and 43 stolen bases in a single season, and Ohtani is now one away from both.

Ronald Acuña holds the record for most stolen bases during a 40-40 season with 73 last season, and Alfonso Soriano holds the record for most home runs during a 40-40 campaign with 46 in the 2006 season.

Ohtani is on pace to reach 51 home runs and 51 stolen bases, which would make him the only 50-50 player in MLB history.
