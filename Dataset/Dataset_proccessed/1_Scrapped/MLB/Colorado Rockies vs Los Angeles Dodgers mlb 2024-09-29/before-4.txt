We did it. We made it to the final week of the 2024 MLB regular season. The Colorado Rockies need to win their final two games to avoid a second-consecutive 100-loss season. Best case, they finish 63-99; worst case, they finish 61-101. So regardless, they will finish with fewer losses than 2023.

Also ending this weekend is Charlie Blackmon’s illustrious 14-year career with the Colorado Rockies. Purple Row, the Rockies and MLB will continue to celebrate Blackmon through the weekend. Stay tuned!

But throughout the week, here’s what we were up to:
