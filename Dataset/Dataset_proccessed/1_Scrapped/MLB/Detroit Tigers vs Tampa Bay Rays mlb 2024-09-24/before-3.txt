Tampa Bay Rays vs Detroit Tigers Prediction

I’ll try the Tigers here. You could make a case either way, though; we should have a fun starter matchup in-store. Skubal is 1-0 in his last three starts, giving up four earned runs over a combined 16.2 innings. As for Pepiot, he’s 1-0 in his last trio as well with four earned in 13.1 total frames.

Detroit has been scoring pretty well lately also. They’ve notched three or more runs in six of their last seven games. If the Tigers can hit that threshold again on Tuesday, they should be in good shape behind Skubal.
