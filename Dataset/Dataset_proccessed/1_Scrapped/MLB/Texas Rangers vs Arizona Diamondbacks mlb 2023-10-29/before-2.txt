Kourtney Kardashian recently recreated her sister's 2013 Met Gala look when she was still together with Kanye West and expecting North West, now 10.

Kourtney who is now pregnant with Travis Baker's baby, recreated the floral ensemble to the letter, wearing the same or one similar to the iconic Givenchy attire followed by the identical makeup and hairstyle, topping it with the emblematic red lips.

Kourtney Kardashian wore the same dress Kim wore in 2013 Met Gala

Pregnant Kourtney posted the picture on Instagram quoting it "Freaky Friday" paying homage to the classic body-swap film, and fans liked it.

Contrary to what happened with Kim when she walked through the famous Met Gala stairs back in 2013, people loved Kourtney's attire, back when Kim wore it, she was highly criticized from 'looking like a floral stamp sofa' and was even compared to Robin William's legendary Mrs. Doubtfire.

"This met gala look is my favorite of all time," added a fan on Instagram, while another claimed "loooove this."

Immediately after it became popular, fans started speculating about how Kourtney 'stole' her sisters' looks, fueling the feud that was discussed in the Kardashians reality show when they spoke about how Kourtney copied Kim's wedding ideas and recreated them to the letter.

"I got married in Italy. Am I saying you copied me by getting married in Italy?" Kim said "Who performed at my wedding? Andrea Bocelli. Who performed at Kourtney's wedding? Andrea Bocelli."

She elaborated, "You stole my f-king wedding country and my wedding performer. Andrea Bocelli is my favorite male singer of all time, but I'm copying her Dolce Vita lifestyle.? Okay."

"She stole my f-king met gala dress," one user said, reminiscing about the confessionary comment during the show.

However, all was in good fun, as Kim even posted Kourney's picture in her IG story adding three clapping emojis to the publication.
