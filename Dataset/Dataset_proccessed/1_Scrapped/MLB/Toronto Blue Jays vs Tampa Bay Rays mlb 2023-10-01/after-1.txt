As he says these words, George Springer scans a mostly empty Blue Jays clubhouse less than 24 hours before his team would clinch a playoff berth.

He is neither boastful nor speaking with an inflated sense of self-worth.

Instead, he’s talking about a leader’s act shared with us by a couple of teammates that happened in the aftermath of a late-season four-game sweep at the hands of the Texas Rangers. It was a deflating moment that had this generally upbeat group feeling defeated for the first time this season.

“We were pretty down, pretty much in the dumps because that was a huge series in the middle of a playoff race,” Jays closer Jordan Romano said. “But George came around to every single guy in the locker-room and said: ‘Don’t give up, we’ve still got this.’ It was pretty cool hearing from that guy, a World Series MVP, addressing you personally — every one of us — and encouraging us to keep this going.

“I feel like that was a deciding thing. Like we could have rolled over or we can keep fighting. We chose to keep fighting. That’s the kinds of little things he does. That’s George.”

Springer is much more than a cheerleader, of course. That six-year, $150-million US deal he signed in 2021, the richest contract in franchise history, was to lead this team not just to the post-season, but deep into the proceedings.

With appropriate reverence to the original Mr. October, Yankees great Reggie Jackson, the expectation was always for Springer to fulfill that role here.

Springer’s performance with the Houston Astros earned him World Series MVP in 2017 after he banged out five home runs in a seven-game set against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He set the tone as leadoff man in a dynamic Astros lineup and was a proven performer when the stakes were highest.

All of that big-game pedigree and those leadership credentials made the veteran’s words resonate with a Jays team harbouring high hopes of embarking on a Springer-like deep October run.

“I’ve been there before,” Springer said in an interview. “I’ve been on teams that the exact same thing has happened to and the overall message was just: Don’t quit. It’s really easy to listen to stuff that’s outside and think the season is over when, in fact, we were actually in a really good spot.

“That’s part of why I’m here, to help these guys through anything. Whether that’s doing something like (the post-Rangers rally talks) to getting hit by a pitch, diving into a wall. Whatever it is. That’s my job.”

Cavan Biggio has seen the Mr. October version of Springer up close and personal.

A lifelong Houston resident, where his Hall of Fame father Craig is an Astros legend, Biggio returned home in late-summer 2017 after a season with the single-A Dunedin Blue Jays. And Biggio had a front-row seat to the Springer show about to unfold.

“I’ve known George for a long time, dating back to when he debuted, but that World Series, obviously, was an unbelievable performance by him,” Biggio said.

“I feel like that’s just who he is. Big spotlight. Big moment, he’s able to shut everything out and go play.

“He’s ready. In moments like that, he plays with an edge. He almost plays with a little bit of anger and that’s the best George Springer you’re going to get.”

When Springer came to the Jays, Biggio saw what he meant to his new franchise, one with a clubhouse populated with players still on the climb to playoff calibre and ultimately toward contender status.

“I’ve seen that pretty much every September I’ve played with him,” Biggio said. “His will to win at that time of year is more than whoever he’s competing against. Whether he’s playing outfield or whether he’s hitting, he’s always locked in and ready to make a play.

“It’s just who he is. It takes a very special player to do that, a special mindset. He’s someone who can take over a game and win it for you and he seems like he does that a lot in September and October.”

Chad Green has seen the Mr. October version of Springer as well, but from an opposing dugout.

The Jays reliever was part of the New York Yankees bullpen that faced the Astros in the ALCS in both 2017 and 2019.

“The first thing that comes to mind was how good their lineup was, but he was the tone setter,” Green said. “He hit leadoff and you knew if you got him out that things were going to be a lot easier.”

Springer’s opponents and teammates alike marvel at his ability to get baseball Zen as the post-season nears and the pressure and distractions escalate.

“I think it’s his ability to slow the game down in those situations — not that we all can’t do it — but the more you are in that situation, the easier it becomes,” Green said. “I think that’s what makes him special, that ability to not let the game get too fast at times. He just becomes a really tough out in those situations.”

Springer himself scoffs at statistics and one supposes that, at this point of his career, he doesn’t need to worry about the minutiae of numbers. He is the prototypical leadoff man, a hitter who can turn a home stadium into a post-season frenzy with one swing of the bat.

“I think he’s just locked in at the right time,” Green. “When he’s having good at-bats, it just sets the tone for the rest of the lineup.

“He’s super-talented and a really good hitter. There’s not many people who when they get hot can carry a team, but he’s one of them.”

Bo Bichette is a dude who wants to be Mr. October, just like his more accomplished teammate. And in his own way, the Jays shortstop possesses the same chill gene as the veteran outfielder.

Bichette has taken note of Springer’s comportment throughout the marathon grind that is the longest in professional sport.

“I think he cares about his teammates a lot and he shows it,” Bichette said.

“He plays hard every day, so that when the lights come on he doesn’t have to kick it into an extra gear or anything.

“Obviously, at this point he has the experience. I think he’s able to slow it down because he plays that way all the time. That’s the way I try to approach it as well. There should be an urgency every day.”

Mark Budzinski coaches Blue Jays outfielders and has seen first-hand the energy of Springer. He, too, is excited about seeing the Mr. October flourish in his right-fielder, especially after one of the most durable seasons in his career.

The 153 games the 34-year-old played in 2023 are Springer’s most since 2016, when he appeared in all 162 for the Astros. It’s also 20 more than his previous high here last season.

But with Kevin Kiermaier taking over in centre, Springer has thrived in right field, the spot he has patrolled most in his career.

“Especially down the stretch here, he’s made some huge plays for us,” Budzinski said. “He’s a gamer. He loves this time of year. He’s stayed sharp and he’s playing great.”

Like the players, Budzinksi notices how the intangibles mix with talent to make Springer particularly dangerous in big games.

“He does so much,” Budzinski said. “He’s the leadoff hitter who can do damage. He can make a great play in the field. He can steel bases. He’s done it all and has been a World Series MVP. He knows what it takes to win this time of year and he does all the things well.”

Springer acknowledges that the more you play in October, the easier it is to slow the big moments down.

When he patrols right field on Tuesday as the Jays’ playoff odyssey beings in the wild card round, it will be Springer’s 66th career post-season game. That includes 14 over two trips to the World Series and 25 in four ALCS appearances.

It was that 2017 World Series where he truly forged his reputation, however, hitting .379 with five home runs, seven RBIs and eight runs scored. That display of power allowed Springer to join Lou Gehrig and the original Mr. October, Jackson, as the only players to bash long balls in four consecutive Fall Classic games.

Springer’s approach this time of year? Slow it all down and let the moment come to you.

“I just like having fun. You never know if you’re going to get back, so you might as well enjoy it. A lot of people like to put an emphasis on stats. I don’t. I think they are irrelevant. You do what you can in the moment and move on.

“It’s definitely something that I have learned. I just think the more experience, obviously I’ve had the benefit of that, understanding the magnitude of a situation. At the end of the day, it’s the same game you are playing in October as it was in May or June.”
