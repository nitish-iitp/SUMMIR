Becomes free agent
The Pirates released Tellez on Wednesday.
Impact Tellez is now a free agent after previously being jettisoned from the Pirates' 40-man roster. The 29-year-old has hit just .231/.295/.385 over the last two seasons and is a poor defender at first base, so he could be facing a limited market this winter.

DFA'd by Pittsburgh
The Pirates designated Tellez for assignment Tuesday.
Impact Tellez slashed .310/.347/.533 from the beginning of June through the end of August, but he's hit only .116/.255/.209 in September and had been seeing his playing time dwindle. The Pirates have elected to move on from the veteran now and give his at-bats to others. Billy Cook is at first base for the Pirates on Tuesday and should share that spot with Connor Joe and Jared Triolo in the final week.

Out again versus righty
Tellez is not in the lineup for Tuesday's contest against the Brewers.
Impact This is the fifth time over the Pirates' last 10 games versus righties that Tellez has been out of the lineup, as the club is getting a look at some younger players down the stretch. Billy Cook will handle first base Tuesday.

Idle against RHP
Tellez is out of the lineup for Saturday's game against the Reds.
Impact The lefty-hitting Tellez will be on the bench for the fifth time in the last 10 games despite Pittsburgh facing a right-hander in Rhett Lowder. Tellez is 2-for-25 (.080) in his last nine games.

Getting Wednesday off
Tellez isn't in the Pirates' lineup for Wednesday's game against the Cardinals.
Impact Tellez has gone 0-for-18 with five walks and five strikeouts over his last seven games, and he'll get a chance to recollect himself while he sits down Wednesday. Jared Triolo will fill in as Pittsburgh's first baseman while Nick Yorke starts at third.

Held out of lineup vs. righty
Tellez is out of the lineup for Monday's game against the Cardinals.
Impact Tellez is typically absent from the lineup against left-handed starting pitchers, but he'll take a seat Monday for the second time in the Pirates' past three matchups with righties. Connor Joe will step in at first base in place of Tellez, who may be starting to lose some job security after producing a .485 OPS thus far in September.

Goes deep Saturday
Tellez went 1-for-5 with a two-run home run and two walks across both games of Saturday's doubleheader against the Nationals.
Impact Tellez didn't start in the first game of the twin bill, but he came up as a pinch hitter in the seventh inning and drilled a 443-foot, two-run blast to right field. The first baseman added a walk later in that contest, then went 0-for-4 with another walk in the nightcap. Even with the Game 1 homer Saturday, Tellez has had a rough start to September, going 3-for-18 with seven strikeouts over his first seven games.

Tellez isn't in the Pirates' lineup for Game 1 of Saturday's doubleheader against Washington.

Makes early exit Wednesday
Tellez was removed ahead of the eighth inning of Wednesday's 14-10 loss to the Cubs with an apparent injury, Danny Demilio of PittsburghBaseballNow.com reports. He went 3-for-5 wit...
Impact Tellez may have hurt himself at some point in the bottom of the seventh, when he reached base after legging out an infield single. He stayed in the game to run the bases, only to remain in the dugout when the Pirates came out to play defense in the top of the eighth. The Pirates should provide an update on Tellez's status later Wednesday or following Thursday's off day.

Goes deep in loss
Tellez went 1-for-4 with a two-run homer in Saturday's 10-2 loss against the Reds.
Impact Tellez took Julian Aguiar deep in the second inning for his 11th home run of the season. Tellez got off to a rough start this campaign, but since June he's been hitting .302/.343/.529 with 10 home runs and 36 RBI over 62 games. The 29-year-old is a mainstay in the middle of the Brewers order and will continue to play on the strong side of the platoon at first base.
