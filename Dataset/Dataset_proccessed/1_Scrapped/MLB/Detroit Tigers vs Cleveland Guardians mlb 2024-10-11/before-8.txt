The Cleveland Guardians have new life again in the ALDS, all thanks to utilityman David Fry.

Fry delivered with the biggest hit of the year for Cleveland as his team trailed the Detroit Tigers 3-2 in the seventh inning of Thursday’s Game 4. With the Tigers on the brink of closing out the series, Fry stepped up as a pinch-hitter and promptly clubbed a go-ahead two-run home run off Beau Brieske to give the Guardians a 4-3 lead.

Maybe even better than the dramatic, season-saving homer by Fry was the local radio broadcast of the at-bat. Longtime Cleveland radio play-by-play announcer Tom Hamilton had an incredible call of Fry’s clutch dinger, which circulated on social media. Take a listen.

Hamilton, 70, had been the radio broadcaster for the team since 1990. Thus, he has seen a lot over the years with Cleveland, including heartbreaking World Series losses in 1995, 1997, and 2016.

As for Fry, he was in the minor leagues just last season before getting called up by Cleveland and then hit .266 with 14 homers and 51 RBIs in 122 games during the 2024 regular season. No homer was bigger than the one that Fry hit on Thursday though, and it resulted in the best moment from Hamilton since his call of the Jose Ramirez-Tim Anderson fight.
