Seth Brown hit a tying homer earlier in the game and later ended it with a one-out single in the bottom of the ninth inning to give the Oakland Athletics a 3-2 victory over the visiting Seattle Mariners on Tuesday night.

Brown went 3-for-4 and Lawrence Butler also homered for Oakland, which scored a walk-off win against the Mariners for the second straight night. The Athletics won 5-4 on Monday night.

Cal Raleigh drilled a two-run double for the Mariners, who lost their fourth game in a row. Seattle (69-70) is 6 1/2 games behind the Houston Astros in the American League West and 5 1/2 games out in the battle for the third wild-card berth.

Oakland (61-78) has won six of its past nine games.

More on Athletics vs. Mariners

JJ Bleday walked against Trent Thornton (3-3) with one out in the ninth and Shea Langeliers followed with a bouncing single through the left side of the infield to put runners on first and second.

Brown then engaged in a seven-pitch duel with Thornton, finally drilling a 2-2 fastball just to the right of Seattle second baseman Jorge Polanco and into center field as Bleday scored the winning run.

Oakland rookie J.T. Ginn was sharp in his second major league start and allowed two runs and five hits over six innings. He struck out seven and walked one.

Hogan Harris (3-3) replaced Ginn and tossed three no-hit innings of relief. He struck out three and walked two.

Seattle’s Luis Castillo allowed two runs and four hits over seven innings. He struck out five and walked one.

The Mariners had two runs on the scoreboard just three batters into the game before going silent.

J.P. Crawford led off the game with a single and Julio Rodriguez followed with a double. Raleigh then ripped a two-run double into right center to score both players.

Oakland got one run back when leadoff batter Butler capped a seven-pitch at-bat with a homer to center. It was his 21st blast of the season.

Castillo set down the next 11 Oakland batters until Brown came up with two outs in the fourth and smacked a homer to center. It was his 13th shot of the season.
