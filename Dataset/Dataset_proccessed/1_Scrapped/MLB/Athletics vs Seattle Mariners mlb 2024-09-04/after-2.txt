The Oakland Athletics recorded walk-off victories in the first two contests of a four-game series with Seattle, continuing the Mariners’ recent problems in close games.

The host Athletics will look to deliver another blow to Seattle’s playoff hopes on Wednesday night when the American League West rivals meet in the third game of the set.

Oakland’s last at-bat has been winning time in this series as it produced a 5-4 victory on Monday and a 3-2 win on Tuesday. Shea Langeliers hit a game-winning homer in the opener and Seth Brown was the hero Tuesday with an RBI single.

More on Athletics vs. Mariners

“To have another walk-off the way we did tonight was great,” Athletics manager Mark Kotsay said. “It’s always great to be on the winning side of it.”

The Mariners have lost four straight games. Seattle is 5-6 since manager Dan Wilson took over in the dugout and all six of the setbacks are by one run.

“Two walk-offs in a row is tough,” Wilson said afterward. “… It was a hard-fought game but it was tough to come up on the losing end of this one again.”

The untimely skid has seen the Mariners (69-70) fall 6 1/2 games behind the Houston Astros in the AL West with just 23 games to go.

In the wild-card race, Seattle stands 5 1/2 games behind the Kansas City Royals for the third wild-card berth. The Mariners also trail the Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox — both are 4 1/2 games behind Kansas City.

Right-hander Luis Castillo, who pitched seven strong innings on Tuesday, isn’t ready to concede either race.

“It’s never too late,” Castillo said through an interpreter. “If we got a chance and the playoffs are in our cards, we’ll get there. The thing we can do is just come in here and keep putting in the work.”

Cal Raleigh had a two-run double for the Seattle runs to raise his RBI count to 84, breaking the franchise single-season mark for a catcher set by Wilson (83 in 1996).

Oakland (61-78) has won six of its past nine games.

On Tuesday, Brown went 3-for-4 and belted his 13th homer of the season. Lawrence Butler hit his 21st of the campaign.

Brown was demoted for 3 1/2 weeks earlier this season when he was struggling. Since returning to the majors on July 11, he has raised his batting average from .189 to .242.

“Just being on a baseball field in itself is special,” Brown said. “When you get to do it on this stage with these guys it’s something to where you go to bed at night thinking about how lucky you are to do it.”

Seattle right-hander George Kirby (10-10, 3.63 ERA) will face Oakland left-hander JP Sears (11-9, 4.21) on Wednesday.

Kirby, 26, is 4-0 with a 4.12 ERA in seven career starts against the Athletics. He defeated Oakland on June 4 when he gave up two runs and six hits over five innings.

JJ Bleday (4-for-6), Zack Gelof (3-for-5) and Brent Rooker (3-for-9) each have homered against Kirby.

Kirby defeated the Los Angeles Angels on Friday despite giving up five runs and five hits — including three homers –over 5 2/3 innings.

Sears is 7-2 with a 3.06 ERA over his past 10 starts. He has allowed one run or fewer six times during the stretch.

Sears, 28, defeated the Texas Rangers on Friday when he gave up one run and five hits over seven innings.

Sears lost to the Mariners on June 6 when he gave up two runs and three hits over six innings. He is 2-2 with a 1.86 ERA in seven career starts (six appearances) against Seattle.

Julio Rodriguez is just 3-for-16 against Sears, while Mitch Haniger is 1-for-6 with a homer.
