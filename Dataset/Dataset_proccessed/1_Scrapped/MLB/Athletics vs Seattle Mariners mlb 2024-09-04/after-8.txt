The Mariners continue to find new ways to lose one-run games. They need to win tonight to avoid a series loss—or worse, the potential of a sweep at the hands of the A’s.

Lineups:

Well, that is certainly A Lineup.

News:

The A’s made a few roster moves prior to today’s game:

Today’s game information:

Game time: 6:40 PT

TV: ROOT Spots NW, with Aaron Goldsmith and Mike Blowers

Radio: 710 AM, with Dave Sims and Rick Rizzs

Today in Mariners history:
1981: The Mariners play the longest game in the history of Fenway Park, taking an 8-7 victory in the 20th inning of the game suspended the night before with the score tied at seven. The game was suspended due to the American League’s 1 a.m. curfew.
2015: The Mariners scored a season-high 6 runs in the 3rd inning, overcoming an early 5-1 deficit in an 11-8 win at Oakland. Jose Ramirez earned his first MLB win, throwing 1.2 innings of scoreless relief.
2021: Kyle Seager hits two 3-run home runs to power the Mariners to an 8-5 win over the Diamondbacks. J.P. Crawford records second career 4-hit game in the same game.
