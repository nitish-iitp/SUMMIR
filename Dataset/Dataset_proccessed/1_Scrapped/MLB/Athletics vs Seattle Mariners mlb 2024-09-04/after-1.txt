UPDATED: September 5, 2024 at 4:11 AM PDT

OAKLAND — Mitch Garver and Luis Urías both drove in four runs, George Kirby struck out nine in six innings and the Seattle Mariners beat the Oakland Athletics 16-3 on Wednesday night.

Seattle, which entered the day 5 1/2 games back of the last AL wild card spot, recorded a season high in runs and snapped a four-game losing streak to get back to .500 at 70-70. The Mariners scored seven times in the seventh inning to pull away, sending 12 batters to the plate. They added four more runs in the eighth.

Kirby (11-10) improved to 5-0 against the A’s in his career and had eight strikeouts through the first four innings.

Ahead by a run in the fourth, the Mariners recorded four straight two-out hits off A’s starter JP Sears (11-10) to extend the lead to 5-1. After Victor Robles reached on a double, Garver knocked in his third run of the game with a single. Urías and Dylan Moore each followed with RBI hits.

Urías led off the seventh with a solo homer, and then the next six Mariners reached base to blow the game open. Julio Rodríguez, Randy Arozarena and Victor Robles all knocked in runs to give Seattle a 12-2 lead. A’s reliever Janson Junk was charged with all seven runs and did not record an out as he allowed six hits and two walks. Oakland gave up a season-high 16 runs.

The A’s, in the midst of their second-to-last homestand at the Coliseum, drew an announced crowd of 4,390 on Wednesday.

Lawrence Butler set a franchise record when he recorded an extra-base hit for the ninth straight game with a leadoff double. Butler then scored the A’s first run on a single by Brent Rooker.
