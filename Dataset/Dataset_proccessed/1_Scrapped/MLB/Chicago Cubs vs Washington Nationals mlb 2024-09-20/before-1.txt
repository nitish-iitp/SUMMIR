Washington Nationals vs Chicago Cubs Prediction 

Chicago was able to bounce back from their series loss against Oakland with a nice win in game one of this series, but they are just about eliminated from postseason contention. The Cubs are 40-35 at home this year, while the Nationals are 32-46 on the road. Washington is starting Trevor Williams, who started the season pitching very well, but is just coming off of the 60-day IL. Chicago is going with Jameson Taillon, who has had an up-and-down season but has pitched well in three straight starts. I think we are going to see a solid pitching performance here and I like the under in this matchup.
