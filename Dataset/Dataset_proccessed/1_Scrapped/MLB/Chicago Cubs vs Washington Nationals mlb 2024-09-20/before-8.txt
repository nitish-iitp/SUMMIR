The Philadelphia Phillies are one win away from clinching a playoff spot for the third straight year.

The Phillies have been one of the top teams in Major League Baseball all season. Rob Thomson’s team was on a historic pace with a 62-34 record in the first half of the season. His team fell into about a month-long slump that slowed their pace, but that seems to be well in the rearview mirror.

The Phillies have the best record in the majors at 91-61, with 10 games left to play in the regular season. The first step is to clinch a playoff spot. Assuming a complete disaster doesn’t happen, the next step would be to win the National League East division.

The magic number for the Phillies to win the NL East is four wins. The last time the Phillies won their division was in 2011, with a 102-60 record.
That team lost in the NLDS in five games to the St. Louis Cardinals.

If the Phillies can hold on to the top record in baseball over the last two weeks of the season, they will head into the postseason as the No. 1 seed in the NL with a first-round bye. It’s also worth noting that if the Phillies make it to the World Series, they will have a home-field advantage, assuming an American League team doesn’t finish the season with the same record.

The Phillies have three series left before the postseason begins. A four-game NL East matchup against the New York Mets starts tonight at Citi Field. A three-game home series against the Chicago Cubs begins Sept. 23 before closing out the 2024 regular season in Washington against the Nationals in a three-game series.

The Phillies hope to head into the postseason healthy and on a high note.
This would be the organization’s third straight postseason appearance after falling short of a World Series championship the previous two years.
