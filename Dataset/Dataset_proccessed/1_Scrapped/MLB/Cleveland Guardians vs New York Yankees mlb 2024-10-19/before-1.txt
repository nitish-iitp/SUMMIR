MLB Playoffs 2024

Josh Naylor was out there paying tribute to Vladimir Guerrero Sr. during Friday’s game.

In the third inning of his team’s ALCS Game 4 showdown against the New York Yankees, the Cleveland Guardians slugger Naylor managed to get a pretty wacky RBI hit. With a runner on second and one out, Naylor reached way out of the zone to get to a 2-2 Luis Gil changeup. He was somehow able to not only get contact on the ball but poke it the opposite way to right field for an RBI single.

That was a good five or six baseball lengths off the plate, but it didn’t matter for Naylor. The 2024 All-Star had a career-high 108 RBIs during the regular season and got another one there to cut the Yankees lead to 3-2.

This series is a little bit personal for Naylor, who already got into it with the Yankees during a 2022 playoff matchup against them. The Yankees still lead the ALCS 2-1 though, so Cleveland will need a bit more than the occasional bloop hit from their top lefty power bat Naylor.
