Cleveland Guardians fans thought their team got another go-ahead home run late in Game 4 of their ALCS showdown against the New York Yankees. But instead, all they got Friday was heartbreak.

The Guardians trailed the Yankees 6-5 in the bottom of the 7th inning at Progressive Field in Cleveland, Ohio. Game 3 hero Jhonkensy Noel came up to bat with two men on and one out against Yankees reliever Mark Leiter Jr.

Noel gave Leiter’s 1-1 pitch a ride to deep left field. But it ultimately hooked far enough that it fell well short of a home run or even a double. Yankees left fielder Alex Verdugo caught it with some room to spare.

Guardians fans watching at home, however, thought that the ball was headed for the seats based on how the camera was angled on the TBS broadcast. The camera panned high enough to have spectators believe it was a home run before the ball fell into Verdugo’s glove.

One fan challenged the TBS cameraman to a duel, while another felt like he was owed some sort of compensation for the heartbreak he had experienced.

The Guardians did manage to tie the game an inning later. However, Cleveland’s All-Star closer Emmanuel Clase continued his nightmare postseason with two earned runs given up in the top of the 9th. The Guardians lost 8-6.
