Major League Baseball’s playoff series is underway.

The D-Backs Left Behind

The New York Mets and the Atlanta Braves split victories in a doubleheader secured them both spots in the 2024 MLB Playoffs.

The Mets won 8-7 over the Braves in game one of a doubleheader, while the Braves won 3-0 in game two.

The Arizona Diamondbacks needed the Mets to win game two to make the playoffs.

In game one, the Braves originally had leads of 3-0 and 7-6 in the final two innings. However, the Mets’ Francisco Lindor had a home run in the ninth to secure an 8-7 victory over the Braves.

In a turn of events, Atlanta came back in the second game, with Grant Holmes giving the Braves six strikeouts through three innings. Holmes got the start due to Chris Sale dealing with back spasms.

In the bottom of the second inning, Gio Urshela hit an RBI single off Mets’ Joey Lucchesi for a Braves 1-0 lead.
