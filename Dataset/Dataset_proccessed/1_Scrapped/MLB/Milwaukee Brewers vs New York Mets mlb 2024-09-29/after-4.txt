We’ll keep it simple: If the Mets win and Diamondbacks lose today, the Mets will clinch a playoff spot.

If both teams share the same result, the Mets will need to win at least one game of the doubleheader against the Braves on Monday to secure a playoff spot.

If the Mets lose and Diamondbacks win, the Mets will need to win both games of the doubleheader to continue playing.
