CINCINNATI – Few players who have played Major League Baseball have achieved more from their careers than the late Pete Rose.

For 24 seasons from 1963-86 with the Reds, Phillies and Expos, Rose was not only a great player but a transcendent one. His work ethic, gritty play and hustle made him a superstar, sought-after interview subject and product pitchman.

A 17-time All-Star – including 13 for his native Cincinnati – at five different positions, Rose is the Major Leagues’ all-time leader with 4,256 hits. He won three World Series trophies – two with the Reds (1975-76), and one more with the Phillies (1980).

Individually, Rose was the 1963 NL Rookie of the Year, the 1973 NL MVP, the 1975 World Series MVP and the winner of three batting titles. He was named a member of MLB’s All-Century team in 1999.

Because of a lifetime ban in 1989 for violating league rules on gambling while managing the Reds, Rose has remained ineligible for election to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Here are 10 of the best moments from Rose’s great career:

1. Baseball has a new “Hit King”

In the first inning vs. the Padres at Riverfront Stadium on Sept. 11, 1985, the 44-year-old Rose lifted a single to left-center field against pitcher Eric Show for career hit No. 4,192. It surpassed Ty Cobb’s 57-year-old record and made Rose the all-time leader in hits.

Play was stopped as a long-awaited celebration unfolded on the field. Rose was mobbed by his teammates and became emotional as he hugged his son, Pete Jr., who also wore a No. 14 Reds uniform. Among other things, Rose was gifted a bright red Corvette that emerged from behind the outfield fence.

“It was the first time ever on a baseball field, I didn’t know what to do,” Rose said after the game about the hoopla.

Rose went on to collect 4,256 hits over his storied career.

2. The collision at home plate

Riverfront Stadium was brand new on July 14, 1970, and hosted the All-Star Game when it was less than a month old. Its first signature moment came courtesy of Rose.

In the bottom of the 12th inning as Jim Hickman lined a single to center field in a 4-4 game, Rose streaked from second base and barreled into Cleveland catcher Ray Fosse at the plate to score the winning run for the National League.

While Fosse was prone on the field with a fractured and separated left shoulder, Rose was largely celebrated for his hustle during an exhibition game. Although, there were some that felt he went too far.

“That’s the only way I know how to play, I play to win, the way my father taught me to play,” Rose told reporters that night. “I play hurt, I play tired, I play as hard as hell. Don’t tell me it’s an exhibition or Spring Training. Don’t tell me to take it easy between the white lines. That’s not me, that’s not my dad.”

3. Rose extends hit streak to 44 games

Against Phil Niekro of the Braves at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium on July 31, 1978, Rose rolled a slow single through the right side in the sixth inning to extend his NL-record hitting streak to 44 games.

The streak would end the following night, but it remains the third-longest all-time behind Joe DiMaggio's 56 games and Willie Keeler’s 45 games. One oddity: Rose never hit a home run during his lengthy hit streak.

4. Rose-Harrelson brawl in NLCS

During the fifth inning of Game 3 of the NL Championship Series at Shea Stadium on Oct. 8, 1973, Rose slid hard into second base to try to break up a double play. In the process, he took out Mets shortstop Bud Harrelson with his slide and the two ended up brawling on the dirt as the benches cleared.

The Mets would take the game by a 9-2 score. Rose hit a game-winning home run in the top of the 12th inning of Game 4, but New York advanced to the World Series with a victory in the deciding Game 5.

5. Backing up Boone for Phillies World Series clincher

As the Phillies worked to close out the World Series vs. the Royals in Game 6 on Oct. 21, 1980, closer Tug McGraw was on the mound in the top of the ninth inning with a 4-1 lead. With one out and the bases loaded, Frank White batted and represented the go-ahead run.

White hit a foul pop towards the first-base dugout at Veterans Stadium. Near the top step, catcher Bob Boone appeared to have a routine catch but the ball came out of his glove. Backing up all the way from first base, Rose alertly snagged the ball for the second out and gleefully bounced the ball on the AstroTurf. McGraw struck out Willie Wilson for the final out to give Philadelphia its first-ever World Series title.

6. Three-homer game

Rose had 10 five-hit games during his career but only one game where he slugged three home runs. And it happened to come during a five-hit performance for the Reds vs. the Mets on April 29, 1978.

In a 5-for-6 performance, Rose hit homers in the fourth and fifth innings and again in the eighth inning as Cincinnati rolled to a 14-7 victory at Shea Stadium.

7. National League’s new hits leader

On Aug. 10, 1981, in the first game back following a players’ strike that lasted nearly two months, Rose hit a single through the hole on the left side for the Phillies in the eighth inning against the Cardinals. It was career hit No. 3,631 to surpass the NL all-time record previously held by Hall of Famer Stan Musial.

As fans at Veterans Stadium celebrated and fireworks exploded over the ballpark, Musial greeted Rose at first base to congratulate him for his record-breaking hit.

8. Career hit No. 4,000

Rose played only 95 games for the Expos during his brief stop in Montreal during the 1984 season. But he reached a big milestone that was celebrated by the fans at Olympic Stadium.

On April 13, 1984, during the Expos’ home opener vs. the Phillies and pitcher Jerry Koosman, Rose lined a double to right field for his 4,000th career hit. He joined Cobb to become the second player in Major League history to reach that plateau all-time. It was also the 21st anniversary of Rose’s first career hit.

9. An MVP and a batting title

Rose won back-to-back NL batting titles in 1968 and ’69 and he won his third in 1973 while also becoming the league’s Most Valuable Player Award winner. Rose batted .338/.401/.437 in 160 games. Of his league-leading 230 hits, he collected five home runs, 36 doubles and eight triples.

10. The ’75 World Series MVP

The 1975 World Series is considered one of the greatest contests in baseball history and it became an all-timer in Game 6 when Boston’s Carlton Fisk slugged an iconic walk-off home run to force a Game 7.

Rose was 2-for-5 in the seventh game with a walk in the deciding top of the ninth inning rally. Overall, he batted .370 (10-for-27) with three runs and two RBIs to be named World Series Most Valuable Player.
