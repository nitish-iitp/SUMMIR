Reds’ Elly De La Cruz sets another record on the final day of 2024
 Doug Gray  09/30/2024 180

Ever since Elly DE La Cruz joined the Cincinnati Reds in the summer of 2023 it was apparent that his raw talent was off the charts. The power, the speed, the arm, the athleticism – he was just a different kind of guy on the field compared to his extremely talented peers. That’s not to say he was as good as all of them – he’s still just 22-years-old – but he is and was capable of things that hardly anyone else is. Pretty much from the start of his big league career he’s been doing things every so often that put him in a “this is the only guy to ever have this many X, Y, and Z in this time frame in the history of baseball”.

On Sunday afternoon in the top of the 10th inning Elly De La Cruz doubled into the right field corner to drive in two runs to put the Reds ahead of the Cubs 2-0 in a game they’d win 15 minutes later by a score of 3-0. After the game that play was rightfully turned into a triple. And that scoring decision put Cincinnati’s shortstop in the record books once again. The triple was his 10th of the year. It gave him 36 doubles, 10 triples, and 25 home runs on the year. He also stole two bases in the game, pushing that number to 67 on the year.

In the history of Major League Baseball there have been 105 players to have 60 steals and 10 triples in a season. Joining that club on it’s own is impressive. Less than one player per season in the history of the game has been able to accomplish that feat. But only 15 players have been able to do that while also hitting 10 home runs. Now we’re into an even more impressive club. If we add in that you also needed to have 30 doubles, then that club shrinks to just nine players.

Only one player, though has ever had 20 home runs, 30 doubles, and 10 triples in a season while also stealing 60 bases. And that player is Elly De La Cruz. And he easily cleared the bar in four of those five categories, too. Given that he’s the only guy in that club, he’s also the only guy in the 35+ doubles, 10 triples, 25 home run, and 65 steal club, too.

Elly De La Cruz is a unicorn. He’s one of a kind. It feels like you’re making things up when you talk about some of the things he’s done.

The 22-year-old had a 6.4 WAR (Fangraphs) this season. That was the 9th best in baseball and the 3rd best in the National League (Shohei Ohtani – 9.1, Francisco Lindor – 7.6). Since 1947, that’s tied for the 26th most valuable season in Cincinnati Reds franchise history among position players. Since 1980 it’s trailing just the 2015 and 2010 seasons from Joey Votto, the 1987 season from Eric Davis, the 1996 season from Barry Larkin, and the 1995 season from Reggie Sanders in terms of value (tied with 2011 Joey Votto and 2013 Shin-Soo Choo).

That’s why the Reds really need to figure out how to strike a realistic deal with him now while he’s young. I don’t think he’s the type of guy you just let walk away when he hits his FA opportunity. After playing for the Reds, who wants to see him join the Dodgers? It’s unnatural to contemplate.

Oldtimer 09/30/2024

EDLC may get close to $500 M for 12 years when he is a free agent a few years from now. That’s comparable to Joey Votto getting $225 M for 12 years not too long ago but I highly doubt the Reds can sign EDLC long term.

jmb 10/01/2024

Votto’s contract was only for 10 years.

Redsfan4life 09/30/2024

I’d love for Elly to retire a Red. But if they did sign him long term. It would be another situation like Votto’s entire career. They wouldn’t spend enough to put a winning team around him.
It’s a mute point anyway. They aren’t signing Elly and my guess is Elly has zero intrest in remaining a Red once his contract is up anyway.
I can’t blame him if I am correct in my guess.

2020ball 10/01/2024

Certainly not with that attitude

redfanorbust 10/01/2024

I agree with the current ownership Reds can’t or won’t spend enough money to pay a superstar and surround him with quality players. Boras and Elly know this very well. I give Elly a 5% chance of signing long term with the Reds. Unless owners sell to a Steve Cohen type of person we should do our best to emulate the Rays system and get a max haul for him whatever year that happens to be.

greenmtred 09/30/2024

Yup. +10000000.

greenmtred 09/30/2024

That was for LDS.

Votto4life 09/30/2024

No way the Reds will be able to sign Elly to an extension, even if they wanted to….In a couple of years, the Reds will have to make a choice, they can either take the approach the Nationals took with Soto or they can take the approach that the Angels took with Othani.

I think the Nats approach would be preferable unless they are really close to a title when the time comes.

Either way, they will not be getting equal value for Elly. Just enjoy him while we can.

MBS 09/30/2024

or, don’t sign EDLC…

@Oldtimer is right, a 12Y $500M is a realistic, but maybe on the high side guess of what it would take to sign him.

So why not use that same money, and sign Soto who is currently a bigger star. Then we could have Soto for 12 seasons (age 25) batting alongside EDLC for the 5 seasons that we already control EDLC?

It won’t happen, but if we wanted to spend mega bucks that would be my plan.

1 it’s a more surefire ROI
2 it doubles the amount of superstar players the team has

SultanofSwaff 09/30/2024

I’ve kicked around in my head a 2 or 3 year deal for Soto at ~$65mil per year. Wondering which side would walk away from that first. Soto still hits free agency in his prime and it fits the Reds competitive window while keeping payroll solidly middle of the pack.

2020ball 10/01/2024

@Sultan

I would do that deal in a heartbeat, but I think Soto would prefer the years on the contract to some slightly bigger paydays for a couple seasons. He might at least give it a little thought though.

75MM ea for two years?

redfanorbust 10/01/2024

12@500M us 41.6M AAV. Not bad but with inflation and his upward trajectory what could he command in say 2-3 years? I understand the security aspect of signing early but then it is the Reds he would be signing with and with equal salary who would you rather sign with Dodgers or Reds? Unless the Reds magically find money and decide to spend in the top 10 team salaries and given who Elly’s agent is and Elly’s personality I think that choice is clear. LOVE your idea of signing Soto so he could play along side Elly. What would that look like though? 65M-70M@12yrs? Maybe more, an overpay because he is signing with the Reds? 75-80M per year? Not sure how ownership could/would afford that including locking up the rest of our young talent, with most of Reds fans unable to attend games due to being in shock.

Oldtimer 09/30/2024

… EDLC became the only player in MLB history with 30+ doubles, 10+ triples, 25+ home runs, and 60+ stolen bases in a single season.

Per radio host Lance McAlister, he joined Vada Pinson (1960, 1963, and 1965) as the only Reds batters since 1900 with 20+ homers, 10+ triples, and 30+ doubles in a single season.

De La Cruz finished the season with a .259 average, 36 doubles, 10 triples, 25 homers, and the 67 steals. The 22-year-old also scored 105 runs, the first time a Reds player eclipsed 100 since Joey Votto in 2017 …

Mark 09/30/2024

Think what his numbers could be if he cuts his strikeouts in half. That should be his goal.

JayTheRed 10/01/2024

lHell even if he dropped them by 25%.

Anthony 09/30/2024

Doesnt seem like we can keep him when FA eligible. Enjoy him till then whether its at ss or rf.

Doug Gray 09/30/2024

I will absolutely not enjoy anything if they put him in right field.

Redsfan4life 09/30/2024

Why do so many Reds fans wanna see Elly moved off SS?
He is going to win some gold gloves. He is already one of the best SS in MLB. Forget the errors. Concepcion and Larkin had high error totals early in their careers. I believe in year 3 Larkin led the N.L. in errors. He would have been 25 at the time. Elly is 22.

citizen54 09/30/2024

Exactly. A lot of his value comes from the fact he is a great defender playing a premium position. He has a 118wRC+ which is above average but is a far cry from Ohtani’s 181 or Judge’s 218. Moving him to RF or LF would negate a lot of that value.

doofus 09/30/2024

Shortstop Range Factor per 9 innings-
Elly 3.96
Davey 5.03
Ozzie 5.22

Total Chances per Error-
Elly 21.74
Davey 34.0
Ozzie 46.0

I judge shortstops defensive accumen by simply seeing how many assists they make over 1,350 innings. Four hundred is my benchmark for an above average SS. Both, Davey and Ozzie were elite with 500 assists in some seasons. Elly has not figured out how to unfold that tower yet… Perhaps he will.

doofus 09/30/2024

Citizen what does 118wRC+ mean, 118 with Rice Crispies+?

Oldtimer 09/30/2024

Elly at 22. Reds best player and All-Star.

Davey at 22. Split SS with Woody Woodward in 1970 Reds.

Ozzie at 22. Still in minor leagues.

2020ball 10/01/2024

@doofus

A stat that removes some of the noise from other stats, such as park variances. Its not a complicated stat, a google search would suffice. If you drop your preconceptions that is.

redfanorbust 10/01/2024

Agreed 100%. NO way I put Elly in the OF. He would be unhappy. We don’t want an unhappy Elly. Then you don’t want him having to learn a new position and take away from his concentration of his upward trajectory with his hitting. Third I don’t want our best player crashing into walls and diving for balls.

Seth 10/01/2024

Nobody will enjoy him in RF.

SultanofSwaff 09/30/2024

Before anyone gripes about the strikeouts, take a second to think about health and readiness to play to be in a position to accumulate those kind of stats. The kid plays hard and that goes a long way in my book.

With the AAV of a top 10 player around $45mil, I would think the Reds would need to exceed $600mil over, say, 12 years to get him to bite on an extension. Under different ownership I’d pull the trigger in a heartbeat but with these cheapskates you have to wonder if a quality roster could be constructed around him. I suppose at worst the cost certainty would (sadly) make him a more attractive trade candidate.

Jim Walker 09/30/2024

Per BBRef EDLC is on line to become an FA after the 2029 season which will be his age 27 year. A realistic path for the Reds would be to sign him to a bridge deal, a la the Greene deal, which would assure they can keep him that long or garner a better return on the off chance they decided to move him prior to the deal running out.

In the process, they should try to go for a year or two of FA time with a team (only) option for the his age 28 season (2030) and a two way option for his age 29 season (2031). However, even if they cannot get any FA time, they should still do the bridge deal through his period of team control.

What might this money look like? I’d say a 5 year AAV of 5% above what he would project to make without the deal for 2 years of pre-arbitration and 3 years of arbitration. In addition, the deal would be adorned with serious bonuses (along the lines of Greene’s deal) for MVP balloting finishes and All Star appearances. So, not cheap.

As for the FA year options? For salary, go 10% above what the current projection of them would be with the team buyout being that 10% and the player buyout 5% on the mutual option year,

sultanofswaff 09/30/2024

Works for me. Potentially missing out on a couple prime seasons and the sentimental idea of him playing his whole career in one uniform doesn’t outweigh making the right business decision.

Chris 09/30/2024

If I’m the owner of the Cincinnati Reds it would kill me to watch the most exciting player this side of Ohtani play for anyone else after being a homegrown Red and all. and you know there are owners slobbering with the thought of stealing him away for their own team. Talent like this comes along once in a generation. Extend Elly!

redfanorbust 10/01/2024

Hey Chris. Hopefully if/when (most probably when) he will not get stolen and the team that gets him will have to swallow hard and give up a lot.

Daytonnati 09/30/2024

I bet Doug slept in today! 

Doug Gray 09/30/2024

I did. But I also didn’t. I definitely got out of bed at 11:13am. But my watch also says I went to bed at 5:30am, which feels about right because I could hear the neighborhood starting to move (people leaving for work).

RedsGettingBetter 09/30/2024

Elly is ELLy-te. He will be making incredible things game by game , year by year…even if he gets 6 Ks in a game is special. By the way, if Elly manages to lower his K% and applies baseball fundamentals more often running the bases in 2025, his season promises to be from the other planet…
But the records Elly reaches, wouldn’t look so impressive if Doug weren’t describing it. In this article, Doug executed step by step in a clear and excellent way a procedure named in data base management as query by example, getting close slowly to get the searched results. Pretty good.

David 09/30/2024

The guy is so young, really. He has learned an immense amount since he made it to the ML.
Johnny Bench won an MVP award at the age of 22 (he was going to turn 23 in December of 1970). I would not put it past EDLC to do the same in his age 23 season (next year, 2025) if he improves as much over 2024 as he improved over 2023.

He is an amazing player, and also seems to be very personable. He made a big effort to learn English so he could speak to people directly, this year.

Redsfan4life 09/30/2024

Odds are he will win a MVP very soon. It wouldn’t surprise me if he wins more than one.

VaRedsFan 09/30/2024

That might depend on Ohtani having some sort of ailment. If not, Ohtani will win it every year.

stuckonthenorthshore 09/30/2024

What makes it even more impressive is adding in the 200+K club ??? – if he makes contact/walks 50 more AB’S a year. He’ll probably set a couple more records.

DW 09/30/2024

And yet it still appears that he is only scratching the surface of what he is capable of.

Michael B. Green 09/30/2024

Braves got beat by the pitch count in Game 1. Why take out an SP when they are dealing?

greenmtred 10/01/2024

A number of possible answers to that besides rigid stupidity: 1). pitcher beginning to tire. 2). 3rd time through batting order–the stats on that are pretty clear-cut. 3). Unfavorable specific match-ups coming up.

Anthony 09/30/2024

The answer of Elly could be moved to rf is simple. 1) there’s no current corner ofer. 2) Reds have 2 prospects who are steadier defensive ss than Elly. One is named McClain the other naned Arroyo. Elly makes the spectacular play is a tremendous talent. But moving hin to Rf would not be such a death knell

Oldtimer 09/30/2024

No. Elly is elite SS. No other Red can say that. Elly would NOT be elite RF.

You don’t move your best player from his best position to another position.

doofus 09/30/2024

Dave Concepcion and Ozzie Smith were elite. Elly is not an elite SS.

doofus 09/30/2024

How do you know that SS is Elly’s best position?

Oldtimer 09/30/2024

Yes, he is. Davey was NOT elite anything at age 22, 23, or 24.

Nor was Ozzie Smith at that age.

doofus 09/30/2024

Elly is not an elite SS at 22 years old.

Oldtimer 09/30/2024

Yes, he is. Davey wasn’t. Ozzie was still in minor leagues at 22.

Frankie Tomatoes 09/30/2024

doofus, Elly is an elite defensive shortstop according to both Statcasts defensive metrics and Fangraphs defensive metrics.

doofus 09/30/2024

Elly is a dynamic young ballplayer who happens to play SS. He is not an elite SS. He will become an elite SS when he improves his defense. At the present time, NYET on the SS eliteness!

Frankie Tomatoes 09/30/2024

doofus you seem to think that you must not make errors to be a good defender. That is not the case. You need to be able to make more plays than other guys. Elly does that and that is even if we include the plays he messes up with the errors. He is elite at turning hits into outs.

doofus 09/30/2024

Frankie, I am curious, what from the Statcast and Fangraphs D-metrics indicates that a SS is elite?

Thanks!

doofus 09/30/2024

Frank, I do not think that errors are a good indicator, never have. I do not know how you came up with that. I agree, that a SS needs to make plays.

I do not think that Elly makes enough plays at SS. With work, I believe that he has the ability to make more.

To be an elite SS he needs to make an average of 5 postive plays (an assist or putout) per 9 innings.* Right now he is only averaging 3.96 per 9. Davey (5.03) and Ozzie (5.22) were elite.

* doofus defense metrics.

Frankie Tomatoes 09/30/2024

doofus Statcast has him at +11 runs saved which is tied for 19th in baseball for all positions. It was 4th among shortstops.

Fangraphs has his defensive value as the 5th best in baseball for all positions.

Neither provides a specific breakdown of where one excels or struggles in terms of something like coming in on balls, going to their left, right, how much difference the arm strength makes.

But if you are interested Mike Petriello looked at Elly’s defense a few months ago to show just why it is that he makes errors but is still so highly rated thanks to the other kinds of plays he makes that basically no one else does. https://www.mlb.com/reds/news/elly-de-la-cruz-playing-good-defense-despite-errors

Melvin 09/30/2024

Just curious. How does Larkin rank?

Frankie Tomatoes 09/30/2024

doofus I have to tell you that using range factor to compare players in the same year is a bad practice but using it to compare players who played decades apart is even worse.

Range factor is simply about the number of plays made. Depending on your pitching staff you are going to get more or less chances than another guy and that alone means it’s giving you bad information. If your entire team is full of groundball pitchers not only will you get more chances as an infielder on grounders but you are also going to get more chances because groundball pitchers don’t strike guys out as much as fly ball pitchers. Range factor is the RBI of defensive stats – it’s not so much about the guy being credited as it is about the amount of opportunities given.

And lets just also realize that comparing a guy playing in 2024 where the strikeout rate is nearly doubled that of 1980something is going to lead to far more chances.

What we know is that compared to the other players in baseball today that Elly is better at turning batted balls into outs than almost all of them. And that includes when he throws the ball away or flips it poorly to India at second base.

MBS 10/01/2024

@doofus, you are correct. EDLC is an elite talent that will make elite plays wherever you put him.

2023
3B 259 innings, 1 E
SS 591 innings, 13 E

2024
SS 1391 innings, 29 E

He doesn’t need to make errors, he makes errors because he is played outside of his position.

People say he’ll be a GG SS, well he was already a GG 3B. We have him for 5 more years. Maybe by the last 2 he’ll get to that GG level like many here think he’ll become. I’d rather have 5 seasons of GG at 3B, and let McLain play SS. McLain’s best position is actually SS, EDLC’s is 3B.

Why complicate things?

greenmtred 10/01/2024

Elly was good at third base, but the position wastes his range. He generally wouldn’t be involved in as many plays there, either.I don’t believe it’s safe to assume that he won’t cut down considerably on errors.

doofus 09/30/2024

I did not know that the Reds played 2024 without a rightfielder.

If Elly moved to the grass, CF is the better fit. The Reds would not need a rightfielder or leftfielder then.

Daytonnati 10/01/2024

Nice!

redfanorbust 10/01/2024

No, IMO you build around your superstar keeping him happy and focused even if his defense is just league average. Plus I don’t want him running into walls and diving for balls.

Anthony 09/30/2024

Bottom line…Elly is a unique talent regardless if hes a ss or rf. Its gonna be fine either way

BK 09/30/2024

Shortstops are involved in far more plays than RF. Moving him to RF would hurt the team’s defense, causing the Reds to give up more runs and lose more games.

doofus 09/30/2024

How would a move to the outfield hurt the team’s defense? Would the Reds not have someone else play SS?

BK 09/30/2024

EDLC was the fourth-best SS based on Outs Above Average in his first full season. I’m assuming you can’t get one of the top 3 on the Reds.

https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/leaderboard/outs_above_average?type=Fielder&startYear=2024&endYear=2024&split=yes&team=&range=year&min=q&pos=6&roles=&viz=hide

Also, please see the link below to a Fangraph’s article on defensive value by position. There is a HUGE difference in the defensive value of a SS vs. RF because a good SS can prevent more runs than an equally good RF.

https://library.fangraphs.com/war/war-position-players/

DaveCT 09/30/2024

Thank you, BK.

Sure, let’s take an All Star short stop and move him to .., wait for it … right field.

That move would be moronic. Beyond dumb. Weird. Very weird. Way too weird.

Melvin 09/30/2024

To me EDLC is an elite SS and would be elite just about wherever he plays. I’m happy wherever that is. I’ve always maintained though that he would be an all world CF unlike any we’ve ever seen.

greenmtred 10/01/2024

Melvin: he might well be a terrific centerfielder, but he would have less defensive impact than he does at shortstop. He’s the best athlete on the team–one of the best in all of baseball–and he plays the most important defensive position–except catcher, I think. Why move him? He’s almost certainly going to cut down on errors and refine his game in years to come.

Mike W 09/30/2024

I think OFs are more likely to get injured (running into other players at full speed, hitting walls at full speed, diving at full speed) than SSs are. And you know Elly would run after a ball at full speed. That’s why I would not move THE player with the most upside potential in all of baseball to the OF. He didn’t get hurt at SS. You know the expression: If it ain’t broke? Focus on improving Elly’s bat to ball contact in the off season, make Marte and Benson earn their spots — and go sign a hard hitting OF. We’d have the necessary parts. Bring on 2025!

In the Pete Rose documentary that was released recently my Dad was in the video. In section 4 Dan Patrick was talking about how much conversation is spent on Pete at the HOF . My Dad is quoted as saying that if Pete isn’t allowed in the HOF they should close the doors. My Dad died in 2004. Pete was the player you Dad always told you, that’s how you play the game.
His style of play always stuck with me. When ever I played team sports I always wore number 14. Pete Rose and Oscar Robertson wore that number.

Doofus is correct. RIP Hit King. This is a sad day for baseball.

redfanorbust 10/01/2024

I certainly would not go so far to say he was “so” flawed as a human. I did social work for 11 years and I have seen flawed humans that make Pete look like a boy scout.

Mark Moore 09/30/2024

160 games … that stat makes me go WOW!!! 

doofus 09/30/2024

It is 8:51pm EST and there is nothing on mlb.com website about Pete Rose’s passing.

LDS 09/30/2024

Sheldon posted on MLB about 10-15 minutes ago. Too many have trouble distinguishing Rose’s baseball performance, which was superlative from his human performance, which certainly wasn’t. To paraphrase Nixon, “we won’t have Pete to kick around anymore”. But, there are and will be plenty of new candidates, some of whom we know already.

Melvin 09/30/2024

There will be something on Pete Rose at half time of the Seattle/Detroit game tonight.

Andy 09/30/2024

More significantly, it’s 9:47 pm and there is nothing on redlegnation.com (other than comments). I am aware of Doug’s point of view, but he won’t even let another writer cover his passing?

Doug Gray 09/30/2024

Anyone on the Redleg Nation staff can write whatever they want to.

LDS 09/30/2024

RLN isn’t a news site and doesn’t have official standing and thus isn’t obligated to cover it. It is reasonable to expect the MLB site to cover Rose’s passing. Whether Doug does or doesn’t is irrelevant. I’d rather he snag us some off season scoops and rumors – preferably more positive than going for Gray.

DW 10/01/2024

Agree LDS

Bdh 09/30/2024

Nothing here either. Pathetic

Jim Walker 10/01/2024

If I were to write anything above the line here about Pete Rose, it would conclude that he was as flawed as a person all his life as he was great at playing baseball for a couple of decades. That hardly seems fitting on the occasion of his passing.

Here’s Mark Sheldon’s lead from MLB(.)com
“CINCINNATI – A gritty baseball great who compiled a nearly unrivaled list of achievements, only to tarnish his own legacy with sins against the game that drew a nearly unrivaled list of detractors, Pete Rose died on Monday at the age of 83.”

Eddiek957 09/30/2024

Aside for 71 I can’t think of any other Reds season that was bad with Pete on the team. God bless Pete

Mauired 09/30/2024

Time to put Pete in the Hall of Fame.

LDS 09/30/2024

Back to the topic of signing EDLC to an extension. Boras is one stumbling block. He demonstrated last season that he’s not necessarily giving his clients the best representation. And I’ve seen more than one story hinting that EDLC wants to be a Dodger. Nonetheless, the right approach is getting someone he respects to explain reality – that he’s 22 and immortal right now and that can change in an instant. Talk to Eric Davis.

Melvin 09/30/2024

Yep. That’s been my point all along. How can one risk millions and millions of guaranteed dollars when everything depends on him being able to play baseball? Too many things can happen in life that can change that and he’ll be left with nothing relatively speaking.

JB 10/01/2024

Absolutely. Anything can happen in the next 5 years. Tomorrow is never guaranteed and life doesn’t care who you are or what you have. Take it from me , the poster boy of that. Married my wife on a beautiful day and held her in my arms as she passed away the very next day. Life will humble you at some point.

greenmtred 10/01/2024

My God, JB. I’m so sorry.

Melvin 10/01/2024

Sorry for your loss JB.

Votto4life 10/01/2024

Man JB, I am so sorry.

west larry 10/01/2024

J B: I’m so sorry for your loss…and to have it happen the day after your marriage…must have taken years to be able to coup with that. I hop that you are blessed with many happy years to follow.

Wayne Nabors 09/30/2024

Lds it is a news site a reds news site which has covered other reds legends passing,but I would rather there not be nothing on this site considering the negative attitude of administrator of this site toward pete

Brian 09/30/2024

What ever could lead someone to have a negative attitude towards him? Maybe it was all of the negative things he did.

Wayne Nabors 09/30/2024

@brian,no one ever said he was a saint,and neither is numerous players befor or after him but he was treated unfairly, rules were changed to specially keep him from hall,how many people you know had rule change especially for them?

greenmtred 10/01/2024

Wayne, the 1919 Black Socks, including Shoeless Joe Jackson, aren’t in the Hall. Pete was a great player who bet on baseball–including games involving his team: that threatens the viability and integrity of MLB itself. Banishment is tough, but how can it be unfair? Do you believe that a different player wouldn’t be banished for the same thing?

Votto4life 10/01/2024

We are all guest here. Doug is allowing people to comment here on Rose. He could block these comments should he choose. Doug has no obligation to write about someone who he feels is not worthy of it. I respect Doug for his decision.

There are plenty other places to read about Rose’s death. My FB and TikTok feeds are full of them.

Wayne nabors 10/01/2024

To greenmtnred,you are absolutely right they aren’t in the hall but they could have,any one of them could have been voted in,Vincent didn’t bar banned players til 1991,and it was specifically for pete

William 09/30/2024

I see some news that Pete Rose died.

Creigh deeds 09/30/2024

I get that you don’t care for Pete Rose, but objectively he was one of the greatest Reds. Failure to recognize that affects your objectivity and ultimately, your credibility.

ChrisInVenice 10/01/2024

Seems like everyone knows.why do you expect someone to write about it if they don’t care to. Kind of weird, really.

William 09/30/2024

My condolences to the Rose family. He loved the game of baseball and played it with great hustle. He broke Ty Cobb’s hit record.

MBS 09/30/2024

RIP #14, he was a true legend of the game

Frankie Tomatoes 09/30/2024

Watching Pete play was great.

But then he ripped my heart out over and over after he stopped playing.

Jim Walker 10/01/2024

+1000

Westfester 10/01/2024

This is my feeling. I was watching MLB Network, and someone make a great comparison. It’s comparing the art to the artist. The art can be beautiful and inspirational, and the artist can be an ugly, selfish person who destroyed his legacy all by himself. It’s up to all of us to decide ourselves how we feel about those stark differences.

Mauired 10/01/2024

Very good point. In my opinion, exactly why he and Parker and Blue should be in the Hall. Their careers can be recognized and celebrated while even though their personal lifes should not be celebrated. And yeah I know he bet on baseball while working in baseball but his playing career was over by then. I think and hope.

Moon 09/30/2024

I see a lot of stuff in the media about the record number of hits Pete had. That he was a 17 time all star, etc. But one record that does not get mentioned is his 44 game hit streak, which is still a national league record. I remember when he did that. Very exciting stretch of baseball

Melvin 09/30/2024

Maybe the greatest record he holds is the amount of games played.

Moon 09/30/2024

Good point….he was still hitting well late in his career at an advanced age for ballplayers

Mauired 09/30/2024

Top 10 in the MVP race at the age of 40. 3 time All-star in his 40s as well.

JA 09/30/2024

Memories come to my mind….
Watching the world series games in a very small town in central Mexico….the tV announcer used to say…
“LTH batteries, the “soul of yor car” is pleased to broadcast from the USA via satellite, the game for the MLB world series…line ups… Joe Morgan, George Foster, Pete Rose, David Concepcion, Johnny Bench….”
At some point Rose made a big play and.the announcer said something like… “LTH battery is the soul of your car as Pete Rose is the soul of the big red Machine…”
Pete Rose RIP

Rick 09/30/2024

I went to my first Reds game ever at age 14 in 1970. I was elated to watch my beloved Reds play. Pete Rose didn’t disappoint against the Braves. My 1st bat that I saved up to buy was a Rose model. Loved watching him play & manage. I hated all of the mounds of evidence of him the person, but now is not about those narratives. RIP, I hope that he was saved prior to his end.

Dan 10/01/2024

Pete Rose the player is an all-time great player, and without question is on the Mt. Rushmore of Cincinnati Reds. What he did on the field brought a lot of joy to a lot of people, including me. (Off the field, not so much…)

Hit King, #14, a one-of-a-kind, a Cincinnati icon.

Thank you, Pete. Rest well.

Rick 10/01/2024

Agree

JayTheRed 10/01/2024

Question about Pete Rose. Was he the last player manager in baseball? I was trying to think of anyone else who did that, and I came up empty.

JayTheRed 10/01/2024

I am talking in the same season.

Melvin 10/01/2024

Google says Rose was the last.

Melvin 10/01/2024

Pete Rose was the last player-manager in Major League Baseball (MLB), serving as manager of the Cincinnati Reds from 1984 to 1986:

Rednat 10/01/2024

Pete Rose is Cincinnati. Cincinnati is Pete Rose. You really can’t separate the two. I grew up watching Pete and he was definitely a hero in my eyes. my brother called me when he heard the news and we both had a long cry.

A few things come to mind when I think of Pete.

1. The game has certainly changed since he was banned from baseball. it is now a game of elite wealthy college kids. not sure if it is a cause or coincidence but i don’t necessarily think this is a good thing. just look at the last series of the year with the cubs. it was about as interesting as watching golf.

2. there have been 2 players in over 150 years of baseball to hit over 4,000 hits. Neither will win any citizenship awards and both have similar backgrounds. I’m sure you can find a lot of similarities between Royston Georgia and Anderson Ferry. Also both had very similar relationships with their father’s. i just find the similarities fascinating. If there ever is a third player who reaches 4,000 hits (doubt it will happen) I got a feeling he won’t win any citizenship awards either.

3. we don’t talk about the baseball commissioners office much on this site. But you look at Giamatti, Vincent,Manfred etc. you got these aloof elitist Yale/Harvard law guys in control of the game. Is that the best thing for our league? could these guys relate to Pete at all? Its like he didn’t stand a chance.

JA 10/01/2024

Maybe all of the on-line sport betting sites could suspend taking bet for the next 30 days?

Ironic, at least

Dan 10/01/2024

The Cobb-Rose similarities are interesting, I agree.

Just wanted to point out though that Ichiro also has over 4000 hits (albeit spread over 2 leagues, so he doesn’t OFFICIALLY have 4000 hits), and he seems like an upstanding guy.

VaRedsFan 10/01/2024

Yeah…Japanese hits don’t count, just like Rose’s minor league (Also professional) hits don’t count.

Mauired 10/01/2024

True. They don’t count. Wish Japanese players weren’t forced to play in Japan because it does affect their overall career stats and hall of fame eligibility. Ichiro’s in regardless but other borderline guys might not get in. Ichiro would have gotten 4000 in MLB if he started his pro career in the US. He does have the single season hit record though. It was almost a hundred year old record from the 20’s when he broke it.

Jim Walker 10/01/2024

Kenesaw Mountain Landis is the commissioner who instituted the hardcore gambling ban in the 1920s in response to the BlackSox scandal. Rose was busted 60+ years later for violating this longstanding and well-known cardinal rule of MLB. Rose perhaps should have done a better job of adhering to his sport’s rules

Landis was not an East Coast elite type. He was born in Millville, OH, near Hamilton. His family subsequently moved to Logansport, IN. He was a graduate of Union College of Law which is now the law school of Northwestern University in Chicago. He sat as a judge on the Federal Court bench in Chicago at the time he became MLB commissioner in 1922 (and served until he died in 1944).

greenmtred 10/01/2024

+10000000

rednat 10/01/2024

i Really believe Landis would have worked with Pete. At LEAST NOT PEJUDGED HIM like our current commissioners.

Westfester 10/01/2024

rednat, he had his chance. in 2002 he met Bud Selig in a secret meeting arranged by Morgan and Bench. Selig was going to take him off the ineligible list. All he had to do was 2 things:
1. NO. MORE. GAMBLING! Full stop. He had to get treatment for his addiction.
2. Hold a Press conference and CONFESS, and beg forgiveness.
they shook hands… and Pete immediately went to a Sportsbook in Vegas that night. Pete set his own legacy.

Mauired 10/01/2024

Landis was also a racist that kept integration from happening decades earlier than it did which hurt the game. Players like Josh Gibson, Martin Dhigo, prime Satchell Paige, and many others didn’t get to play in MLB because of Landis. He was no saint. An argument can be made that his sins were far worse than Pete putting a little cash on his team to win. Not that it was ok. But I think racism and stopping a man from making a living at his craft because of skin color is alot worse than gambling.

Votto4life 10/01/2024

So now we are blaming people for being smart? There is nothing wrong with having a good education.

Jedi Joey 10/01/2024

Nothing wrong with education but I know plenty of “educated” people who aren’t the brightest bulbs in the box.

Michael Wilson 10/01/2024

RIP Pete. Love him or hate him you have to marvel at his numbers and how he played the game. To achieve his numbers a player has to be very good and be very good for a long time. About 20 years worth. He played alongside Robinson and Pinson, Bench and Perez, Mike Schmidt’s Phillies. Second base, left field, right field, third base, first base, just put me in coach.

Melvin 10/01/2024

He played 162 games at age 41 in 1982. .271/.345/.338/.683

I think the Reds could have used him that year being that they lost 100 games. lol

Anthony 10/01/2024

The passing of Pete brings back SO many emotions it would take about 8 paragraphs of web-space to expound upon everything. , Head-first slides, Fosse, Harrelson, WS MVP, Hit Streaks, saving Bob Boone, Player Manager Head First Slide return, 4192 Hit King and all the Gambling Ban Saga. For anyone on this list who had youth privilege of watching Pete play live or on Saturday Game of the Week or in post-season you know what I mean. For those of you who did NOT have the pleasure of watching this guy play…just know this was a WINNER…who HUSTLED….played HARD all the time….knew and loved the GAME for how it was meant to be played. Taught a whole generation of us how to play this game and to love it. Maybe the lasting impression is Italian Born mother who only knew that her son played and loved baseball too much had only ONE favorite player she recognized…#14 of the Reds sliding headfirst and running to first base without hitting the ball. Very touching the last 24 hours that family and friends and even Ex’s reaching out with condolences over Pete Rose?? What did the HOF ban actually end up accomplishing now that he isn’t here to give one of his classic speeches. Many of us who live thru better days as Reds fans often whine and complain of How Things Are Today…..there’s a reason for this. We saw LIVE how GLORIOUS it once was……..RIP Pete Rose…….we shall never forget.

Anthony 10/01/2024

Reading all the above touching comments on Pete I also add DITTO……Its a time that we all HUG…and CRY……We understand it all…:(

TR 10/01/2024

No one ever played the game with more intensity than Charlie Hustle. To see Pete Rose play baseball was a reason to go to the ballpark. Condolences to his loved ones.

jmb 10/01/2024

I’m not impressed by how the Tatis Jr. and J-Rod contracts are turning out. I certainly hope the Reds don’t make the mistake of signing EDLC to such a contract, not until he proves that he can reduce the SOs and the errors, anyway. Guys with stellar skills but who strike out so much and make so many errors often don’t develop enough to fulfill expectations.

VaRedsFan 10/01/2024

So you would have moved on from Larkin and Concepcion, or other Non-Reds like Jeter, because they made some errors in their 1st full season???????

If you wait until he plays more than 1.5 seasons and improves in those areas, then those costs double.

Indy Red Man 10/01/2024

RIP Pete. Loved when he’d come back to Gabp and talk baseball. I love sports handicapping and I’ve met a lot of really desperate gamblers over the years. One friend is 74-75 and he’s lost everything.
He has a condo in the wealthiest part of Indianapolis, but he’s so broke he can’t get his refrigerator fixed. Moving in with his sister all because of gambling

Jedi Joey 10/01/2024

While I’m deeply saddened by the passing of Peter Rose, I will say it is Doug’s decision not report it on his website and I respect it. I may not agree with it but I’m a guest here and am thankful that he lets me freely post my opinions with you all. Thank you all for sharing the wonderful memories of Pete. If anyone would like to read a nice article on Pete, head over to the Dayton Daily News and read Hal McCoy’s article. RIP Hit King

MBS 10/01/2024

I don’t want us to get weaker in the position player department. If anything we need to add 2 or more bats to the roster. Say what you want about Candy, he’d been a good MLB player since 2020.

2020 137 OPS+
2021 121 OPS+
2022 81 OPS+
2023 121 OPS+
2024 90 OPS+

We know he’s been dealing with injuries in 2024, so I’m willing to cut the guy some slack.

LDS 10/01/2024

As much as I’d like to see Candelario traded, I don’t think it’s likely. And the trade for Gray would further erode payroll space. I’d rather see the money spent on hitters, particularly OF’ers than a nearly 35 yo pitcher. For example, Santander, who sportrac is projecting at $90m for 5 years, nothing in today’s game. Or Tyler O’Neill projected at $48m for 3 years. Or Teoscar Hernandez projected at 3 years and $73m. All of these guys are younger and cheaper than Gray. And all would be better signings than Candelario. BTW, as several have noted, Martinez is younger and cheaper than Gray as well. Krall needs to spend his money wisely this season. No more “maybe he’ll become Barry Bonds at GABP”, no more wishful thinking, and no more old home weeks like Gray, Suarez, Winker, and any other former Red one can think of. Move forward. And the Reds’ season ended two days ago. Let’s see some action. Fire some more folks, hire a manager, sell the team. As the old saying goes, you snooze, you lose.

SultanofSwaff 10/01/2024

Some thoughts about Pete-
–he had a great mind for baseball and (other than maybe Nolan Ryan) was the last thread of connection to the players of the 50s and 60s who could speak credibly about comparing the abilities of those previous generations to now.
–not to dismiss his considerable talent and hat tip to Bird, but he was the grindiest white athlete ever lol.
–obviously he made some terrible life choices, but it’s also true he was the rare veteran player who took rookies and especially black players under his wing (buying them clothes, etc.) as he didn’t want them to experience what he went thru.
–at 5 years old I cracked my souvenir Reds helmet playing in the back yard trying to emulate Pete.
–some time in the 90s I was strolling thru Ceasar’s in Vegas (the shopping mall part) and saw Pete sitting alone at a memorabilia shop waiting for someone to stop by an pay for an autograph…..couldn’t force myself to meet him, just kinda sad and pathetic. Not exactly how you want to meet your sports idol.
–we know he wasn’t just a singles hitter….to that end I would argue he possessed a rare skillset that would’ve worked in the deadball era, the steroid era, and today.

greenmtred 10/01/2024

+100000000. Thanks, Sultan. Personally, I’d give Bird more than a hat tip, but yours was a really fine comment.

Jim Walker 10/01/2024

+500. Rose’s support of black and Latino players, especially in the early and mid-1960s when racial barriers were still de facto in much of society, is a positive for him that extends beyond baseball. As I said above, he was a very complex character who sadly was as flawed in many respects as he was great at baseball.

rednat 10/01/2024

yes, i believe his positive qualities far outweigh the negative. He was well ahead of his time concerning race relations. Especially during the tumultuous 60’s and 70’s. Pretty amazing for a poor white kid from the west side. that is why I really blame the commissioners for not working with Pete to get him reinstated. Just seem like they had their mind made up before even meeting with him

old-school 10/01/2024

Interesting non candidates for the Reds manager to cross off the list, per Wittenmyer. These have been ruled out or not interested.

No Maddon, No Girardi, No Servais, No Miguel Cairo, and no Barry Larkin.

MBS 10/01/2024

What does Whittnemyer know? Really there is zero chance that he has been credible leaked a word about who’s in the mix yet.

Jim Walker 10/01/2024

As I said yesterday over on X (@jn_walkerjr), it is Schumaker, Ross, Tito if he is interested/ healthy or a rabbit out of the hat like Sparky was in 1970 (and to a degree Dusty to the Reds though he was a known quantity).

old-school 10/01/2024

I saw an interview with Pete on MLb network and said Sparky demanded infield practice before games and if you weren’t out there that meant you weren’t healthy enough to play. Context of Don Zimmer who was from Western Hills like Pete and Pete heard zimmer retiring and Pete Said “what’s up Zim? Zimmer said paraphrasing I told my wife when I dont enjoy baseball anymore Im giving it up and when the third baseman is in the clubhouse for infield watching TV and a pitcher is taking grounders at third for him and for the starting second Baseman too, Im done.

Also saw an interview of Schumacher criticizing his starting pitcher for a bad opening inning, missing the zone and digging the Marline a big hole. I think Schumacher and Ross are both on the short list and both have reputations for holding players accountable for mental errors or sloppy play or lack of focus

greenmtred 10/01/2024

Old-school: that raises a question–were the Reds not interested in those guys, or were they (the candidates) not interested in managing the Reds? When you think about it, an ownership group with a history of being unwilling to pony up the money to make the improvements necessary to keep a playoff run alive is a set-up for failure.

old-school 10/01/2024

@GMR, FWIW

the actual article started off hypothetically with Maile as a player manager concept. Maile said interested in managing after his career. Krall interviewed and quoted “No. Not a candidate” to concept of player manager/Maile.

On Girardi “he appears to be sitting out this round of managerial openings this off-season.”
On Maddon “He’s a podcaster, pundit and author these days with the next step in his managerial career being HOF consideration”
On Cairo “He doesnt have the experience or natural fit”

On Servais” Most of his tenure as manager involved disappointment and underachievement for the talent”

On Larkin” has never managed and wont be in the mix for this opening.”

greenmtred 10/01/2024

Ah ha!! Thanks, O-S.

Mauired 10/01/2024

I’m all for Maile being a player/manager next year if it’s in the minors.

Richard Fitch 10/01/2024

And Doug’s opinion is pretty evident in that this is a Reds fan site and he hasn’t even bothered to put up an article on Pete’s death…

Johnny Bench was on the Dan Patrick show at lunch today so at least some people are talking about Pete.

Doug Gray 10/01/2024

This is not a “fan site”. Whatever that means.

I’m not writing about Pete. Someone else is but they have not completed their piece yet.

Jedi Joey 10/01/2024

OnlyFans? Wrong place 

Pablo 10/01/2024

Regarding Elly, hopefully the front office is operating with the mindset of being in the ‘Elly window’ and build a winning team around him NOW.

And please stay healthy Elly!

Votto4life 10/01/2024

I hope this is what is behind the Sonny Gray rumors. Not so much about Gray specifically, but maybe the Reds plan to go all in while they still have Elly.

Jim Walker 10/01/2024

But why do I feel getting Sonny back is doubling down on prior errors of being a day late and a dollar short on guys who are what they really need? They have their ace in Greene. What they need for the rotation is one or two mid level guys who will grind innings. They can probably get them both for the $$$ salary cost of Sonny,

Spend on one or two corner OF guys who can hit and do NOT require platoon support. Or, get one corner guy and a true top tier CF.

.

old-school 10/01/2024

@ Jim.

Nick Martinez was a shade behind Gray in fWAR -3.8 vs 3.5.
Gray is a year older.
Martinez could be had for less with Gray Owed $65 million for 2025/26 in a bad contract that is heavily weighted in years 2/3. You could get Martinez for 3/45 or Gray for 2/ 65???? That makes makes no sense unless the Cards are taking on Candelario’s 2/30 as well to take over at first base for Goldschmidt.

Tony Cloninger 10/01/2024

One legacy of Pete is the Cincy people and fans all over. They value hustle more sometimes than actual players who are good but look so good that they don’t hustle enough? Freel comes to mind. Liked the hustle but there were a lot of people who said he was more important and cared more than Griffey or Dunn. Those guys don’t care.

Eric Davis hustled. Probably too his detriment because his body could not handle that. He got injured. Fans thought he might be lazy. Whatever. Not everybody could hustle and not get hurt like Pete. In fact I would day no one really could.

George Foster stopped diving so much in 1979-80 because he said his bat is important. More important than getting hurt. He was right. But those fans thought he was lazy. There was a lot of them. I remember. Very well.

Votto. Get the frustration with him. But there seemed to be fans who would prefer Phillips over him because it looked like he cared more. Or Joey did not hustle enough.

Elly. If he gets paid here. We will have the same people come out of the weeds to tell us he’s not doing enough. They might even accuse him of not hustling too.

That’s the annoying legacy of Rose that I prefer would go away. That if you don’t hustle like him. A complete outlier. You’re not good enough.

Jim Walker 10/01/2024

I always felt the situation with Votto started and ended with poor communication between him and the team. They hired him for a decade to be the big power bat in the middle of the lineup. He made himself into one of the top OBP guys in the MLB.

There was nothing inherently wrong with either point of view. However, the issue was the team would have preferred to have a little less OBP and a little more slugging from him. The other side of the coin was that he was not always surrounded by a lineup that forced pitchers to throw him strikes.

Justin T 10/01/2024

Joey is one of the last great hitters who didnt strike out 175 times a year. I think by now we all can appreciate the value of that. He was a steady presence in the lineup but just wasnt born with the rah rah personality that fans sometimes clamor for. Im curious to see how history views him in the future.

Jim, my opinion is the Reds will never be able to pay one guy so much and try to build around him, it takes resourcefulness that hasnt been displayed by the current owners.

Pat 10/01/2024

So what if the reds sign Mr. Del La Cruz longterm and bring in Juan Soto longterm. Would they generate enough in revenue (ticket sales and merchandise) to compensate for the cost? Isn’t that what business decisions are based on? Cost versus benefit? Thoughts?
