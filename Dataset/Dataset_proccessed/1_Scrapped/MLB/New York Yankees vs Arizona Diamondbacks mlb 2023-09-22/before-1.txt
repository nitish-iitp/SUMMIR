Stephen A. Smith is known to make headlines, usually for controversial or intriguing takes he makes on his First Take show.

But on Thursday, while throwing out the honorary first pitch at Yankee Stadium ahead of the New York Yankees vs. Toronto Blue Jays game, Smith left fans in shock for a different reason: his throw couldn't make it to the catcher without a hop.

The media personality looked distraught following the pitch. Smith took to Twitter to defend himself, albeit tongue-in-cheek, saying that the pitch was a "changeup".

Stephen A. Smith vs. Baseball

Ironically, Smith upset baseball fans everywhere just a day ago ago during a segment on First Take regarding Shohei Ohtani. Smith made a passionate case against any MLB team paying Ohtani a reported $500 million contract this offseason.

Smith cited the Angels' poor record and the team being unable to "fill seats" despite having Ohtani on their team. Many supporters flooded the social media posts with corrections on how much money the Angels made directly from Ohtani, with some saying that Smith should never talk about baseball.

Smith's first pitch surely won't help him get in the good graces of those fans, but it may provide some comedic relief in the meantime.
