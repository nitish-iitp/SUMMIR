Yankee Stadium

The New York Yankee Stadium, one of the most important stadiums in the major leagues, has a capacity for 46,000 spectators and was inaugurated on April 2, 2009. It will be the venue for this series between the Yankees and the Arizona Diamondbacks, where it will surely have a very good attendance, because despite not doing well this season, the fans are not abandoning their teams at the end of the regular season and without playoff possibilities.

Background

The record does not have a favourite at the moment, as they have met 10 times, leaving a record of 5 wins for the New York Yankees, while the Arizona Diamondbacks have also won 5 times, so tomorrow there will be no favourite for the first game of this series, it is expected to be a series full of intensity, many runs and emotions.

How are the Arizona Diamondbacks doing?

For its part Arizona Diamondbacks comes sweeping in its series to San Francisco and be in the fight for a wild card ticket as it looks very difficult to win their division who is led by the Los Angeles Dodgers, Arizona is with a record of 81 games won and 72 games lost, no doubt we expect a very special series with historically strong teams in the big leagues, thus the two teams come to a series in the regular season of the MLB 2023.

How are the New York Yankees doing?

The New York Yankees today close their series against the Blue Jays, which they have already lost because they have two consecutive defeats, they will look to close their series in the best way so that tomorrow they will open a new series against the Arizona Diamondbacks, teams that are strong in their wild card aspirations, They are tied in their record with 76 games won and 76 games lost and with little chance of playoffs but with every intention of closing in the best way this regular season that was certainly not the best for the team of the bronx, in this way come the New York Yankees.
