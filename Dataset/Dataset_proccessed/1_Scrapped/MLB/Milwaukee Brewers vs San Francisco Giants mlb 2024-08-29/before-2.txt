The first live action on ESPN arrives on the evening of Friday 23 August, as Sheffield Wednesday host Leeds United in an EFL Championship clash (21:00 LIVE on ESPN), and the English football action continues on the afternoon of Saturday 24 August with a battle between Hull City and Millwall (13:30 LIVE on ESPN).

Millwall manager Neil Harris is hopeful to add some quality in attack before the transfer window closes: "We know where we need to recruit. We’ve talked about it all summer. But we also have to be respectful to the level we’re at and it’s always been the hardest position to recruit, in the top line, because that’s where the demand is and the finances are.

“I know the recruitment guys are working extremely hard and they want to deliver the players to me they feel we need [...] ultimately we have to be patient and work with what we’ve got in the building. A lot of the players did exceptionally well for me at the end of last season so I’m really happy with the group we’ve got.”

Saturday night brings an Eredivisie match between Almere and reigning champions PSV Eindhoven (20:00 LIVE on ESPN),before the morning of Sunday 25 August features a trio of games from Major League Soccer (MLS): Minnesota United v Seattle Sounders, Sporting Kansas City v Orlando City and Los Angeles Galaxy v Atlanta United (00:30, 02:30, 04:30 LIVE on ESPN).

Sunday afternoon will bring more Eredivisie action, as the derby between Sparta Rotterdam and Feyenoord is played at 'Het Kasteel' (14:30 LIVE on ESPN), while the evening of Wednesday 28 August features a Major League Baseball (MLB) regular season game between the Cleveland Guardians v Kansas City Royals (19:10 LIVE on ESPN).

ESPN 2 will begin its live coverage for the week with action from the National Football League (NFL) Preseason, with the Cincinnati Bengals taking on the Indianapolis Colts (02:00 LIVE on ESPN 2), while the afternoon of Saturday 24 August features Rangers v Ross County from the Scottish Premiership (16:00 LIVE on ESPN 2).

Saturday evening brings more NFL Preseason games, with the Baltimore Ravens visiting the Green Bay Packers (19:00 LIVE on ESPN 2), before the Dallas Cowboys look to wrangle the Los Angeles Chargers (22:00 LIVE on ESPN 2).

Sunday 25 August features Scottish Premiership action between St Mirren and Celtic (13:00 LIVE on ESPN 2), an EFL Championship Welsh derby between Swansea City and Cardiff City (16:00 LIVE on ESPN 2), and an evening NFL battle between the New Orleans Saints and the Tennessee Titans (20:00 LIVE on ESPN 2).

Titans head coach Brian Callahan has explained that the team will be without wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins for a few weeks due to a knee injury, allowing Treylon Burks to get more playing time in the build-up to the regular season.

"It’s a chance for guys to get more opportunities and you get to see what they’re going to make of them. Treylon’s probably the one that benefits the most at that position,” Callahan explained.

“We’re going to get some looks at him as a starting receiver for us when D-Hop’s out. So I’m excited about that. When you get opportunities to see guys do more. I think Trey’s had a really nice camp. We’ve seen good things and now we’re going to get the chance to see more."

The morning of Monday 26 August brings the final NFL Preseason game of the week, with the New England Patriots testing themselves against the Washington Commanders (02:00 LIVE on ESPN 2), while the evening of Thursday 29 August features the Milwaukee Brewers v San Francisco Giants in MLB (20:10 LIVE on ESPN 2).
