The Greatest Right-Handed Pitchers of All Time

Posted by Brett Baker on September 15, 2023

In a 1999 commercial, Atlanta Braves pitchers Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine famously proclaimed “Chicks dig the long ball” after watching adoring fans fawn over Mark McGwire’s batting practice home runs. And while that may be true, every baseball fan knows that a good pitcher can neutralize those long ball hitters. After all, McGwire had more than twice as many strikeouts as home runs in his career. Even though great power hitters like Babe Ruth may receive more adoration, baseball history is filled with players whose main skill was keeping Ruth and his ilk from getting on base. Whether throwing the ball by a hitter – with brute speed or a sweeping break – or locating a pitch so precisely or varying its speed just enough to throw off a hitter’s timing and cause light contact, pitchers have found ways to get outs. Here are 10 of the greatest right-handed pitchers in baseball history, according to WAR, presented alphabetically.

Some pitchers achieve greatness with exceptional performance over a limited period of time, and others do it by maintaining better-than-averageness for many years. Blyleven falls into the second category of players. A two-time All-Star and three-time top-4 Cy Young finisher, Blyleven maintained a 3.01 ERA over his first 16 seasons. Blyleven led the league in WAR twice, but somehow never finished higher than 13th in MVP voting. He’s 5th in career strikeouts.

The list of 300-game winners with a career ERA below 3.00 is short … 12 pitchers. And the list of those pitchers who began their career after the end of the Dead Ball Era is even shorter: one. Only Tom Seaver. In addition to winning three Cy Young awards, Seaver had four other top-5 finishes. The 12-time All-Star led the league in strikeouts five times and won three ERA titles. Of pitchers with 4000+ career innings pitched, only Nolan Ryan and Randy Johnson allowed fewer hits per nine innings than Seaver’s 7.5. Numbers like that are why he was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame with 98.8% of votes.

ERA

The man so good that they named the pitching award after him, Denton True (Cy) Young is still the all-time AL/NL leader in a number of categories, more than 100 years after his final game: innings pitched (7,356), games started (815), complete games (749), wins (511), and batters faced (29,565). On the flipside, he’s also the all-time leader in losses (315), earned runs (2,147), and hits allowed (7,092). He had 16 seasons of at least 300 innings pitched.

The list of greatest right-handed pitchers is an impressive group. Whether pitching in the pre-1920 Dead Ball Era, or the late 20th and early 21st century, or the decades in between, the pitchers on the list above accumulated more WAR than all of the other right-handed pitchers in the history of baseball. Some were hard throwers … some were soft tossers … but all of them were effective!

Who is the greatest MLB pitcher of all time?

Cy Young is maybe the greatest MLB pitcher of all time according to a number of statistics. He leads all AL/NL pitchers in WAR (165.6), Wins (511), IP (7,356), and complete games (749). Roger Clemens has the highest WAR (138.7) of any pitcher in the Modern Era (after 1920).

Who holds the record for the most career strikeouts as a pitcher?

Nolan Ryan is the all-time leader in career strikeouts in the AL/NL with 5,714. With 3,509 career strikeouts, Walter Johnson retired as the all-time career strikeout leader and remained so for 62 seasons until Ryan broke it in 1983. After briefly trading spots with Steve Carlton, Nolan Ryan reestablished the record the following year and has led ever since.

Who is the greatest active MLB pitcher?

Justin Verlander leads all active MLB pitchers in career WAR (81). Clayton Kershaw (76.5) and Max Scherzer (74.5) are not far behind Verlander.
