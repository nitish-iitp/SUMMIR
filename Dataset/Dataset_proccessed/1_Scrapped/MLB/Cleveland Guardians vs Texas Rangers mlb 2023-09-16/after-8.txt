CLEVELAND — In search of bullpen reinforcements, the Texas Rangers recalled left-handed pitcher Jake Latz from Triple-A Round Rock on Saturday. Veteran right-handed pitcher Ian Kennedy was placed on the 60-day injured list with a right rotator cuff strain in a corresponding roster move.

Latz, 27, has a 4.10 ERA in 63.2 innings pitched in Triple-A this season. He’s pitched almost exclusively out of the bullpen (46 appearances, five starts), though he came up through the Rangers’ system as a starter. Texas drafted Latz in the fifth round of the 2017 MLB Draft out of Kent State.

Since the start of July, Latz has a 1.25 ERA in 36 innings with Round Rock, and 29 strikeouts to 15 walks.

He made his MLB debut on Aug. 25, 2021 with the Rangers, and pitched 4 and 2/3 innings of three-run ball against the Cleveland Guardians.

Kennedy, 38, had a 7.16 ERA in 16 and 1/3 innings pitched for the Rangers this season. He was on Texas’ Opening Day roster, was designated for assignment on May 11 and signed to a minor league contract on June 13. He was recalled from Round Rock on Sep. 5 and pitched in five games.
