Rangers catcher Austin Hedges breaks down the art of position player pitching: ‘Lob it’

CLEVELAND — There are two rules to pitching as a position player, Austin Hedges says.

The first: don’t try to be something that you aren’t.

The second: make it snappy.

“My mindset is to throw strikes and make it happen as quick as possible, get that inning over with,” the Rangers’ backup catcher-turned-emergency relief pitcher said on Saturday. “As much fun as it seems like someone might have, if I’m pitching, that means we didn’t do our job as a team and a lot of guys are probably not having a great day.”

Hedges — much to the chagrin of manager Bruce Bochy, who’s strongly opposed to trotting out a position player to pitch — has had an ample amount of opportunities to consider these things of late.

The 31-year-old pitched a perfect eighth inning in the Rangers’ 12-3 loss to the Cleveland Guardians on Friday night at Progressive Field. It was his fourth blowout-induced relief appearance in the Rangers’ last 20 games: he also pitched one inning vs. the Minnesota Twins on Aug. 28, then appeared in back-to-back games vs. the Houston Astros on Sep. 5-6.

He has a 4.91 ERA in 3 and 2/3 innings pitched with five hits, a home run and one strikeout. On Friday, he became the franchise’s single-season record holder for pitching appearances as a position player, and he tied Charlie Culberson for the most all-time in team history.

“Yesterday was a little bit more fun because a lot of my boys are in [the Cleveland dugout] so it was a little different,” said Hedges, who spent three seasons with the Guardians from 2020-22. “But the other times — even last night — it’s not my time to shine.”

Hence his repertoire and approach.

“I’m trying to lob it in there, and try and get guys out as quickly as possible,” Hedges said.

Hedges threw nine “fastballs” on Friday night with an average velocity of 52.4 miles per hour, a low of 44.5 and a high of 74.1, per Baseball Savant. He induced two flyouts and a pop-out with his batting practice-style tosses and, most importantly given the situation, kept the Rangers from diving deeper into their bullpen.

Of his nine looping meatballs, five were hit — three into play and two into foul territory — and another four were balls.

“I’ve realized in watching enough position players throw that if you try and pitch at all, you’re going to get whacked,” Hedges said. “It’s about throwing it under the hitting speed.”
