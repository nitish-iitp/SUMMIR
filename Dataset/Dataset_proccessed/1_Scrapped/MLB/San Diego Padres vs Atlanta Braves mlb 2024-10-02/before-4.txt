On Tuesday, October 1 and Wednesday, October 2, ABC is set to preempt “General Hospital” due to the network’s coverage of Major League Baseball Wildcard Series Games (Postseason), which will also be broadcast on ESPN.

“General Hospital” will be fully preempted on the East Coast and the West Coast on both days of postseason coverage while “GMA3: What You Need to Know” will air at a special time, 2:00 p.m. PT, on the West Coast. Meanwhile, “The View” will air without interruption on both coasts.

Original episodes of “General Hospital” are currently set to air on Monday, September 30; Thursday, October 3; and Friday, October 4.

Should it be deemed necessary, ABC is preparing to again preempt “General Hospital” on Thursday, October 3. The network will decide on the matter as early as the evening of Wednesday, October 2.

Teams currently set to play during ABC and ESPN’s coverage include the Kansas City Royals, Detroit Tigers, Milwaukee Brewers, Baltimore Orioles, Houston Astros, San Diego Padres, and either the New York Mets or Atlanta Braves, which have a doubleheader postseason-determining game scheduled for Monday, September 30.

I saw Tuesday was pre-empted, when I was going through my DVR set. Praying we don't get a second pre-emption, 'cause I am dying to see Van Hansis as Lucas on Friday.

Wild Card game 1 - 3.2 million viewers

Wild Card game 2 - 3.0 million viewers

Compared to GH's  1.8 million viewers

Yikes that makes GH's ratings look even worse. ABC can think "Oh hey, sports does better than our only soap, we should look into that"

Sports does better than anything on TV now. They likely know those ratings will not be repeated by anything else.
