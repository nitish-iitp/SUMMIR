Major League Baseball’s (MLB) Milwaukee Brewers have named Northwestern Mutual as their new jersey patch partner in an expanded sponsorship agreement. 

Contract:
Northwestern Mutual’s logo to feature on the sleeve of Brewers players’ jerseys
Financial terms were undisclosed but both parties confirmed it is a multi-year deal beyond the end of this season
Northwestern Mutual becomes the Brewers’ official financial planning partner
Financial services firm gains additional advertising in the Brewers’ ballpark, on TV and in digital spaces, and will partner with the franchise on a community programme
Context:

Northwestern Mutual already has naming rights for a luxury suite section at the Brewers’ home ballpark. With this deal, the Brewers become the 15th MLB franchise to secure a jersey patch partner.

Comment:

“From our perspective, it had to check a number of boxes,” Rick Schlesinger, Brewers president of business operations.

“We really wanted a local partner, an iconic brand and a local partner that has a great reputation. And you wanted a long-standing brand, not somebody you worry about ‘Are they going to be around in two years?’ [Northwestern Mutual] has been around for 165 years and is a signature company.”

Coming next:

The Brewers debuted the new patch against the Washington Nationals and are next in action this week against the St Louis Cardinals.
