Danny Masterson, the American actor and DJ, boasts a net worth of $8 million, jointly held with his wife, actress Bijou Phillips. He's best known for portraying Hyde in the hit sitcom "That '70s Show," featuring in all 200 episodes from 1998 to 2006. Beyond that, Masterson starred in "The Ranch" and dabbled in DJing under the alias 'DJ Mom Jeans.'

In 2017, Masterson's reputation took a hit when he faced multiple rape allegations from three women. By 2020, he faced formal charges of three counts of rape. On May 31, 2023, Masterson was found guilty on two of the three charges, each carrying a potential 15-year prison sentence. He officially received this 30-year sentence on September 7, 2023.

Born on March 13, 1976, in Long Island, New York, Danny began his entertainment journey at a young age, starting as a child model at four and eventually branching into musicals and acting by the age of eight. Notably, he appeared in over 100 commercials for various brands before his sixteenth birthday.

How much he made in 'That 70's Show'?

Masterson's career milestones included roles in "Beethoven's 2nd," the sitcom "Cybill," and the transformative role of Hyde in "That '70s Show." Post-"That '70s Show," he diversified his acting portfolio with appearances in "Punk'd," "MADtv," and the 2008 film "Yes Man" alongside Jim Carrey. His partnership with Bijou Phillips extended to the 2009 film "The Bridge to Nowhere," followed by roles in "White Collar," "The Chicago 8," and a significant stint in "The Ranch" from 2016 to 2018.

Masterson, who played the character of Steven Hyde in 'That 70's Show', was among the highest-paid actors on the show. According to reports, the main actors were earning between $250,000 and $300,000 per episode.

Masterson's personal life revolves around his dedication to the Church of Scientology. In 2005, he began a relationship with fellow Scientologist Bijou Phillips, culminating in marriage in 2011 and the birth of their first child in 2014.

Masterson's real estate ventures included a Hollywood Hills home tied to his legal battles. He eventually relocated to Santa Ynez in Santa Barbara County, renting out his Hollyridge Drive residence. Despite legal disputes surrounding his home financing, Danny sold his Hollyridge Drive home for $6.2 million in December 2021, marking another chapter in his tumultuous journey.
