Solid in first start of season
Beck took the no decision Saturday against the Cardinals, he allowed one run on four hits and two walks while striking out three over four innings.
Impact Beck got his first start since September 2023 and looked impressive in the opportunity. It was Beck's longest outing of the season, and he finishes the season on a good note. Beck made his season debut in September after missing the majority of the season with an aneurysm in his upper right arm that required surgery. The 28-year-old allowed just three runs in 16 innings this season.

Solid in first start of season
Beck took the no-decision Saturday against the Cardinals, as he allowed one run on four hits and two walks while striking out three over four innings.
Impact Beck got his first start in place of Blake Snell, Beck's first since September 2023, and he looked impressive in the opportunity. It was Beck's longest outing of the season, and he finishes the season on a positive note. Beck made his season debut in September after missing the majority of the season with an aneurysm in his upper right arm that required surgery. The 28-year-old allowed just three runs in 16 innings this season.

Makes return from 60-day IL
The Giants reinstated Beck (arm) from the 60-day injured list Sunday.
Impact Beck will join the big club for the first time all season after completing his recovery from surgery to address an upper right arm aneurysm, which cropped up during spring training. The right-hander got stretched out to 56 pitches and three innings over his five minor-league rehab outings, so he be an option for the rotation if the Giants elect to expand to six men at some point in September. For the time being, however, Beck will likely serve as a multi-inning reliever.

Improved form in fifth rehab start
Beck (arm) made the fifth start of his rehab assignment Wednesday with Triple-A Sacramento, striking out five over three innings while giving up one earned run on two hits and one...
Impact After retiring just five batters while giving up seven runs (six earned) his last time out with Sacramento on Friday, Beck bounced back nicely Wednesday, giving up just one extra-base hit (a solo home run) and spotting 29 of his 41 pitches for strikes. He's now thrown exactly three innings in four of his rehab outings and hasn't thrown more than 56 pitches on any occasion, so the Giants may envision him serving as a multi-inning reliever in September rather than being an option for the rotation. Beck has been on the injured list all season with an upper right arm aneurysm that he addressed through surgery March 4.

Makes third rehab appearance
Beck (arm) struck out four and allowed four earned runs on five hits and no walks over three innings in his most recent rehab start Sunday with Triple-A Sacramenot.
Impact Beck has now covered three innings in each of his three rehab starts with Sacramento, logging 5.00 ERA, 1.44 WHIP and 11:1 K:BB. According to MLB.com, Beck is scheduled to make his next start for Sacramento on Friday and is likely to work 4-to-5 innings. Though Beck appears to be getting stretched out for a traditional starting role as he works his way back from an the upper right arm aneurysm that he had addressed surgically in early March, the Giants likely won't have a spot available in the rotation for the right-hander once he completes his rehab assignment.

Set for rehab outing Tuesday
Beck (arm) will throw three innings in his rehab appearance with Triple-A Sacramento on Tuesday, Alex Pavlovic of NBC Sports Bay Area reports.
Impact Beck continues to work his way back from surgery on March 3 to address an upper right arm aneurysm. He made his first rehab outing Thursday, when he allowed one run on four hits while striking out four across three innings. If Beck does end up returning to the majors this season, he'll likely work out of the Giants' bullpen rather than the starting rotation.

Ready for rehab assignment
Beck (arm) is scheduled to begin a rehab assignment Thursday with Triple-A Sacramento, Alex Pavlovic of NBC Sports Bay Area reports.
Impact Beck is finally ready for his first game action of 2024 after he was diagnosed early in spring training with an aneurysm in his upper right arm that required vascular surgery. He was cleared to resume throwing in early May and had been building up slowly over the last three months, but the Giants evidently came away encouraged with how he fared since he resumed facing hitters. Though Beck had been in line to compete for a rotation spot heading into the spring, he'll prepare for a relief role while he's on his rehab assignment. Beck has two minor-league options remaining, so the Giants could opt to keep him with Sacramento upon activating him from the 60-day injured list if they aren't satisfied with his results during his rehab assignment.

Throws extended side session
Beck (arm) threw a 40-pitch bullpen session at Oracle Park on Sunday, MLB.com reports.
Impact Assuming Beck checked out fine following the extended side session, the Giants could clear him to resume facing hitters when the club reconvenes following the All-Star break. Beck has been on the shelf all season after he was diagnosed with an aneurysm in his upper right arm in spring training that necessitated surgery March 4. Though he was cleared for full baseball activities May 1, Beck has been building up slowly and is still likely multiple weeks away from returning from the 60-day injured list. With both Robbie Ray (elbow) and Alex Cobb (hip/shoulder) further along in their throwing programs and poised to beat him back from the IL to bolster the Giants' rotation depth, Beck will likely be ticketed for the bullpen once he's eventually activated.

Throws bullpen session
Beck (arm) completed bullpen session Monday, MLB.com reports.
Impact Beck was cleared to resume full baseball activities May 1, but the Giants have been having him proceed cautiously with his ramp-up program after he required surgery March 3 to address an upper right arm aneurysm. After weeks of steadily increasing his throwing distance off flat ground, Beck was finally cleared to advance to mound work. Given the pace of his rehab thus far, Beck wouldn't seem likely to make it back from the 60-day injured list until after the All-Star break.

Pitches well Saturday
Beck allowed a run on six hits and a walk while striking out three over five innings in a no-decision versus the Dodgers.
Impact Beck put together a strong outing against a tough opponent, limiting the damage to a Mookie Betts RBI single in the fifth inning. This was just the third start of the year for Beck, who often worked as a piggyback option or a long reliever in his first big-league campaign. The rookie ends the campaign with a 3.92 ERA, 1.22 WHIP and 68:21 K:BB as well as a 3-3 record, two saves, two holds and a blown save over 33 appearances spanning 85 innings. The right-hander should enter 2024 with a chance to win a spot in the Giants' rotation.

Scheduled to start Saturday
Beck is scheduled to start Saturday's game against the Dodgers, Alex Pavlovic of NBC Sports Bay Area reports.
Impact It'll be a traditional start for the 27-year-old right-hander, who has largely been operating in a piggyback relief role. Beck owns a 4.05 ERA, 1.21 WHIP and 65:20 K:BB through his first 80 major-league innings this season with San Francisco.
