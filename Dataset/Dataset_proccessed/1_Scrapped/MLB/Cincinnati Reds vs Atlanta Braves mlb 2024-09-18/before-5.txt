The group stage of the Women’s Concacaf Champions Cup on Wednesday when Tigres UANL takes on Frazsiers Whip FC. Tigres got off to a great start in its first group match as it whipped CF Monterrey 4-0 on August 22nd. It got three goals in the first half by Maricarmen Reyes, Jennifer Hermoso Fuentes and Thembi Kgatlana to take control of the match. Cristina Ferral added an insurance goal in the 71st minute and Tigres cruised to the victory. The win has Tigres in a tie for first place in Groiup A with Gotham, Alajuelense and CF Monterrey. Alajuelense and Monterrey, though, have both played two matches. Tigres can put itself at the top of the group with a win on Wednesday over a Frazsiers team that struggled in its first two matches.
