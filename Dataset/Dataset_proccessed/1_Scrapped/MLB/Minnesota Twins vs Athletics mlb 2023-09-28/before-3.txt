I got my dream Dachshund as a pet but after seven years he turned on me and starting biting my family - is this normal?
Mum wants to rehome her Dachshund
The dog bit her and her husband
READ MORE: From apartment dwellers, to young families, here's the ultimate guide to choosing a dog from the vets who know best

A mum has pleaded for help after her seven-year-old Dachshund started biting her and her husband and she fears what the dog could do to her young children. 

The woman, from Victoria, said her Dachshund, Pablo, bit her husband on the face so badly he had to get five stitches after never having displayed the behaviour in the years the family has owned him. 

She wants to rehome the dog as she worries Pablo will injure her four-year-old or nine-month-old however her husband refuses. 

Desperate for a solution, the mum has spoken to an animal behaviourist as well as a vet who even brought up possibly euthanising the dog for its sudden problematic biting. 

Sydney veterinarian Dr Tim Montgomery told FEMAIL there could be a number of factors at play but recommended the concerned mum try to understand why the dog could be feeling like it suddenly needs to bite.

'We have had a dachshund for almost seven years, recently he has bitten. First it was me approaching him on the bed with my husband (who seems to be the dog's 'chosen one'),' she wrote in a Facebook post. 

'Second it was my husband's face after being picked up running out of the laundry and being carried back in. He started growling at my hubby and my hubby put his hand on his mouth.'

She said the dog 'launched' at her husband's face when he removed his hand and he had to be admitted to hospital and given five stitches. 

Dr Tim said he did not recommend covering a dog's face or even punishing them if they are growling. 

'While dogs can't use words they do speak to us all the time. Educating families on dog body language is critical for managing these situations well,' he said. 

'Many people feel they should punish a growl because it's a 'bad' behaviour however a dog has only a few limited ways to tell us they need space and a growl is one of them.'

'Contrary to popular belief we should reward a growl by giving the dog what they want - and that's usually space.' 

The mum expressed her concern over the safety of her young son and baby who is about to start crawling. 

'I want him gone, rehomed (we have him on Dachshund Rescue Australia on private sale) but I am being strangely shut down by my husband who has a very strong bond with him,' she said. 

'I am worried everyday for the safety of my children, I am being told I am overreacting.'

Dr Tim, who works with many families who have pets with challenging behaviour problems, said he sympathises with the mum's worries but cannot determine the root of the change without knowing more details.     

'I completely understand why she would be concerned. It can be important to avoid bites between dogs and children,' he said. 

'I usually I don't see it as my place to tell families how much risk they should take, this is ultimately a personal decision, however I always try and work with them to identify the risk as well as strategies to mitigate it.'

The 33-year-old said there may be some underlying conditions that could have the dog feeling uncomfortable or anxious.    

'In a dog of seven years of age without prior history of biting the family, there's quite a long list of possible explanations,' he said. 

'Many pet parents can be surprised to learn the behaviours are rooted in some source of pain including arthritis or dental pain along with a long-standing anxiety disorder.'

The dog owner has taken Pablo to their vet who said the dog is perfectly healthy and even mentioned euthanasia as an option if the behaviour persists but the mum was hesitant to take such drastic action. 

'In the case she's already visited the vet, my usual next step would be complete blood testing followed by a long discussion to unpack the dog's past and any early warning signs of anxious or fearful behaviour,' Dr Tim said. 

'Depending on the prognosis - how likely it is for the unwanted behaviour to be managed - there may be combination of medication and environmental and behavioural strategies that could improve things for the dog and manage the risk for the humans.'

What do you think the family should do with Pablo?

Rehome him
Euthanise him
Work with a vet to find out what's wrong

Pablo's owners have also spoken to a behaviourist who told them 'the dog must feel bad and (they) need to ensure he feels good'. 

The parents have tried to work out how to keep the dog separated from their children by keeping him in the laundry with their other dog, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and a 'big warm bed'. 

However the four-year-old has a habit of 'opening doors all day' letting Pablo loose. 

'We don't have another suitable space for the dogs and can't fence them off without being cruel. We have a HUGE backyard and the dog is very active during the day,' the mum said. 

'(The behaviourist) also said to keep the dog off the bed, hubby has not (conformed) to this. I merely say 'Pablo' from a distance in a kind voice and he growls instantly from the bed.' 

Dr Tim encouraged owners to look at what could be causing the biting and the 'emotional state' of the pet rather than solely on the problem behaviour. 

'Put yourself in the dog's paws - how must he be feeling in order to respond with these behaviours? That feeling is the problem, the behaviour is simply the strategy this dog has adopted to cope with the feeling,' he explained. 

'I agree focusing on the feeling is the right place to start - a behaviour like biting is a last resort for most dogs when they're feeling very worried, vulnerable or uncomfortable.'

He added euthanasia may be an option for some but would only recommend it as a 'last resort'.  

'It's not usually something I would immediately discuss except where there was high level risk that couldn't be managed any other way,' he said.
