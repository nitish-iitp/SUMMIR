A Labour Day shooting claimed the life of a man outside his home in south Etobicoke.

Neighbours say the victim, who they called “Steve,” 35, was in construction by trade, had built his house at 3 Bonnyview Dr. a few years ago, and was having a small pool party with about a half-dozen people before the shooting.

Next-door neighbour Simer Singh, who has lived in the Parklawn Rd.-The Queensway area neighbourhood for the last six years with her husband and two kids, said she heard three gunshots. She recalled going outside and seeing he had been gunned down at his doorway while taking out the garbage.

“This neighbourhood is really safe,” said Simer. “Parties used to happen a lot (with) Steve and his friends. And they used to go on Airbnb, as well.

“And there was a lot of cars coming in and out,” she added. “It was a very quiet street before they came and before the house was built. He, himself, was a good guy. My kids, from the backyard, they would talk and say, ‘Hi Steve.’ I knew him as a neighbour like cutting grass, and chit chat, but he seemed to be very polite, very friendly. We never had any issues with him.”

When paramedics arrived, they took him down to the driveway where dried blood could still be seen on Tuesday morning.

“When the ambulance guys arrived, they brought him down,” said Simer’s husband, Amitpal Singh.

“I heard his girlfriend shouting and screaming and (asking) for help, saying that he’d been shot. It’s shocking. It’s sad … because he was a lovely person.

“He was very friendly. He was very nice. Very soft spoken,” he added. “He was good with the kids, as well. He had two cats they played with.”

Toronto Police reported the shooting happened around 11:50 p.m. and that officers “located the victim and provided life-saving measures.” The victim was taken to hospital, where he died.

Neighbour Maxine Brandes, who lives down the street from the shooting scene, said she cried after finding outA “Steve” had died.

Brandes was in her home when she heard three gunshots and came outside and watched police and paramedics arrive.

“(I don’t) feel so good,” said Brandes, who recalled getting a few rides from “Steve” to the subway..

“I couldn’t sleep last night. (It’s) unnerving. (He was) a nice guy. I wish he wasn’t dead. I cried. And a mother is not supposed to bury their son. And his girlfriend, I heard her crying, that’s how I know maybe he died.

“She was crying and saying, ‘Don’t leave me! Don’t leave me!'”

Police urged anyone with information to call 416-808-2200. No suspect information has been released.
