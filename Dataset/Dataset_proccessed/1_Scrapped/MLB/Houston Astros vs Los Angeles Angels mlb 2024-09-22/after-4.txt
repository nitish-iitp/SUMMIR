With only six games remaining in Major League Baseball’s regular season, the Houston Astros can potentially clinch the American League West division with just one win over their next three games against the Seattle Mariners.

Unfortunately, the ‘Stros may have to do so without one of their best players, as Yordan Alvarez left Sunday’s game against the Angels with an apparent knee injury. It is still unclear as to how serious the injury is and whether it will keep Alvarez out for any extended time.

Meanwhile, the Houston Texans took their first loss of the NFL season at the hands of the Minnesota Vikings, putting on a generally miserable performance that only garnered one touchdown in the 34-7 beatdown.

Between the multitude of penalties, lack of running game, and no real answers against Vikings DC Brian Flores’ defensive packages, are there things the team can learn from their ugliest loss under coach DeMeco Ryans?

In the audio above, Craig Cohen talks with Houston Press writer and Bleav in Astros podcast host Jeff Balke about the Astros, the Texans, and some recent buzz on the potential prospects of WNBA and NHL franchises returning to Houston.
