Avoids arbitration
Vest and the Tigers agreed to a one-year, $1.4 million contract Thursday to avoid arbitration, Evan Petzold of the Detroit Free Press reports.
Impact Vest enjoyed a career-best season out of the Detroit bullpen in 2024, turning in a 2.82 ERA, 1.12 WHIP and 63:18 K:BB in 70.1 innings while gathering three wins, two saves and 14 holds. The Tigers' closing situation isn't settled heading into 2025, but Vest likely won't be manager A.J. Hinch's top choice for save situations and is expected to continue seeing the bulk of his opportunities in the seventh and eighth innings.

Earns rare save Wednesday
Vest retired the final two batters of Wednesday's 4-2 win over the Royals, including one by strikeout, to record the save.
Impact This was Vest's first save since Aug. 11 and just his second of the season, but it was a critical one, as the Tigers moved within a half game of a playoff spot with a big win against a division rival. The righty reliever is behind Jason Foley and Tyler Holton in the bullpen pecking order for Detroit, though Vest has been a steady presence with a 3.02 ERA this year across 65.2 innings of relief.

Earns hold Sunday
Vest tossed 1.2 scoreless innings of relief to earn a hold in Sunday's 4-1 win over the Red Sox. He struck out one.
Impact Vest continues to be a reliable bullpen option for the Tigers with a 3.05 ERA across 59 innings this season to go along with nine holds, which is second on the team. The veteran has four of those holds dating back to the beginning of August as well as his first and only save of the season on Aug. 11. Jason Foley and Tyler Holton are the top closing options in Detroit, though Vest has proven himself capable of handling high-leverage work.

Lands on paternity list
The Tigers placed Vest on the paternity list Monday.
Impact Vest will now miss a maximum of three games while away from the team. Across 57 outings this season, Vest has registered one save and eight holds with a 3.20 ERA and 1.26 WHIP across 56.1 innings. Right-hander Mason Englert was recalled from Triple-A Toledo in a corresponding move.

Secures win Friday
Vest (3-4) tossed 1.1 scoreless innings of relief to earn the win in Friday's 5-2 victory over the White Sox. He allowed one hit.
Impact Vest came on with two outs in the bottom of the sixth inning, then worked through the seventh inning as well to earn the win when the Tigers scored twice in the top half to break a 2-2 tie. The veteran righty is having another solid season with a 3.11 ERA across 55 innings of relief. Vest is getting high-leverage work, though Jason Foley is seeing the bulk of the save opportunities for the Tigers, including in Friday's contest.

Secures first save
Vest worked around a walk to pitch a scoreless ninth inning and secure the save in Sunday's 5-4 win over the Giants. He struck out one.
Impact Vest blew a save in his last appearance Thursday when he allowed two runs while retiring only two batters. The veteran righty bounced back with a better performance Sunday to earn his first save of the season. Jason Foley leads Detroit with 15 saves but he wasn't used in Sunday's game after last pitching on Friday. Six players on the Tigers now have saves this year after Vest recorded his first, making this a murky bullpen at best currently.

Blows save, takes loss Thursday
Vest (2-4) retired two batters via strikeout but also allowed two runs on two hits and a walk to blow the save and take the loss Thursday against the Mariners.
Impact Detroit's top closing option, Jason Foley, had pitched each of the previous two games, so the Tigers turned to Vest on Thursday. The righty struggled as he blew his fifth save chance of the season. Vest still has a solid 3.16 ERA overall, and he should continue to see high-leverage work, but the back end of Detroit's bullpen remains murky. Foley is probably still the arm to own, but Vest, Tyler Holton and Shelby Miller are all candidates to see save opportunities moving forward.

Earns win in wild game
Vest (2-3) tossed a scoreless inning of relief to earn the win in Saturday's 11-9, 10-inning victory over the Dodgers. He walked one and struck out one.
Impact Vest was the last of six Detroit pitchers to appear in the contest, and he calmly navigated the top of the 10th inning on 12 pitches before Gio Urshela ended the game with a walk-off homer in the bottom half. The veteran righty has been solid once again this season with a 3.27 ERA and 36 strikeouts across 41.1 innings. Vest should continue to work in a high-leverage setup role for the Tigers ahead of Jason Foley, though it's a fairly fluid bullpen, and Vest could see some save opportunities down the stretch if Foley stumbles.

Takes loss Tuesday
Vest (1-3) allowed two runs (one earned) on three hits over 1.1 innings of relief to take the loss Tuesday against the Guardians. He walked one and struck out one.
Impact Vest got the final out of the ninth inning but ran into some trouble in the 10th to take his third loss of the season and second this month. Despite the hiccup, the righty has been solid this year with a 3.43 ERA across 39.1 innings out of Detroit's bullpen. Vest should continue to work in a high-leverage role for the Tigers, though he's been clearly behind Jason Foley for save opportunities thus far.

Pitching well so far
Vest has logged 4.1 scoreless innings across four appearances to start the season. He's struck out four.
Impact The veteran righty has picked up where he left off last season. Vest recorded a 2.98 ERA and 1.10 WHIP across 48.1 innings in 2023, while striking out 56. It looks like he'll once again post good ratios with a decent amount of strikeouts if he keeps up his current form. Vest could also see some save opportunities in a fluid Detroit bullpen, though he's likely behind Alex Lange, Jason Foley and Shelby Miller in the pecking order.

Opening for bullpen game
Vest will serve as the Tigers' opening pitcher Saturday against the Guardians, Evan Woodbery of MLive.com reports.
Impact The Tigers are treating their penultimate game of the regular season as a bullpen day, with Vest unlikely to work more than an inning or two before giving way to a slew of relievers. Vest will be serving as an opener for the fourth time this season.

Struggles in first loss
Vest (2-1) allowed three runs (two earned) on two hits while retiring just a single batter to take the loss Friday against the Athletics.
Impact Starter Sawyer Gipson-Long allowed just one run across five innings, but Vest couldn't keep it up in the sixth. Part of the damage was a home run by Brent Rooker, which was just the third long ball allowed by Vest this season across 45.1 innings. The righty has been solid overall with a 3.18 ERA and 1.15 WHIP, and he should get a few more opportunities to pitch before the schedule wraps up.

Secures five-out save
Vest allowed a hit and struck out two over 1.2 innings to earn the save in Wednesday's 4-2 win over the Dodgers.
Impact Regular closer Alex Lange blew a save Tuesday and had pitched three of the last four days, while Vest was fresher. Vest threw 23 pitches (15 strikes) to get the last five outs of this contest for his second save this season. He's added 10 holds and two blown saves, and he's on an 11.2-inning scoreless streak. For the year, Vest has a 2.80 ERA, 1.11 WHIP and 52:13 K:BB across 45 innings.
