NEW YORK YANKEES

The New York Yankees are champions of the American League East for the second time in three seasons.

Having already secured a spot in the MLB playoffs, the Bronx Bombers clinched the division with a 10-1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on Thursday.

This being the Yankees, seasons aren't judged solely on whether or not they win the division. Hitting that benchmark alleviates some pressure on manager Aaron Boone, but USA Today's Bob Nightengale already reported that his future in the dugout could hinge on the team's playoff showing.

New York has endured a relatively up-and-down campaign for a team that hit 90-plus wins.

The team was riding high in the first half thanks to a 45-19 start. Then it started slumping and watched the Orioles claim a one-game lead in the AL East heading into the All-Star break.

The Yankees and Orioles were running neck and neck through the end of August, and it was only in September when New York began to create some breathing room.

Not only that, but it also asserted a claim to be the World Series favorite in a field without one candidate standing head and shoulders above the rest. While expectations are always through the roof in the Big Apple, this is a roster that warrants that kind of hype.

To that end, no player will shoulder a larger burden than Aaron Judge.

Beyond the fact that the 32-year-old hasn't won a World Series—pretty much a prerequisite to truly becoming a legendary figure in pinstripes—he hasn't really had a signature run in October, either. In 44 career playoff games, he has 13 home runs and a .211/.310/.462 slash line.

Juan Soto's impending free agency will be a subplot of New York's postseason as well. The 25-year-old has hit as good as he ever has over a full 162-game season and put himself in position for a massive payday this winter.

The reaction toward Soto within the fanbase and local press might be unforgiving if he doesn't help to get the Yankees over the top, though.
