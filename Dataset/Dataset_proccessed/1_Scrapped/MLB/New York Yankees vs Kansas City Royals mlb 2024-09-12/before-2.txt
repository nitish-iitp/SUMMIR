Red Sox Walk Off

The Red Sox hit a walk-off three-run homer in extra innings and that was enough for another key victory. Nick Pivetta got the start, and he went six innings, giving up four hits and one run. The Red Sox are averaging 4.76 runs, while their pitching is giving up 4.76 runs per game. The offense is ranked 8th in the league, while the pitching is ranked 24th. 

Rafael Devers has hit 28 home runs and driven in 81 RBIs. Getting the start for the Red Sox will be Cooper Criswell, who sits with a 6-4 record and an ERA of 4.11. In his last start against the Chicago White Sox, he went five innings giving up six hits and two runs. The Red Sox will face the Rays after this series.

Yankees Pick Up Key Win

The Yankees were tested on Wednesday against the Kansas City Royals, and they were able to secure the 4-3 victory in extra innings. Juan Soto has hit a home run and drove in two RBIs. The Yankees are averaging 5.03 runs, while their pitching is giving up 4.19 runs per game. The offense is ranked 2nd in the league, while the pitching is ranked 10th. Aaron Judge has hit 51 home runs and driven in 126 RBIs. Getting the start for the Yankees will be Nestor Cortes, who sits with a 9-10 record and an ERA of 3.97. In his last start against the Chicago Cubs, he went 4.1 innings, giving up zero hits and zero runs. The Yankees will take on the Mariners following this series.

Why the Yankees Will Beat the Red Sox
The Red Sox have lost each of their last five road games.
The Yankees have won nine of their last 10 games against the Red Sox following an extra-innings win.
The Red Sox have failed to cover the run line in each of their last four road games.
The Yankees have covered the run line in five of their last six games after going to extra innings.
Boston Red Sox vs New York Yankees Prediction

The Red Sox have confidence heading into this game, but that is going to be blown up here. Nestor Cortes Jr is coming off a strong start, and it’s going to be much of the same here. The Red Sox’s offense is going to really struggle to get any sort of offense going here and that is going to be the difference here as the Yankees are going to get the job done. Back the Yankees on the run line.
