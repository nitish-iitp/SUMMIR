Tampa Bay Rays vs Cleveland Guardians Prediction

I’ll lean toward the Guardians. I could probably go either way, though. Williams is going to need a bounce-back start if Cleveland is going to win. He’s coming off a loss to the Dodgers with five earned in 0.2 innings. Prior to that, Williams went 1-1 with three earned in 12.0 innings over two starts. On Wednesday the Guardians bagged 10 team hits, but also had three errors in the victory. The good news is that Cleveland only had one bad inning and the early exploits at the plate were enough to get a win. I like the Guardians to keep it up on Thursday.
