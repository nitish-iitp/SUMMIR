We’re very fortunate to consider Hall of Fame Coach Jim Leyland as a friend of the show, he checked in with us to preview the upcoming playoff series with Houston – and give some wonderful praise to current manager AJ Hinch.

To check out the entire conversation with Jim click here – but we definitely wanted to share Jim’s thoughts on AJ Hinch:

This is one of the greatest managerial jobs I’ve ever seen. I think that he did one of the greatest jobs I’ve ever seen in my 60 years of baseball. I mean, he used all the players. He kept them even keel. He kept him confident. He used everybody. He pinch hit. You know, the way he did the openers and his bullpen. I mean, it was, this is one of the best jobs I’ve ever seen done. Okay.

Jim also talked about the mindset of a manager in the playoffs and had rave reviews for the young talent on the team. 

How you feeling Tigers fans? 

I said it before and I’ll say it again – why not now? This is NOT a fluke. You don’t make a run like over the course of almost two months on a fluke. There’s a TON of quality players on this team that can hold their own with anyone. 

In my story about the 5 Reasons The Detroit Tigers can win the World Series, check out reason number five:

5. The “Cinderella Story” Vibe

Every great World Series run has that underdog team that shocks everyone, and Detroit has the potential to be that story. Is there a better story in baseball than the Tigers? (I’m waiting for the New York Times to write an article about the Tigers and the rebirth of Detroit…you know it’s coming). Did anyone REALLY think Texas would win it all last year? It can happen.

Bottom line. Jim Leyland is right. AJ Hinch has done an amazing job and this team is built to win now.
