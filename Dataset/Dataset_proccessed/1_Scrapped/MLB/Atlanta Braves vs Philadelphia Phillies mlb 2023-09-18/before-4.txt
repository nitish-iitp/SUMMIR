The Atlanta Falcons (2-0) managed to seal the victory against the Green Bay Packers (1-1) on Sunday at Mercedes-Benz Stadium thanks to rookie running back Bijan Robinson pulled off a shifty Madden-like move to pick up a new set of downs on 4th & INCHES late in the final frame.

Robinson, 21, racked up 124 rushing yards on 19 carries, but has yet to score a touchdown in his short NFL career. Despite not scoring, he has already cemented himself as a game-changer.

"Toy Story" magic NFL meets in innovative ESPN broadcastR.O.

The late-game djuke to pick up a first down was not the only time Robinson delivered some highlights.

Early in the second quarter, Robinson moved the chains by djuking nearly five defenders, leaving them on the ground by shifting left and right.

Robinson was selected eighth overall in the 2023 NFL Draft and is already proving his worth. Falcons won 25-24 thanks to the rookie's first-down conversion that kept the clock running and made the winning field goal easier to score.

Jordan Love shines for Packers once again

Packers quarterback Jordan Love made it a close game by recording back-to-back games with three touchdown passes and zero interceptions.

This time, Love's stellar play was not enough to give Green Bay the victory, but Packers fans will be happy with his 14-for-25 completed passes.
