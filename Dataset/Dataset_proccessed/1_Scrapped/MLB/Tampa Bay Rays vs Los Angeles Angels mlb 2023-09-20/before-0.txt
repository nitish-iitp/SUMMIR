Links up with Arizona
Andrus agreed to a minor-league contract with the Diamondbacks on Sunday that includes an invitation to major-league spring training, Jesse Friedman of GoPHNX.com reports.
Impact Andrus spent last season with the White Sox, and he was unable to secure a major-league contract for 2024 after he posted a .251/.304/.358 slash line with six homers and 12 steals in 112 contests. The 34-year-old should compete for a roster spot as a backup middle infielder.

Taking seat Thursday
Andrus is not in the lineup for Thursday's game versus the Diamondbacks.
Impact Andrus has been seeing most of the playing time at second base for the White Sox lately, but he'll yield to Lenyn Sosa for this one. The veteran infielder has collected a .674 OPS across 109 games for the Pale Hose this season.

Heads to bench
Andrus will sit Saturday against the Red Sox.
Impact Andrus has hit well down the stretch, slashing .347/.368/.521 over his last 33 games. He finds himself on the bench for the second time in three games, however, with the White Sox seemingly seeing no reason to give everyday at-bats to a 35-year-old on an expiring contract in a season that's long since gone off track. Lenyn Sosa will be Saturday's second baseman.
SEPTEMBER 23, 2023

ROTOWIRE
Sitting Wednesday
Andrus is not in Wednesday's lineup against the Nationals.
Impact Andrus has been productive lately when he's played, hitting .326 with one home run, four runs, six RBI and one steal in 14 games this month. Lenyn Sosa is manning the keystone and batting eighth.

Nabs fourth straight start
Andrus will start at second base and bat ninth in Monday's game in Washington, Daryl Van Schouwen of the Chicago Sun-Times reports.
Impact Andrus had appeared to move into a utility role toward the end of August, but he'll pick up his fourth consecutive start Monday and seems to have supplanted Lenyn Sosa as the White Sox's preferred option at the keystone. The 34-year-old is on an expiring deal and thus doesn't look to be a part of the White Sox's long-term plan in a non-contending season, but he's made it tough for manager Pedro Grifol to remove him from the lineup in recent weeks. Dating back to Aug. 1, Andrus has arguably been Chicago's top hitter overall, slashing .353/.375/.543 with four home runs and six stolen bases across a stretch of 33 games.

Racks up four hits
Andrus went 4-for-5 with a double in Wednesday's 6-4 win over the Royals.
Impact Andrus filled in atop the lineup and at shortstop with Tim Anderson (neck) scratched with neck stiffness shortly before the game. Over his last 15 games, Andrus has gone 23-for-56 (.411) with eight multi-hit efforts. The veteran infielder is slashing .256/.317/.361 with five home runs, 37 RBI, 35 runs scored and 11 stolen bases over 348 plate appearances. Andrus would likely continue to play at shortstop until Anderson is ready to return, at which point Andrus would resume a utility role.

Added to lineup Wednesday
Andrus was added to the lineup for Wednesday's game at Kansas City.
Impact The veteran infielder will cover shortstop and bat leadoff after Tim Anderson had to be scratched due to neck stiffness. Andrus went 2-for-4 with a run scored in Tuesday's loss to the Royals and is slashing .370/.400/.568 with three homers, 17 RBI, five steals and 14 runs over his last 22 games (85 plate appearances) dating back to Aug. 4.

Losing work to Sosa
Andrus is out of the lineup for Sunday's game against the Athletics.
Impact Andrus will end up taking a seat for the final three games of the White Sox's four-game set in Oakland with youngster Lenyn Sosa having seemingly gained hold of a regular spot in the middle infield next to shortstop Tim Anderson. Though Andrus has turned in an .889 OPS through 20 games in August, he's a 35-year-old infielder on an expiring deal who likely won't be much of a priority for the 51-79 White Sox heading into the final month of the season.

Takes seat Friday
Andrus is not in the lineup Friday against the Athletics.
Impact Lenyn Sosa will cover second base and bat eighth. This is presumably just a routine breather for the veteran Andrus, who has come to life with a .352/.361/.578 slash line across his last 72 plate appearances dating back to Aug. 4.

Racking up stolen bases
Andrus went 1-for-4 with a stolen base Wednesday against the Mariners.
Impact Andrus was the primary leadoff hitter with Tim Anderson sidelined by a suspension. With Anderson back in action, Andrus shifted down one spot in the order and also made only his second start of the season at third base. On the field, Andrus managed his 11th stolen base of the campaign and third in his last eight starts. With potential at-bats at three different positions, he should see consistent at-bats down the stretch.
