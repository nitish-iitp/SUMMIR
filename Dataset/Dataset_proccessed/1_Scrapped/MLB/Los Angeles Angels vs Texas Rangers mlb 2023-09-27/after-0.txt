Why Evan Carter would be eligible for the Rangers’ postseason roster
Well, the easiest way to work through all this is to understand that MLB rules were made for loopholes.

ANAHEIM, Calif. - A sure sign of playoff fever: Explaining archaic baseball roster rules.

Like this: Though MLB’s handbook specifically states that players must be on a team’s 40-man roster by 11:59 p.m. ET on Aug. 31 to be eligible for a postseason roster, Evan Carter, who wasn’t added to the 40-man roster until eight days later IS, in fact, eligible.

How can that be?

Well, the easiest way to work through all this is to understand that MLB rules were made for loopholes. The real governor is not whether the player is on the 40-man roster by Aug. 31, but if the player is in the organization.

According to the rule book: “A player who doesn’t meet said criteria for postseason eligibility can still be added to a team’s roster in the postseason via petition to the Commissioner’s Office if the player was in the organization on Aug. 31 and is replacing someone who is on the injured list and has served the minimum amount of time required for activation.”

The “petition,” basically means filing paperwork. But here’s how teams manipulate the rule: Payers who are on the IL and won’t be available for a series or all of the postseason are included in a team’s playoff pool. The team then decides to replace that player with somebody who they’d like to add to the playoff pool. The one caveat is that a position player must be replaced with a position player and a pitcher with a pitcher. The Rangers currently have six players on the 10-, 15- or 60-day IL: Brett Martin, Jake Odorizzi, Ian Kennedy, Jacob deGrom, Max Scherzer and Brad Miller. Miller is the only position player among that group.

In the case of Carter, the Rangers would merely file with the league that they are replacing Miller, currently on the 60-day IL, with Carter. Carter, who has become the Rangers’ regular left fielder against right-handed pitching, would then be eligible.

Evan has covered the Rangers since 1997. He has twice been named one of the top 10 beat writers in the country by the AP Sports Editors. His passions outside of covering baseball are his wife, Gina, his two step kids, two crazy dogs & barbecue. Let's not discuss the cat. Evan graduated from Georgia State University, but oddly is a Georgia fan.
