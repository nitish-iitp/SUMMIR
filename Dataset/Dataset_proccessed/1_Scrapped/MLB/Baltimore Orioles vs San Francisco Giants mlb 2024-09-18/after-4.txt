San Francisco’s Blake Snell held the host Baltimore Orioles to one hit across six innings with 12 strikeouts and the Giants began a nine-game road trip by winning 10-0 on Tuesday night.

Mike Yastrzemski provided a big night at the plate with a home run and a run-scoring single, while LaMonte Wade Jr. and Michael Conforto also drove in two runs apiece. The Giants (73-78) won for just the second time in their last seven games.

It was another damaging defeat for the Orioles (84-67), who have lost seven of their last nine games while struggling to keep up with the American League East-leading New York Yankees. Baltimore began the day three games behind the Yankees, though still in the top spot among AL wild-card contenders.

Giants vs. Orioles recap

The only hit off the left-handed Snell (4-3) was Emmanuel Rivera’s second-inning single. Snell walked two, but he didn’t return for the seventh after throwing 98 pitches.

The first five starters in Baltimore’s batting order went a combined 0-for-14 with eight strikeouts against Snell.

It has been a near-constant grind offensively in recent weeks for the Orioles, who began a six-game homestand. Baltimore’s second hit against the Giants came on Heston Kjerstad’s pinch-hit single off Hjelle with one out in the seventh.

Albert Suarez (8-6) took the loss, giving up four runs on six hits with two walks and three strikeouts in 3 1/3 innings.

Yastrzemski’s 16th homer of the season led off the game. The Giants tacked on more in the second inning, with Brett Wisely’s sacrifice fly accounting for the second run before Yastrzemski’s two-out single stretched the gap to 3-0.

Grant McCray scored three runs. He singled to begin the fourth, stole second base and scored on Donovan Walton’s single.

In the ninth, McCray came home on Wisely’s sacrifice bunt for the first of six San Francisco runs in the inning.

The Orioles received a lift from the bullpen, with Keegan Akin (2 2/3 innings) and Burch Smith (two innings) not allowing a run. Craig Kimbrel gave up the ninth-inning runs.
