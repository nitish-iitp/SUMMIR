Final Marlins-Twins Prediction & Pick

Edward Cabrera started the month strong, going 13 innings and giving up just two earned runs. Still, he was hit hard in his last start. Simeon Woods Richardson has not been great as of late either. He has given up nine runs in his previous 15.2 innings of work. Still, Woods Richardson has been in a position to win in the last three starts but has not gotten the run support. While the Twins have not been hitting well as of late, they will give Woods Richardson the run support today. Take the Twins in this one.
