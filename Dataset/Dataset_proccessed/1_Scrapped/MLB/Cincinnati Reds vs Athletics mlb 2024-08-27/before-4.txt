I think some of those are solid options. I personally like more of a classic look. I want more excitmenet than Penn State or Notre Dame football uniforms but don't care for classic cartoonish versions of the Raptors and Grizzlies jerseys like a lot of people. I tend to like most of our Christmas Day jerseys over the years. I especially like this one.

Some decent concepts here. I do support the Thunder looking to redesign the logo. Though I haven't heard official word on it.

The colour palette is alright to me, even though I'd embrace the lightning/thunder influence more with grays and splashes of light blue/white, I don't mind the orange in our scheme too much.

Of the 1st photo, I like the darker jersey [far right] the most (only for the text). However I am kind of sick of teams 'defaulting' to black jerseys that look like practice fits to be honest.

I prefer white for home, standard colour scheme for away, and one alternate only. I get tired of the 5 versions of jerseys we see throughout the year lol.


The other concepts are okay, I guess. Bison/Rumble front-on as the logo is not great to me, could be side profile like MN Wolves, or bison stampede in the clouds etc... idk
Cheers

And honestly any rebranding excitment will always be muted as long as we have the loves patch.

Yeah, agree on that for sure. Though I do think some other teams' sponsors are worse. Charlotte has YouTube influencer-turned entrepreneur Mr Beast's food company  "Feastables"
