CINCINNATI — Max Schuemann and Lawrence Butler each hit a two-run homer in the seventh inning to propel the Oakland Athletics past the Cincinnati Reds 5-4 on Tuesday night.

Zack Gelof added a solo shot in the eighth and All-Star closer Mason Miller hung on after giving up two runs and four hits in a shaky ninth. With runners at second and third, he struck out pinch-hitter Amed Rosario for his 22nd save.

Oakland had one hit and trailed 1-0 through six innings, but rallied to hand Cincinnati its ninth straight loss against interleague opponents.

A’s starter Mitch Spence allowed a run and five hits in 5 1/3 innings. He walked three and struck out three.

Michel Otañez (1-0) got two outs in the sixth for his first major league win.

The Reds, who have five starting pitchers on the injured list, figured to go deep into their bullpen on Tuesday.

Jakob Junis made his fourth start of the season, first since joining the Reds, and retired all 12 batters he faced with three strikeouts. He had made eight relief appearances after being acquired from the Brewers on July 30.

Oakland didn’t have a baserunner until Buck Farmer walked Seth Brown with one out in the fifth. The first hit for the A’s came when Schuemann doubled off Farmer leading off the sixth.

In his next at-bat, Schuemann hit a two-run homer off Tony Santillan (1-2) to put the A’s ahead 2-1 with two outs in the seventh. Two batters later, Butler launched his 15th homer off Justin Wilson.

Gelof added his 16th home run off Casey Legumina in the eighth.

Oakland was leading 5-2 with one out in the ninth when Elly De La Cruz and TJ Friedl singled to put runners at first and third. De La Cruz scored on a groundout. Spencer Steer’s bloop single drove in the fourth run before Miller fanned Rosario.
