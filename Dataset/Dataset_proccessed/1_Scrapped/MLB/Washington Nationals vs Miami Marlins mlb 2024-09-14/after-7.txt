Game #148 Corbin has 2 more starts after this one for the Nats

The Washington Nationals got another ace performance from DJ Herz as he has stepped up as the team’s No. 1 starter this season. He was never even in the plans until Trevor Williams went down with an injury in the first week of June. With 17-starts in the books, Herz lowered his ERA to an impressive 3.70. Can he improve further? Herz will get back into the pitching lab this offseason to try to emerge next season as the team’s ace.

Today, it is Patrick Corbin‘s third start from the end of his checkered Nats’ career that will finish hopefully on an up-note. His World Series contributions in the 2019 season started his 6-year deal on a high note — but it is hard to sugarcoat his 5.10 ERA in his Nats’ tenure.

The Nats got some great defense from all of their players last night, and defense and hustle have started to define what Dylan Crews brings. Along with a developing bat at the MLB level, he will get his reps and try to keep pushing his numbers up.

The Nats need to go 6-9 or better to beat their 2023 win total. How great would that be to finish in the mid-70’s for a win total? After this 4-game series with the Marlins, the Nats will only face teams in competition for the postseason.

The Nats are favorites today, at -145 to win on the moneyline. That means if you bet $145 you would win $100. Bet $14.50 and you win $10.00.

Nats’ manager Dave Martinez need 4.0 innings last night from the bullpen to seal the victory, which they did. Eduardo Salazar, Jose A. Ferrer, and Kyle Finnegan combined for four zeroes, and Ferrer covered 2.0 innings.

This is what the Nats schedule looks like going forward, and the plan is to get Trevor Williams back into the rotation and finish the final week-and-a-half of the season with a 6-man rotation:

Saturday: Patrick Corbin vs. Marlins
Sunday: MacKenzie Gore vs. Marlins
Monday: Jake Irvin vs. Mets
Tuesday: Mitchell Parker vs. Mets
Wednesday: DJ Herz vs. Mets
Thursday: Corbin vs. Cubs
Friday: Gore vs. Cubs
Saturday: Irvin vs. Cubs
Sunday: Parker vs. Cubs
Monday: Day-off September 23
Tuesday: Herz vs. Royals
Wednesday: Corbin vs. Royals
Thursday: Gore vs. Royals
Friday: Irvin vs. Phillies
Saturday: Parker vs. Phillies
Sunday: Herz vs. Phillies (Final Game of the Season)

Your top Washington Nationals on the FanGraphs’ WAR leaderboard has Jacob Young at +2.8, Luis Garcia Jr. at a WAR of +2.8, and CJ Abrams has sunk all the way back to +1.6. In total, 29 Nats’ players are in positive WAR and another seven are at a neutral 0.0 WAR.

“When we first saw [Herz], he was all over the map. We got him, talked to him in Spring Training about just controlling the strike zone. Be aggressive in the zone. You have to be in the zone. You can’t pitch here when you’re walking three, four, five guys a game. He took it to heart, and went [to Triple-A], and really was just trying to throw the ball over the plate. He gets up here, and he’s had his moments. … When he does that, he’s really good.”
