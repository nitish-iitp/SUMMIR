Get ready to see a new player on the field – well, on the helmets. Major League Baseball (MLB) announced a multi-year international partnership with European workwear giant STRAUSS, making them the official workwear partner of both MLB and Minor League Baseball (MiLB). This strategic move marks STRAUSS's first major league deal in the US, aiming to build brand awareness and reignite baseball's passion across the pond.

"Whether on the field or off the field, your gear is a source of pride," says STRAUSS CEO Henning Strauss. He emphasizes the shared values between STRAUSS and baseball fans—loyalty, dedication, and a commitment to excellence. This aligns perfectly with the "iconic ostrich logo" brand's existing customer base, which values quality craftsmanship. STRAUSS is thrilled to be the first brand on MLB batting helmets in the US and is excited to contribute to the resurgence of baseball in Europe.

The partnership goes beyond the bright lights of Major League Baseball. Starting in 2025, STRAUSS will have its logo displayed on batting helmets worn during the 8,000+ MiLB games each season. This extensive reach allows STRAUSS to connect with the next generation of baseball stars and resonate with fans across North America. Additionally, the brand will be heavily promoted across MLB and MiLB digital platforms.

To further connect with fans during the season, MLB has created a new digital platform dedicated to stolen bases, presented by STRAUSS. This platform will showcase stolen base highlights on MLB Network, MLB.com, and social media channels. STRAUSS sees this as a perfect opportunity to celebrate the aspects of the game that mirror their brand values – preparation, strategic thinking, and decisive action.

"We are proud that STRAUSS selected Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball as the marketing platform to introduce its brand to the U.S. market," said Noah Garden, MLB Deputy Commissioner, Business & Media. He highlights the shared legacy, teamwork, and dedication to craft between both entities, making this partnership a natural fit.

This partnership aligns with STRAUSS's existing sports marketing strategy that has seen success for over a decade in Europe. The company enjoys a strong connection between their loyal customers and passionate sports fans. Through partnerships with UEFA (European soccer governing body), Bayern Munich, and Liverpool FC, STRAUSS has established a strong brand presence in a key demographic.

This strategy has also proven successful for American sports organizations aiming to expand into Europe. STRAUSS already partners with the NFL and the Kansas City Chiefs, demonstrating its understanding of the European sports market. It believes this partnership with MLB and MiLB presents an opportunity to build a similar connection with dedicated baseball fans worldwide.
