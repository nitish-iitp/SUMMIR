The Nationals' Week in Review: 8-14 September, 2024

In case you missed any of the games over this past week and wanted to read up on them, this article compiles every Nats' game over the last 6 days, and provides a quick glimpse of key performers and standouts. The Nationals dropped the finale in Pittsburgh, but came back with a series-splitting win against the Braves and two versus the Marlins.

Last Sunday, the Nationals wrapped up a four-game set in Pittsburgh with a loss characteristic of most Patrick Corbin starts: Corbin ate six innings, gave up seven runs, and was outdueled by a pitcher over ten years younger than him in Jared Jones.

Even still, the loss wasn't particularly difficult to swallow. Obviously, the Nationals have long been out of playoff contention (and depending who you ask, were never in it), and had just win both ends of a thrilling doubleheader the day before. CJ Abrams broke a 14-game homerless drought with a 416-foot tank off Jones to start the game. And on the other side of the dugout, 2021 tenth-round pick Billy Cook was making his major league debut with the Pirates, and picking up his first double and RBIs in the process.

Once again, it's time for the box score roundup, a condensed box score highlighting key players and moments from each game all wrapped up in a neat little package for quick skimming-over. If you're liking this, or have changes you think I could make, feel free to let me/us know on Twitter @DistrictOnDeck and @TheOttSpot.

8 SEPTEMBER
(64-79) WSH 3-7 PIT (67-76)
WSH SS CJ Abrams 1 for 4, HR (19), RBI

PIT C Joey Bart 1 for 4, HR (13), 2 RBI
PIT DH Andrew McCutchen 2 for 4, HR (19), RBI, K
PIT 1B Billy Cook 2 for 4, 2B (1), 2 RBI, K -- MLB DEBUT
PIT CF Michael A. Taylor 1 for 4, HR (5), RBI, K

WSH SP Patrick Corbin 6.0 IP, 10 H, 7 ER, 5 K, 3 HR, WP (3)

PIT SP Jared Jones QS (11) KdS (1, 6th inning) 7.0 IP, 4 H, 2 ER, 9 K, HR

"QS" is short for quality start. "KdS" is shorthand for "struck out the side," specifically where a pitcher faces the only three batters in an inning and strikes out all three.

Then it was back on the plane and back home to D.C., where the Atlanta Braves awaited. The Braves, in the thick of a tense National League Wild Card race, had struggled against the Nationals, losing 7 of 11 contests against the Nats this year. That didn't seem to be an issue in Game 1 on September 10, as despite a one-and-out from breakout starter and former National Reynaldo López due to shoulder inflammation, the Nationals failed to get more than one hit combined across six innings from Jesse Chavez and John Brebbia. MacKenzie Gore's second-half struggles only worsened, as the lefty was unable to complete four innings and allowed seven runs (five unearned). José Tena picked up a pair of doubles, but was a key factor in those unearned runs, committing his ninth error of the season.

10 SEPTEMBER
(79-66) ATL 12-0 WSH (64-80)
ATL CF Michael Harris II 3 for 6, 2 HR (11), 2 RBI, K
ATL RF Jorge Soler 1 for 4, BB, 2B (27), RBI, 2 R, 2 K
ATL DH Marcell Ozuna 1 for 2, BB, 2 R
ATL 1B Matt Olson 3 for 5, BB, GIDP, 2B (33), 2 RBI, R
ATL LF Ramón Laureano 3 for 5, 2B (12), 3 RBI, R
ATL C Sean Murphy 2 for 4, HBP (3), HR (9), 3 RBI, 2 K
ATL SS Orlando Arcia 1 for 5, HR (16), RBI, K

WSH 3B José Tena 2 for 4, 2 2B (4), K, E5 (9)

ATL SP Reynaldo López 1.0 IP, H, 0 R, K, HBP (2)
ATL RP Jesse Chavez SD (10) 3.0 IP, H, 0 R, 3 K
ATL RP John Brebbia 3.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 2 BB, 2 K

WSH SP MacKenzie Gore 3.2 IP, 6 H, 7 R/2 ER, 3 BB, 3 K, HR, HBP (10), WP (13)

"SD" = Shutdown, a Fangraphs-created metric defined by a relief appearance with +6.0% WPA or greater; a leverage-based alternative to saves and holds. "MD" = Meltdown, which functions inversely; any relief appearance with a -6.0% WPA or lower.

And then the tides turned. Jake Irvin got the ball on Wednesday, a statement that has been trouble for the Braves three times prior this season, and was trouble again last week. Irvin was coming off a tough outing in Pittsburgh, when he gave up six runs on seven hits and three walks, due in part to his curveball not playing how he had wanted it to. Evidently, the gameplan was different heading into the season series finale, as Irvin threw nearly 90 percent fastballs to the Braves, and with extremely excellent location was able to barrel through the lineup twice hitless before Michael Harris II broke up the bid for history with a two-out double in the 6th. He came back to wrap up the quality start, and by that point it was too little, too late for the Braves--CJ Abrams had already hit his 20th home run of the year to lock up a 20/20 campaign, and the Nationals finished the season series against the Braves with a 61.5% win rate--their first season win over the team since 2017.

11 SEPTEMBER
(79-67) ATL 1-5 WSH (65-80)
ATL RF Jorge Soler 2 for 3, BB, 2B (28), RBI

WSH SS CJ Abrams 2 for 4, HR (20), RBI, 2 R, K, E6 (16)
WSH RF Dylan Crews 2 for 4, RBI, K
WSH LF James Wood 2 for 4, RBI, K
WSH 2B José Tena 2 for 4, SB (3), R, 2 K
WSH C Keibert Ruiz 2 for 4, 2B (19), RBI, K

ATL SP Max Fried 6.0 IP, 11 H, 4 ER, 6 K, HR, HBP (6)

WSH SP Jake Irvin QS (15) 6.0 IP, 2 H, ER, BB, 5 K -- NO-HITTER thru 5.2 IP

Finally, time for the Marlins to come to town. Miami haven't had a good season--after an unlikely playoff berth in 2023, they've returned to Earth this year and are on pace for 100 losses--but despite entering play on Thursday with a 1-7 record against the Nats this year, the Marlins came back from a 3-0 first-inning deficit to win. The Nationals ultimately beat themselves in this game: after a hot first inning where three runs scored on hits from CJ Abrams, Dylan Crews, and José Tena (plus a James Wood walk, no big surprise there), the well totally dried up thereafter, while Miami got two runs back following an Abrams throwing error on what should have been a 6-4-3 double play putting both Nick Fortes and Javier Sanoja in scoring position, then Derek Law imploding in the 8th inning of a 3-3 tie by allowing three runs--one unearned, thanks to another error, this time by Luis García Jr.--and getting saddled with a meltdown of enormous proportions: the Nationals' probability of winning dropped a total of 51.1%, per FanGraphs, while Law was pitching.

WSH RP Derek Law MD (13) 1.0 IP, 3 H, 3 R/2 ER, BB -- Stranded 1 inherited; -51.1% WPA

There was still some solace to be taken in the day's events, as the Nationals became the first team since the 2007 Mets to steal 200 bases in a season, and did so with several weeks left to play.

Small ball reigned supreme on Friday, as it often has in rebuild Nationals games, but the team's aggressive approach on the basepaths paved a road to success against Marlins starter Edward Cabrera, who allowed two runs over six innings, plus two errors of his own. The Nationals picked up just four hits, one walk, and one hit batsman, but five stolen bases from four different players and pressure on the Miami defense was enough to push four runs across and back up a strong start for DJ Herz, who went 5 innings with one run allowed to pick up his fourth Major League win. Jose A. Ferrer continues to shove out of the bullpen, and Kyle Finnegan reached 37 saves on the season.

13 SEPTEMBER
(55-93) MIA 1-4 WSH (66-81)
MIA 2B Otto López 1 for 4, HR (5), RBI

WSH 2B Luis García Jr. 1 for 3, HR (16), RBI

MIA SP Edward Cabrera QS (5) 6.0 IP, H, 2 R, BB, 9 K, HBP (4), 2 E1 (3)
MIA RP Anthony Veneziano MD (2) 1.0 IP, 2 H, 2 R/1 ER, HR

WSH SP DJ Herz 5.0 IP, 4 H, ER, BB, 5 K, HR
WSH RP Eduardo Salazar SD (5) 1.0 IP, H, 0 R, PCV (3)
WSH RP Jose A. Ferrer SD (4) 2.0 IP, 2 H, 0 R, K

A key moment from that Friday evening affair was Dylan Crews showing raw, fantastic body awareness with a leaping catch to steal away potential extra bases from Connor Norby in the first inning, before going on to steal two bases in the game. (The night before, he made another highlight reel grab in right center to secure Parker's quality start!)

That takes us to yesterday afternoon, on a sunny September Saturday in the nation's capital. Patrick Corbin's second start in 7 days went considerably more smoothly--the 35-year-old's 103rd career win was his 9th quality start of the 2024 campaign--as the Marlins failed to generate any momentum. Second baseman Otto López was the only member of the opposition to reach three times, while three Nationals hit homers, including 400-plus-foot tape measure shots from José Tena and Joey Gallo. Keibert Ruiz stole third base for the second time this month, and the Nationals have positioned themselves for a series win tomorrow against the Marlins before a seven-game road trip against the playoff-focused Mets and scuttling Cubs.


14 SEPTEMBER
(55-94) MIA 1-4 WSH (67-81)
MIA 2B Otto López 2 for 3, BB, 2B (20), SB (17), CS (3), RBI, K

WSH DH Juan Yepez 1 for 3, BB, HR (6), RBI
WSH 3B José Tena 2 for 4, HR (3), RBI, 2 R
WSH C Keibert Ruiz 2 for 4, 2B (21), SB (3), RBI
WSH 1B Joey Gallo 1 for 3, HR (7), RBI, 2 K

MIA SP Valente Bellozo 5.1 IP, 6 H, 3 ER, BB, 4 K, 2 HR
MIA RP Mike Baumann KdS (1, 7th inning) 1.2 IP, H, 0 R, 4 K

WSH SP Patrick Corbin QS (9) 6.0 IP, 3 H, ER, BB, 6 K
WSH RP Robert Garcia SD (15) 1.0 IP, H, 0 R, 2 K
WSH RP Derek Law SD (19) 1.0 IP, H, 0 R, 2 K

Over the last seven days and six games, the Nationals went 3-3 and have not lost a series since they were swept by the Cubs to start the month. Closer Kyle Finnegan is on the doorstep of 40 saves, a number not reached by a Washington National since Rafael Soriano in 2013. There are obviously still myriad questions to be answered, and one can only hope that answers will be found during the offseason. For now, we can only sit back and await the final 14 games of 2024 Nationals baseball.
