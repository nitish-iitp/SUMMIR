We did NOT see this coming! Bryce Harper shaves his beard during the San Diego Padres in early September of the 2023 Major League Baseball season.

Bryce Harper Shaves His Iconic Beard

We are so used to seeing Bryce with that big beard. In fact, he and the rest of the Phillies were really hot in the month of August while he had that beard. Did he need a change of some sort? Not sure. We think it could’ve been good luck.

In the month of August, he hit ten home runs in 26 games played and was batting .361. That is actually kind of insane. Here’s every one of those home runs.

The Phillies ended up going 17-10 in the month of August, absolutely crushing the ball. The team hit 59 home runs which is the most they’ve hit in any month in franchise history.

Bryce Harper Good Luck Charm

You would think the beard would bring him good luck, right? Maybe not! Cause he saved it off! Here’s a picture of him, pre-shaving of the beard.

Then he goes onto the west coast trip, to San Diego. The Phillies had a huge win against the Padres in which WE CAN SEE THE BEARD STILL!

And Now, No Beard Harper

Then, all of a sudden, it is gone. POOF! Just like that. He decided he needed a change and then the Phillies lost 8-0. So I hate to say what everyone else is thinking but… they might be tied to each other!

We don’t know what the idea is here but you should really grow it back!
