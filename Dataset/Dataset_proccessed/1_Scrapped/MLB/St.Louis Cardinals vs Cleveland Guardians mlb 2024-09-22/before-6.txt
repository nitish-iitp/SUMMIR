A Chapman Among Giants

Matt Chapman had himself a game to remember after being reinstated from the paternity list.

In a 9-0 win over the Royals, Chapman went 2-for-4 with two home runs, his 25th and 26th of the season. The win was inconsequential for the Giants as they improved to 76-79 for the season. Conversely, it was another backbreaking loss for the Royals, losers of six straight who have seen their Wild Card lead shrink over the past week.

Chapman signed a six-year, $151 million extension last week to stay in San Francisco. It hasn’t been the most significant period for the Giants since setting a club record for wins in 2021. Since that magical season, the Giants have failed to have a season over .500, a streak that will likely continue in 2024 barring a hot finish.

Retaining the 31-year-old veteran could help turn things around in 2025. Chapman, a Gold-Glove defender, has made strides with his bat this season. In 621 plate appearances, he has 26 home runs but scored 95 runs, collected 75 RBI, and has an OPS  of .789. The latter is his highest mark in that category since 2020 with the A’s, and he will likely pass his 27-HR mark in 2022 with the Blue Jays.

There are many questions about this Giants organization this offseason. Will they keep team president Farhan Zaidi, especially with rumors of conflict between him and executive board member Buster Posey? Will Bob Melvin be one and done in San Francisco as the manager? Will the Giants make the splashes in free agency necessary to compete with the Dodgers, Padres, and Diamondbacks in the NL West?

At least Chapman’s future in San Francisco is already settled.

 

Let’s see how the other hitters did Saturday.

Julio Rodríguez (SEA): 4-6, HR, 2 R, 4 RBI, SB. 

It’s been a down year for Rodriguez as he only has a .736 OPS (down from .818 last year and .854 in his rookie season). However, he’s surging at the right time as the Mariners try to make one last playoff push. He hit .345 with a .970 OPS in September. On Saturday, he hit his 19th home run and 23rd stolen base. Hopefully, this strong finish can lead to a turnaround in 2025.

 

Ketel Marte (ARI): 2-2, HR, 2 R, 2 RBI, 3 BB, SB. 

It’s a shame Marte got injured and missed so much time in August. He could’ve made a case as a dark-horse MVP candidate if he had been fully healthy. Marte is hitting .296 with 34 home runs, 92 RBI, and a .937 OPS. Even though he likely won’t be a serious candidate in the MVP race, he is solidifying himself as one of the best fantasy second basemen in the game.

 

Elly De La Cruz (CIN): 3-5, 2B, HR, 2 R, 4 RBI. 

The Reds have disappointed this year, but De La Cruz has lived up to the hype in his sophomore campaign. He hit his 25th home run of the year on Sunday, and he has 65 stolen bases and an OPS of .824. He has made marked growth since his rookie year, including improvements in barrel rate, walk rate, and hard-hit rate. Don’t be surprised to see De La Cruz take another step in his third year in the league in 2025.

 

Iván Herrera (STL): 2-3, 2B, HR, 2 R, 3 RBI, BB. 

He’s been primarily a backup, but Herrera could make the catching situation intriguing in 2025. Herrera has gotten full-time duties with Willson Contreras out for the season, and he has taken advantage. He is hitting .293 with a .770 OPS in 242 plate appearances. He also has four home runs and five stolen bases. Contreras will likely be back in 2025 but expect Herrera to give him more days off behind the plate.

 

LaMonte Wade Jr. (SFG): 2-4, 2 HR, 2 R, 2 RBI. 

Wade did his best Barry Bonds impression at Kauffman Stadium on Saturday. He hit two absolute tanks against the Royals, his seventh and eighth of the season. Wade has dealt with nagging injuries for most of the season, as he has been limited to only 311 plate appearances. However, his stellar performance on Saturday showed what he could be capable of if he were 100%.

 

Kyle Tucker (HOU): 4-4, 2B, HR, R, 2 RBI, BB. 

Since returning from the IL, Tucker has been on fire in September. He is hitting .405 with a 1.167 OPS this month and has three home runs in 54 plate appearances. The Astros missed Tucker in the lineup when he was on the 60-day IL. However, he looks fully healthy and locked in, which is good news for Houston as they prepare for another postseason run.

 

Logan O’Hoppe (LAA): 4-4, 2 2B, HR, 2 R, RBI. 

After a brutal August (.099 average and .339 OPS), O’Hoppe bounced back in September with a .222 average and .753 OPS. Hitting for a high average may never be in the cards long-term for O’Hoppe, especially with a strikeout rate of 30.2%. On the flip side, he has hit 20 home runs this year, which is valuable to have on one’s roster in fantasy, especially in two-catcher leagues.

 

José Ramírez (CLE): 2-4, 2B, HR, R, 3 RBI. 

The Guardians clinched the AL Central on Saturday with the Royals loss. Even though the Guardians lost themselves, they saw another big day at the plate from Ramirez, who hit his 37th home run of the year. Ramirez is three home runs away from a 40 HR-40 SB season. While that seems paltry to what Shohei Ohtani is doing in Los Angeles, it would be a mark to celebrate if he hits it by the season’s conclusion.

 

Joey Gallo (WSN): 2-3, HR, R, 3 RBI, BB. 

Despite the distractions of CJ Abrams‘ demotion for burning the midnight oil at a Chicago casino, the Nationals beat the Cubs 5-1 at Wrigley Field. Gallo had a big day as he had two hits and collected his ninth home run of the year. Despite the strong performance on Saturday, Gallo is only hitting .164 with a .622 OPS in 243 plate appearances. The writing may be on the wall for Gallo’s polarizing MLB career.
