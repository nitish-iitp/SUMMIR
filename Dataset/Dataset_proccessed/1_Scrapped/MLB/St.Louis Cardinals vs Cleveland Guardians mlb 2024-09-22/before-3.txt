Cleveland Guardians vs St. Louis Cardinals Prediction

I’ll probably stay with the Guardians. Also probably not touching it. Williams is on a rough run lately, going 0-3 in his last trio with 10 earned runs in 11.0 total innings. As for Pallante, he’s 1-2 in his last three with eight earned in 17.0 total frames.

On Saturday the Guardians nearly came back from a 6-1 hole but fell short of the epic evening. There were only two earned runs for Cleveland in this one, so the mound wasn’t exactly the trouble. I like the Guardians to come back from this one Sunday.
