Cheat Sheet and Projections

We've reviewed every player from every team to help you find the best selections on Saturday's slate.

Selection	Player	Salary	Proj. Pts	Pts/$1K
Stud	Blake Snell (SF, P)	$21,120	20.2	1
Value	Samuel Aldegheri (LAA, P)	$5,000	12.9	2.6
Fade	Grant McCray (SF, OF)	$9,170	2.8	0.3
Cheapie	Jesús Sánchez (MIA, OF)	$5,000	5.9	1.2

According to Fantasy Insider's DFS model, our "stud" is the highest projected scorer across the slate, while "value" picks offer the most "bang for your buck," meaning they're expected to perform well relative to their salary.

Conversely, a "fade" is a player considered to offer lower value for money, based on their expected score relative to their salary. For budget-conscious strategies, "cheapie" options highlight the best value players at lower price points not already mentioned.

In fantasy sports, understanding value—assessing a player's potential output against their salary—is crucial, as players scoring high relative to their cost are key in crafting the optimal line-up.

The "Pts/$1K" metric shows the predicted points for every $1,000 of a player's salary. A higher number indicates better value, making it easier to spot players who could outperform their cost.

Conclusion

When building your MLB Saturday teams, consider starting with a value player like Samuel Aldegheri. To secure one of the highest projected scorers, Blake Snell is a strong option. If you're looking for budget-friendly choices to free up salary cap for more studs, take a look at our cheapie options, including Jesús Sánchez.

On the other hand, according to our model, Grant McCray is one of the worst value options on the slate, suggesting you might want to limit exposure to him if entering multiple line-ups.
