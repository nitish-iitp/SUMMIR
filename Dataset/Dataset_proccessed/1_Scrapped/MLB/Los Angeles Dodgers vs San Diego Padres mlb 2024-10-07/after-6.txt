FRANCHISES

The start of the bottom of the seventh inning between the Dodgers and Padres in Game 2 of the NLDS "was delayed several minutes" after someone in the crowd "threw a baseball on the field" toward Padres LF Jurickson Profar. Profar was "very animated" talking to umpires and teammates as fans "threw objects on the field." Dodger Stadium security officials met with umpires on the field and security personnel, at one point, "were surrounding Profar." Both Profar and Padres RF Fernando Tatis Jr. had been "interacting with fans throughout the game." The game resumed "after a roughly 12-minute delay" (L.A. TIMES, 10/6).

Although "no one wanted to see players threatened by balls coming out of the stands, they didn’t seem to mind the overall atmosphere at Dodger Stadium" (ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER, 10/7). There was "continuous booing" by the sellout crowd of 54,119 -- the largest at Dodger Stadium this season (AP, 10/6). 

In L.A., Bill Plaschke writes an "already tattered image" of Dodgers fans "was further damaged." A "historically bad reputation was further stained." On a national stage, "a few bad actors" among the largest Dodger Stadium crowd of the season "only furthered the harmful narrative that Chavez Ravine is a place stocked with punks." After the security stoppage in the seventh inning, SS Manny Machado "led the Padres in what appeared to be an emotional impromptu team meeting in their dugout." The rest of the game was "completed without incident" (L.A. TIMES, 10/7).
