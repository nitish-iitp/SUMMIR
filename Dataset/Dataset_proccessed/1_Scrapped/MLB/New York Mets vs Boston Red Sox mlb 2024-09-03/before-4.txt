Our Mets vs Red Sox predictions are based on market-leading simulations and betting expertise to help you place more informed bets with your chosen online bookie.

And while the Mets have a higher chance of winning the game, betting on the Red Sox to win is our preferred option due to the edge found when comparing our data-driven probabilities to the odds currently available.

Making use of the edges published here at Stats Insider is pivotal to being a profitable bettor in the long run.

Even though the Mets are more likely to cover the line, our best bet of Red Sox -1.5 is based on the chance of that happening, as projected by our predictive analytics model, and the best odds available.

Furthermore, despite the Under being more likely to hit in this game, Over 8.5 is our best bet because of the better odds ($1.91) that are available from TAB.
