Boston Red Sox vs New York Mets Prediction

I’ll stick with the Mets. New York should be in good hands with Peterson starting. Over his last three Peterson is 1-0 with five earned over 21.1 innings total. As for Crawford, he’s 0-3 in his last three with seven earned over 17.0 innings of work.

On Monday the Mets only needed RBI from Francisco Lindor and Brandon Nimmo in a pretty nice defensive effort. The pen posted 2.0 clean frames with no hits and one walk alongside four Ks. I like New York to keep it up on Tuesday.
