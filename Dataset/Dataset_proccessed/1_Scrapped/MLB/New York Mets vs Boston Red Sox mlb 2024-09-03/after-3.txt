David Peterson struck out a career-high 11 over six solid innings and the Mets got a three RBI night from MVP candidate Francisco Lindor to push their winning streak to six games with a 7-2 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Tuesday night at Citi Field.

New York improved to 75-64 on the season and have now won 14 of their last 20 games.

Here are the takeaways…

- Peterson allowed a soft contact infield hit but blew high fastballs past three Red Sox for a 17-pitch, three-strikeout first inning. In a change of pace, the lefty got a slider in at the knees for a called third strike to start the second before blowing away another Boston batsman on a fastball up in the zone to end it, stranding a hard-hit two-out single off the wall in left.

Pitching on his 29th birthday, Peterson continued to pound the strike zone in the third, getting two strikeouts and a flyout to center in a seven-pitch inning to give him seven strikeouts, one off his season high. Through his first 40 offerings, the left-hander induced 10 whiffs on 21 swings and had another 12 called strikes for a 55 percent called-strike whiff rate.

A master of soft contact this year, Peterson got stung for a run on soft contact in the fifth with a leadoff infield single from Masataka Yoshida (59.6 mph off the bat) and two-out bloop RBI from Nick Sogard (71.3 mph). After another single put two aboard, the lefty got his 10th strikeout on the night blowing a 3-2 high fastball past Jarren Duran.

Peterson allowed a leadoff single to start the sixth before falling behind 2-0 to the dangerous Rafael Devers but battled back and blew him away with another up-and-away fastball. The lefty then walked his first batter of the night to put the go-ahead run aboard and pitching coach Jeremy Hefner to the mound.

Peterson got a dribbler in front of the mound and gunned it to second to nail the runner by an eyelash before a soft flyball to right to end the threat.

His final line: 6.0 innings, six hits, one run, one walk and 11 strikeouts on 89 pitches (65 strikes) to lower his ERA to 2.75 on the year.

- Kutter Crawford was determined to match Peterson in the early goings and got through two perfect frames with five strikeouts (all swinging). Through his first 31 pitches, Mets batters had eight whiffs on 16 swings (five on the fastball) and five called strikes.

Jeff McNeil worked a one-out walk for the Mets’ first base runner in the third, setting up Lindor for a two-out, two-run home run to right field as the MVP chants rained down from the Citi Field crowd.

With the mighty swing on a 2-1 pitch (a cutter that hung up, over the middle of the plate), Lindor extended his streak of reaching base to 32 games and his hitting streak to 14 on the 369-foot blast (104.8 mph). The homer was his 30th on the season, the fifth time he reached that mark in his career.

- Mark Vientos greeted Red Sox reliever Justin Slaten by taking a 1-1 sweeper 426 feet deep to center for his 22nd home run of the year. The no-doubt solo shot (106.1 mph) was just the Mets' second hit of the night.

- Jose Butto entered and tallied a pair of strikeouts in a nine-pitch 1-2-3 seventh. But things fell apart in the eighth when the righty walked Duran and Tyler O'Neill (on four pitches) to bring the go-ahead run (the dangerous Devers) to the plate.

Carlos Mendoza quickly bounded out of the dugout to summon Reed Garrett and he got Devers to hit a slow bouncer up the middle, but Lindor failed to get an out when he was too slow going to the bag at second and his throw to first was late.

A sacrifice fly to right scored the speedy Duran. But Garrett got Yoshida to hit a bouncer that Jose Iglesias deftly turned into a 4-6-3 inning-ending double play to preserve the Mets’ lead.

- In the home half of the eighth, McNeil dumped his second hit of the night to right before Francisco Alvarez, with just three hits in his last 34 at-bats, slapped a single through the big hole on the right side to put two on and nobody out for Lindor.

And the MVP candidate smacked a first-pitch RBI double the other way to the warning track in left. Brandon Nimmo's sac fly on a sinking liner plated Alvarez to give the Mets a three-run cushion.

Pete Alonso, who yanked a single to left snapping an 0-for-11 skid in the seventh, put the exclamation point on the night with a 422-foot, 108.4 mph two-run homer to center. Before the single, the first baseman had just six hits in his previous 41 at-bats with a .146/.182/.390 slash line and .572 OPS.

- Ryne Stanek added a 1-2-3 ninth to close the door with a pair of strikeouts.

MVP of the Game: David Peterson

Lindor might end up being the NL MVP for the year, but on this Tuesday in Queens, Peterson set a Mets record for strikeouts thrown on a pitcher's birthday with his new career high of 11, so he is getting the nod.

The southpaw ended the night with 20 whiffs on 49 swings (14 of which came on the fastball) to go along with 16 called strikes for a very solid 40 percent called-strike whiff rate. Peterson has a 1.81 ERA over his last seven starts (44.2 innings).

What's next

The Mets and Red Sox conclude the series with a 7:10 p.m. first pitch scheduled for Wednesday.

Right-hander Tylor Megill (4.82 ERA and 1.395 WHIP in 52.1 innings) will make his 12th appearance in the big leagues this year. In his last outing, his first in a month, the 29-year-old allowed one run on five hits and a walk in 5.1 innings with six strikeouts against the lowly White Sox.

Boston counters with its ace, right-hander Tanner Houck (3.12 ERA and 1.166 WHIP in 164.2 innings). The 28-year-old rebounded his final start of the month, but struggled during August, pitching to a 4.29 ERA in 35.2 innings over six starts.
