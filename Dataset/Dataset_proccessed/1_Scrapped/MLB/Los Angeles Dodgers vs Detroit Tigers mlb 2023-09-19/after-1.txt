Dodgers 1B Freddie Freeman enters rare territory with 20-stolen base, 20-HR season

LOS ANGELES — Throughout the spring, Freddie Freeman wore it as a source of pride. Not that he had nearly won his first batting title. Not that he had played in 159 of 162 possible games en route to one of the finest years of his career in his first season with Los Angeles.

No, the Dodgers first baseman wanted one thing to be clear: He had stolen more bases — 13 — than his teammate Mookie Betts, who had once pulled off a 30-30 campaign in his 2018 MVP season. That had marked a new career high for Freeman.

Now, he wanted to top it. He surprised even himself, entering rare territory for his position when he swiped his 20th stolen base of the season in the seventh inning of Monday’s 8-3 win over the Detroit Tigers, taking off on José Cisnero’s pitch and sliding in safely following a replay review. It marked just the 16th season ever for a first baseman with 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases, the first since Ian Desmond in 2018 and a feat only 10 other full-time players at the position had ever accomplished.

“This is one thing I never thought I’d do in my career,” Freeman said. “First basemen usually aren’t the speed demons.”

Baseball’s new rules this season, including bigger bases and limits on pickoffs and pitcher “disengagements,” have spiked stolen base rates. Entering Monday, the league had already swiped 733 more bases this year than it did all of last season — and there are still more than two weeks remaining.

Freeman has taken advantage, utilizing his skill as one of the better baserunners in the league to make up for his 35th-percentile sprint speed. He has only been caught once in his 21 tries this year, thriving off efficiency.

“He has scored (124) runs this year and that speaks to the baserunning and the ability to get on base, steal second base, go first to third, he’s as good as I’ve ever seen,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “The object of the game is to score more runs than the other team. His run production and creation is incredible.”

If anything, he has gotten better at stealing bases over time. Freeman’s 20-20 campaign is just the 23rd such season for a player in their age-33 season or older, and the first since Brett Gardner in 2017. With four more hits, he’ll have his first 200-hit campaign — and become the second-oldest player to collect 200 or more hits in a 20-20 season, behind Paul Molitor in 1993.

“Man, it’s an exclamation mark on a tremendous season,” Roberts said. “It’s special. He’s never done it … the 20-20, I think he really wanted it. I’m happy for him.”

The former MVP checked his phone Monday night after the accomplishment only to find a message from his father, Fred. His method of congratulating his son was simple.

“Fast enough,” the message read.
