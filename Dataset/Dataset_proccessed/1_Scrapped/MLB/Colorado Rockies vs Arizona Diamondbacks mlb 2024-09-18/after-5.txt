In his last start against the Milwaukee Brewers, he went five innings giving up five hits and two runs.

Arizona Diamondbacks vs Colorado Rockies Prediction

This is a great spot to take the Rockies. Gomber’s ERA isn’t actually all that high for pitching at Coors Field, and he’s going to have a strong start here. Rodriguez hasn’t been great for the Diamondbacks, and he sits with an ERA of 5.50. The Rockies have been inconsistent, but they are going to find success scoring here, and that will be enough for the Rockies to get the job done. Back the Rockies.
