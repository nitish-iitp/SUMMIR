Braves’ Ronald Acuña Jr. becomes MLB’s fifth 40-40 club member, first since 2006

Atlanta Braves outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. blasted his 40th home run of the 2023 season Friday against the Washington Nationals, becoming the fifth member of MLB’s 40-home run, 40-stolen base club. Here’s what you need to know:

Acuña homered in the top of the first inning, sending Patrick Corbin’s 3-2 pitch just over the left-field wall at Nationals Park.
Acuña, who leads the majors with 68 steals, joins José Canseco (1988), Barry Bonds (1996), Alex Rodriguez (1998) and former National Alfonso Soriano (2006) in accomplishing the feat  — none of the others had more than 46 stolen bases.
The 25-year-old became the first player in MLB history with 30 home runs and 60 steals last month. The MVP candidate and four-time All-Star previously neared the 40-40 mark in 2019, when he had a career-high 41 home runs along with 37 steals.
Acuña entered Friday slashing .335/.414/.592 this season for the Braves, who have the best record in baseball. He has 34 career leadoff homers and a career-high 101 RBIs on the season.

The Athletic’s instant analysis:

Acuña vs. other 40-40 club members

Acuña is the fifth member of the 40-40 club, and it’s not difficult to make a case that Acuña’s 40-40 season is superior to any of the others. First, there’s the sheer size of the gap between his stolen base total — 68 and counting — compared to the previous high total in a 40-40 season, Rodriguez’s career-high 46 steals in 1998. Rodriguez was caught stealing 13 times in 59 attempts, the same number of caught stealings as Acuña has in 81 attempts.

Even if Acuña were to go homerless for the rest of the season, his 40 homers would still be only two shy of the totals produced by three of the other four members of the 40-40 club: Canseco had 42 homers and 40 steals in 1988, Bonds had 42 homers with 40 stolen bases in 1996 and Rodriguez had 42 homers with his 46 steals in 1998. The exception was Soriano, with 46 homers and 41 stolen bases in 2006.

Considering the rate at which Acuña has hit the ball out of the park lately — nine homers in 16 September games before Friday — and the fact that he intends to play every game for the rest of the season, there’s a good chance he will surpass homer totals of at least three of the other 40-40 members.

As for steals, Acuña can reasonably be expected to reach or surpass 70, especially considering five of the Braves’ final eight games are against Washington, which has allowed the second-most stolen bases in MLB. Even given the increased stolen base totals this season with larger bases and limits on pitcher pickoff throws, the fact that only two other major leaguers have as many as 50 steals points to how exceptional Acuña has been. — O’Brien

Measuring by OPS

Acuña began Friday with a National League-leading 1.006 OPS. The only player to finish with a higher OPS in his 40-40 was Bonds, whose 1.076 OPS ranked second in the NL behind Miami Marlins’ Gary Sheffield (1.089) in a year when 13 major leaguers hit 40 or more homers. Only 10 players have more than 35 homers this season with less than two weeks remaining in the season.

No other member of the 40-40 club had an OPS as high as .960 in his 40-40 season.

After Bonds, the next highest was Canseco’s .959 OPS in 1988, when he was American League MVP and helped the Oakland Athletics win the AL pennant before losing to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series. Canseco hit .307 with a .391 OBP and .569 slugging percentage, significantly lower than Acuña in each of those categories. — O’Brien

This could’ve been Acuña’s second 40-40 season

No player has had more than one 40-40 season, but this could’ve been the second for Acuña, if not for a strained hamstring that kept him from running in the final week of the 2019 season. He finished with 41 homers and an NL-leading 37 stolen bases in 46 attempts that year in his first full season in the majors (he debuted April 25, 2018).

Neither Rodriguez nor Canseco ever had as many as 30 stolen bases outside of his 40-40 season, while Soriano had two other seasons with at least 40 steals. Soriano narrowly missed a 40-40 season in 2002 with the New York Yankees when he had 39 homers and 41 stolen bases, the closest that any 40-40 club member other than Acuña has come to having two 40-40 seasons.

Bonds had two other seasons with more than 40 steals, both with the Pittsburgh Pirates in his ages 25-26 seasons — 52 steals with 33 homers in 1990, and 43 steals with 25 homers in 1991.

Considering Acuña’s relatively young age — he’ll be 26 one week before Christmas — and his speed and aggressiveness, plus the larger bases and pickoff rules, it’s not a stretch to think he could have more 40-40 seasons, as long as he can stay as healthy as he has this season, or at least close.

Think about it this way: Acuña has averaged 42 stolen bases per 162 games throughout his career and prides himself in playing every day if he’s healthy enough to do so. He doesn’t want a day off, and manager Brian Snitker is fine with playing him every day, though he did give Acuña a partial rest day by DH’ing him once this season.

Even if were to DH a handful of times in seasons going forward, there’s no reason that would keep Acuña from running just as much, at least while he’s still in his 20s and has as much speed and fast-twitch explosiveness in his legs. — O’Brien

Backstory

Acuña entered Friday leading MLB with 140 runs, 207 hits and 365 total bases. The 2018 NL Rookie of the Year closed in on the 40-40 club with a two-homer night Tuesday against the Philadelphia Phillies, his fourth such game of the season.
