MORE:            Rolen, who spent parts of the first seven seasons of his 17-year major league career with the Phillies, was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame this past January and enshrined into Cooperstown on July 23. A second-round draft pick of the Phillies in 1993, Rolen debuted in the majors in August 1996. During his time in Philadelphia, he hit .282 with a .373 on-base percentage and a .504 slugging percentage. He had 207 doubles, 150 home runs, 559 RBI, 426 walks, 533 runs and 71 stolen bases as a Phillie. 

The highlight of Rolen’s tenure with the Phillies came in 1997 when he was the unanimous choice as National League Rookie of the Year. He was the first Phillie to win that honor since another young third baseman – Dick Allen – did so in 1964. A brilliant defender, Rolen earned four of his Gold Gloves as a Phillie, the first as a 23-year-old in 1998. He hit .290 with 45 doubles, 31 home runs, 110 RBI and a .923 OPS while playing in 160 games for the Phillies that season. 

Rolen moved on to St. Louis in 2002 and later played in Toronto and Cincinnati. He won a World Series with the Cardinals in 2006. He finished his career with a .281 batting average, 517 doubles, 43 triples, 316 home runs, 1,287 RBI, 899 walks, 1,211 runs, 118 steals and an .855 OPS in 2,038 games. His 70.1 bWAR during his career ranked sixth in baseball in that span, trailing only Alex Rodriguez (116.4), Albert Pujols (91.5), Barry Bonds (88.8), Chipper Jones (82.4) and Derek Jeter (73.2).
