Alex Bregman drops Breggy Bomb and epic blast as Astros clinch 6th Al West title

In what’s now becoming an H-Town fall rite of passage, the Houston Astros have just clinched their sixth American League West Division title in the past seven seasons on Sunday, October 1. The Stros cemented the title with a big, 8-1 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field.


Also keeping things official: On Sunday, the Seattle Mariners bested the Texas Rangers 1-0, ensuring the Astros’ top-line status.

Superstar Alex Bregman, who is quickly rising to legend status in Houston, handed the D-Backs a Breggy Bomb, and handed fans a bomb line that may just become this year’s Astros rally:

“A lot of people were wondering what it was gonna be like if the Stros didn’t win the division,” Bregman told his teammates in the clubhouse after the win, goggles on and Dom Pérignon in hand in a video captured by KPRC Channel 2 sports reporter Ari Alexander.

And then: “I guess we’ll never know.” Amazing.

The Astros clubhouse exploded in yells and sprays of Champagne as the normally steely eyed, understated Bregman (who is becoming a quiet comedy star via recent H-E-B commercials) hopped up and down with his guys.

Sunday’s win marks 12 division titles, 17 playoff berths in franchise history, and a franchise record seventh consecutive season heading to the playoffs in a row (2017-2023). The Astros have also won the AL West the last three consecutive seasons (2017-19, 2021-23) in six overall division titles.


As for the manager Dusty Baker, who’s been the topic of debate among talking heads and fans, this win marks his fourth consecutive postseason bids with the Astrios. Baker is now the first manager in MLB history to win division titles with five different clubs (Astros, Nationals, Reds, Cubs, and Giants), with 10 division titles under his belt.

He also boasts a promising 28-14 record in the postseason with the Astros, good news as the team looks ahead.

Nailing six straight ALCS titles (2017-2022) is a historic feat for our Houston Astros, the first American League team to do so. Only the 1991-99 Atlanta Braves, during a dominant sweep, accomplished such a feat in Major League Baseball.

It’s never too early in Houston to talk World Series, so a quick reminder that the Stros have headed to the championships four of the last six seasons (2017, 2019, 2021, and 2022). We all remember the unforgettable World Series titles in ’17, our first, and ’22, our most recent.

To celebrate the next run, fans can head to the Astros Center Field Team Store, which will remain open for a 24-hour event from Sunday, October 1 through 7 pm Monday, October 2. Fans can stock up on gear and look forward to visits from the Shooting Stars (10 am – 11 am and 5 pm – 6 pm) and Orbit (noon – 1 pm). Monday shoppers can score free coffee and pastries as they grab gear.

Meanwhile, the Center Field Team Store will have expanded Postseason hours beginning this week and running until the conclusion of the postseason: 9 am to 7 pm Monday through Friday and 9 am – 2 pm on Saturdays.

GONE FISHIN'

State of Texas stocks Houston-area ponds with thousands of trout

Anglers get ready, because the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department will be stocking various Houston-area ponds with rainbow trout as part of their annual winter tradition.

"The goal of the rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) stocking program is to release catchable size rainbow trout into reservoir tail waters, lakes, ponds, and urban ponds in Texas to provide winter fishing opportunities," says TPWD press spokesman Kirk McDonnell. "The rainbow trout stocking program has increased from 10,000 rainbow trout stocked in four sites in 1966 to 359,000 rainbow trout stocked in 200 sites in 2023-24. Over 6,200,000 catchable size rainbow trout have been stocked by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department over the last 20 years."


The Kickerillo-Mischer preserve in Cypress and Tom Bass Park in South Houston were restocked in early December, though they are getting additional fish this month as well. Other Houston-area parks with ponds that will receive rainbow trout in January are Bane, Eisenhower, and Sheldon. Waterways in Friendswood, Conroe, Spring, Katy, Missouri City, Pasadena, and Rosenberg are all participating in the program. For a full list of parks and restocking dates, visit the TPWD website.

Anglers are encouraged to bag the five-fish maximum during the winter months. Rainbow trout do not do well in the warmer seasons and will not survive the summer. Recommended equipment are a light-action rod and reel with small hooks and light line, small bobbers, and small split shot. While rainbow trout can grow to almost 50 pounds., the ones being released into Texas lakes and ponds are generally between 1-5 pounds, so lightweight equipment is fine. Preferred baits are salmon eggs, whole kernel corn, marshmallows, small worms, or prepared trout bait. Bring a cooler if planning to keep catches.

"The Rainbow Trout Program is a very popular program with urban and rural Texans," says McDonnell. "Rainbow Trout are stocked in 18 urban fishing ponds during winter months as part of the Neighborhood Fishin’ program. An additional 190 sites around the state are stocked at the request of District Fisheries Conservation and Management Biologists and at the request of partner cities and local parks departments. Spending time outdoors has been shown to be very beneficial for children and families. Fishing is a great way to connect young people with nature and can be great fun in the process."

For full park hours, restrictions, and other fishing information, contact the park you are planning to visit. Texas anglers do not require a license or stamp to fish within the boundaries of a Texas State Park, but anglers should always confirm whether a particular fishing spot falls under that jurisdiction. Children under 17 do not require licenses. Good luck on the banks this winter.
