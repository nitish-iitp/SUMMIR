Uncertainty looms over Tee Higgins' contract extension with Bengals
Coach Andy Reid trolled by NFL fans after late game decision in Chiefs' loss to Lions

In an exhilarating face-off against the Kansas City Chiefs, the Detroit Lions displayed exceptional grit, marking their territory right at the beginning of the NFL season. While the absence of Travis Kelce from the Chiefs' lineup was a notable miss, it's essential not to overlook the Lions' stellar play, which proved they're not just riding on the coattails of opponents' misfortunes.

Jared Goff, the Lions' quarterback, stood tall as he went on to 2-0 against Mahomes in his career. With a solid performance that saw him record 22-of-35 for 253 yards and a touchdown, Goff is making history. He now finds himself just a breath away from surpassing football giants Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers for the most consecutive pass attempts without an interception. Currently, his streak stands at 359, challenging Rodgers' record of 402 and Brady's of 399.

However, this wave of success wasn't always the forecast for Goff. A year earlier, following his trade from the Super Bowl-winning Los Angeles Rams, Goff seemed unlikely to pose any threat to records held by the likes of Rodgers or Brady. His initial journey with the Lions saw him post a 3-10-1 record in 2021. But the narrative began to shift in November. Despite early-season struggles, Goff and the Lions started finding their rhythm, culminating in a near playoff berth after a commendable 8-2 season finish.

This season, things are looking even brighter. The victory over the Chiefs wasn't solely a Goff show; it was a well-rounded team effort. The Lions managed an average gain of 5.3 yards per play, surpassing the formidable Chiefs led by Patrick Mahomes. The offensive line showcased their tenacity by allowing just one sack, executing 70 plays throughout the game. Dan Campbell's strategic play calls, combined with the synergy between Goff and wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, kept the Lions in sync.

Post-victory, an elated Goff expressed his sentiments to NBC Sports, emphasizing the team's focus and aspirations. "It means that we are 1-0. We come to every game expecting a win. We're excited to head back home as 1-0," he stated.

The scene post-match saw Goff rushing towards a group of Lions fans present at Arrowhead Stadium, sharing an impromptu celebration. Notably, Goff now boasts a 2-0 record against the celebrated Patrick Mahomes. The big question now: Will he continue this streak?

As the preseason betting odds hint at a playoff return for the Lions, the 2023 season could set new horizons for the team. With Goff at the helm and continuing his interception-free form, the sky's the limit for Detroit's aspirations.
