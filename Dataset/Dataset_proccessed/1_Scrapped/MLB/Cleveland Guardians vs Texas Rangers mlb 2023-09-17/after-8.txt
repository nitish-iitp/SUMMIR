Two years after MLB debut, Rangers’ Jake Latz returns to Cleveland in new role
Latz debuted in 2021 as a starting pitcher. Now, two years later, he’s back with the Rangers to help the bullpen.

CLEVELAND — His first MLB stint was one bred by necessity — emergency, even — for a last-place team.

Now, back in the same city that he made first-and-only major league start, Texas Rangers left-handed pitcher Jake Latz will be asked to help shore up a leaky bullpen in the midst of a playoff race.

Yeah, it’s different. In more ways than one.

“I think it’s exciting, honestly,” Latz said. “It forces you to raise your game to a new level.”

Latz, 27, was called up from Triple-A Round Rock on Saturday and joined the Rangers in Cleveland, the same city that he made his MLB debut in back in 2021.

The scenario then: Texas, on Aug. 25 of that year, was 30 games back of first place in the American League West with a shorthanded locker room due to COVID-19. He was added to the Rangers’ taxi squad and pitched 4 2/3 innings of three-run ball in his first career start against the Guardians. He was sent back down to Triple-A five days later.

Since then: He battled a shoulder injury in 2022 and was converted from a starting pitcher to a reliever. In 46 games — just five of which have been starts — for Round Rock this season, Latz has a 4.10 ERA in 63 2/3 innings pitched. He was told on Friday night that he’d earned a second-career stint with the Rangers.

“When you do hear your name finally, it’s an experience you obviously dream of,” Latz said. “But then when it happens, it’s just weird to take in. It didn’t hit me at first until I got here honestly.

“It’s kind of weird that it all came together like this again.”

Since the start of July, Latz has a 1.25 ERA in 36 innings with Round Rock, and 29 strikeouts to 15 walks.

“Finding my mentality out of the bullpen is a little different,” Latz said. “I’ve always been an even-keeled type of pitcher, but I’m trying to get a little more aggression behind my pitches, basically, out of the bullpen.”

Rangers manager Bruce Bochy got a look at Latz in spring training (where he pitched seven exhibition innings, largely in relief) and again in August when he pitched to catcher Jonah Heim in a live bullpen at Globe Life Field.

Bochy said that Latz will largely be used in a one-inning role, possibly two if needed.

“He’s got a live fastball, a lot of hop on it, and he’s got a good breaking ball,” Bochy said. “He’s pitched here before, so he’s got some experience. We just felt like he was the right fit for right now, the next couple of series.”
