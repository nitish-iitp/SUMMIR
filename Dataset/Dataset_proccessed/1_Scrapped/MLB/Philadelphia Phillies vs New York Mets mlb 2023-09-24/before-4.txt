Oregon Ducks head coach Dan Lanning went viral on Saturday over his pregame speech in which he disses Colorado Buffaloes HC Deion Sanders ahead of their faceoff at Autzen Stadium.

Lanning, 37, can be seen telling his players they're playing for wins, not "clicks" like the Buffaloes.

The speech is doubling down on previous comments made by him earlier in the week about YouTube videos not winning games, referencing Sanders' YT channel.

"The Cinderella story is over, men. They're fighting for clicks, we're fighting for wins. There's a difference. This game ain't going to be played in Hollywood. It's going to be played on the grass," Lanning said.

Lanning's pregame speech seemingly worked wonders, as the Ducks handed Sanders' Buffaloes their first loss of the season.

Deion Sanders deserves raise

Jeremy Bloom, a former Colorado and NFL player, told TMZ Sports that Sanders deserves a pay raise, perhaps even more than what Nick Saban earns.

"You've got to put that in front of him," Bloom said. "Because right now, the buyout is just too small. Any team can come together, get a bunch of boosters, buy him out and give him some long-term deal."

Bloom explained how Sanders should get $16 million per years for the next 10 seasons.

Sanders is currently signed to a five-year, $29.5 million, which gives him about $6 million a season. Some NFL teams are already looking to acquire his services.
