Dodgers News: Brusdar Graterol Has Emotional Reunion With Mother

The Los Angeles Dodgers extended their winning streak to five games with a 3-2 walk-off victory against the Detroit Tigers on a night that was emotional for Brusdar Graterol.

Caleb Ferguson, Ryan Pepiot, Graterol and Alex Vesia combined to allow two runs on six hits and struck out eight in comparison to just one walk.

Graterol retired all three batters faced in the eighth and extended his scoreless streak to 21 innings. It was a special performance for the right-hander as he reunited with his mother, Ysmalia, for the first time in seven years.

Ysmalia, who lives in Venezuela, recently flew to Los Angeles and got to watch her son pitch in a Major League game for the first time. “We’ve been working on this for seven years,” Graterol explained.

“The last two weeks we kind of moved it a little more forward when we got a document to help her get here. We obviously wanted to do it as fast as possible, and luckily we were able to do it this past weekend.”

Graterol was overcome with emotions when coming out of the bullpen and walking off the mound.

“When I first came out, I felt fine. Then when I got onto the mound, there were a lot of memories and things that went through my head and I got a little bit more emotional,” he said. “But once the music started playing and I got ready to make that first pitch, I felt back to being OK.”

Graterol had a close relationship with his mother growing up and was grateful to see her again. The 25-year-old was also happy she got to meet his daughter for the first time. “It’s an incredible moment,” Graterol began.

“Obviously there’s been a lot of things that were really hard. When I made my debut, she wasn’t here. When I got married, she wasn’t here. When I had my daughter, she wasn’t here. Those were very difficult times, so to be able to now share that with her is very special.”

Prior to Tuesday, Graterol’s mother last saw him pitch in 2015 in the Dominican Republic.

How many Dodgers games will Brusdar Graterol’s mother attend?

Graterol revealed that his mother is sticking in Los Angeles for the remainder of the 2023 season and through the playoffs.

“She’ll be here with us for the end of this season and hopefully to celebrate the World Series,” he said.
