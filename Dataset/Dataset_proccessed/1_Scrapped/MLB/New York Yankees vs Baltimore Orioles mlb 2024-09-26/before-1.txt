Baltimore Orioles vs New York Yankees Prediction 

Baltimore was able to pick up another big win in game two of this series on Wednesday night, as they are between the Yankees and the AL East title. New York needs one more win to clinch the division and they are 42-35 at home, while Baltimore is 44-33 on the road. The Orioles are starting Corbin Burnes, who has been great in his last four starts but has faced the Tigers (twice), Rays, and White Sox in his last three. New York is going with Gerrit Cole, who has been mostly solid over the last two months but did struggle in his last home start. This is going to be a great pitching matchup to watch, but I think the offenses have the advantage, as both lineups are great. Take the over here.
