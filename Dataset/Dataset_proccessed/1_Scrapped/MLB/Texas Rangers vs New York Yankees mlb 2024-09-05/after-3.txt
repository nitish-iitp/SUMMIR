Texas Rangers lineup for September 5, 2024 against the Los Angeles Angels: starting pitchers are Cody Bradford for the Rangers and Jack Kochanowicz for the Angels.

The Rangers are facing a pitcher I have never heard of today. I even went to B-R to make sure that someone wasn’t funning me about this Jack Kochanowicz guy. He is apparently a real pitcher who has started six games in the majors this year, thrown 32 innings, and has somehow struck out just 12 of 137 batters faced. That’s amazing.

The lineup:

Semien — 2B

Langford — LF

Smith — SS

Garcia — RF

Lowe — 1B

Jung — 3B

Heim — C

Taveras — CF

Kelly — DH

7:05 p.m. Central start time. Rangers are -190 favorites.
