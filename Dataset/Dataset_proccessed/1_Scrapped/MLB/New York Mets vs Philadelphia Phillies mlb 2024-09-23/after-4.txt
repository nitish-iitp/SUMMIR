MLB: Philadelphia Phillies at New York Mets - Source: Imagn

The Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Mets took the field for the last game of the four-game series at Citi Field. While the Phillies have already clinched a playoff berth, the Mets are hanging on to the last NL Wild Card spot. They are getting stiff competition from the Atlanta Braves.

Zack Wheeler (16-6, 2.56 ERA) started the game for the Phillies, while Tylor Megill (4-5, 4.08) was on the mound for the Mets.

The Phillies struck first as Alec Bohm's RBI single drove in Trea Turner for the first run of the game in the first inning. Zack Wheeler swiftly got past the Braves hitters in his first inning.

The Mets tied the game on Tyrone Taylor's RBI single that drove in Mark Vientos in the second inning. Both pitchers went on to put up blanks on the scoreboard as offense came hard for both teams at Citi Field. After pitching four innings for one run, Megill was replaced by reliever Phil Maton on the mound in the fifth inning.

Trending

Finally a breakthrough came in as Brandon Nimmo homered a solo shot off Wheeler in the sixth inning, giving the Mets a pivotal 2-1 run lead in the game.

The Phillies came close to tying the game in the ninth but Mets closer Edwin Diaz held up. Diaz first retired Nick Castellanos before walking Bryson Stott. With JT Realmuto at the plate, Stott stole second base to get into scoring position. Brandon Marsh was also walked to make things exciting with Kody Clemens at the plate for the final out with runners at and third.

Diaz just needed four pitches to strike out Clemens to end the ball game 2-1 in favor of the Mets, who played their last regular season game in Citi Field. They will now play three game series each with the Atlanta Braves and the Milwaukee Brewers in Truist Park and American Family Field, respectively.
