HITTER RECAP

Mi Casas Es Su Casas

The 2024 season hasn’t gone exactly as planned for Triston Casas, as a rib injury robbed him of about four months of playing time. He is doing his best to end the season on a high note as he blasted 3 HRs in Game 1 of a doubleheader to lead the Red Sox to victory over Pablo Lopez and the Twins. The 24-year-old has showcased a nice combination of plate discipline and power during his season and a half of Major League baseball and could be a breakout candidate for 2025.

 

Let’s see how the other hitters did Sunday:
Kerry Carpenter (DET): 2-3, 2 HR, 2 R, 2 RBI. 

Just like Riley Greene did last Sunday, Kerry Carpenter put the Tigers on his back to secure a huge 4-3 win over the Orioles to keep Detroit tied with Kansas City for the last two Wild Card spots. The HRs were Carpenter’s 16th and 17th of the year and he is sporting an impressive .290/.351/.601 hitting line for the season, albeit mostly as a platoon hitter against RHP.

 

Oneil Cruz (PIT): 1-3, HR, R, RBI, 2 BB. 

Oneil Cruz is starting to adjust nicely to life in CF and it looks like it is translating over to the plate. After securing his first 20/20 season earlier this week, Cruz hit his 21st HR of the season off Reds All-Star Hunter Greene. You also love to see the walks from Cruz whose 0.45 BB/K ratio from August and September is far better than his career 0.26 BB/K ratio.

 

Zach Neto (LAA): 3-5, 2 HR, 2B, 3 R, 6 RBI. 

The bright spots are few and far between for the Angels these days, but Zach Neto provided a big one in Los Angeles’ 9-8 win over the division-leading Astros. It was actually the 2nd time Neto has driven in 6 runs this season, joining Mo Vaughn, Kendrys Morales and Mike Trout as the only Angels players to accomplish the feat. He now has 23 HRs and 77 RBIs for the season, excellent numbers for a middle infielder on a poor offensive team.

 

Alex Bregman (HOU): 3-4, HR, 3 R, 3 RBI. 

Alex Bregman did his best to carry Houston to victory, with 3 hits and 3 RBIs to go with his 25th HR of the season. Bregman has turned into the model of consistency in the power department as he reached 25 HRs for the 2nd consecutive season, although his OBP has taken a surprising downturn in 2024.

 

Eugenio Suarez (ARI): 2-5, HR, R, RBI. 

It has been a tale of two seasons for Eugenio Suarez, who has been on an absolute tear over the past few months. Entering July, Suarez had hit only 6 HRs and was looking at a 2nd consecutive down year in the power department. Since the beginning of July, Suarez has hit 23 HRs and could have a major impact as the playoffs loom.

 

Miguel Amaya (CHC): 2-3, HR, 2B, R, 2 RBI. 

25-year-old Miguel Amaya has seemingly taken over the primary catcher role for the Cubs and he has turned into a modestly reliable contributor at the plate. The HR was Amaya’s 8th of the season and he is slashing .294/.400/.647 over the last week.

 

Leodys Taveras (TEX): 3-4, HR, 3 R, RBI, SB. 

There will be no repeat playoff run for the Texas Rangers this season but don’t tell Leodys Taveras that. The 26-year-old roped 3 hits off Seattle pitching, including his 12th HR of the season and added his 21st steal for good measure. The switch-hitting Taveras has picked it up over the last week as well, hitting .320/.370/.560.

 

Aaron Judge (NYY): 2-3, HR, 2B, 2 R, RBI. 

MVP #1 on this list had a ho-hum day at the plate as all he did was hit his 55th HR of the season and get on base 4 times in the Yankees win over Oakland. Just an absolute beast at the plate.

 

Shohei Ohtani (LAD): 4-5, HR, 2 R, RBI, 2 SB. 

MVP #2 put MVP #1 to shame this past week and he did it again on Sunday with his 53rd HR of the year to tie the game in the bottom of the 9th. Oh yeah, he also had his 54th and 55th stolen bases to go with his 4 hits. Over the past week, Ohtani is hitting .500/.543/1.125 with 6 HRs, 17 RBI and 7 stolen bases. I really hope every baseball fan in the world can appreciate the greatness we are witnessing with Ohtani because we’ve never seen anything like him before and who knows if we ever will again.

 

Jurickson Profar (SD): 2-3, HR, R, 2 RBI, SB. 

Finally we have Jurickson Profar who hit his 24th HR and stole his 10th base of the season in a 4-2 Padres win over the White Sox. The 31-year-old Profar is having easily the best season of his solid big league career as he has set or tied career-highs in HRs, RBI, walks, stolen bases, AVG, OBP and SLG.
