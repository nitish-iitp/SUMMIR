Cubs Pitching Dominated

The Cubs pitching dominated against the Washington Nationals. The pitching gave up eight hits, but the offense gave up zero runs and that was the victory. Shota Imagna went seven innings, giving up six hits and zero runs. The Cubs are averaging 4.57 runs, while their pitching is giving up 4.15 runs per game. The offense is ranked 13th in the league, while the pitching is ranked 12th. They do have a positive run differential of 0.43 runs per game, which is 13th in the league. Ian Happ has hit 25 home runs and driven in 85 RBIs so far this season. 

Phillies Look to Bounce Back

The Phillies faced off against the New York Mets on Sunday, and the offense wasn’t good enough. The Phillies scored only one run and that wasn’t enough as they were defeated by a run. Zack Wheeler went seven innings, giving up two hits and one run. Even though it was a good start, it wasn’t enough because there wasn’t run support. The Phillies are averaging 4.87 runs, while their pitching is giving up 4.08 runs per game. The offense is ranked 4th in the league, while the pitching is ranked 9th. Kyle Schwarber has hit 36 home runs and driven in 99 RBIs so far this season. 

Getting the start for the Phillies will be Aaron Nola, who sits with a 12-8 record and an ERA of 3.54. In his last start against the Milwaukee Brewers, he went seven innings, giving up three hits and one run. 

Why the Phillies Will Beat the Cubs
The Phillies have won eight of their last nine home games after playing the previous day.
The Cubs have lost four of their last five games against NL East opponents that held a winning record.
The Cubs have failed to cover the run line in six of their last seven night games against NL East opponents.
The Phillies have covered the run line in three of their last four games against NL Central opponents following a road loss.
Chicago Cubs vs Philadelphia Phillies Prediction

The Phillies are going to get the job done here. The Phillies' offense struggled on Sunday, but they are going to give up even fewer runs here. Nola sits with an ERA of 3.54, and he’s going to dominate the Cubs' offense here. The Phillies' offense is better than they showed on Sunday, and they are going to get out to a fast start. The Cubs are going to have no answer. Back the Phillies on the money line to cash here.
