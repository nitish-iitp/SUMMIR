Burrow, who has been grappling with a calf injury sustained during a training camp, aggravated it in the Week 2 loss against the Baltimore Ravens, leaving fans and teammates concerned about his participation. However, recent developments have seen Burrow actively taking first-team reps during Cincy's Sunday walkthrough, reinforcing the optimism around his return.

The injury has been lingering for Burrow

The calf injury had initially sidelined Burrow for a month of training camp, visibly affecting his performance and causing him noticeable discomfort during the Bengals' Week 2 loss. Cincinnati's 0-2 start to the season has been a deep contrast to the Super Bowl-caliber performances fans have been accustomed to seeing from Burrow in previous years.
