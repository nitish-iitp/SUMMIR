Wyatt Langford saves day again for Texas Rangers with robbery: ‘He’s Superman’
Fresh off hitting a walkoff grand slam the previous night, Langford saved the Rangers once again. But this time, it was with his glove.

ARLINGTON — You can call him Walkoff Wyatt. Or, even, Walkoff, Texas Ranger. He might best be called the Sandman because, in consecutive games, Wyatt Langford has put Dallas-Fort Worth to sleep.

“He’s Superman,” Rangers outfielder Leody Taveras said Wednesday night.

He did save the day after all.

Again.

Langford robbed a would-be three-run home run from Giancarlo Stanton at the left field wall to end the Rangers’ 10-6 win vs. the New York Yankees on Wednesday at Globe Life Field. That came just one game after he hit a walkoff grand slam in Tuesday’s win vs. the Yankees. Tuesday’s grand slam was his third career walkoff hit.

Stanton’s flyout was a low shot that left the bat at 103.9 mph. Langford played “way back,” as he said, because of Stanton’s propensity for deep, hard-hit balls. The 22-year-old left fielder backpedaled and leaped at the Medical City branding on the wall to take away a home run that would’ve pulled the Yankees within one run of the Rangers.

Between Tuesday’s walkoff hit and Wednesday’s game-winning robbery, it’s evident that Langford — maybe more than anyone — wants to wrap these games up in a timely manner. His teammates, fans and reporters alike can appreciate the effort.

“Yeah, me too,” Langford said with a laugh. “That was a bit of a long one.”

Wednesday’s game — which ran 3:11 and was an out away from finishing before the duo of Matt Festa and Grant Anderson allowed four runs in the bottom of the ninth inning on three walks and a Trent Grisham grand slam — was Texas’ longest since Aug. 12 against the Boston Red Sox. Partly because of that drawn-out ninth inning that Langford ended. Partly because the Rangers’ offense broke loose for its first double-digit run game since July 24 vs. the Chicago White Sox.

Langford was at the heart of that. He went 3 for 4 with three runs scored, two runs driven in and a walk. He’s slashed .296/.377/.519 with three home runs and 13 RBIs in his last 15 games and has driven in six runs in consecutive games as the Rangers’ two-hole hitter.

“You look at last night and tonight, he continued to swing it well,” Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said. “He got some big hits for us and that catch. He’s playing some terrific ball. He’s in a good place right now. I think, watching him play, he’s really playing with a lot of confidence.”
