Stats Insider's Rangers vs Yankees predictions are based on detailed simulations and wagering experience to give you the best possible advice every day of the year.

While the Yankees have a higher chance of winning the game, betting on the Rangers to win is our recommended option because of the 2.5% edge found when comparing our data-led probabilities to the odds currently on offer.

Taking advantage of the edges seen here at Stats Insider is one of the keys to being profitable in the long run.

Furthermore, despite the Over being more likely to hit in this game, Under 8.5 is our best bet because of the better odds ($1.91) that are available from TAB.
