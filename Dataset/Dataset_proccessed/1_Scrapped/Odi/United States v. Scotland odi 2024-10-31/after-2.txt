United States of America form

The United States of America side will look to finally get into a groove as they suffered various losses during the previous games. Openers Andries Gous and Shayan Jahangir will be the pacesetters. For two consecutive games, he has not even reached the double-digit mark, thereby amassing an aggregate of 150 with 2 half-centuries and he is in 5 innings. On the other hand, Jahangir has scored a century in the last match and scored 244 runs in the tournament at an average of 48.80. Captain Monark Patel will bat at number three. He is a consistent batsman and has scored 383 runs in 10 games, with a century and three half-centuries.

It was observed that Saiteja Mukkamalla, Milind Kumar, and Sanjay Krishnamurthi are most probably batted in the middle. Of all the USA batter with the highest average at 85.33 who amassed 256 runs through five innings with one hundred and two half-centuries was Mukkamalla. Kumar has not had too much to do anything about except for the previous game where he got on the duck. Yet again he has been pretty constant for the middle order in a batting average of 52 and 364 runs through nine innings. He has also been active with the ball, taking 8 wickets at a mean of 19.50 - the best for USA bowlers.

Leaders in the bowling department are Saurabh Netravalkar, Jasdeep Singh, Shadley van Schalkwyk, and Nosthush Kenjige. Netravalkar has been effective as he has snapped 9 wickets from 6 matches at an economy rate of 4.28. It's Van Schalkwyk who is the one having 14 wickets in 8 matches and at the same time has given some handy contributions with bat also by scoring 126 runs in 5 innings. All eyes on Nosthush Kenjige, who remains the highest wicket taker with 17 wickets at an economy of 4.28.

United States of America Probable Playing XI

Andries Gous, Shayan Jahangir, Monank Patel (c & wk), Saiteja Mukkamalla, Milind Kumar, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Harmeet Singh, Jasdeep Singh, Nosthush Kenjige, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Saurabh Netravalkar.

Scotland Form

Scotland has to win all the remaining matches to come at the top of the table. For this purpose, some of the players will have to be reinstated in the team. Charlie Tear and Andrew Umeed also have a very impressive unbeaten opening partnership of 145 runs against the USA. Tear has scored 186 runs in 8 matches while Umeed has scored 120 runs in three games. Micheal English must replace Tear as he made a century in his first match against Namibia. Brandon McMullen will bat at number three with an average of 28.14 in 9 games. Captain Ritchie Berrington will bat in the middle order along with Michael Jones, Matthew Cross, and Michael Leask. Berrington has the highest average among the regular Scottish batters at 61.75 with 247 runs in 8 games. George Munsey has been the top run-scorer with 302 runs in 6 games, but he is not sure of his selection. All-rounder Leask could not make any difference in both bat and ball, taking 6 wickets in 9 games. The bowling will be led by Bradley Currie along with Brandon McMullen, Christopher Sole, and Mark Watt. Currie is the highest wicket-taker for Scotland with 13 wickets at an average of 13.92. He will be a player to watch out for in the matches. McMullen has also done well with 11 wickets in 9 games and an economy rate of 3.56. On the whole, the bowlers of Scotland have done better than the batters in this tournament.

Scotland Predicted Lineup

Andrew Umeed, Charlie Tear, Brandon McMullen, Richie Berrington (c), Michael Jones, Matthew Cross (wk), Michael Leask, Mark Watt, Brad Wheal, Jack Jarvis, Bradley Currie.

United States of America vs Scotland Expert Tips & Prediction

The USA team had some miserable news and public backlash during the social media recently due to which this victory will have an adverse effect of loss of confidence despite success against Nepal. Scotland played very well against the ODIs in their last ODIs where they won the last four and lost to one in five matches out of five where they succeeded and their winning percentage percentage is more in comparison of the USA and hence by these reasons the Scotland wins against the USA in future match.
