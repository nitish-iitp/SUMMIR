The tour of Sri Lanka will start on January 6, 2024, with the ODI series, and all matches of the tour will be played at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo

The Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) have announced their squad for the upcoming tour of Sri Lanka, with Craig Ervine returning to lead the side in the three-match ODI series. Sean Williams, who picked up a side injury in the second T20I in Harare last month, will also miss the tour. 

The selectors have announced uncapped spinner Tapiwa Mufudza after picking up 18 wickets in the domestic season. Pacer Faraz Akram, who was called up for the Ireland ODIs, has also been retained in the ODI side.

After Dave Houghton stepped down as the Head Coach of the side, Walter Chawaguta will be the interim head coach for the tour. Houghton stepped down after a series of terrible performances that saw them not making it to the ODI World Cup in India and also failing to make it to the T20 World Cup in West Indies and USA, set to be played in June this year.

The tour of Sri Lanka will start on January 6, 2024, with the ODI series, and all matches of the tour will be played at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. 

ODI squad: Craig Ervine (capt), Faraz Akram, Ryan Burl, Joylord Gumbie, Luke Jongwe, Takudzwanashe Kaitano, Tinashe Kamunhukamwe, Clive Madande, Wellington Masakadza, Tapiwa Mufudza, Tony Munyonga, Blessing Muzarabani, Richard Ngarava, Sikandar Raza, Shumba Milton

T20I squad: Sikandar Raza (capt), Brian Bennett, Ryan Burl, Craig Ervine, Joylord Gumbie, Luke Jongwe, Tinashe Kamunhukamwe, Clive Madande, Wellington Masakadza, Carl Mumba, Tony Munyonga, Blessing Muzarabani, Ainsley Ndlovu, Richard Ngarava, Milton Shumba
