Afghanistan vs South Africa 3rd ODI, Check Highlights From Sharjah Cricket Stadium (X)

Afghanistan vs South Africa 3rd ODI Highlights: 

Aiden Markram’s calm innings helped South Africa avoid suffering a series clean sweep by Afghanistan with a seven-wicket victory in the third one-day international in Sharjah on Sunday.

The Proteas cruised to their target of 170 after bowling out their opponents cheaply thanks to an unbeaten 69 from Markram, having briefly wobbled at 80-3.

“I am happy with the performance. We were happy to up our skills today,” said South Africa captain Temba Bavuma.

“We were quite clinical with the bat. In terms of the series, not what we planned for.”

Afghanistan had already wrapped up a historic series triumph after winning the first two matches but struggled with the bat after winning the toss.

Only the in-form Rahmanullah Gurbaz put up any real fight with an excellent, 94-ball 89, but when he fell Afghanistan were 132-7.

Key batters Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi and Ikram Alikhil were all run out in a haphazard display.

Tail-ender AM Ghazanfar smashed 31 not out off 15 deliveries to at least give Afghanistan hope.

South Africa had been bowled out for 106 and 134 in the opening two games but found life easier against an Afghan attack missing the rested Rashid Khan and Fazalhaq Farooqi.

Afghanistan were still in the contest when Reeza Hendricks was dismissed by Fareed Ahmad, but Markram and Tristan Stubbs, who ended 26 not out, saw South Africa home with an unbroken stand of 90.

“Feeling very happy with the series win,” said Afghan skipper Shahidi.

“I would be more happy if we would have won this match. At the same time, we were looking to give the youngsters more chance.

“Today, the run outs were a big reason why we didn’t finish on top.”

… THE RUN CHASE …

SEP 23, 2024
01:45 IST

South Africa’s bowlers were in complete control from the start, applying relentless pressure that left Afghanistan searching for answers. With a modest target of 170 runs in 50 overs, South Africa appears well-positioned to end the series with a win, especially with the absence of Afghanistan’s star bowler Rashid Khan. Can Afghanistan pull off a remarkable defence, or will South Africa cruise to a comfortable victory? Stay tuned to find out.

Afghanistan’s head coach, Jonathan Trott is in for a chat. He says that before the game, he was happier than he is right now. Trott feels they have lacked in decision-making with their running between the wickets and are a few runs short. He believes that playing three games in five days serves as good practice for the Champions Trophy where there is going to be a similar gap between games.

Lower-order batter Allah Ghazanfar provided some resistance toward the end, managing to push Afghanistan to a somewhat respectable total. However, the innings was marred by a series of run-outs, caused by poor communication between batters, which further stunted any chance of a late surge.

Afghanistan are bundled out for a mere 169 runs by an outstanding display with the ball and on the field by South Africa. Temba Bavuma and his men have been on top of their game from the start of the innings and have given themselves a very good chance to win the third ODI. With a total of 170 on the board, Afghanistan look in some trouble.

33.6 – OUT! TAKEN! Nqabayomzi Peter wraps things up! Naveed Zadran is disappointed, having failed to clear the ropes. It was in the slot though for Naveed but he is tucked up for room as Peter follows him. Zadran is unable to free his arms in a fashion he would have liked. Swings through the line but does not get the elevation. Hits it flat and straight to long on where Aiden Markram leaps and takes it over his head. Peter ends with two wickets to his name. Afghanistan have been bowled out for 169.
