Afghanistan vs South Africa Commentary
6:12 PM IST Right then, that wraps up what has been a thoroughly entertaining first-ever bilateral series between Afghanistan and South Africa. Hashmatullah Shahidi collects the trophy and joins his teammates as confetti is popped, with the team posing for pictures with their well-deserved silverware. Looking ahead, South Africa will now head to Abu Dhabi for their white-ball series against Ireland, starting with the T20I series on Friday, 27th September, followed by the ODIs. As for Afghanistan, their next assignment will be a multi-format series in Zimbabwe in December, though the exact dates are yet to be confirmed. That’s all from us for now. Goodbye and cheers!
6:09 PM IST The skipper of Afghanistan, Hashmatullah Shahidi says that it is a good feeling to win the series and there were many learnings for them in this series. Mentions that he would have been more happy had they won this game but at the same time, they wanted to give some game time to the youngsters. Reckons that the run outs cost them in this game. Shares that there are a lot of youngsters who have a bright future for Afghanistan.
6:07 PM IST South Africa captain Temba Bavuma expresses his satisfaction with the team's performance, stating that he is pleased with how they elevated their skills. He commends their clinical approach with the bat, acknowledging that while the series didn't go as planned, the players gained valuable experience and learning from it. Bavuma highlights the importance of handling the Powerplay, which he and Tony de Zorzi managed effectively, and praises the middle-order for carrying on the momentum. He also notes that the dew played a role, helping the ball skid on the surface. Overall, he is happy with the day’s outcome.
5:59 PM IST Rahmanullah Gurbaz is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH, albeit in a losing cause, as he waged a lone battle for Afghanistan with the bat. He is also the PLAYER OF THE SERIES for scoring 194 runs in the series. He says that he is happy with his performance and states that it feels good to perform against a quality side like South Africa. Feels that he could have done better in this game. Further says that he is looking forward to carrying this confidence in future games.
5:48 PM IST Time for the presentation...
5:45 PM IST Earlier in the game, the toss went Afghanistan's way, and they opted to bat first. South Africa bowled well, consistently targeting the stumps during the Powerplay. The visitors chipped away at the wickets throughout the middle phase, with three run outs contributing to Afghanistan's downfall. While Rahmanullah Gurbaz kept the runs flowing, his aggressive approach led to his dismissal. AM Ghazanfar hit a few lusty blows but was left stranded as Afghanistan were bowled out for 169 with 16 overs unused. For South Africa, their bowling effort was well-supported by their fielders, with Lungi Ngidi, Nqabayomzi Peter, and Andile Phehlukwayo each taking two wickets, while Bjorn Fortuin chipped in with one.
