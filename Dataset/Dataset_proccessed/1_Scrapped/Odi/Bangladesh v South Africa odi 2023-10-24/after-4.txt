South Africa vs Bangladesh Highlights, Cricket World Cup 2023

South Africa vs Bangladesh Highlights, Cricket World Cup 2023: A dazzling batting display by Quinton de Kock proved to be pivotal as South Africa thrashed Bangladesh by 149 runs in ODI 23 of the ongoing 2023 World Cup, in Mumbai on Tuesday. Chasing 383, Bangladesh top-order was rattled right from the start by the likes of Marco Jansen, Kagiso Rabada. Bangladesh lost openers Tanzid Hasan and Litton Das for 12 and 22 respectively, as Jansen and Rabada scalped their wickets. Meanwhile, Jansen struck again to remove Najmul Hossain Shanto for a golden duck. Meanwhile, captain Shakib Al Hasan (1) fell cheaply to Lizaad Williams. Batting at no. 6, Mahmudullah proved to be the only bright spot for Bangladesh in the second innings, smacking his third World Cup ton (111 off 111 balls). But his knock didn't really make a difference as he didn't find any suitable partner as Bangladesh were eventually bowled out for 233 in 46.4 overs. Other than Jansen's two-wicket haul, Gerald Coetzee scalped three dismissals. Meanwhile, there were two-wicket hauls for Lizaad Williams and Kagiso Rabada too....Read More

South Africa vs Bangladesh Live Score: Pitch report by Dinesh Karthik

South Africa vs Bangladesh Live Score: “The square boundaries are shorter as compared to the straighter ones. You need to hit the deck hard in order to get wickets here. It's similar to the pitch that was played between England and South Africa. A pretty good surface to bat on. The weather suits Bangladesh, but the pitch suits South Africa.”

South Africa vs Bangladesh Live Score: Marco Jansen on his batting

Marco Jansen hammered an unbeaten 75 off 42 balls in the previous match against England, which featured three 4s and six 6s.

"I enjoy scoring runs more than taking wickets; there's not so much running involved. I just love batting. Whenever I bat, it gives me more joy. Bowling is more hard work. It's nicer seeing a ball fly 80 metres off your own bat than your bowling." - the tailender said about his thoughts as a batter.
