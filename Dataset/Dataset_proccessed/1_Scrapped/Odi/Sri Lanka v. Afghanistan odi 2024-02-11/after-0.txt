COMMENTRY
That's it from this game then. The series is done and dusted but there is still a game to go. Afghanistan will look to avoid the whitewash whereas, Sri Lanka will look to make it 3-0. That game will be played on 14th this month. It will begin at 1430 IST (0900 GMT). Till then, goodbye and take care!
Hashmatullah Shahidi says losing is not good and he is not happy. Adds the middle order did not do well and fielding was also poor and that is what dost them. Ends by saying the bowling and the fielding needs to improve and they need to be a lot more disciplined.
Charith Asalanka, MAN OF THE MATCH, says he is happy with how he played. Adds he was looking at 270 but Janith Liyanage batted really well and made 300 possible. Mentions he tried for the ton but couldn't get there.
... PRESENTATION TIME ...
For Lanka, barring the initial few overs, they were really good. Fernando was excellent and so was Hasaranga. Theekshana was also decent and Madhushanka came back strongly towards the end. It was a combined bowling effort by the hosts to seal the series.
A convincing win and Lanka have sealed the series with a game to go. Another Afghanistan collapse in this tour. It happened in the Test and now here. They were going along well when Shah and Zadran were batting, once that stand was broken, it all fell apart. They slipped from 143 for 2 to 155 all out. The middle order just did not step up and in the end, the margin of defeat is a massive one.
