Despite early setbacks with the openers departing cheaply, Kusal Mendis (61) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (52) provided stability, forming a crucial 103-run partnership for the third wicket. Both batsmen, however, benefited from dropped catches before falling within eight deliveries of each other. Asalanka, unbeaten on 97 off 74 deliveries, including nine fours and two sixes, guided Sri Lanka to 308 with a boundary in the last over of the innings.

NEW DELHI: Four half-centuries helped Sri Lanka to a total of 308 for six after they opted to bat first in the second one-day international against Afghanistan in Kandy on Sunday.
Despite early setbacks with the openers departing cheaply, Kusal Mendis (61) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (52) provided stability, forming a crucial 103-run partnership for the third wicket. Both batsmen, however, benefited from dropped catches before falling within eight deliveries of each other.


Samarawickrama's dismissal occurred as he hit one straight to mid-wicket, where Mohammad Nabi made the breakthrough with a catch.
Mendis, attempting to take on Azmatullah Omarzai, failed to clear a fielder at deep mid-wicket, and Omarzai finished with three wickets.

The fifth-wicket partnership between Charith Asalanka and Janith Liyanage added 111 runs, completed in 98 deliveries. Liyanage reached his second ODI half-century with a straight six off Noor Ahmad but was dismissed on the very next ball. His half-century came off 48 deliveries, including two fours and two sixes.


Asalanka, unbeaten on 97 off 74 deliveries, including nine fours and two sixes, guided Sri Lanka to 300 with a boundary in the last over of the innings.

Afghanistan's fielding performance was marred by sloppiness, with five dropped catches.
Sri Lanka lead the three-match series 1-0, having won the sole Test by 10 wickets. The final ODI is scheduled for Wednesday in Kandy, followed by three T20 matches, all to be played in Dambulla.
