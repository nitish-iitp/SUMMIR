I just picked this up on Friday but am having some remorse as I still realllly want a new coyote barreled action. That said if no bites, I will HAPPILY keep it.

Many don't know this firearm even exists.

This is a pretty rare firearm right now. a Colt Python Combat Elite. Specs as follows:

3" Barrel
Unfluted Cylinder with chamfer
Night sight
Gorgeous Grips
I'm told the smoothest of the smooth triggers. I wouldn't know as I haven't pulled it.

This gun has not been fired or even had rounds placed in cylinder. Has not been spun, hollywood closed. NOTHING. I pulled it out of the bag at my FFL with my own hands and only polished lightly with a micro fiber before placing it back in the box. Reopened for pictures and here I am.

Value? Don't care. It's whatever you value it at... I want to trade this for a barreled action with a carbon fiber barrel. Prefer a nice 223 lightweight shorty, but open to others if you are interested in this gun.

Will ship with full insurance

But it’s titled as want to trade. Why is a price required in order to trade.  If I absolutely must then 1800+/- trade value. Depends wutcha got.

I fondled one of these in a LGS. Beautiful revolver. I can confirm that it has an incredibly smooth DA trigger. Unfortunately, I don't have what you're looking for. GLWS.
