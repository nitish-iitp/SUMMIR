Now onto the next assignment

After that thumping of the West Indies, there could be more fireworks in coming days.

Australia have three upcoming T20s against the West Indies in Hobart (Friday), Adelaide (Sunday) and Perth (Tuesday).

Australia chase down target in 6.5 overs in comprehensive victory

Australia has put on a clinic today in Canberra by registering one of their most dominant wins in history.

Chasing 87, Australia chased the runs down in just 6.5 overs (41 balls). It’s an extraordinary performance.

The West Indies look completely shocked. They were very ordinary today.

Get this: Australia had 259 balls up their sleeve. It’s the shortest ODI game on Australian soil (in terms of deliveries bowled).

They don’t get more one-sided than that.

Hardie out for two

Aaron Hardie is out in the middle at No.3. He’s batted at No.7 and No.8 in his previous ODI knocks.

Inglis cracks a six over mid-wicket to race to 35.

From 1000th ODI games, Australia has never made 80 from the first six overs.

Whoops. Hardie has edged one behind off Thomas. A short innings having been thrown up the order. Just went half-hearted at that.

Fraser-McGurk out for 41 off 18 balls

The fireworks have stopped for the moment as Fraser-McGurk is caught at mid-on.

They are - this is not a typo - on 1-67 from 4.3 overs.

They need just 20 runs to make it a series whitewash.

Aussies 0-58 from four overs as Fraser-McGurk hits three sixes in an over

This is embarrassing stuff for the West Indies.

Jake Fraser-McGurk goes 6, 4, 6, 6 in a brutal display of hitting that has the Canberra crowd loving what they’re seeing.

This is wild batting. Never seen a run chase quite like this in a 50-over game. Fraser-McGurk is 33 from 15 balls.

Australia 0-59 are from four overs. They need just 28 runs from 46 overs. Should manage it you’d think (ha-ha).

List of the shortest ODI matches

With Australia flying at 0-35 from three overs, thanks to a couple of boundaries from Fraser-McGurk, let’s take a look at the quickest ODI matches in history.

The West Indies batted for 145 balls earlier today.

The fewest balls in a completed match that Australia has taken part in was 191 vs USA in 2004.

Australia would need to get these runs in 7.4 overs to equal the record.

Inglis clubs 16 off Forde’s first over

A far from ideal start for Matthew Forde, who leaks 16 runs from his opening over.

Inglis helps one down to fine leg for four before crunching a couple more boundaries - including a glorious on-drive - to really get his innings going.

Australia 0-27 off two overs
