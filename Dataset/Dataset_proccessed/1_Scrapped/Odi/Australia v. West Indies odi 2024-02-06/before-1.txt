Travis Head Released From ODI And T20I Series Ahead Of New Zealand Tour
By Pavan Suresh - February 3, 20240
Travis Head named the player of month for Nov

The star Australian batter Travis Head has been released from the One-day international and T20I series against West Indies. He will not be a part of the next two ODI matches to be played on the 4th at Sydney and the final match to be played on the 6th of February 2024.

Head has been given a rest ahead of the New Zealand tour that comprises 2 important World Test Championship matches and included a few T20I matches which would be an ideal preparation for both teams ahead of the T20 World Cup to be played in West Indies and United States of America June this year.

He has been performing brilliantly for Australia across all formats including match-winning efforts in the 2023 World Test championship finals against India. He scored a brilliant century during the ICC World Cup finals against India on 19th November 2023.

The other major change included in the One-day international squad for Australia that debutant Xavier Barlett has been rested. Spencer Johnson would join the squad for the 3rd One-day international at Canberra, but Barlett would be available.  Australia took a 1-0 lead in the One-day international series with a dominating 8-wicket win at Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Xavier Barlett was impressive in his debut match with figures of 4 for 17 in 9 overs and was named the player of the match award. His bowling effort made sure that Australia bowled out West Indies for 231. Australia chased down the target easily with 8 wickets remaining.

The second One-day international will be played at Sydney Cricket Ground on 4th Feb while the third and final match will take place on 6th at Canberra. It promises to be an exciting encounter between Australia and the West Indies as the Aussies would look to grab the chances with both hands.

Travis Head scored a match-winning century in the first Test match against West Indies at Adelaide. He was dismissed without opening his account at Gabba, Brisbane. The first Test match will be played from 29th Feb at Basin Reserve, Wellington while the second match will take place on 8th March at Hagley Oval, Christchurch.

Jake Fraser McGurk Likely To Make Debut

Travis Head has been rested for the last two ODI Matches, it is likely Jake Fraser McGurk will make his debut and open the innings that would give the taste of international cricket.
