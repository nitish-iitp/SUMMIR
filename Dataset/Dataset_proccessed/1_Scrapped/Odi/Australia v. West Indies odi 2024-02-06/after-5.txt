Steve Smith says fast bowler Xavier Bartlett has a "bright future" after making an impressive start to his ODI career against West Indies.

Bartlett picked up player-of-the-series honours, finishing with the staggering figures of 8-38 across his two outings in the 3-0 whitewash of the tourists.

On Tuesday, the 25-year-old took 4-21 as Australia dismissed West Indies for an embarrassing 86 in the home side's eight-wicket win at Canberra's Manuka Oval.

Building on a BBL campaign where he led the competition's wicket-taking and helped the Brisbane Heat win the title, Bartlett's sky-rocketing stocks could see him on the fringes of Test selection in the near future.

Fellow quick Lance Morris has trained with the Test squad over the past 12 months, with Smith believing Bartlett could be in line for similar treatment soon.

"I remember facing him probably five or six years ago in the Gabba nets before a Test match … I thought, 'This guy presents a beautiful seam', which you don't often see," Smith said.

"I just remembered that randomly, and then seeing him come out in this series and bowl the way he did was outstanding.

"He presented that seam I spoke about, swung it and got the rewards so it looks like he's got a bright future."

Young batter Jake Fraser-McGurk also enjoyed his first run for Australia during the ODI series, showing his considerable potential by making 41 off 18 deliveries in Canberra.

"It was exciting, wasn't it? When he hits them, they certainly stay hit," Smith said.

"He's certainly not short of confidence and it's cool to see someone come in and at the age of 21, just play with such freedom and no fear at all.

"It's cool to watch and I'm sure he's going have some learnings along the way and things like that.

"But the way he's playing right now, it's exciting for everyone to watch."

Australia faces the West Indies in a three-match T20I series, beginning in Hobart on Friday night.
