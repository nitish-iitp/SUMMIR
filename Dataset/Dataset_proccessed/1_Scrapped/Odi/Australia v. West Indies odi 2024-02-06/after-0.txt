Australia has completed a 3-0 whitewash in the ODI series against the West Indies, with an eight-wicket hammering of the tourists in Canberra.

Opener Alick Athanaze top-scored with just 32, and extras were the second-highest scorer in a dismal batting total of 86.

The tourists were bowled out on the first ball of the 25th over, losing their last five wickets for just 15 runs.

Fast bowler Xavier Bartlett led the way with 4-21, to go with his 4-17 in game one.

The response from the Australians was impressive — and swift — as the team took just 41 balls to chase down a target of 87.

Powerhouse opener Jake Fraser-McGurk put on a show during his limited time at the crease, slaughtering the West Indian quicks and smashing three sixes in his 18-ball 41.

It was Australia's fastest ODI run chase in history, passing their previous mark of 7.5 overs against USA in 2004.

West Indies had lost a staggering 6-15 to slump to their second-lowest score ever in one-dayers against Australia.

But it came at a cost for the home side with fast bowler Lance Morris leaving the field midway through an over with a side strain that will see him sent for scans.

Morris was playing just his second ODI and had looked threatening with the ball, taking his first two international wickets in his side's stifling performance.

The 25-year-old, who was in the frame for Test selection earlier this summer, is in doubt for Australia's tour of New Zealand later this month.

West Indies were a fraction unlucky to be 2-38 in the 11th over as Australia's quicks made early inroads.

Kjorn Ottley (eight) was given out lbw to Bartlett and didn't review his dismissal, despite getting what looked like a massive inside-edge onto his pad.

And Marnus Labuschagne then produced a screamer of a catch at point to get rid of Keacy Carty (10) for Morris' first ODI wicket.

But that was where the fight ended for the tourists.

Captain Shai Hope (4) and debutant Teddy Bishop (0) fell in quick succession as their innings crashed to 4-44.

As if things weren't bad enough, a calamitous piece of running saw Matthew Forde slip over and run out while stranded almost halfway down the pitch. He and Roston Chase then argued on the field over the call before Forde walked off dejectedly.

At 31 overs in total, the match was the shortest ODI played in Australia.

The teams will meet in the first of three T20 internationals in Hobart on Friday.
