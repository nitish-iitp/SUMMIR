England vs Netherlands Highlights, World Cup 2023

England vs Netherlands Highlights, World Cup 2023: Ben Stokes' first-ever World Cup century and three-wicket hauls from Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid helped England secure a 160-run win over the Netherlands. The victory temporarily pushes England to seventh place and they are now right in the middle of the race for a spot in the 2025 Champions Trophy. Opting to bat, England posted 339 for 9 and then returned to bowl out the Dutch for 179 runs in 37.2 overs to keep their Championships Trophy qualification hopes alive. England suffered a middle-order collapse yet again but this time, Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes saved them. Woakes scored 51 while Stokes smashed an 84-ball 108. In reply, Teja Nidamanuru (41 not out) was the top scorer, while Wesley Barresi (37), Sybrand Engelbrecht (33), Scott Edwards (38) failed to capitalise on the starts.

England vs Netherlands Live Score, ENG vs NED World Cup 2023: England beat Netherlands by 160 runs

England vs Netherlands Live Score, ENG vs NED World Cup 2023: Paul van Meekeren stumped by miles and miles and that is that. England have beaten the Netherlands by 160 runs. They have got the points and they have got the victory margin they needed to get up to seventh spot. Some reason for them to smile in what has been a difficult tournament for them. Three wickets each for spinners Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, they took the middle order wickets and then wiped off the tail. How England would be wishing that most matches went this way with the spinners getting the wickets and Ben Stokes leading a rear-guard comeback with a century.
