10pm And....breathe. A monumental win for Afghanistan, a huge wake-up call for England. Three games in, and both teams have two points. Still not out of the hunt, but neither has much margin for error left. England have been in such situations before, most recently at the T20 World Cup after they lost to Ireland. But the road does get tougher for them, with a clash against South Africa awaiting next Saturday. Afghanistan's next game, meanwhile, takes them to Chennai, where they will face New Zealand, and on the back of this win, Afghanistan will fancy their chances again.

But before all of that, there is the small matter of Australia, currently bottom of the table, taking on Sri Lanka, third from bottom, tomorrow. Do join us for that game, but for tonight, this is me (Shashwat) signing off on behalf of Chandan, Miller and everyone else at ESPNcricinfo. Goodbye and take care!

Hashmatullah Shahidi, Afghanistan captain: (On how big a win this is) I am quite happy and all my teammates are happy. This was the best win. The confidence will be there for the next game and the whole country will be happy and proud with this win. (On the opening partnership) They get a lot of credit (for the win today). Unfortunately, we had back-to-back wickets again today. We have to think about that. We had a good start and credit goes to Gurbaz for that. (On Ikram) He was with us from last two years but did not get too many chances. Me and the coach believed in him and we really appreciate his effort. (On Mujeeb being an all-rounder) I think, yes. Against Pakistan in Sri Lanka, he batted beautifully. Today, he scored important runs for us. (On the spinners) We have to score runs for that (for them to have an impact). The whole world knows how good they are. I am very proud of them today. (On the wickets the pacers took) Fazal started very well, along with Mujeeb. That (Bairstow) wicket was very important. I realised the wicket was not supporting the batters when batting against the spinners. When I went to the pavilion, I felt 280-290 would be enough on this track. (Message to the fans) The belief is there, the trust is there and the talent is also there. Last couple of games, we did not finish well. Looking forward to the rest of the tournament. Hopefully we can be positive. This was the first win for us (since 2015 in the World Cup) but not the last one.

Jos Buttler, England captain: (On England's early bowling) It was disappointing, having won the toss and elected to bowl. Missing the first ball down the leg side sort of set the tone. Congratulations to Afghanistan, they outplayed us today. (On what they could have done differently) It was a bit of bad execution, both with the bat and the ball. It was not at the level we wanted it to be consistently enough. That was the area where we lost the game. (On Afghanistan's bowling attack) They have a really skilful attack. The dew did not come in as much as we expected. The ball held up and there was indifferent bounce. They kept the stumps in play and we were not quite good enough today. (On how they plan to recover) You got to let these defeats hurt. Let it hurt, try to figure out where we need to get better. Lots of resilience in the group, lots of characters who have been through some good times and through some tough times. (On the form of his bowlers) As a whole, we are not at the level we would like to be. In a World Cup, that is where we want to be. On the field and off it, we will be trying to put it right.

Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Player of the Match: Very proud moment to be here at the World Cup and beating the champions. Great achievement for the whole team and this is the kind of opportunity we have been working hard for. Wonderful performances by the bowlers and the batters. (On his responsibility with the new ball) As a spinner, it is pretty hard to bowl in the powerplay. But I have been working in the nets. There is not much room for error to bowl wide so I have tried to bowl wicket-to-wicket. We knew that dew will play some part and that is why I wanted to bowl in the powerplay. The ball was holding a little bit as well. Even if there was dew, I was mentally prepared. Not to give much room and bowl in the right areas. (On the batting) It is all about the management. They have been giving me confidence. I want to contribute as a lower-order batter as well, and those 25-30 runs helps the team as well. I want to continue doing that. I want to dedicate this award to the people back home, who have been affected by the earthquake. This is something we could do as a team and I could do myself as a player.

9:30pm Well, almost every World Cup fan dreaded another one-sided contest today, considering both sides' World Cup pedigree. Who would have thought, though, that Afghanistan would bundle England out for 215 and win by 69 runs. The best part is that the result, for a large chunk of this second innings, seemed inevitable, and that is perhaps the greatest praise Afghanistan can receive tonight.

Farooqi got the ball rolling with the wicket of Bairstow. Mujeeb then castled Root, before Nabi sent Malan packing. Buttler perished to a devilish Naveen in-swinger, leaving Brook to do almost all of the heavy lifting. He made a pretty decent fist of it but support was not very forthcoming, meaning that the defending champions ultimately crumbled to a shattering defeat.

England, for most parts of this run-chase, looked tentative. Afghanistan anything but. And that sort of sums up how we have gotten here. This evening in Delhi belongs to Afghanistan, and even if their World Cup campaign does not quite go to plan in the next few weeks, they will always have Delhi, and this performance that has sent shockwaves throughout the cricketing world.

Rashid Khan to Wood, OUT

That will be that! Afghanistan's date with history is now upon them, and it is their greatest World Cup night. In Delhi. Against the defending champions! Slider on a length on middle and off. Wood has a wild slog across the line and has an air-shot. The ball crashes into the stumps and Rashid looks up to the heavens in delight. An amazing Afghanistan display, and they have taken down the reigning champions. Soak it all up Afghanistan fans, and relish this night - this will be rememberd for a very, very long time!

Fazalhaq Farooqi to Topley, FOUR runs

Three fours in the over! Full outside off this time and Topley has this covered too. Free swing through the line and he absolutely crunches it past extra cover!

Fazalhaq Farooqi to Topley, FOUR runs

Where have you been all along, Reece Topley! Dug in short on leg stump. Topley backs away again, channels his inner Rafael Nadal, and smashes a backhand down the line, massacring it past the bowler!

39.4

Fazalhaq Farooqi to Topley, FOUR runs

Edged and four! Full and this follows Topley outside leg. He swings like a rusty gate and the ball flies off the inside edge, past the keeper

39.3
1
Fazalhaq Farooqi to Wood, 1 run

Off-pace, on a back of a length on leg. Wood is too early into the stroke and chips it. Falls agonisingly into no man's land as Wood gets across for a single

200 comes up for England. Small wins, perhaps...

39.2

Fazalhaq Farooqi to Topley, 1 run

Searing yorker on off. Topley gives himself ample room and squeezes it out to deep cover point

Fazalhaq Farooqi to Topley, no run

Length just outside off. Topley has the most ungainly of prods at it and no surprise that he misses. All three stumps very much on display

Rashid Khan to Wood, no run

Has that been put down?! Length delivery outside off. The ball pitches and spins away. Wood was anyway going to throw the kitchen sink at it and he does so. Slashes it towards cover point, where Farooqi puts down a low chance. Afghanistan's date with history....put on hold, for now

38.5

Rashid Khan to Topley, 1 run

Short and wide outside off. Topley rocks back and cuts it towards deep cover point. There is hope still...

Topley is the last man in

Rashid Khan to Rashid, OUT

Rashid gets Rashid, and England are on the brink now! Full and dangles the carrot outside off. Rashid thinks he can come forward and defend but the ball is drops late, and he has to reach out a little. Does so with hard hands and gets a healthy outside edge that is gobbled up at first slip!

Adil Rashid c Mohammad Nabi b Rashid Khan 20 (13b 2x4 0x6 24m) SR: 153.84

Length delivery that slides just outside leg. Wood has a massive slog at it and gets a thick inside edge that smashes into the keeper's pads and rolls away

Banged into the track outside off. Seems to come off a lot slower than Wood expects as he hacks it to mid wicket

Fullish outside off. Rashid gives it everything he has and slices it on the bounce to deep cover point

Slower and shorter outside off. Wood runs it down to third man and jogs across to the other end

Superb timing! Hard length that hones in on off stump. Wood gives himself a shade of room and that allows him to steer it past backward point. Races away to the fence!

Fazalhaq Farooqi to Wood, no run

Length delivery wide outside off. Wood flashes hard at it but only connects with fresh air
