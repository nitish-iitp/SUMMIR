Yes it really, really did happen. Afghanistan hammered the world champions in Delhi and made 15 October 2023 a date their players will never forget. As bad as this is for England, who are now in serious trouble, there’s a bigger picture. The World Cup needed this result; international cricket needed Afghanistan to finally beat one of the big six. The cricket world has changed today – subtly, but indelibly. Afghanistan are at the top table now.

Thanks for your company and emails; I’ll leave you with Simon Burnton’s report. Goodnight.

Jos Buttler have just done another interview, this time with Athers on Sky Sports. It was the usual stuff, delivered almost on auto-pilot, but the last bit was interesting.

Mike Atherton So you still have faith in the group of players, given that two of the defeats have been quite heavy?

Jos Buttler [hardens his face and stares right into Atherton’s eyes] Yeah absolutely.

Buttler is tougher than people realise, with more of a temper than Eoin Morgan, and he turned the air blue in the dressing-room after a similar defeat to Ireland at last year’s World T20. It’ll be fascinating to see how he, and England, approach the game against South Africa.

This is the social context in which Afghanistan have made history. It’s hard to understand the kaleidoscop of emotions the players must be experiencing right now.

“What a win!” says James Male. “Congratulations Afghanistan. Here’s hoping this is the first of many... But I feel obliged to point out that the ICC’s decision to limit the WC pool post-2015 looks worse by the day. Could Ireland be the next Afghanistan? The Netherlands? Namibia? We’ll never know because they aren’t allowed to play at the prestige event of cricket. Not a good call imo.”

I’m torn on this, mainly because I don’t know how, say, a 14-team tournament would work in practice. There’s more jeopardy with this format, as England are finding out, though I appreciate that’s not the only consideration.

The Afghanistan captain Hashmatullah Shahidi speaks

This is our best win and will give us confidence for the next game. The whole country will be proud and happy.

The way the openers started gave us momentum; credit goes especially to [Rahmanullah] Gurbaz. The coach and I believe in Ikram [Alikhil, who made a crucial 58] and he showed why today. We appreciate his effort.

Mujeeb batted brilliantly in the series against Pakistan as well. We needed him today and he scored important runs for us.

[On his three spinners] The whole world knows how good they are. It’s up to us to score enough runs to give them a chance. I was proud of them today.

The belief is there, so are the talent and trust. This is not the [end goal]. Moving forward, inshallah, we will be positive. This win means a lot to us. It was the first one, not the last one.

Jos Buttler’s verdict

Me missing the first ball set the tone early on. It’s a tough loss to take – congratulations to Afghanistan, they outplayed us today. Throughout the game we weren’t good enough with the ball or the bat. You’ve just gotta play better, find ways to impose yourself on the game and execute your skills.

They have a really skilful attack, with some fantastic spin bowlers especially. Maybe the dew didn’t come in as much as we expected.

[As he speaks, the camera shows a small boy, in tears of joy, hugging Mujeeb Ur Rahman]

The ball held a little bit and there was a bit of indifferent bounce. They put us under lots of pressure – they bowled dead straight, bringing the stumps into play, and we weren’t quite good enough today.

You’ve got to let these defeats hurt for a bit before you move on. We need to show some real resilience. We’ve got a lot of character in the group and we’ll come back fighting.

Afghanistan’s next match is against New Zealand on Wednesday. England play, gulp, South Africa on Saturday, knowing another defeat would leave them needing to beat India, Australia and Pakistan to have any chance of making the semi-finals. It hasn’t quite sunk in.

The player of the match is Mujeeb Ur Rahman, with his spin twin Rashid Khan on translation duties

It’s a very proud moment to beat the world champions. It’s a great achievement for the whole nation and something we have worked very hard for. It was a wonderful performance from the bowlers and the batters.

For spinners it’s pretty hard to bowl in the Powerplay. I’ve been bowling with the new ball in the nets, trying to be as consistent as possible. In the Powerplay I try to bowl stump to stump and that’s what I’ve been doing in the nets.

We knew the dew would play a part which is why I bowled six overs with the new ball. [On his batting] The management have given me a lot of confidence. I really want to contribute more with the bat – 25 runs can make a big difference.

This [player of the match[ trophy is for the people back home who have been affected by the earthquake in Herat. We dedicated this victory to them.

This is Afghanistan’s greatest victory, by a country mile, and one of the biggest shocks in the 38-year history of the World Cup. England had a stinker from the moment Jos Buttler chose to field and then let the first ball of the match go through for four wides. But this isn’t about England, not yet; it’s about a group of players who have craved a breakthrough victory at an ODI World Cup.

It’s a glorious triumph for two generation of Afghan cricketers, from the 21-year-old Rahmanullah Gurbaz, whose pulsating 57-ball 80 set a tone England could never quite reverse, to the 38-year-old Mohammad Nabi, whose crafty offspin picked up the wickets of Dawid Malan and Sam Curran.

The three famous spinners, Nabi, Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman, had combined figures of 25.3-2-104-8. It was a classic trial by spin and England couldn’t cope. We shouldn’t ignore the quicker bowlers, particularly Fazalhad Farooqi and Naveen-ul-Haq.

Their figures don’t look great but they played a key part. Fazalhad dismissed Jonny Bairstow with his first ball to give England some jitters, then Naveen dismissed Jos Buttler with a marvellous bit of bowling. It’s Afghanistan’s day, now and forever.

Afghanistan beat England by 69 runs!!

WICKET! England 215 all out (Wood b Rashid 17) Four years ago, Rashid Khan disappeared for 110 off nine overs against England at the World Cup. Today, in entirely different circumstances, he gets to bowl a tenth over.

Rashid deserves to take the final wicket – and he’s done it! Wood misses, Rashid hits, and Afghanistan have completed an extraordinary victory.

40th over: England 213-9 (Wood 17, Topley 14) Topley hits Fazalhaq for three successive boundaries to prolong Bangladesh’s wait. The England coach Matthew Mott smiles wryly. Jos Buttler continues to stare down a small dot precisely 1,000 yards away.

England’s Nos 9-11 have all outscored six of the top eight.

17.52 CEST

39th over: England 199-9 (Wood 16, Topley 1) Dropped him! Wood blasts Rashid to cover, where Fazalhaq can’t hold onto an awkward chance as the ball dies on him. The upshot is that Fazalhaq will now have the chance to take the glory wicket.

WICKET! England 198-9 (Rashid c Nabi b Rashid 20)

Nine down, one to go. Adil Rashid pushes at a gorgeous legbreak from Rashid Khan and is well caught by Nabi at slip. Afghanistan are one wicket away from the greatest moment in their cricketing history!

17.46 CEST

38th over: England 196-8 (Rashid 19, Wood 15) Brook faced around a third of the strike in his partnerships with Curran and Woakes, which is when he started to lose his rhythm. That said, I don’t think it changed the result. From the moment Jos Buttler was bowled, England were in a deep hole.

Wood opens the face to steer Fazalhaq for four, another accomplished stroke. In the context of England’s struggles, he and Rashid are playing surprisingly well.

“I’m close to bursting with this,” writes Romeo. “I’ve been following and supporting Afghanistan for well over a decade and flew 1500 miles to see them at Lord’s against MCC six years ago. Just thinking about it, let alone writing about it, is rather
tempting the gods but I can’t help myself.”

37th over: England 190-8 (Rashid 18, Wood 10) Mujeeb gifts England four overthrows off his own bowling. There’s no sense of drama, though – Afghanistan still have loads of runs to play with, and England don’t bat down to No11 today.

Mujeeb ends a brilliant evening’s work with figures of 10-1-51-3, including the vital wickets of Joe Root and Harry Brook. He bashed a 16-ball 28 with the bat as well.

“While I don’t think it’s over yet...” says Arul Kanhere, “England and Australia are really messing up a lot of pre-tournament predictions.”

Quite. I suppose the only previous World Cups with a league phase were won by teams who were backed into a corner, Pakistan in 1992 and England in 2019, so maybe that will liberate England and/or Australia. But I don’t fancy their chances right now.

36th over: England 182-8 (Rashid 12, Wood 8) Every now and then, a statistic is worth repeating. This is Afghanistan’s 18th World Cup match, and their only previous victory was against Scotland. They’ve played 19 ODIs against the big six nations, losing 18 and tieing one. This is the breakthrough victory they have craved for almost a decade.

Rashid Khan returns, and it would be perfect if he takes the final wicket. Not yet: Rashid hits him for four, Wood plays and misses at consecutive deliveries and then hacks another boundary to cow corner. The defiance is admirable; it’s also futile.

“How could Woakes review,” says David Peters, “I thought England were out of reviews?”

I messed it up (see 26th over)

17.34 CEST

35th over: England 173-8 (Rashid 7, Wood 4) Mark Wood, defiant to the last, pumps Mujeeb over mid-off for four. His batting changed the Ashes but England need more than an eight-ball 24 tonight. This is amazing.

17.32 CEST

Harry Brook, who lost a bit of rhythm after being starved of the strike, has gone for 66. He tried to force a quicker ball from Mujeeb, whose second spell has been majestic, and got a thin edge to the keeper. It was a really good catch from Ikram Alikhil. Brook played extremely well, almost on a different pitch, but it’s over for England now.

34th over: England 168-7 (Brook 66, Rashid 6) Jonathan Trott, who had a strange ODI career with England, is the Afghanistan coach, which makes this an even better story. The new batter Adil Rashid gets off the mark with a jaunty flick for four off Naveen, and another four singles make it a decent over for England. All they can do is try to take it deep. They need 117 from 96 balls.

“I don’t want to calculate Woakes’ personal net run rate today,” says Niall Mullen. “It’s been ugly.”

Arf. I wouldn’t be too critical of his innings with the bat; every England player apart from Brook has really struggled. I don’t have my xWickets program running, but my instinct is that a score of 170-odd for seven flatters England.

33rd over: England 160-7 (Brook 64, Rashid 0) Harry Brook shares a joke with the new batter Adil Rashid. Who says defeat has to be depressin’?

17.23 CEST

Mujeeb teased Woakes every which way in the course of a superb over, and put him out of his misery with the final ball. Woakes tried to whip to leg and was bowled through the gate. He goes for 9 from 26 balls, having inadvertently starved Brook of the strike. A wicket maiden from Mujeeb.

Review: Woakes is not out!

Woakes was trapped in front by a skiddy offbreak from Mujeeb that kept low. It was legsideish, so Woakes reviewed – and replays showed it was just going down. Goodness me.

WICKET! England 160-7 (Woakes LBW b Mujeeb 9)

And now they’re even bigger favourites!

17.19 CEST

32nd over: England 160-6 (Brook 64, Woakes 9) Naveen replaces Nabi, whose figures of 6-0-16-2 do not flatter him. Woakes gets his first boundary with an excellent drive through extra cover. He’s beaten by the next ball, then edges a big drive for a single, after which Naveen gives one of his teammates a mouthful.

England need 125 from 108 balls. If they can take it deep, Afghanistan may start to fear a repeat of the agonising defeats to Pakistan and India at the last World Cup. Right now, though, they are strong favourites.

31st over: England 154-6 (Brook 63, Woakes 4) Mujeeb replaces Rashid, who bowled a screw-turning spell of 7-1-23-1. Woakes steals a single to mid-on, though he would have been in trouble with a clean pick up, and then Brook hoicks a poor ball over long leg for six. That’s the first six of the innings and the first boundary in nine overs.

While Brook is at the crease, England still have hope of a minor miracle. When England asked him to stand in for Ben Stokes, I don’t think a Stokesian, one-man runchase was what was they had in mind.

17.04 CEST

30th over: England 143-6 (Brook 53, Woakes 3) This is Nabi’s sixth over, which means he, Rashid and Mujeeb have 11 left between them. That’s too many for England to just see them off, but at the moment Woakes (3 from 15 balls) is struggling to do anything other than survive. He whips across a big offbreak that hits the pad, prompting another LBW appeal. It would have missed leg stump.

29th over: England 141-6 (Brook 52, Woakes 3) Rashid, who is having a whale of a time, bowls a superb maiden to Woakes, culminating in a quicker ball that beats the edge. The required rate is racing towards seven an over.

28th over: England 141-6 (Brook 52, Woakes 3) This is increasingly astonishing. Afghanistan are four wickets away from beating the world champions.

“I’m perversely loving this, and (non-condescendingly) really chuffed for Afghanistan who have always looked the most likely of the minnow nations…” says Mark Hooper. “That said, I think Woakes, Rashid and Wood could make it an interesting end.”

I think they need too many. The only way they can get close is if Brook plays an all-timer.

WICKET! England 138-6 (Curran c Rahmat b Nabi 10)

England are in abundant doodoo. Curran feels for another beautifully flighted delivery from Nabi and edges low to slip.

15 Oct 2023
16.53 CEST

27th over: England 138-5 (Brook 52, Curran 10) Rashid, in his sixth over, beats Brook with a quicker, fuller, wider delivery. This is a cracking contest between two brilliant young players. Rashid is an ODI veteran and Brook a newbie, yet there’s only five months between them.

Four singles make it a decent over for England. At some stage they will have to go after the bowling. But not yet.

Share
15 Oct 2023
16.50 CEST

26th over: England 134-5 (Brook 50, Curran 8) Harry Brook, alone on the burning deck, drives Nabi for a single to reach a sparkling, outlierish half-century from 45 balls. England need him to double it and then some.

“My TV feed says England have one more review,” says Beau Dure. “But it also says England still have a chance to win, so take that for what it’s worth.”

Yep, I’ve cocked that up – Bairstow’s dismissal was umpire’s call, so he didn’t waste a review. Don’t I look like an eejit now.

Share
15 Oct 2023
16.47 CEST

25th over: England 132-5 (Brook 49, Curran 7) Brook plays around a googly from Rashid Khan. Afghanistan go up for LBW but it’s missing leg, and Rashid has no interest in a review. Afghanistan have two remaining; England have none. As the late Martin Johnson might have said, England have only four problems today: they can’t bat, can’t bowl, can’t field and can’t review.

Share
15 Oct 2023
16.44 CEST

24th over: England 129-5 (Brook 48, Curran 5) Nabi replaces Azmatullah, so the first time we have spin at both ends. Three low-risk singles from the over. England need 156 from 156 balls.

“You told us this would be tough,” says Ian Copestake. “How dare you know what you are talking about.”

You appear to be confusing knowledge with pessimism.
