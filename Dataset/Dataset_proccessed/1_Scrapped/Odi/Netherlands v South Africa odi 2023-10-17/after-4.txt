SA vs NED Highlights, World Cup 2023: Netherlands soared to their 1st ever win in the World Cup over a Test nation despite being 82/5 at one point.
South Africa vs Netherlands Highlights, World Cup 2023:

South Africa vs Netherlands Highlights, World Cup 2023: Put in to bat in challenging conditions after the rain reduced the contest to 43 over a side, the Netherlands found themselves reeling at 140 for seven before their captain Scott Edwards staged a remarkable recovery with an unbeaten 78 off 69 balls to take his side to a fighting 245 for eight. With the pitch offering variable bounce and some turn, the Netherlands sniffed an opportunity against a formidable South African batting unit which crumbled under pressure to be all out for 207 in 42.5 overs, handing the Dutch their first World Cup win against a Test playing nation. Until Tuesday, the Netherlands had only beaten fellow associate nations Namibia and Scotland in their World Cup history, having made their debut back in 1996. The surprise outcome came 48 hours after Afghanistan shocked defending champions England in Delhi, adding to the unpredictability of the 10 team competition.

South Africa vs Netherlands Live Score: NETHERLANDS BEAT SOUTH AFRICA BY 38 RUNS!

South Africa vs Netherlands Live Score: A glove and a catch at long last, off the second last ball of the match. Maharaj is the last wicket to fall and South Africa are all out for 207. And perhaps among the great compliments you can give this team is that this result has been obvious for about an hour. The first time Netherlands have beaten a Test-playing nation in the 50-over World Cup. Roelof van der Merwe had said during one of his interviews in this World Cup in a matter-of-fact fashion that the Netherlands want to reach the semis this year. Well, they showed that they have the goods to do that on their day and if a big side take their feet off the pedal against them, as South Africa did today, they will be made to pay. Van der Merwe, who made that statement, has backed that up with a statement performance today. A game-changing 29 off 19 balls and then a fantastic spell with figures of 2/34. Scott Edwards, who seems to be having ice in his veins as he walks off the field after taking the winning catch, was unbeaten on 78 off 69.

South Africa vs Netherlands Live Score: The last wicket stand rolls on

Maharaj and Ngidi have been together out there for 40 deliveries now. South Africa need 52 to win off eight balls and so a Netherlands win is confirmed but somehow, South Africa getting a huge clump of luck at this point. These two have heaved at a number of balls, ugly top edges have flown everywhere and they have all landed in safe zones.
