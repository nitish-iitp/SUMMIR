Netherlands completed a famous 38-run win over South Africa to add further intrigue to the pool stage at the Cricket World Cup.

Two days after Afghanistan had humbled holders England, the in-form South Africans were well beaten by the Dutch in a rain-affected game in Dharamsala that was reduced to 43 overs a side.

Netherlands looked to be heading for a third successive defeat when they stumbled to 82 for five. However, a brilliant unbeaten 78 off 69 balls from wicketkeeper-captain Scott Edwards saw them post a competitive 245 for eight, and it was a total that proved beyond the hitherto impressive Proteas.

“Proud of the group. Putting in that performance and being able to play my part is nice,” said Edwards, who was named player of the match. “In the last couple of games our issue has been too many of our middle order being out before the end of the game. So I wanted to take it deep and hope a couple guys around me would chip in.”

Having been 36 without loss, the former Somerset all-rounder Roelof van der Merwe, who had contributed a handy 29 from 19 balls with the bat, took two quick wickets and South Africa were suddenly reeling on 44 for four.

Despite 43 from David Miller, they lost wickets at regular intervals and were beaten for the first time in the tournament.

“At 112-6 we didn’t want to let them get over 200 and we definitely dropped the ball there,” said Temba Bavuma, the losing captain. “We were still confident that we could chase down the score but we didn’t get partnerships and we didn’t adapt to the double spin in the powerplay.”
