Thanks for joining us tonight. Hope you enjoyed our company. This is Shashank Kishore and Shashwat Kumar signing out on behalf of our colleagues Chandan Duroah and P Ranjith from the scoring team. Look forward to your company for New Zealand v Afghanistan in Chennai on Wednesday.

Scott Edwards is the Player of the Match for his 68-ball 79 that bailed Netherlands out and set them up for this win.

"Hopefully a few more [wins] to come," he says. "In both games we were in decent positions and then fell away. Nice to get in a few partnerships to get a total we thought was competitive. Am sure there's plenty of fans staying up and watching the game. Always a lot of supporters around, grateful for the support. Hopefully a few messages from them. We came into the tournament where we wanted to have a chance in the semi-finals and if you wanna do that you gotta beat teams and South Africa are one of the favourites the way they are playing, so it is a good win for us."

Temba Bavuma:From 112 for 6, shouldn't have allowed them to go past 200. We dropped the ball there but were still confident with the chase. But they were able to extract some deficiencies in our batting. We were clinical against Australia. We could have controlled the extras. The fielding wasn't up to the standard. It's not the same standard we had against Australia. We need to have some conversations with the boys. You got to let the emotion to seep in. It will hurt. Our campaign is not over by any stretch of imagination. That was a proper display from them. They put us under pressure throughout. Good luck to them."

11.10pm How Netherlands grew a big-team mentality. This is your #MustRead piece from Nagraj Gollapudi for The Cricket Monthly. It's a long read, so make sure you have a nice cup of coffee/tea or whatever else beside you as you soak in the magnitude of the result.

All the players are walking around the ground to thank the fans who turned up to make a lot of noise. As many as 12,000 fans turned up to watch the game tonight; quite an impressive number really.

11.00pm Netherlands beat South Africa at the T20 World Cup last year. They've beaten them convincingly yet again, at the 50-overs World Cup. It didn't seem likely when Netherlands were in choppy waters at 112 for 6, but Roelof van der Merwe, Scott Edwards, Logan van Beek and Aryan Dutt all stood up and delivered under pressure to first keep them in the contest and then suckerpunched South Africa under the night sky in rainy, cold conditions they're so used to playing in back home.

They aren't on free to air TV just yet back home, but they've delivered yet another reason to be on it soon. Netherlands can celebrate long and hard into the night. This has been a famous, famous win. What a moment for them. They're already dancing, families and friends of the players who've come in to India can't be happier. It's fair to say the Dutch contingent in the stands outnumbered the South Africans and this is a moment they'll all remember for a long, long time.

van Beek to Maharaj, OUT

What a moment for the Netherlands! Logan van Beek, one of the inspirational men instrumental in Netherlands getting here to the World Cup, seals a famous, famous win. Scott Edwards, captain fantastic, takes the catch. What a moment in their history. Maharaj backs away to scythe this through the off side but the ball gets big on him and flies off the edge as Edwards takes an excellent catch.

Pulls but not in control again, lands between the square leg fielder running back and fine leg running in

Slower length ball outside off, looks to whack it over cover but is beaten as he plays too early

de Leede to Maharaj, 2 runs

In the air, but it falls in no man's land with three fielders running towards the ball. Vikramjit cuts it off at sweeper cover

Punched to deep point

Looks to reverse ramp but Logan cleverly bangs this in short to ensure Maharaj doesn't get underneath the length

40.6
5nb
van Beek to Maharaj, (no ball) FOUR runs

Gets inside the line and helps this pull down to fine leg for four. And that's also a free-hit as there's an extra man outside the ring

van Beek to Ngidi, 1 run

Snorter of a bouncer that Ngidi somehow manages to glove in trying to take evasive action, flies down to third man on the bounce

Slash and a miss!

van Beek to Maharaj, 1 run

Slower ball into the pitch, Maharaj works this down to long-on, looked for a second as he hit it but realised he'd never make it in the end

40.2
•
van Beek to Maharaj, no run

Just short of cover, once again Maharaj cramped for room as he tries to break free

40.1

van Beek to Maharaj, no run

Dug in short on middle, Maharaj backs away to slash over the infield but this keeps coming at him to cramp him for room, through to the keeper

Tucks this to deep midwicket, won't run because that'll mean he keeps strike next over

de Leede to Ngidi, no run

Arches back and dabs this short ball to point

Shreya: "As a South African supporter, I was sad earlier because I was worried the rain will lead to the match being washed out and SA will lose one point, now I'm wishing that the rain was actually trying to save us from this hammering :("
