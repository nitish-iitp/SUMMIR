South Africa skipper Temba Bavuma won the toss and elected to field in overcast conditions. However, the onset of rain shortly after the toss led to a two-hour delay before play commenced at the picturesque venue. The match was reduced to a 43-overs-per-side contest. Max O'Dowd, the Dutch opener, exhibited some elegant strokes, while his partner Vikramjit Singh struggled at the other end, ultimately departing in the seventh over as Kagiso Rabada struck on his first delivery.

O'Dowd looked promising until he edged one to the keeper, falling for 18. Colin Ackermann appeared steady at the crease and was later joined by Bas de Leede. Rabada claimed his second wicket by dismissing de Leede LBW. The Proteas bowled with finesse, creating pressure, and Ackermann, while attempting to accelerate, dragged one back onto the stumps, departing for 12. Sybrand Engelbrecht seemed settled and initiated the recovery alongside Teja Nidamanuru.

Engelbrecht and Nidamanuru built a 32-run partnership before Engelbrecht fell for 19. Nidamanuru aimed to regain the initiative but was dismissed LBW for 20 in the 27th over. Scott Edwards and Logan van Beek offered resistance in the lower order. Crafty bowling from Keshav Maharaj terminated van Beek's innings. Roelof van der Merwe came out aggressively, employing inventive shots.

As the death overs approached, Edwards and van der Merwe accelerated the scoring. The South African bowlers appeared rusty as the Dutch batsmen consistently found the boundary. Edwards reached his fifty from 53 balls. The pair brought up a brisk 50-run partnership in just 30 balls, leaving the Proteas perplexed. The 64-run stand for the eighth wicket concluded with van der Merwe's departure after a swashbuckling cameo of 29 from 19 balls.

Aryan Dutt, along with Edwards, struck powerful blows towards the end, remaining unbeaten on 23 (9) and 78 (69) respectively, propelling the Netherlands to a total of 245/8. Edwards' knock included 10 boundaries and a maximum, while Dutt contributed with three maximums. Lungi Ngidi, Marco Jansen, and Kagiso Rabada each claimed two wickets for the Proteas, with Gerald Coetzee and Keshav Maharaj also chipping in with one wicket each.
