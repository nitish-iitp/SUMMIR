Adam Zampa was not at his physical best during his match-winning performance against Sri Lanka here on Monday.

“I did a gym session a couple of nights ago and I don’t know if it was a back spasm, but I was under the weather the last couple of days. I had to do fitness tests before the game today. It felt like adrenaline was going to get me through,” the leg-spinner, who rattled the Sri Lankan middle-order with a four-wicket haul, said.
