Nepal Form

The team will largely be relying on key batsmen: Rohit Paudel-the captain, Aasif Sheikh, Kushal Bhurtel, Anil Sah, Dipendra Singh Airee, and Aarif Sheikh. Paudel played brilliant innings in Nepal's previous game as he scored 96 off 75 deliveries that consisted of eight fours and three sixes. Sah, scoring 56 off 62 with five boundaries, along with wicket-keeper Aasif Sheikh who had made 52 runs off 53 balls and including seven fours and one six, were the successful run getters for the match.

On the bowling front, Nepal will expect crucial wickets from the hands of Sandeep Lamichhane, Lalit Rajbanshi, Sompal Kami, Karan KC, and Kushal Bhurtel. In the last match, Kushal Bhurtel was the Nepal bowler who did well taking 4 wickets for 23 runs in six overs. Kami also picked up two wickets with 37 runs in 6.4 overs.

Aasif Sheikh (wk), Kushal Bhurtel, Rohit Paudel (c), Aarif Sheikh, Anil Sah, Gulsan Jha, Dipendra Singh Airee, Sompal Kami, Sandeep Lamichhane, Karan KC, Lalit Rajbanshi

Scottish Form

With these top-order batsmen-Charlie Tear, Andrew Umeed, Richie Berrington, Brandon McMullen, Michael Jones, and wicket-keeper Michael Cross-that Scotland will score most of its runs. In the last match, Andrew Umeed was quite impressive in not getting out to score 98 off 79 balls and was ably supported by Charlie Tear, who also did not get out, scoring 43 off 70 balls.

For bowling, Scotland would have Brad Wheal, Christopher Sole, Mark Watt, Michael Leask, Brandon McMullen, and Bradley Currie, who would take crucial wickets. In the last match played, Bradley Currie was the man of the match as he picked 4 wickets for 32 runs in just 10 overs, while for the ninth over, he had 3 wickets for 20 runs to his credit. Brandon McMullen also did a good job in his last match by picking three wickets for 20 runs in nine overs.
