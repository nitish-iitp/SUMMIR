JSK vs DSG (Joburg Super Kings vs Durban Super Giants), 29th Match Preview

Joburg Super Kings have struggled with their batting in this campaign, prompting a change at the top with Leus du Plooy taking charge. With their spot in the knockout stage at stake, there’s a possibility of Moeen Ali joining du Plooy at the opening.

Durban’s Super Giants made two changes in their last game, resting Reece Topley and Marcus Stoinis. Despite their absence, the Super Giants secured a win. It’s anticipated that they might be given another break for the upcoming Saturday evening game.

Our prediction favours the Durban Super Giants’ win.
