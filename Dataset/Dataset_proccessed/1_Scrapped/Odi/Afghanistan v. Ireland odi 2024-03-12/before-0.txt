This thing looks legit. They seem to have incorporated nearly every accuracy/reliability producing process/technique available to the AR platform. RD has a great video on Instagram explaining more about the rifle. Here’s what I like:
-extremely tight/rigid receivers
-thermal fit upper
-cut rifled proof barrel with intermediate gas system
-taper locked/keyed gas block
-A5 w/Springco green spring
-Geissele trigger and CH

This is as close to a turn-key recce/SPR I’ve seen. Nice work RD.

Odd stock choice for a precision AR. Everything else looks pretty sweet though.

I like that they have noticeably improved the barrel to upper fit along with the 3" inch long barrel nut and their rigid handguard. My personal preference would be to change the stock, bipod, grip and muzzle device. The 16" barrel is okay but I would prefer an 18" inch one a little more.
SOLGW makes a similar rifle. While at this point in time 5.56/.223 is the obvious choice in an AR15 sized platform due to it being our military cartridge and easy ammo availability, I think with the right bullet 6mm MAX or the 6mm ARC would take it to the next level in lethality and making easier hits at longer distances when there is some wind. Depending on how it shakes out I think the new PWS UXR rifle would be an excellent platform to base a recce/ SPR type weapon upon due to it's rigid design and easy barrel change capability. I will probably be getting one to test out when they are released.

Yeah that and the muzzle device. I'm guessing they're just cheap placeholders since they know everyone has their own preferences.

Not a fan of the CTR myself, but the aftermarket for tweaking it with risers (or a RISR) or SAPR, or a bag rider can get you close to the utility of a PRS lite but keep the stock adjustable. Alex from Ridgeline talks about his setup in the Ridgeline SPR class:

Hey Guys,

Glad to see the growing interest, for those who don’t know I am the Director of Special Projects at Ridgeline and bring the Ridgeline LPR through development to production has been my main effort for the last six months. So if you got questions let me know!

Regarding some of the questions already asked, things like the A2 flash hider are simply functional place holders. An A2 isn’t my go to either but we got better things do than play guess your favorite muzzle device. Same goes for pistol grips we know everyone uses what they like and as buttstocks go the CTR as a base has some great potential for growth with add on options.



Regarding future barrel lengths and chambering, the 16” intermediate gas in .223 wyld was deemed to be the most versatile to start with and the future will undoubtedly bring a shorter and longer option.

6ARC concept variants are under cursory development at the behest of several organizations. I could see this likely leading to production at some point but I have fair amount of reservations based on watching 6ARC guns choking hard in classes for several years now. The ballistic advantage is real but holding true reliability is another matter.

Same goes for 6MAX, I am super interested in the performance gains and we actually had an LPR in 6MAX built as a proof of concept for Mike Russo earlier this year. Mike has been racking up some impressive wins in the Quantified Performance matches, so again definitely a possibility at some point down the road.

In addition to the Small frame, there is a Large frame variant targeted for 2025, 308WIN/6.5CM/6CM focused but honestly that doesn’t happen until the LPR production is completely up and running.

There’s definitely a demand, it’s probably one of the most asked questions but I suspect the timeline for that depends heavily on the progress of primary priorities such as delivering full rifles.

I would like to know more about the barrel to upper receiver attachment method. Is there anything else unique about about the upper receiver, like is it forged or billet, is it reenforced in areas to make it more rigid, has the front face been machined true to the barrel bore, do you use a flanged barrel nut against the barrel extension or does your barrel and barrel nut use tapers to secure it to the upper receiver like Blackout Defense does. Also, how do you secure the gas block on the barrel ?

Lots of good questions, I think at some point here it might be easiest to take a lunch break at some point this week and give you all a look under the hood as some of these questions are better suited for pictures.

But I can answer some of those questions outright. Regarding the forged vs billet, these are billet receivers sets. And yes construction is quite a bit reinforced over traditional AR15 upper receivers and machined to be true for the specific purpose of building a precision platform from the ground up.

Doubtful, carbon fiber has proven to be a little finicky (don’t get me wrong I have one that shoots lasers…but also have one that pretty ) it’s just not worth the effort from a production standpoint when considering the number of customers asking in relationship to the cost.

Additionally when you look at the actual weight savings (we actually have a prototype in CF) the 16” SPR barrel it’s laughable. In a heavy profile bolt gun maybe/yes but a small fram gasser not really. And everything above can also be applied to flutes.

While “Light” is a subjective term it was also secondary to the primary design objective which was precision. We wanted a laser beam, bomb-proof SPR that can run and gun. Think URGI meets PSG1.

Price point was put out somewhere around $3k-ish. I am not in sales (should be obvious) so don’t quote me, I am just the dude out back at loading dock blasting Creed during my lunch break. 

As accuracy goes it is not guaranteed it’s required.

Each rifle leaves the factory with a 5 round proof target. That proof target requires 5 rounds (FGMM) sub MOA, shot prone off a bipod and rear bag, at roughly the sustained rate of fire. If it doesn’t shoot it doesn’t ship.

Edit: we decided to switch to 5 rounds group vs. 10 after the first 50 or so rifles due to the notable amount of fatigue it places on testers, shooting 20 consecutive sub-MOA 10 round groups is taxing.

The rifles are certainly capable but if you are real about it as a shooter, a cold windy (25-35pmh) day is going to periodically net you groups like you see on the left:

The right side was the retest shot with all the same parameters other than me trying to chase the wind.

I am somewhere down on the list for one, and to help me make the decision to plunk down around $3,000. and pull the trigger for one, I would really like to see what's under the hood, as in some pics of the rifle without it's handguard showing the barrel to upper interface and the gas block setup. Also is there anything else unique about the upper receiver other than being strengthened and beefed up in critical areas ?

FYI, this may or may not still apply to Proof Research barrels and Surefire muzzle devices like the Warcomp and possibly other brands of muzzle devices. Just something to be aware of when changing out muzzle devices on barrels of any brand.

Also is there anything else unique about the upper receiver other than being strengthened and beefed up in critical areas ?
Alright, been super busy QCing, building, testing and packaging but with the snow storm at hand I got moment to dive into the some of the points of interest regarding the LPR. Essentially this isn’t what I would call an “innovative” rifle but rather a “iterative” rifle as Alex says. Most things in rifle are not particularly unique, they’ve all been done before but either not well or not in concert or just never really refined.

So whats the big deal?

1.) The barrel - This is the heart of any rifle and if a manufacturer won’t tell you who’s turning their barrels or leaves the details murky, it’s a huge red flag to me.

So in full transparency our barrels are being produced by Proof. They are standard Proof stainless steel blanks (Wylde chamber 1/7 twist) turned to our profile and finished in black. 16” now and probably more options someday.

Why Proof? In 2024 there are quite a few high end barrels to choose from. Proof makes great single point cut barrels AND are tremendously easy to work with as a company. Single point cut barrels are simply must in our opinion as it almost completely mitigates POI migration under rapid fire.

Here’s an example of a 5x5 I shot the other day in about 60 seconds. There is clearly a little NPA slop but you’re not getting the stringing you’d typically see with Button cut rifles as they heat up, which is an important practicality in regards to SPR applications.




As mentioned our profile is unique and for several reasons. The profile is on the thick side but in all the right places, kinda a SPR/SOCOM hybrid…

(Here’s a prototype barrel with almost the same dimensions as the production)


Additionally our dual tapered gas block which indexes off of the barrel and which is held in position with a jam nut.

(An actual production set up)


Again we didn’t come up with this idea, we just made it better. The whole point of this is three fold. A) jamming set screws and pins into the barrel isn’t exactly guaranteed to screw things up but it doesn’t help accuracy and makes for leaky inefficient gas system. B) this system allows us to have a thicker gas block journal, which in combination with the intermediate gas length, has seemed to help reduce gas port erosion by a degree. C) lastly a locked and torqued gas block doesn’t go anywhere or become misaligned.



2.) The Barrel Nut - Our barrel nut does one thing, it holds the barrel in place. This was a major point of design intention as a traditional barrel nut design typically holds the barrel in the receiver as well as serving as mounting point for the handguard.

This traditional design is problematic as any shift in pressure to the handguard (bipod/tripod/barricade) will transmit to the barrel nut and the barrel causing vertical shift in the POI. 0.3-0.5 MRAD is common and we’ve seen it as bad as 1 MRAD of vertical shift on some rifles. Our “semi-monolithic” design separates the two aspects.

(Here’s a barrel nut being installed)


(Here’s an example of 5x2 with “P” being a group fired prone and “T” being a group fired of a tripod)


Lastly regarding the barrel nut I actually lied about it only doing one thing as it also incidentally seems to act as a heat sink of sorts, pulling a fair amount of heat out of the barrel (chamber/throat area) reducing heat wear significantly. We had a prototype barrel (stainless steel) conduct 20x SOCOM SURG cycles (4,800 rounds at near cyclic rates) with zero malfunction or stoppages and no perceivable loss in accuracy/precision when compared to the initial accuracy/precision test done prior to the SURG test.

I’ll snap a picture of it next time I’m in the shop, a few photos shows the results much more easily.

Yes, it’s designed to be shot either or we did most of the testing and optimized around the Surefire RC2. As with any gas gun, low back pressure cans are ideal but it should be able to handle a variety.

As I mentioned before it’s a intermediate, length gas system, which when paired with the A5 buffer system makes for a very reliable and soft shooting rifle that’s fairly suppressor friendly.

Happy to see more choices on the market. What does it weigh? Can it compete with the 2A Armament (sadly, now gone) offerings? Niche weapons...in the NEMO arms pricing range?

Happy to see more choices on the market. What does it weigh? Can it compete with the 2A Armament (sadly, now gone) offerings? Niche weapons...in the NEMO arms pricing range?
It’s not exactly in the same category (nor was it meant to be) as 2A Armament offerings…or NEMO for that matter.

7.65lbs as previously stated earlier in the thread. This is precision rifle, in a small frame, which is inherently lightweight relative to say a large frame.

The 2A rifles I have, these are backups, are doing VERY well for me. I'm not in any way shape or form dogging a new product. We need them, customers are looking for them, but many of the advantages they offer are...not new. If precision is the ultimate goal the barrel is almost always the difference. I can't shoot these 2A rifles in a combat environment and expect consistent accuracy (barrel heats up...we string those shots). What they do provide is a very lightweight platform for hunting/initial engagement that has been very difficult to find over the years. The Ruger SFAR is a recent add to the stable that is performing very well for it's pedigree. It doesn't shoot as well as it's slightly heavier SCAR 17S but it's also a 3rd of the cost.

We very much look forward to what you guys have to offer!!!

2A Armament 16" 5.56 Balios Lite build - 5lbs 3.3oz


2A Armament 18" .308 Win Xanthos build w/cerakote - 6lbs 11.2oz


2A Armament 20" 6.5 Creedmoor Xanthos build - 6lbs 9.1oz

Yeah I wouldn’t put the LPR in the same category as your 2A Armament simply because the LPR isn't designed as an Ultra-lightweight build out. The LPR is basically a modernized SPR/Recce Rifle concept and you need/want a certain balance of mass in a rifle if you expect it to maintain reliability, accuracy and precision through sustained/rapid firing rates.

"The semi-monolithic receiver utilizes precision engineered elements to provide the most stable semi-automatic platform available by removing the most common and impactful interferences that affect precision."

Very bold statement.

I see a lot of engineering there...that's been done before. Super excited to see the end product, what it can produce, what it weighs....and cost.

Did you read the thread? He already stated that they haven't reinvented the wheel. Price has been discussed. Weight has been listed, and it's not a flyweight or a competitor to your 2A rifles.

I’d like to see some more pictures of the barrel nut setup and how the rail is attached. I see it’s “press fit“ but I’m guessing there’s some other means of retention as well. It’s sleek and looks incredibly well done. But, if consumers are allowed a peek under the hood, I’d like to see how it looks compared to my Blackout Defense upper and a JP SCI-20.

The gas block and journal confuses me. Why go to the trouble to cut a bunch of separate tapers and threads only to notch the rear sealing taper and roll pin the tube? Why not key the block on the sides outside of the rear tape and use a ferule on the tube? Seems incomplete from a design standpoint and you can see the where the prototype is leaking.

@TonyTheTiger - yes, I missed it...see it now. Sorry I was "that guy"
- Weight - 7.65lbs
- Price - $3,200

Also curious @ohiofarmer. Will the barrel be end user serviceable?

Hope @Rudy Gonsior doesn't mind me sharing this. I asked the same thing via PM a couple weeks ago and he sent this photo. He said the hardware of the handguard will retain by way of that square keyway cut into the receiver extension

Well could it be improved on? Yes, I mean that’s how we got to this point of development, we took ideas already in play and made some improvements. Improvements are always a balance between performance gains and efficiency in effort, especially in regards to actually bring something to production.

Important things to note is what you see on the prototype in terms of fouling is 5000+ rounds of SURG and accuracy testing. The roll pin hole obviously leaks a little initially as the system fouls but seals up as carbon fouling builds. Additionally when you take into account how much easier a traditional gas tube and roll pin is in regards to manufacturing, it’s a compromise that makes sense. You gain a better gas system with marginal effort rather than building the “perfect” one at a cost that is 3-5x the price.

Here’s a closer look at the gas leakage. As you can see the tapered gas block does a great job and does the lion’s share of sealing it up. Again the roll pin and gas tube exhibit an expected amount of leakage but remember that’s a entire day of like 150+ magazines.

Fair enough. I'm excited to see these rifles out in the wild. I appreciate your engagement in this thread.
