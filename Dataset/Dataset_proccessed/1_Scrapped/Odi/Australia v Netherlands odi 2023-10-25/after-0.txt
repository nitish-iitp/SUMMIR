That’s it from us today, thanks for your company and comments and ta very much to Jonathan Howcroft for his masterly scribing of the Australia innings.

We’ll be back to bring you the OBO of England v Sri Lanka in Bengalaru tomorrow. Speaking of which, I’ll just leave this points table here…

Here’s Pat Cummins: He doesn’t seem to be in particularly chatty mood does Pat – he’s making the interviewer Ian Bishop do a fair bit of heavy lifting…

It was just about the complete game, I couldn’t be happier. Maxwell’s innings was crazy… I thought we both contributed equally in that 100-run partnership…

We are starting to play to our potential and play in the style we talk about. We’ve bowled quite well but without a lot of luck even though Zampa took another four-for.

On the next game against New Zealand:

We’re prepped as good as we can be. They are a good side and they’ve played in Dharamsala before. Its a big game, its a World Cup.”

I think Cummins then said that his side haven’t been at their best with the bat and thqt there was room for improvement, which is admirable *Captaincy* when your side have just nigh on racked up 400 and one of your batters has smoked the fastest World Cup ton by a distance. Keep them grounded Pat!

Netherlands Captain Scott Edwards speaks:

(He looks a bit shellshocked and fair enough. That was a bruising game for his side)

Australia have got world-class bowlers but we should’ve been better today. (On Bowling to Maxwell) If you miss your length by a fraction then you’re going out of the park. Full credit to their batting line-up, we almost got in there with ten overs to go but we couldn’t stop him (Maxwell)

It’s a pretty nice wicket (At Delhi) and the ball really travels, the margins are small.

We just want to click for the last four games, we’ll look at a few things but otherwise move on (from this game) quite quickly.”

Share
25 Oct 2023

Glenn Maxwell speaks!

(The record) It’s not something I set out to do it was more just the situation of the game…We wanted to put a good platform for the back end and cash in on this ground where the ball can run away quite quickly.

It was nice to get in rhythm, to make good decisions and give myself a little bit of time, a bit of confidence and a platform. It is a huge confidence booster knowing I’ve got that in my locker, doubts can creep in when you are not scoring consistently.

It was close to the perfect game - if you score 400 and bowl the opposition out for under 100. A lot of our guys got to have a hit and we’ve had three really good wins in a row.”

That sound? The rest of the teams in the tournament taking an almighty GULP.

Adam Zampa now has the most wickets in World Cup 2023, thirteen scalps and counting. Santner (12), Bumrah (11) and Madushanka (11) yapping at the leg-spinners heals.

It’s not enough to earn him the player of the match though – that goes to Glenn Maxwell - his 40 ball century was NINE BALLS quicker than the one previous holder Aidan Markram managed against Sri Lanka last week. Far be it for me to encourage Guardian readers to gamble but I wouldn’t bet against seeing that record broken again before the tournament is over.

WICKET! Dutt lbw b Zampa 1 (Netherlands 90-9)

Zampa strikes again! After seeing a huge appeal for LBW turned down - rightly by a magnificent decision from Umpire Michael Gough - the diminutive leggie pins Dutt LBW to leave the Aussies needing just one more!

19th over: Netherlands 86-8 (Edwards 9, Dutt 0) Aryan Dutt is the new batter and he ramps up the drama by halting proceedings for a minute, looks like in the scrabble to get his kit on he came out to the middle with the wrong helmet. We’ve all been there, granted not in a World Cup match… Here we go… can Zampa join Brett Lee as the only other Aussie to snare a World Cup hat-trick!? CLOSE BUT NO CIGAR! A full ball on the stumps skidded onto Dutt but he managed to keep it out. Just.

Zampa in amongst it! van Beek tries to cut a ball that was too full from the leggie, gets a meaty edge and Josh Inglis does the rest…

WICKET! Nidamanuru c Inglis b Marsh 14 (Netherlands 84-6)

Soft dismissal for Nidamanuru who had played a lovely pick up shot off Marsh earlier in the over. A back of a length ball is glanced off the face of the bat into Josh Inglish’s gleeful gauntlets behind the stumps. Netherlands lose their sixth wicket inside 20 overs – the Aussies are giving their own net run rate a shot in the arm here.

Logan van Beek is the new batter and he sees out the end of the over.

18th over: Netherlands 85-6 (Edwards 5, van Beek 0)

17th over: Netherlands 78-5 (Edwards 5, Nidamanuru 7) Zampa it is, he starts by flighting a couple and finding some turn from the off. Nidamanuru and Edwards are watchful, knocking the ball into the gaps and collecting singles. It’s not enough for the Dutch and the required run rate rises like a hissing yellow cobra.

16th over: Netherlands 74-5 (Edwards 5, Nidamanuru 7) Five runs off Marsh, Adam Zampa has been given the nod and is warming up. He’s been very impressive in this World Cup so far. Flight, guile and a natty pair of bowling specs.

15th over: Netherlands 69-5 (Edwards 3, Nidamanuru 4) Just a single off Cummins’ latest. The players pause for a drink. My toddler bounds into the room and starts crawling all over my ‘work-station’. The Dutch continue. The child is banished.

WICKET! Engelbrecht c Warner b Marsh 11 (Netherlands 62-5)

Yes that was an …Ellipsis of Doom… thanks to a laptop buffering at my end. Engelbrecht is unfortunate to fall, Marsh sends down a short ball that the extravagantly monikered batter flat bats away powerfully only to see David Warner pouch a sublime catch on the leg side fence. Sometimes it just ain’t your day.

Engelbrecht is a gun fielder himself (trust me, worth a google) and might well appreciate (with time) that grab from Warner. The replays show that the gnarled Aussie was very happy with that pouch, a Garfield smile spreading across his chops after the ball nestled safely in his paws.

12th over: Netherlands 59-4 (Engelbrecht 9, Edwards 1) Six runs pocketed off Hazlewood’s over, Engelbrecht pushes a full ball in the gap at extra cover and the batters scamper a lesser spotted three.

On the old NRR front – I’m no mathematician but I think that it is good news for England if Australia romp home here – If the Dutch are skittled for less than 250 runs then England will likely move up to eighth in the table.

WOULDNT THAT BE SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE?!*

WICKET! de Leede lbw b Cummins 4 (Netherlands 53-4)

de Leede plays one of the strokes of the day (which is saying something) a caressed drive off Cummins pings through mid off with Swiss Dutch clock timing. Beautiful. Gah! He has to go next ball – Cummins nips one back into the pad and umpire Michael Gough has no hesitation in raising the finger for LBW. The review shows the ball was kissing leg stump with a delicate peck.

Dutch skipper Scott Edwards joins Engelbrecht in the middle and is nearly sorted out first ball by his opposite number. It’s a long road back from here.

10th over: Netherlands 47-3 (Engelbrecht 4, de Leede 0) Hazlewood started rustily but has found his groove, you could put a dinner plate over his pitch map. A full ball jagged back in to Ackermann and rapped him on the back leg in front of all three stumps. Goodnight Vienetta. Bas de Leede has to pause licking his bowling wounds and strap the pads on, he joins Engelbrecht in the middle and faces out a maiden.

Oh no! The ball after driving Hazelwood straight back down the ground for a crisply driven four Singh does himself a dutty! A poke to Maxwell at mid-off and ludicrously Singh sets off for a single, Maxwell slings the stumps down with the opener not even in the frame.

RUN OUT!

WICKET! O'Dowd b Starc 6 (Netherlands 28-1)

O’Dowd looked in all sorts of strife to Starc’s full ball – two stifled appeals in the over as the big man lost his balance with the ball speared in. BOWLED ‘IM! Third time is a charm for Starc, he pulls his length back a smidge and O’Dowd chops on!

The Aussies have their first.

3rd over: Netherlands 27-0 ( Singh 21, O’Dowd 5) There are no demons in this Delhi pitch, Singh gets a leading edge on a length ball from starc, the ball lands safe and races away to the boundary. Starc pulls back his length but offers width, Singh throws the Kitchen sink at it (reckon he’s a Poggenpohl kind of guy) and the ball flies off a thick edge for four more. Perky response from the Dutch. Starc goes up for an lbw appeal but the ball was sliding down leg.

2nd over: Netherlands 18-0 ( Singh 13, O’Dowd 5) Brilliant response from the Netherlands to come out punching in Delhi after that Maxwell onslaught. O’Dowd throws his hands at a wide one from Hazelwood and gets an under edge for four. Nothing spawny about a brace of boundaries from Singh though – he stands on his tippytoes and punches Hazlewood through the covers for four… next ball he repeats the stroke and this one is even better – the ball scorching to the fence. Game on!

1st over: Netherlands 4-0 ( Singh 4, O’Dowd 0) Vikramjit Singh defends the first ball from Mitchell Starc, Max O’Dowd leans on his bat at t’other end. Starc looks full of pep and is steaming in with two slips in place. Five dots stitched together by Starc before Singh clips a full ball on his pads through mid-wicket for a sublime four! The Dutch are underway – 99 more of those should do it!

Thanks Jonathan, top work covering the mayhem and genius of the final ten overs! Hello everyone, Jim here to lead you through the Dutch response, just the small matter of 400 runs needed for the lads in orange.

The stattos across the globe are duly working themselves into a numerical lather over that record-breaking innings. Here’s one that just caught my eye – from the err Beautiful Mind of Daniel Norcross (I’m fairly certain he will have pinched it…)

Glenn Maxwell arrived at the crease at the end of the 39th over and still got a hundred. The latest arrival by a centurion in ODI history.

It needs stating at the outset of this half-time round-up that the Netherlands didn’t bowl badly, never lost their heads, were captained astutely, and fielded as well as you could ever imagine in such conditions. And still they find themselves chasing 400.

There are two main reasons for that: David Warner and Glenn Maxwell.

The former anchored Australia’s innings after Pat Cummins won the toss and made a measured 104 from 93 deliveries. It was an innings of bursts of runs and passages of calm from the veteran who laid the foundation for the carnage that followed. Around him Steve Smith (71) and Marnus Labuschagne (62) looked in decent touch and Mitch Marsh (9) fell early.

But Australia slipped from 244-2 to 290-6 and instead of cantering towards 400 the target became much more modest. Until Maxwell fulfilled his cricketing destiny with a 40-ball century – the fastest in world cup history by nine balls! And he did so with some of the most outrageous shots you could ever see on a cricket field. It was a joy to witness. In seven overs his partnership with Cummins was worth 103 runs and turned a contest into a work of performance art.

Bas de Leede bore the brunt of the damage, ending his 10 overs with figures of 2/115 – a new record for the most expensive spell in world cups. But, given time, I’m sure even he will appreciate the role he played in one of the most astonishing passages of cricket in the sport’s history.

And with that, it’s time for James Wallace to take control and see you through the Dutch run chase. Catch you soon.

49.3 over: Australia 393-6 (Maxwell 106, Cummins 8) Even the mishits are going to the rope. Maxwell fails with the reverse lap but the back of the bat still deflects the ball beyond the keeper and away for four. That’s the century partnership off just 43 balls.

100 for Glenn Maxwell (40 balls - new world cup record)

49th over: Australia 389-6 (Maxwell 102, Cummins 8) Maxwellball is life. De Leede begins his over bowling full and straight so Maxwell belts him back down the ground for consecutive fours. Then he marmalises a slower ball over midwicket for six, and helps a legside full toss out of the ground for six more! Carnage! Carnage on a historic scale! 4/4/6/6… what’s next? Six more! Another full toss helped over square leg. The fastest world cup century – and by a massive margin – beating Aidan Markram’s mark of 49 set just a few days ago. This is staggering. Maxwell removes his helmet, holds his arms wide and soaks up the adulation. This is the coming together of everything he’s been promising his entire career.

48th over: Australia 361-6 (Maxwell 75, Cummins 8) Van Beek has the unenviable task of coming into the attack to play the role of cannon fodder. Maxwell welcomes him by standing his ground and hoiking a six over cow corner. Cummins then joins in the fun, but fortunately, miscuing a slog that O’Dowd could have gone for on the full coming in off the midwicket fence, but instead he hesitated and missed the half-volley. Maxwell is soon back on strike, stepping to leg and carving another improbable six over backward point. It’s like watching a computer animation. How does he do this?

Good lord, now he’s hit the same shot but as a pull! Mid-leap! That was a crunching six with the ball almost on his grille! This is performance art.

46th over: Australia 325-6 (Maxwell 46, Cummins 3) Drink it in people, this is vintage Maxwellball. After exchanging singles with his skipper, the Victorian switch-hits an outrageous one-bounce four over what was point. Then he stands his ground and heaves a six over square leg. Van Meekeren retains his composure to see out the over with minimal further damage.

44th over: Australia 305-6 (Maxwell 30, Cummins 0) Gorgeous delicate late cut for four from Maxwell to begin van Meekeren’s ninth over. He then fails to connect with a couple of swipes, before a borderline wide bouncer makes it three dots in a row. Another mighty swipe from Maxwell skews off the outside edge and miles into the Delhi sky. Will it land in a fielder’s hands? Almost! Teja Nidamanuru was up in the ring at mid-off and he couldn’t make enough ground stumbling backwards and diving forlornly.

43rd over: Australia 297-6 (Maxwell 22, Cummins 0) Maxwell keeps the momentum flowing with an improbably fine sweep for four. A couple more follow then a rotation of strike. Cummins just has to face one delivery, and van der Merwe knows the Australian skipper isn’t going to be interested in anything flash, so he tosses up a full wide delivery for the No 8 to chase. Cummins takes the bait, misses the ball, and Edwards claims a catch behind the stumps. The Dutch skipper takes an age deciding if he should REVIEW or not. Cheers greet the T signal but it doesn’t take long for Rassie Erasmus to figure out there was no bat involved.
