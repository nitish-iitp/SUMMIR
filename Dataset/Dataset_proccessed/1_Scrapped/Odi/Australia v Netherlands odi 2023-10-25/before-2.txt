South Africa vs Bangladesh Commentary
5:03 PM IST That brings us to the end of the 23rd match of the ICC World Cup 2023 where South Africa clinch another big win against Bangladesh this time to move up the ladder, claiming the 2nd position under India at the moment. Join us again as on 25th October 2023 it's Australia meeting the Netherlands in Delhi for match number 24 which will start at 2 pm IST (8.30 am GMT). Till then, have a good night.
5:00 PM IST Aiden Markram, the captain of South Africa says that it was another good day. Feels that it was tough to grind it out towards the end but all in all, it was a great day. Reckons that the death bowling is not a problem and adds that the guys have worked hard to bowl at the death. Shares that Quinton de Kock was superb as was Heinrich Klaasen who walked in and smashed it. Mentions that it is different how each person in the top 6 bats. Informs that Temba Bavuma improved quiet a lot but was not fully fit for this game. Hopes that he can be ready for the next game against Pakistan.
4:57 PM IST Bangladesh's skipper Shakib Al Hasan says that they bowled well in the first 25 overs. Adds that Quinton de Kock kicked on from there and they did not have any answer to the way Heinrich Klaasen finished. Feels that they should have bowled better. Reckons that this was one of the most expensive last 10 overs they have bowled in a long time. Mentions that Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah have been doing their role well. Feels that the top order needs to do well. Further adds that it is a long tournament and there is a lot to be learned and to play for. Ends by saying that they would love to finish 5th or 6th if not in the semis.
4:56 PM IST Quinton de Kock is the Player of the Match for his scintillating knock of 174 runs off 140 balls. He says that he is a bit more tired than satisfied. Mentions that it was a great day out and everyone played their part. Adds that it is nice to get two points on the board. On this being his 150th ODI, he says that he was nervous this morning and he is one of the those guys who does not get nervous. On Heinrich Klaasen, he says he has been absolutely amazing and he has been special for whichever team he has played. Adds that he has taken the World Cup by storm and says that he is happy for him.
4:49 PM IST ... TIME FOR PRESENTATIONS ...
4:44 PM IST Facing the daunting target of 383 runs, Bangladesh's batters encountered a challenging task from the outset. The South African bowling attack swiftly dismantled the top order, and Bangladesh found themselves in dire straits, losing three wickets in the opening six overs. As the powerplay ended, Bangladesh had only managed to score 34 runs and had already lost four wickets. Despite a valiant effort from Mahmudullah, no other batter could provide substantial resistance, Mahmudullah ended up scoring a brilliant century for his side while the other batter fell short of converting starts, and Bangladesh was eventually bowled out for 233 runs in 46.4 overs. Bangladesh's skipper, Shakib Al Hasan, would be disappointed with the performance, especially in the context of their ongoing struggles with top-order batting. This loss not only tilted their head-to-head record against South Africa in World Cups to 3-2 but also placed them in a precarious position on the points table. In contrast, South Africa has been on a roll, consistently posting 300+ scores in their last four games while batting first. The team's players are in remarkable form, with different stars shining in each match. Quinton de Kock's magnificent 174 on his 150th ODI was the standout performance of the day, further boosting South Africa's confidence as they move forward in the tournament. they were on the top of their game even tonight as they bowled brilliantly with Marco Jansen picking up the crucial first 2 wickets with Lizaad Williams and Kagiso Rabada chipping in as well. Keshav Maharaj also picked up a couple in the middle overs and as a unit they kept pushing the Bangladesh batters on the back foot from the word go and that resulted in them pulling off a comfortable win.
