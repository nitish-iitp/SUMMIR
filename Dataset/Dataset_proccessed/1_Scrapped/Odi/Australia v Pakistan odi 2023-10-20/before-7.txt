India vs Pakistan Highlights, World Cup 2023: Shreyas Iyer hit the winning runs and in the process got to his half century as well.
India vs Pakistan Highlights, World Cup 2023:

India vs Pakistan Highlights, World Cup 2023: Jasprit Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav triggered a stunning Pakistan collapse and shared four wickets in India's dominant victory over their archrivals at the 2023 World Cup on Saturday. The seven-wicket win in front of a crowd of more than 100,000 fans at Narendra Modi Stadium was India’s eighth consecutive victory over Pakistan in World Cups in a streak that began in 1992. Bumrah took 2/19 in seven overs and Kuldeep picked 2/35 in 10 overs as Pakistan crashed from 155/2 (29.3 overs) to 191 all out in 42.5 overs. Apart from Kuldeep and Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Mohammed Siraj and Ravindra Jadeja all got two wickets each....Read More

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: VIRAT KOHLI! That's it… that's the post!

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: Virat Kohli is the biggest thorn in Pakistan's eyes. They can't stop him; they don't know how to. Look at his record: Over 600 runs at an average of 55-plus. He is coming off back-to-back fifties against Afghanistan and Australia, and before that, scored a century against Pakistan in the Asia Cup. The scenario is simple: When Kohli falls early, Pakistan sleeps easy. But that hasn't been the case lately, has it? Barring that little lapse in concentration in Pallekele last month. In the last three ICC matches against Pakistan, Kohli has registered scores of 77 (in 2019 World Cup), 51 (in 2021 T20 World Cup) and the epic 82 at the MCG last year. The unforgiving law of averages suggests that a low score may be looming for Kohli, but considering the significance of the game and Kohli's innate ability to excel on grand occasions, today may not be THE DAY.

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: Kuldeep threat looming large for PAK

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: From a time when he was dropped from the Indian squad and seemed unlikely to make a return, Kuldeep Yadav's fortunes have swung the entire arc. Even more importantly, he has once again become a master of deception, bewildering batters with his wily old tricks. Not too long ago, Kuldeep delivered a five-wicket haul against Pakistan during the Asia Cup last month, and the memory of that performance is bound to be playing on the minds of India's arch-rivals. Therefore, it came as no surprise to witness Mohammad Rizwan, Pakistan's in-form batsman, practicing sweeps and reverse-sweeps against a local left-arm wrist spinner in the nets.

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: THE BURNING QUESTION! How do Pakistan tackle Jasprit Bumrah?

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: If there were ever concerns as to whether Jasprit Bumrah will remain the same threatening, menacing bowler post his back injury, well… wrap those thoughts in a piece of satin and let them out to dry. Since his return against Ireland, Bumrah has looked more destructive than ever. His pace hasn't dropped one bit – if anything, there is just that extra zip in his deliveries. He has picked 16 wickets in eight innings, recording his best World Cup figures the other afternoon in Delhi. Bumrah has taken his reputation of picking up wickets in all phases of the game even further, and the most compelling example behind it was the 3rd ODI against Australia in Rajkot last month, where after being bludgeoned for 51 runs in his first five overs, he roared back to pick 3 wickets for 30 in his final five overs. If that isn't greatness, wonder what is?

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: Rohit vs Shaheen – the battle that could define this game

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: The last time India and Pakistan met each other in an ODI, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul gave a real pasting to Shaheen, Haris and Co. And while it was a pretty one-sided affair, today is a fresh chapter. Historically, Rohit has never had it easy against Shaheen, dating back to the T20 World Cup match in Dubai where the India captain endured a first-ball duck. Even in the Asia Cup Group tie, although Rohit tried to take him on initially and kind of succeeded too, Shaheen ripped out his middle stump. In comparison, the Super 4 faceoff was dominated by Rohit. Now, as we look forward to Round 3, one can only imagine what this next encounter will be like.

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: The key to winning 'Mother of all battles'

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: We have been hearing for a while now – even the greats have said it – whichever team handles pressure better in an India-Pakistan match, will emerge winner. But we all know it's easier said than done. Matches are won in passages, and teams who come out on top in different phases of play are likely to earn bragging rights. And when it's India vs Pakistan, the stakes are just that bit higher. For India, seeing off the opening burst would be key, while for Pakistan, whether their middle order can raise to the wily Kuldeep Yadav will be a huge factor. Check out that and then some in our very special report.

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: Friends or rivals?

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: The answer is "Frenemies." That's the most fitting way to characterise the relationship between India and Pakistan, as well as their cricketers. While political tensions have limited this highly-anticipated clash to ICC and ACC tournaments, it hasn't dampened the spirit of sportsmanship or the warmth that players feel for each other. This is not a recent development. Starting from the 1980s when Javed Miandad, Imran Khan, Sunil Gavaskar, and Kapil Dev celebrated Holi together, to the 1999 series, the camaraderie between India and Pakistan is unparalleled. Of course, there have been some quarrels, controversies and verbal spats, but that's just their passion speaking. For more insights, check out our special bonhomie feature on the subject.

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: For PAK, a welcome like none other!

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: If you're a member of the Pakistan cricket team and have to reflect upon how your time in India has been since arriving here 15 days ago for the World Cup, the word you are looking for here is fulfilling. The Pakistan team has had a ball here this far, first receiving a warm welcome in Hyderabad and then gorging on some traditional Hyderabadi cuisine. However, the tip of the iceberg is how the Hyderabad crowd warmed up to them, turning up in numbers for the game against Sri Lanka and repeatedly breaking out 'Jeetega bhai jeetega! Pakistan jeetega' chants. Fewer gestures can top it.

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: THE STARS HAVE LANDED!

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: When it's India vs Pakistan, who better than the Master Blaster to grace the occasion? Sachin Tendulkar, who has scored the most runs in IND-PAK ODIs, has landed in Ahmedabad to support Team India. Tendulkar has been a constant during India-Pakistan World Cup matches since his retirement. He was in the commentary panel in both 2015 and 2019 World Cups and even attended the World T20 in 2016 at Kolkata's Eden Gardens.

Not just Sachin, but Bollywood beauty Anushka Sharma, Virat Kohli's wife will be in attendance too. Dinesh Karthik, who shared the same flight as the two superstars on his way to Ahmedabad, summed it perfectly: "Royalty at 35000 feet". We concur, DK. We concur.

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: Hello, Ahmedabad weather! What have you got in store for us?

India vs Pakistan Live Score, World Cup: Well… no rain, says Accuweather and the Indian Meteorological Department. That's simply terrific. But at the same time, Ahmedabad is expected to be pretty hot and humid, and could well bring back memories of Chennai's sappy heat. Delhi was much pleasant as Northern India is witnessing an early onset of winders, but the same can't be said about Gujarat, slap bang in the middle of the map, where the blazing sun is not going to make things easy for both batting and fielding sides. Rizwan and his cramps… Are you listening? If you're on your way to the stadium be sure to carry some sunscreen and loads of fluids. It's going to be that kind of an afternoon.
