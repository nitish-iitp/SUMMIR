Australia opener David Warner continued to haunt Pakistan in ODIs as he brought up his first century of the 2023 World Cup, decimating the Pakistan bowling attack in Bengaluru on Friday, October 20.

It was David Warner's 5th World Cup hundred and his fourth successive hundred in ODIs against Pakistan. It's a streak that began in 2017.

David Warner became only the second batter in the history of ODI cricket to score 4 successive hundreds against an opposition in the 50-over format of the game.

A post shared by ICC (@icc)

Virat Kohli achieved the feat against the West Indies in 2017-18, notching up 4 successive ODI hundreds against them.

WARNER'S PURPLE PATCH VS PAKISTAN

130 in Sydney in 2017
179 in Adelaide in 2017
107 in Taunton in 2019
100* in Bengaluru in 2023

At the end of the 33rd over, Warner was unbeaten on 123 while Marsh was batting on 109 not out with the two batters hitting 14 sixes and 21 boundaries between them in a run-fest in Bengaluru.

Warner was dropped on 10 as Usama Mir, who replaced vice-captain Shadab Khan in the XI, grassed a sitter after Shaheen Shah Afridi induced the edge.

Warner made full use of the opportunity as he was ruthless, sending everything into the stands.

Notably, Marsh celebrated his birthday with a century, becoming the first Australian batter to do so in ODI cricket.

Marsh and Warner also became the first set of Australian openers to score a hundred each in the same innings of a World Cup match.
