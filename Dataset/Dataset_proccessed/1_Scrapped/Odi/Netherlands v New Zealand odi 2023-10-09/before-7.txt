New Zealand were on the verge of becoming World Champions in the 2019 ODI World Cup final against England at Lords Cricket ground. But, when the match finished after going into the Super over,, the Kiwis were only lacking in the boundary count and England were declared as winners. New Zealand always enter major tournaments as favorites and perform tremendously well throughout the tournament but fell short in big games like semi final or final.

New Zealand have been one of the most consistent teams in the past few years, by making into the consecutive finals in the 2015 and 2019 World Cup, final of the 2021 T20 World Cup and even winning the World Test Championship in 2021. It is no doubt that New Zealand will again enter the upcoming tournament as favorites and one of the contenders who coils make into the top 4. And the great news for their fans is that the skipper Kane Williamson is back in the squad and will take charge of the team in the World Cup
