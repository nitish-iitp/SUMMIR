The ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 has seen many unexpected outcomes so far. A supposedly weaker team like Afghanistan has defeated defending champions England and established sub-continental sides like Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

Similarly, the Netherlands have also delighted their supporters by beating South Africa and Bangladesh.

Both the teams have won their respective last match and will be looking forward to maintaining their momentum.

The race for the semi-finals is into its last phase, and Afghanistan’s hopes are still alive. The Afghans have three wins out of six matches and must defeat the Dutch to stay in the reckoning for a historic last-four spot.

The Netherlands have also been a dark horse in the tournament, though their chances of qualifying are bleak, as they have secured just two wins in six matches. But their potential, skills and spirit are enough to turn the tables on other teams. Netherlands defeated Bangladesh by a whopping 87 runs in their last game, and if luck favours them and they win three consecutive matches from here on, the Netherlands might well qualify for the semi-finals.

Netherlands and Afghanistan have played nine ODI matches against each other. Afghanistan have won seven matches, while the Netherlands have won just two.

Squads:

Afghanistan: Hashmatullah Shahidi (C), Noor Ahmad, Ikram Ali Khil, Fazal Farooqi, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Naveen-ul-Haq, Reyaz Hassan, Rashid Khan, Mohammad Nabi, Azmat Omarzai, Abdul Rahman,Rahmat Shah, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Najib Zadran, Ibrahim Zadran.

Netherlands: Scott Edwards (C), Colin Ackermann, Shariz Ahmad, Wesley Barresi, Bas de Leede, Aryan Dutt, Sybrand Engelbrecht, Ryan Klein, Teja Nidamanuru, Max O’Dowd, Vikram Singh, Logan van Beek,Roelof van der Merwe, Paul van Meekeren, Saqib Zulfiqar.

The match will be played on Friday, November 3 at 1pm Kabul time at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow.

Manchester United ace rumored to be heading for Al-Nassr

Manchester United are unlikely to do big business in January and one high earner could be on his way out.

Ruben Amorim wanted an improved start to 2025 after five defeats in six Premier League games to end 2024.

This did not happen entirely as Sunday’s match saw United draw 2-2 with Liverpool.

That performance sparked some hope for United fans but Amorim will still need plenty of signings in 2025 to make real progress.

Amorim isn’t expecting a major January though and certainly needs players to leave in order to make new signings.

United will however also be looking to offload big earners this year and one player who fits the bill is Casemiro.

Casemiro joined United from Real Madrid in 2022 with the Brazilian arriving in a big-money move – both in terms of fee and wages.

Selling Casemiro this month is something football journalist Fabrizio Romano has claimed is on the cards – a move which could save United a whopping £350,000-a-week (about $440,000).

It is also a move which could prove lucrative for United, with Saudi Arabia appearing to be the likeliest move for Casemiro.
It is thought that United would sell Casemiro for around €30m ($52 million), which represents a huge loss on the €70m ($73 million) which was spent on the Brazilian back in 2022.

If United receive £25m, it would pay off a big chunk of one possible replacement.

Afghanistan triumphs in Test victory against Zimbabwe

Rashid Khan played a key role, claiming 7-66 and helping Afghanistan clinch the series

Afghanistan secured victory on Monday against Zimbabwe in their second test match, winning by 72 runs in just 15 balls at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo. 

Rashid Khan played a key role, claiming 7-66 and helping Afghanistan clinch the series. 

This marks Afghanistan's fourth test win since obtaining test status in 2017.

Zimbabwe was all out for 205 without adding to their overnight score, losing the final two wickets in a quick 13 minutes.

Richard Ngarava's run-out in the day's second over, due to confusion with skipper Craig Ervine, set the tone. 

Ervine fell in the next over, trapped leg before wicket by Rashid Khan's decisive leg-spin, culminating in figures of 7-66. 

Khan's performance on Sunday shifted momentum when Zimbabwe was poised for victory at 157-4, chasing 278.

The first test in Bulawayo ended in a draw, but Afghanistan's win secured their fourth test victory, two coming against Zimbabwe, since acquiring test status in 2017.

Three wickets in the last hour of play for Rashid Khan put Afghanistan on the cusp of victory in the second test against Zimbabwe at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo, with the home team still 73 runs shy of their target at the close of day four.

Zimbabwe were 205 for eight at stumps on Sunday, chasing 278 to win the series after the first test ended in a high scoring draw, Reuters reported.

Captain Craig Ervine (53 not out) and Richard Ngarava (3 not out) will resume on Monday after Afghanistan hauled themselves back into the contest when veteran Khan’s leg-break bowling put the brakes on the home team’s march.
