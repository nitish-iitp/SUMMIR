Netherlands vs Afghanistan Live Score, NED vs AFG Cricket World Cup 2023: OUT!

Netherlands vs Afghanistan Live Score, NED vs AFG Cricket World Cup 2023: Oh no! That's a soft dismissal. Rahmat hands an easy catch to bowler Saqib Zulfiqar as Afghanistan lose their third!

129/3 in 22.4 overs; target 180
