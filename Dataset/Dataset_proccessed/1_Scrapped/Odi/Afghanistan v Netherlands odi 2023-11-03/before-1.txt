WE TAKE PRIDE IN SOUTH AFRICA's SUCCESS
 
Emir 2023-11-01 22:26:41 

It was always going to be sad during this world cup knowing we are not there. But the performance of South Africa, can make us all proud and I hope all West Indian Fans will throw the full support behind. They are like us, and arguably no other team are closer to us then they are.

Their African players and their fans always support us as their second team, and during apartheid, WI were an inspiration to them and they held us in high esteem.

Should they bring home the WC, it will be a victory for all of us.

Nah. I’m a Pakistan supporter. Not that I donlt like SA because honestly they’re batting like an intelligent West Indies, but Pakistan has always been my second team

Pakistan need to take a page out of India's book: Become a professional outfit starting with their management, their players are exciting, dynamic, and thrilling- unpredictable. It is why cricket fans the world over love to see them play and I would like to see them in the semis.

They haven't played well this tournament and have only themselves to blame.

I am backing SA because, they are closest to us in every count, yes they have some ethnic European players, but the history, their captain, their 2 fast bowlers, their 2 spinners- all black-brown.

In addition, during apartheid, they supported us- we were their team. Imagine if SA take the WC, what it would mean for black/brown kids.

Just as you I have always had feelings about the Saffies when it's cricket but Pakistan will be and always my second team.They always seem to find naturally talented players,fast men ,slow,swing bowlers and most of batsmen who can turn games around from the jaws of defeat to winners,then there' the other side,you know what I mean.They excite the viewers.

What about the Indos that support India? Their fore parents came from there what barely a few generations ago. Team has Hindus, Muslims, all shades of brown and black. Their league has made millionaires out of many our Caribbean cricketers and continues to provide opportunities.

I find the Indian team play too much "text book" cricket and could be boring at times,i understand that is how you should play to get to the top,I'll give them credit for that but Pakistan is an exciting team to watch.The Saffies are sort of similar.

pakistan plays a very west indian brand of cricket and have possibly been the most popular tourists to visit our shores. When they're on song, no one can beat them. One team could have done it, the WI, but we have regressed badly since we started picking seond string teams. Even when we were great or very good, beating Pakistan was a task

Pakistan...don't care for Saffies

 
Curtis 2023-11-02 17:46:32 

Huge population notwithstanding, WI can align their energies and plans to bring cricket back, similar to what India did. At same time, work on our music curriculum. Any other curriculum too for that matter.

Plans at school levels do work

homie this makes no sense. the ipl is a for profit tournament, not a public service. those west indian players were picked because they were the best in the world, which is why that group of players has two world cups to their name, 5 ipl titles and how much other t20 titles. Should we support Australia because Kerry Packer modernized international cricket, including ours?

Not the same. The great India of our great ancestors ceased to be. The modern India wants to be and acts like their former colonial master. They seek validation from Australians because they are white. The Indian cricket fraternity is no better. They do not see you as one of them.

The India of today is a dump heap of modern development, large army and incredible arrogance. Our ancestors left an Indian that was Godly and fought injustice form the colonial and slave masters- the India today wants to be like and crave the validation from their former oppressors.

Our unknows cousins in India- 4th, 5th, 6th and beyond generations cannot get into the Indian team, they face daily caste discrimination.

Err no. Our ancestors left India because their chance of social advancement was next to nothing. Which is why the majority of them came from Uttar Pradesh, one of the poorest states in India, although my Indian ancestors come from Tamil Nadu

 
Halliwell 2023-11-03 10:38:59 

The reason you guys didn’t support SA before is the same reason I can’t support SA today

I will re assess when De Kock leaves the scene

Pakistan all the way as a second side.
I’m with granite here- Indian cricket doesn’t do it for me. Especially when the ‘crowd goes wild’ for a single.

Yeah. Pakistan cricket has an attachment to the West Indies since Imran Khan and. Wasim Raja came and showed their stuff. As I said, the biggest Pakistan fans outside of India and Pakistan would be in the West Indies( Indians love Pakistan cricket, doh mind the fanaticism that is taking place now). I remember watching a test series in England few years ago. It was either Mikey’s second to last or antepenultimate assignment as a commie. They asked him about the teams that gave the WI problems. And straight away he said Pakistan. And I think that’s where the admiration started.

Okay, but Pak are for all intent and purpose out- how will you then support them in the finals? You miss the context of my post.

Secondly, you also missed an important piece of my post- this isn't about some "the cock" but about a great nation that defeated the entire nations of slave masters colonists and their young Black captain leading his nation to a feat that has not been accomplished by them.


No one should miss this historical moment.

Pakistan is the second team for most of the West Indian cognoscenti because we used to,play the same kind of cricket. Both teams are shadows of themselves these days.

 
Halliwell 2023-11-03 11:55:27 

In reply to Emir

I get the first point and agree.
The second one is where we differ. I don’t think they defeated YET, what you are saying they have, because of the continued presence of DeKock after what has happened in the last few years.

 
Emir 2023-11-03 12:07:27 

In reply to Halliwell

Disagree, but I respect your opinion though I remain greatly puzzled by why you allow one person in the team to define the entire squad of 15.

 
doosra 2023-11-03 12:10:51 

India look unbeatable but they are due a loss, no?

SA have the goods to win if they can overcome their old tendency to not get it done

NZ chances gone with all those injuries - guys playing too much cricket 

Australia too up and down but don't trust them

This post is about South Africa and us West Indians supporting them. Not an analysis of who is going to be the top 4 or who will win

They’re not out as yet. Afghanistan’s will probably beat the Dutch but their run rate is inferior. NZ are coming into the Pakistan game tomorrow on the back of 3 straight losses. If they lose against Pakistan they’ll be out of the top fouria ripped apart SL’s run rate last night. My god that was a mauling

You seem really upset that India is not our second team.

After so many generations you still refuse to accept Mother Guyana, why do you see the need to still hang on- you ancestors made a sacrifice so you can find a new world and adopt and assimilate, and live in freedom, not hold on to what they fled from.

It is very sad indeed. The modern rulers and elite people of India, don't see you as one of them-just ask Shiv and Kalli and Modi. (The poor will and powerless will identify with you)

Emir is a Gaslighter.



Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation in which the abuser attempts to sow self-doubt and confusion in their victim's mind. Typically, gaslighters are seeking to gain power and control over the other person, by distorting reality and forcing them to question their own judgment and intuition.

A sad day for cricket. We must take solace that life continues after this game. For the majority around the world, SF is their second team absent WI.

To see Australia and India in the final seems like their is no justice, but this is life. I will not be watching the "finals."

Cricket needs a reformer, cannot have a neo liberal economic model rule the sport. This paradigm is destroying the game. The modern radical right wing political India- not the great India of yesteryear, and Australia are the two most guilty ones that is killing this game.
