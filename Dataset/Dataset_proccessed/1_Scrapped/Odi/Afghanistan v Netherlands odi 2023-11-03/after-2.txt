Hashmatullah Shahidi dedicates win

Hashmatullah Shahidi says this victory, which keeps his side in the hunt for a semi-finals berth, means a lot. He tells the post-match presentation: "Of course, a hundred percent we're trying our best to make it to the semi-finals and if that happened it would be a big achievement for our country.

"Also, especially to me, I lost my mother three months ago so my family is in pain so that will be a big achievement first of all to our country and then my family also.

"Right now a lot of refugee peoples are in struggle so we are watching their videos and we are sad for that and we are with them in this tough time and I dedicate this win to those refugees that are in pain and also to all country peoples back home."

Edwards: 'We gave wickets away'

Scott Edwards, Netherlands captain, admits his side did "give a few wickets away" with those four run outs among their top five batters. "Definitely not ideal. You beat yourself a little bit in that sense," he told the post-match presentation, saying those dismissals were "hard to come back from".

Afghanistan win!

Afghanistan notch up their fourth victory of the tournament, sealed with a four from skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi, who cracks an Aryan Dutt delivery over midwicket. He remains unbeaten on 56 after he and Rahmat Shah (52) broke the back of a modest run chase of 180 to lead their side to a seven-wicket victory.

Azmatullah Omarzai remains not out 31 with Afghanistan closing on 181 for 3 with 18.3 overs to spare. Mohammad Nabi is player of the match for his 3 for 28 and the Dutch will be left to rue a rash of run outs, four of their top five falling that way. Wicketkeeper Ikram Alikhil was crucial with a hand in three of those dismissals as well as two catches and a stumping.

Rahmat falls

Saqib Zulfiqar takes a return catch to remove Rahmat Shah, who throws his arms up over his head in despair after being lured into the drive and finding the bowler moving fairly effortlessly to his left on his follow through. That ends Rahmat's innings on 52 from 54 balls. Afghanistan remain in control at 129 for 3 needing 51 more with 27.2 overs and seven wickets in hand.

Breakthrough for Netherlands

Afghanistan lose their first wicket, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, caught behind off Logan van Beek for 10. He was initially adjudged not out but wicketkeeper-captain Scott Edwards was convinced there was some glove on it, reviewed and was proved right. Afghanistan are 27 for 1 in the sixth over, chasing 180 to win.

Netherlands all out for 179

That’s a wrap for the innings. Netherlands have been bowled out for 179 in the 47th over, leaving Afghanistan to chase 180 for victory. Mohammad Nabi claimed the last wicket, Paul van Meekeren lbw for 4 to give Nabi 3 for 28. Sybrand Engelbrecht top scored with 58 and Max O’Dowd contributed 42 but no other player passed 29 for Netherlands, who had four players run out.

Another wicket for Afghanistan!

A wicket maiden for Mohammad Nabi as Bas de Leede is stumped by Ikram Alikhil for just 3. Nabi bowled just back of a length outside off and de Leede hung the bat out, sending an edge behind. Netherlands slump to 97 for 5 from 92 for 2.

Two more run outs!

Colin Ackermann is run out for 29. Mohammad Nabi bowls full outside off stump to Sybrand Engelbrecht, who works it to mid-off and they set off for a single that isn't really there. Rashid Khan throws to the keeper and that's a job done.

Then, the big wicket of Scott Edwards, who had batted three times against Afghanistan in ODIs previously for as many fifties. He falls for a duck after Nabi floats one up outside off, tempting the sweep but Edwards succeeds only in getting an under-edge to keeper Ikram Alikhil, who whips off the bails with Edwards out of his crease.

Those run outs follow that of Max O'Dowd and leave Netherlands 92 for 4.

O'Dowd falls!

Max O'Dowd had found his groove to lead Netherlands' rebuild after losing a wicket on the fifth ball of the match. But he's gone, run out by an excellent direct hit from Azmatullah Omarzai, who ran round to fine leg and fired the ball into the strikers' end as O'Dowd attempted a second run, his dive landing him short. Netherlands are 73 for 2.

100th ODI wicket for Mujeeb

Mujeeb has been a fantastic new-ball bowler for Afghanistan for a while now, and he shows just why. Wesley Barresi, back in the side in place of Vikramjit Singh, falls in the fourth ball of the match, plumb in front, and that's the 100th ODI wicket for Mujeeb.

Netherlands win toss and bat first

Netherlands win the toss and bat first. Scott Edwards, their captain, says: "It's worked well for us throughout the tournament. The wicket looks good so we'll hopefully put up a good score and defend it."

Two changes for Netherlands, Roelof van der Merwe and Saqib Zulfiqar coming in for Shariz Ahmad and Vikramjit Singh. Wes Barresi moves to the top of the order with a bit of shuffling up going on behind him.

Hashmatullah Shahidi says Afghanistan wanted to bat first too. They've gone with four spinners so Noor Ahmed comes in for Naveen-ul-Haq. "In these conditions it's always spinning so we will look after that end," Hashmatullah says.

Netherlands: Max O'Dowd, Wesley Barresi, Colin Ackermann, Sybrand Engelbrecht, Scott Edwards (c & wk), Bas de Leede, Saqib Zulfiqar, Logan van Beek, Roelof van der Merwe, Aryan Dutt, Paul van Meekeren

Afghanistan: Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Ibrahim Zadran, Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi (c), Azmatullah Omarzai, Ikram Alikhil (wk) Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Noor Ahmad, Fazalhaq Farooqi

Hello from Lucknow

Hello and welcome to our coverage of Afghanistan vs Netherlands, a crucial game for both teams as they look to keep their semi-final ambitions alive. Those hopes are stronger for Afghanistan, who are sixth on the points table with three wins and three defeats. Another victory will move them level on eight points with Australia and New Zealand, who are ranked third and fourth respectively.

The Dutch, meanwhile, have been courageous this campaign and, while their chances of reaching the knockout stages are small, there is a place at the 2025 Champions Trophy in the offing for the top eight finishers here. They are currently eighth with two wins from their six games so far. Not that Netherlands are thinking that far ahead, according to Colin Ackermann in our match preview.
