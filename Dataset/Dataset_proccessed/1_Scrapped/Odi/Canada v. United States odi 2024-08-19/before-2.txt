Kai Kara-France takes on Steve Erceg in the co-main event of UFC 305 as both flyweight contenders seek redemption after failed bids for the interim championship and the championship, respectively. Australian fighter Steve Erceg, who failed to dethrone the flyweight king early this year, is a clear favorite to win the bout.
