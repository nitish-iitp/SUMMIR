West Indies Squad for England ODI Series 2024
Cricket West Indies announced 15-man squad selected for the highly anticipated West Indies Men’s CG United One Day International

The 15-man team chosen for the much awaited West Indies Men's CG United One Day International (ODI) home series against England has been announced by Cricket West Indies (CWI). With both well-known names and intriguing up-and-coming talent set to compete, fans are getting ready for what looks to be an interesting series.

Before the final match at Kensington Oval (KO) in Barbados on November 6, the three-match ODI series starts with two ODIs at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium (SVRS) in Antigua on October 31 and November 2, which coincide with Antigua's Independence weekend celebrations.

West Indies Men's Head Coach Daren Sammy, who just returned from an ODI tour of Sri Lanka in the Caribbean, commented on the forthcoming match and said he was excited to be back to action against England.

"Playing against England always brings a fresh challenge and rekindles a rivalry that the Caribbean's players and people look forward to." When we play England, we West Indies somehow manage to step up our game.

Sammy went on,

"This rivalry dates back decades, and we're prepared to take on a formidable England team once more after defeating them at home in an ODI series last year for the first time in a long time. Playing at home is always unique because of the enthusiasm and energy generated by the local crowd. We have chosen a well-rounded roster that will undoubtedly challenge and contend with one of the top teams in the globe as we aim to qualify for the ICC Men's globe Cup in 2027.

As the only change from the team that toured Sri Lanka earlier this month, Shimron Hetmyer returns to the ODI squad after last playing against England in December 2023.


This thrilling CG United ODI series prepares the audience for the eagerly awaited five-match T20 International (T20I) series between England and the West Indies, which is set for November 9–17, 2024. The T20 team will be revealed soon, giving cricket fans even more exciting cricket action to look forward to.
