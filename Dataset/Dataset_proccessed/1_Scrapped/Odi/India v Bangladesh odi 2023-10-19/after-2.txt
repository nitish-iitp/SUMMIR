India vs Bangladesh Live Score, World Cup 2023: Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill have got India cruising in the middle overs

India vs Bangladesh, Woirld Cup 2023 Highlights: Rohit Sharma got off to a flier of a start once again after Bangladesh were restricted to a score of 256/8. The Indian captain was looking imperious but he ended up falling in the 13th over on 48 off 40. Virat Kohli then came out swinging as he got two back to back no balls. He took two runs off the first, hit a four off the second that was a free hit and a six off the next free hit delivery, thus smashing 12 runs off his first three balls. Shubman Gill, meanwhile, almost effortlessly scored a half century, eventually falling on 53. Kohli and Shreyas Iyer have since looked quite secure and India are cruising along in the chase. Kohli eventually cruised past his 69th ODI half-century. India floated along, to the point that Kohli and Rahul in the end decided to ensure that the former takes most of the strike and gets to a century. What was a one-sided match suddenly became interesting and Kohli thrillingly got to his 48th ODI ton and hit the winning runs with a six....Read More

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: How the skies are holding up

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: Given the amount of rain that was chasing the Indian cricket team – from the Asia Cup all the way to the World Cup warm-ups, it's been a pleasant sight, seeing the dark clouds staying away in the first three games. However, Pune is slightly different and cause India their first interruption this World Cup. While the weather is expected to stay clear in the first half, some showers might spoil the mood towards the evening. The Pune temperature will range in the early 30s but the humidity might spike to around 45 percent during the day.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: A different KL Rahul than the one who faced Bangladesh last year

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: If Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli weren't threatening enough, Bangladesh have to find way to stop KL Rahul too. The last time Rahul played in an IND vs BAN ODI was in December, where he was transitioning from a T20I opener to cementing a place in the middle order and donning the role of a wicketkeeper simultaneously. From finding himself in a rut this time in 2022, to becoming India's most-reliable middle-order batter, Rahul 2.0 has been a grand success for India. He is no longer that jittery batter whom oppositions could snuff out cheaply and Bangladesh are likely to find it out today.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: India's only temptation to bring in Ishan Kishan

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: Who can forget December 10, 2022? Ishan Kishan smashed an abundance of records en route to bludgeoning the fastest ODI double century of all time against Bangladesh. Ishan may fall behind in the pecking order to Shubman Gill, but with Shakib playing, the team management may just be tempted to give him a go to negate the Bangladesh captain's left-arm spin threat. Ravindra Jadeja, the only left-hander bats at No. 7, and by the time he comes out, it may be just a tad late. But if Ishan comes in, who goes out? Certainly not KL Rahul. We'll explain why.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: Dear Virat Kohli! What are these freak numbers?

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: If you thought Rohit Sharma is the real threat to Bangladesh, think again. Virat Kohli is equally big. And no, we aren't just saying this based on current form. Kohli has dominated oppositions that his record against teams like Australia and Pakistan is always glorified. But that doesn't take away the fact that Kohli is a beast against other teams too, in this case, Bangladesh. Kohli stellar numbers against them – 807 runs from 15 ODIs at an average 67.25 including three centuries, the most recent of which came in the last India vs Bangladesh game he featured in. Be scared Bangladesh… be very scared!

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: Indian fans! It may be a bitter pill to swallow but…

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: The fact is, Ravichandran Ashwin and Mohammed Shami's times may be coming to an end. Ashwin's return for the World Cup is a fairytale it in itself, but the truth is that he is no longer India's No. 1 spinner in ODIs, Kuldeep Yadav is. Similarly, Shami is no longer India's preferred seam bowler to partner Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj is. Nostalgia is always beautiful. It makes you relieve your glory days and can captivate our favourite Team Indian players too. But times have changed. The Indian team is slowly beginning to move on. Neither Ashwin not Shami are automatic picks anymore. They still are in Tests, but just no longer as effective in ODIs as they once were.

Former BCCI chairman of selectors MSK Prasad agrees. He says 'Ask Ashwin and Shami if reputation is more important or winning World Cup?'. CLICK HERE to read the full story.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: 25 years of history in this one

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: Today's fixture between India and Bangladesh is significant for more reasons than one. Of course, the two teams have been involved in battles all around the world, but did you know… today marks the first of its kind in 25 years? Yes, this will mark the first instance since 1998 that Bangladesh will be playing an ODI against India in India in a quarter of a century. Head coach Rahul Dravid and Paras bowling coach Paras Mhambrey were part of India's Playing XI when that Coca-Cola Triangular Series ODI took place in Mumbai. Talk about HISTORY, boss!

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: What fuelled the India-Bangladesh cricket rivalry?

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: It all began in 2007 when Bangladesh defeated India at the World Cup. Rahul Dravid, then captain, witnessed the carnage unfold first hand. India were supposed to sail through to the next round, but a defeat in the opener rocked their campaign in ways never thought of. The Men in Blue crashed out after Sri Lanka pummelled them two games later but it led to the birth of a feud that was to turn into a fiercely-contested rivalry. Bitterness crept in when in 2010, Virender Sehwag, during a press conference, called Bangladesh an ordinary team, and it only escalated further when a no-ball drama surrounding Rohit Sharma in the 2015 World Cup led to bad blood. Ever since, India vs Bangladesh is no more just another clash of two subcontinent teams. It is a rivalry that is beginning to outgrow India vs Pakistan. READ ON to know more about this under-rated duel.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: Rohit Sharma lands in trouble for over-speeding with his Lamborghini

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: Rohit Sharma and his penchant for double centuries – he has scored 3 in ODIs and 1 in Tests – is a love story for the ages. But this is not something he would be too proud of. The India captain was issued multiple challans for over-speeding on the Mumbai-Pune expressway. His reckless driving has earned him multiple fines. Rohit was racing at an incredibly fast speed of 200 km/h in his Lamborghini, and at one point, he pushed the vehicle to reach a staggering 215 km/h, causing serious concern among traffic authorities. As a result, he was issues three traffic challans. Read the FULL STORY

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: Why Bangladesh are struggling

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: Bangladesh's big guns have rarely made an impact at this World Cup. Barring Mushfiqur Rahim, who has conjured two half-centuries, and to a certain extent, Najmul Shanto and Litton Das with a fifty each, the rest of the batters have appeared vulnerable. So much was expected of Tanzid Hasan, Towrid Hridoy and Mehidy Hasan, but the returns have been highly ineffective. To add to Bangladesh's woes, the bowling looks jaded as well. Shoriful Islam has bled runs and Taskin Ahmed is resembling a pale shadow of his former self. Against a well-rounded team like India, anything short of a combined effort could see them crash to a hat-trick of defeats.

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: Return of Rohit Sharma the off-spinner?

India vs Bangladesh Live Score, IND vs BAN World Cup 2023: Believe it or not but Rohit Sharma has taken two IPL hat-tricks in his career, which all the more doesn't explain his reluctance to bowl his loopy-yet-effective off-spinners. India's 2011 squad was all about batters who could bowl – Sachin Tendulkar, Yuvraj Singh, Virender Sehwag, Suresh Raina - a topic that has popped up more times that Rohit's ODI centuries. However, in an unexpected sight, Rohit's off-spinners returned briefly during India's practice session on Tuesday, which saw him tempt Hardik Pandya to take him on. Hardik managed to do so but the bigger picture was Rohit rolling his arms over, something which the India captain touched upon when he announced the squad for the World Cup last month.
