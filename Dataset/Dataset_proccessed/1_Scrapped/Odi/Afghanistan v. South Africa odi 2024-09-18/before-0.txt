Afghanistan vs South Africa 1st ODI 2024 | Preview | Squad and Analysis
The Afghanistan vs South Africa series begins with the 1st ODI in Sharjah

The Afghanistan vs South Africa series begins with the 1st ODI in Sharjah, a venue that traditionally supports spin bowling but has also seen quick outfields favoring batters. This ODI series offers both teams an opportunity to adjust their strategies on slower tracks ahead of upcoming international competitions.

Match Information:

Date: 18th September, 2024, 12:00 GMT

Venue: Sharjah Cricket Stadium, Sharjah, UAE

Venue Analysis: 

Sharjah is known for its short boundaries, slow pitch, and dry conditions. The surface often assists spin bowlers, making it a favorable ground for Afghanistan's spin-heavy attack. However, teams batting first tend to have an advantage as the pitch can slow down during the second innings, causing chasing teams to struggle.

Average 1st Innings Score: Around 240-260

Spin-Favorable Pitch: Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman could play a key role here.

Dew Factor: There might be some dew later in the evening, which could make bowling second a bit trickier.

South Africa Squad:

Reeza Hendricks, Tony de Zorzi, Aiden Markram, Temba Bavuma(C), Tristan Stubbs(WK), Jason Smith, Wiaan Mulder, Andile Phehlukwayo, Lungi Ngidi, Ottneil Baartman, Nandre Burger, Lizaad Williams, Bjorn Fortuin, Kyle Verreynne, Andile Simelane, Nqaba Peter

Afghanistan Squad:

Hashmatullah Shahidi (C), Rahmat Shah (VC), Rahmanullah Gurbaz (WK), Ikram Alikhil (WK), Abdul Malik, Riaz Hassan, Darwish Rasooli, Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib, Rashid Khan, Nangyal Kharoti, Allah Mohammad Ghazanfar, Fazal Haq Farooqi, Bilal Sami, Naveed Zadran, Farid Ahmad Malik.

Key Matchups:

Rashid Khan & Mujeeb Ur Rahman vs. South African Middle Order: The South African batters will face a stern test from Afghanistan’s spinners. Players like Aiden Markram and Temba Bavuma will need to find ways to rotate strike and counter the spin attack.

Kagiso Rabada & Marco Jansen vs. Rahmanullah Gurbaz: South Africa’s pace attack will look to unsettle Afghanistan's top order, but Gurbaz’s aggressive style could turn things in Afghanistan’s favor if he gets going.

South Africa: While their pace attack is top-notch, they may need to rely more on their spinners, especially Tabraiz Shamsi, given the pitch conditions at Sharjah. Their batters will also need to rotate the strike effectively against Rashid and Mujeeb.

Afghanistan: This is a venue where Afghanistan could excel, given their world-class spin attack. The key for them will be to put up a competitive total and back their spinners to defend it. Batting depth could be a concern, but players like Gurbaz and Nabi can exploit Sharjah’s small boundaries.
