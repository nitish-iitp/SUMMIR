NEW ZEALAND TOUR OF AUSTRALIA 2024
Where to watch 2nd T20I – Australia v New Zealand? Live Streaming Details
September 22, 2024  Team Female Cricket

As the 2024 Women’s Twenty20 (T20) World Cup draws near, defending champions Australia are currently sharpening their skills against arch-rivals New Zealand in a three-match T20 International (T20I) series. The series is taking place from September 19 to 24, 2024, at the Great Barrier Reef Arena and the Allan Border Field.

In the T20I series opener, New Zealand won the toss and opted to bat first, but Australia claimed the early advantage, dismissing Georgia Plimmer and Melie Kerr inside the powerplay. Suzie Bates found her rhythm while Brooke Halliday remained quiet in the middle as New Zealand managed a brief recovery, reaching 44 runs. Maddy Green joined Bates, and together they forged a significant partnership, pushing New Zealand’s total to 70/4 after 10.2 overs, with Bates departing scoring 33 off 27 balls.

Brief yet important contributions from Isabella Gaze (11) and Leigh Kasperek (14) kept the scoreboard ticking alongside Green. With 126 runs on the board in the 18th over, Green was dismissed for 35 (33). Kasperek, along with Jess Kerr (11*), propelled New Zealand to a challenging total of 143/7 in their 20 overs. Each of Megan Schutt, Tayla Vlaeminck, Sophie Molineux, Annabel Sutherland, Georgia Wareham, and Heather Graham took a wicket, with Molineux being the most economical, conceding just 2.2 runs per over.

Australia, in reply, lost Beth Mooney early in the chase, but the senior duo of Alyssa Healy and Ellyse Perry saw off the powerplay, almost, with Healy departing on the last ball, scoring 17 (18). Unfortunately for Australia, Perry departed the very next ball, as they crumbled to 3/44 in 6.1 overs. Tahlia McGrath was joined by Phoebe Litchfield, who played the role of aggressor and consistently found the gaps, stitched a 41-run stand.

Following McGrath’s dismissal for 6 (10), Georgia Wareham joined Litchfield in the onslaught before departing for 26 (20), leaving Australia on the cusp of victory with a 50-run partnership. Litchfield sealed the game for Australia with a reverse sweep, remaining unbeaten on 64 off 43, alongside Annabel Sutherland (4*) in the five-wicket win. Molly Penfold, with a couple, led New Zealand’s bowling card, with Kasperek and Halliday picking up one apiece.
