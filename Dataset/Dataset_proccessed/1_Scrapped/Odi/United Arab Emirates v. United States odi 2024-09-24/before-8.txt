Moonika was very detailed and communicative. She reached out to us before the trip to confirm all the tour activities. She also reached out to us throughout the trip to ensure everything went as planned. I really enjoy the vendors where she booked for our husky and reindeer sled rides. I could tell they actually do care about the animals, and not just a business. Even when the train was delayed, she made sure we were updated and received any possible refunds. Overall, I had an amazing time in... Read more

Finland was a lifetime dream of mine. I dreamed of seeing the aurora perform and for my 2 kids to experience the “real” Santa Claus and where he lives and everything that are associated with Christmas the Arctic way. This company fulfilled all our dreams and more. Everything was well organized, the drivers for our transport and transfers were ALWAYS on time, and the accomodations were cute and perfect which gave us a real intimate family time for 10 days.

The primary reason for visiting Finland was to attend the 2024 NHL Global Series games in Tampere. Naturally, we wanted to make the most out of traveling such a long distance from Miami and pack as much fun into the trip as possible. It was such a relief to know that the hassle of setting up transportation and convenient lodging would be taken care of, as it was one of our biggest concerns when considering a trip in an unknown region.
