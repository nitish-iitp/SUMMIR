Australia vs South Africa Live Score, World Cup 2023: De Kock 1 away from 50

Australia vs South Africa Live Score, World Cup 2023: Full from Zampa and de Kock had been waiting for that delivery for quite some time. With no long-off, a poor choice from Zampa as he provides de Kock enough room, and the SA batter says thank you very much. Lofts it over mid-off for a four and he moves to 49.

SA 80/0 in 15 overs
