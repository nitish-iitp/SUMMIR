History of the ICC World Cup

The history of the ICC World Cup traces back to the times when the first ODI match was played between the teams in the year 1971. The First World Cup was organized in the year 1975, and England hosted and funded the tournament. 

The first three editions of these world cups were held in England and it was known as the Prudential Cup as it was founded by a company, Prudential PCL. The first three editions consisted of 60 overs per side. The first two editions were won by the West Indies followed by India in the third edition.

The next edition was won by India and Pakistan and the game was reduced to 50 overs per side. It was renamed as ICC World Cup. Through that time, it has become one of the crucial tournaments in the world of cricket and it is conducted with a gap of four years.
