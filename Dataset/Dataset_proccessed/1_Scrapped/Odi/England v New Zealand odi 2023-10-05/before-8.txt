In 2019, an Eoin Morgan-led England team won the ODI World Cup in front of a jubilant home crowd. Now, four years on, they are looking to defend the trophy.

England has appeared in all editions of the ODI World Cup so far and has hosted the tournament five times — the most of any country.

They are once again among the favourites for the 2023 tournament, which runs from October 5 to November 19 in India.

Will the defending champions live up to those expectations?

Here's a look at England's past record at the ICC ODI men's tournament, and an assessment of their chances for this year.

England Cricket World Cup record: How many times has England won the ODI CWC?

While England has always had one of the strongest teams in the ODI rankings, they have so far got their hands on the ODI World Cup trophy only once, in 2019.

The team has been a part of all the ODI World Cup editions since 1975 and reached the finals four times.

Interestingly, they were favourites to win four years ago, and were ranked number one in One-Day Internationals when entering the tournament.

Led by Eoin Morgan, England played against New Zealand in a thriller of a final at Lord's. The game was tied after both teams scored 241 runs. 

When the Super Over was also tied, England won the World Cup based on the boundary countback rule.

Andrew Strauss registered the highest individual score by an English batsman in the 2011 World Cup against hosts India. He scored a scintillating 158 on a tough Indian pitch.

The best bowling figures for England were registered by Vic Marks back in 1983 against Sri Lanka. His brilliant 5-39 remains unbeaten by any of his countrymen.

England registered their highest CWC score against Afghanistan in 2019. The hosts put up a formidable 397 runs in their innings.

With Ben Stokes coming out of his ODI retirement, it looks like England are ready to go for glory again in the 2023 ODI World Cup with all guns blazing.

Jos Buttler's team not only holds the 2019 ODI World Cup trophy but also the 2022 T20 World Cup. Can the hot streak continue for England?
