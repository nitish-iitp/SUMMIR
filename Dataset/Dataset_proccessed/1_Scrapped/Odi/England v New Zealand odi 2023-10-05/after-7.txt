‘Unbelievable’ performance from youngster Ravindra

Rachin Ravindra has been named the player of the match for his unbeaten 123.

Speaking to broadcaster Star Sports, the 23-year-old said: “Sometimes it’s unbelievable at times, but great to have a great day out. The bowlers bowled well and were lucky enough to have Devon [Conway] out there. I spent a lot of time with Dev and we are very, very close mates. I was a little more comfortable and I have a lot of chat with Dev – being able to do that in the middle is cool.”

No Williamson, no problem for New Zealand

New Zealand were without their usual captain Williamson, as well as Southee, Ferguson and Bracewell. Yet, that did not seem to trouble the Black Caps as they hammered England, outclassing them with both the bat and the ball.

The victory will help boost New Zealand’s net run-rate, which might come handy in the latter stages of the tournament.

New Zealand deliver all-round performance for huge win

New Zealand begin their 2023 World Cup campaign with a massive victory against the reigning champions, England.

New Zealand’s bowlers did well to restrict England to under 300, as Henry picked up three wickets and Santner and Phillips bagged two apiece. Later, Conway (152 not out) and Ravindra (123 not out) helped them chase 283 with little trouble.

England, on the other hand, underperformed with the bat as only captain Buttler stepped up. In the second innings, their bowlers struggled against New Zealand’s formidable batters.

The victory will provide a big confidence boost to New Zealand, who lost the 2019 final to England on the account of boundaries.
