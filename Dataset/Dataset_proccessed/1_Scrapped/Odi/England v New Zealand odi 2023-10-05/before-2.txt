In the latest information from Cricket New Zealand, it has been revealed that New Zealand's captain, Kane Williamson, won't be available for the first match. Williamson had recently made a comeback, scoring 54 runs off 50 balls in a warm-up match against Pakistan. 

He is returning to the team after an injury during IPL 2023. His fitness is of paramount importance for New Zealand as they prepare for the ICC World Cup 2023.

England and India are widely regarded as strong contenders for the 2023 Cricket World Cup. However, New Zealand should not be underestimated in this significant tournament. 

The England squad boasts exceptional players like Jos Buttler, Liam Livingstone, and Ben Stokes, while New Zealand also fields talents such as Trent Boult, Lockie Ferguson, and Tom Latham.

In the previous encounter between these teams during the ICC World Cup 2019 final, the match was nothing short of dramatic. England clinched the World Cup title in a thrilling Super Over contest against New Zealand. This captivating match sparked numerous discussions and debates among cricket experts and fans.

Match Details:

- Tournament: ICC Cricket World Cup 2023

- Match: England (ENG) vs New Zealand (NZ), 1st Match

- Date: Thursday, October 5, 2023

- Time: 2:00 PM

- Venue: Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad

Pitch Report:

The Narendra Modi Stadium boasts a combination of six black soil pitches and five red soil pitches. While the red soil pitches are known to offer extra help to seam bowlers in comparison to the black ones, the black soil pitches still present favorable conditions for bowlers, including good bounce. Nevertheless, as the match unfolds, the pitch tends to lose its pace, becoming more spinner-friendly.

England: Jonny Bairstow, Harry Brook, Dawid Malan, Liam Livingstone, Moeen Ali, Jos Buttler (c), Ben Stokes, Reece Topley, Adil Rashid, Sam Curran, Mark Wood

New Zealand: Devon Conway, Tim Southee, Finn Allen, WA Young, DJ Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner, Rachin Ravindra, Tom Latham (C), MJ Henry, Trent Boult
