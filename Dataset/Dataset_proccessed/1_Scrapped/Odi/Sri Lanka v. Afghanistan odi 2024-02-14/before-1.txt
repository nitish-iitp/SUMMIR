SL vs AFG Live Streaming, 3rd ODI: Sri Lanka to take on Afghanistan in a dead rubber match. (X/Afghanistan Cricket Team)

Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan Live Streaming, 3rd ODI: Sri Lanka will host Afghanistan for the final and inconsequential ODI match in the 3-match series on Wednesday. With the series already in the Lankan Lions’ pockets after winning the first 2 matches, the third one will all be about Afghanistan gaining some sort of momentum before the T20I series begins from Saturday.

In the second ODI, Charith Asalanka scored 97 while captain Kusal Mendis and Sadeera Samarawickrama chipped in with 61 and 52 respectively. At the tail end, Janith Liyanage scored a 50 of his own as Sri Lanka set a target of 308. Chasing, Afghanistan’s Ibrahim Zadran and Rahmat Shah were the only ones who could score decent runs but their efforts were in vain with their team getting bundled out for 153.

In the first ODI, it was all about Pathum Nissanka’s 210 not out which helped him become the highest individual scorer in Sri Lanka’s ODI history, surpassing Sanath Jayasuria’s iconic 189 vs India in 2000. While Azmatullah Omarzai and Mohammad Nabi gave it the old college try with tons of their own, Afghanistan fell short by 42 runs.
