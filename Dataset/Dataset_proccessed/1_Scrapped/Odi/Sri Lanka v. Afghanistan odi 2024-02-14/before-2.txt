It's an older can in really good condition, with lots of life remaining. I'm heavily invested into the AAC ratcheting 51T mounts (10, I think), and I know their weaknesses. The can's ratchet pawl mechanism is in excellent condition, and this can does not see high use, FA duty at all. I use Viton O-Rings to keep the can from wiggling on the mount, and that system works fine for me.

But. I desire to move to the 1.375 x24 universal mount system, and my can purchases going forward reflect this choice.

It's Big, It's Heavy, It's a Dinosaur but it's Mine. I lose the AAC 51T mount money ($1000+, but who is counting?). On the flip side, the new HUB mount would then accommodate this older can.

My question is: Should I send this AAC can off for a conversion?

Yes. Sent mine to Ecco Machine last year for a Cherry Bomb conversion. But they have several mounting options. I am well pleased with the conversion and quality of workmanship….really extended the usefulness for me. Took what I could get for the old 51Ts and have not regretted it.

This is a link to my experience having an AAC SD 7.62 converted by ECCO. Well worth the time and money to get it done.


Suppressors - AAC SD 7.62 modified mount
I purchased an AAC SD 7.62 about four years ago. This was my first suppressor and I was never happy using it on my bolt rifle because the zero shift wasn’t always consistent. If I had known more then about different suppressors, I would have gone a different route. At any rate, I sent the...

I think they'll also cut out the stack and put a whole new modernized baffle stack in them to make them much quieter and lighter weight. So, if you're sending it in to ECCO to get it HUB converted, I'd also have them go ahead and do "the works" to it, to upgrade everything they possibly can on it. Might as well, since you're pretty much stuck with a can for life thanks to the NFA process. Improve it if you can, and make it more useful.

If your can locks up adequately to make you happy then I would not waste $1000. Although I bet it is only a matter of time…
Mine did not so I upgraded and have all my center fire suppressors with the same attachment system.
I asked ECCO about a recore on mine and he told me most of the weight of the sdn is the body so not worth the money to recore…I am very happy to have my sdn as a usable suppressor! ECCO is AWSOME!!

You can also send it to AAC and have it converted to the new ranger series which is shorter and lighter. I had Ecco convert mine a few years ago but I’ll probably eventually send it to AAC for an overhaul.

Another option would be to send it back to AAC, who is offering to update/upgrade (Restoration Program) older AAC cans with HUB threads and new baffle stacks for a really nice price. It also gives you a whole brand new lifetime warranty with your can through AAC. Might be worth looking into. They chop up the whole body except the part with the S/N, and then put a whole new tubeless baffle stack on it, and make MUCH lighter weight. And they do the HUB threads, too.

I sent my m42k and sdn6 to AAC for the refurb option. New stack and hub mount. It’s been great and now they aren’t just paperweights because I long ago abandoned the 51t mount. Worth it to me

Seriously considering sending them my Cyclone.
What did they charge for the refurb?
What was the turnaround time?

$600 per can( I got a discount). I think they charge $700 usually. Cheaper than buying new. The turn around was less than 3 weeks I believe.

Sounds Expensive to me. Thats not too far from what I paid for my can originally. But, they will likely continue to honor warranty. So, maybe not so bad.

Does anyone have experience with the "new" AAC? It has been a long time since I did any business with them, and I think a lot has changed for the company (a move, a restructure back in Sep 21 timeframe, possibly a change of ownership to JJE Capital), but I dont know if it has been change for the better?

I have no idea what it's called, that was just a generalized term, but just call them and talk to them and see what all they can do.

The best option by-far, would be the AAC Refurb program, because you get everything you want, for the same price as the ECCO conversion, but you get a brand new limited lifetime warranty on your AAC can from the manufacturer. And the guys posting above said turn-around was less than a month, and ECCO is usually months out on a waiting list to get your can done.

I'd call AAC and get on that refurb program had I bought one of those back in the day. I got a buddy who has an SDN-6, but glad I waited to buy until these newer modern cans came out. I mean, yeah, it's $600, and that's close to the cost of a new can, but you don't have to wait for a new Form4, and you no longer have a paperweight sitting in your safe. You can use your can again, and it's better than it ever could have been.

So I think I missed the Feb rotation at ECCO. Now, I will have to wait until May to go this path. The AAC RestoMod path starting to look pretty good.

From everything I've seen and heard, it's exponentially better off than it ever was before, under any previous ownership...Especially the original owner, who is a giant douche.

im not following what you are saying about a February rotation at ECCO?

end of last summer, from the time i mailed them a can to recore, until i received it back was about 32 days.

for $700 spent with AAC, i think i would go ECCO machine. i would assume they would be close to half that cost.

There is a schedule Ecco adheres to that is stated in the details. Or, supposedly adheres to I dont know. They round up a batch and then do a run of conversions. I missed my "window of opportunity" for Feb according to Jerrica (Nick's wife). Oh Well.

The Ecco .vs AAC is a multi-faceted conundrum (Hey, how long's it been since you seen that written?) Yeah, there's the money. Then the schedule. Then the Warranty issue. Then the AAC get's converted to a Ranger tube thing (So, no longer just a HUB interface conversion, its a new stack and its lighter too). I've decided to believe the resident expert, FuhQ, This Is The Way. From New Guy perspective, it would be foolish of me to ask for help, then ignore the advice given.

It's called a "re-core". What you need from ECCO is a mount conversion, and re-core.

He makes all his own baffles, and has many proven stack designs. You would not be disappointed.

I'm so glad to see Nick getting brought up in so many threads here. He more than deserves it.

Fortunately for me, I've got time to make the choice now. Ecco is on hold waiting for their next cycle of batch conversions (I'm not a big customer, and thats OK). AAC is "waiting for parts" before they require me to send it.

I have two great choices, and time to consider the problem (which one).

Money No Object choice is AAC. I get a next gen stack, a larger BC (affects HUB mounting accessories choices and some performance), a lighter can, a removable front cap, and warranty from a reconstructed manufacturer that looks like they will be GTG for it. At a Price.

For less money there is Ecco. Non welded can (steel is OK, Ti maybe not so much), a new stack with good performance, no warranty for stuff that happens sometimes (almost always on me).

Either way, it avoids the F4 waiting line. Good Choices to have!

My AAC 762SDN6 started jumping a tooth while shooting. Had to check it for tight constantly. Groups would got to crap all of a sudden. Baffle strike was just a matter of time. Paperweight.
I went the ECCO hub conversion route. Great folks, good work.
Whichever route you go, HUB is the snitzel. I bought the HUB to Thunder Beast CB adaptor to go with my new muzzle devices.
I also had roughly $1000 in 51t muzzle devices. Bought a suppressor mount AAC hub to 51t adaptor, the STAMP 51t, so now I have a replaceable 51t ratchet in my suppressor.

I like options.

what would you have "redone"? just the mount?

M4-2000 is still my favorite can to shoot FA M16 on. just really great sounding can, unbelievably quiet (all relative) on the full auto. That can holds up really well to newer offerings. the rachet tooth mount "debacle" really hurt AAC and that cans phenomenal performance reputation suffered.

I know there were some guys who machined a taper to fix the mounts but most had moved on. i dont own one but id like to find one local thats old stock, get it at low ball price and convert it by Ecco machine. i would not want a stack replacement, though i have no idea the difference between the m4-2k and the new Ranger 5 stack. id want the original.

Yes; Ecco Machine did both of mine (SD and an SD-N6), and loved them in that configuration Wolfman Ti also in this pic):



…better pic:



Again, Ecco Machine is an awesome company and team to work with; zero regrets going with them. However, I recently had the SD resto-modded to the Ranger 7 configuration by the ‘new’ AAC; very happy with the result. They also re-cored my worn out Ti-Rant 45:



I paid $700 for mine, but worth it to me to get what is essentially a new can, with a new warranty:

It's good to have good choices.

I've changed my mind about the AAC conversion. I'm going to take that "full" conversion money, and put that towards some other, more modern can.

I'll get the 1.375x24 HUB conversion done by AAC (if they will do it), or by ECCO Machine. The SD-N6 is in fine condition, I just need the new interface on it, since I'm moving to HUB.

AAC wasn’t available when I did mine, but even if it was I would prob have followed ^^^^ this path. I moved on to more modern light weight designs. Got the 7.62sdn6 converted to HUB for SBR use mainly. Before conversion it turned into a safe queen. I’m back to shooting it quite a bit. It’s a dump truck for weight but it’s heavy duty! Excellent choice.

Advanced Armament Co S.T.A.M.P. 51T Mount Adapter
The Advanced Armament Co (AAC) S.T.A.M.P. (STAMP) 51T Mount Adapter is compatible with 51T muzzle devices and features 1.375x24 threads (HUB) for use with most current production silencers.
 www.blackanklemunitions.com
If you want to have the option to keep using your 51t muzzle devices.
When I had Ecco convert mine, AAC was out of business and rebuilding the pawl and teeth was not an option. Later AAC came up with the STAMP and I bought one to keep using the old muzzle devices. And it is replaceable/rebuildable on the teeth and parts. A bit pricey @$200 but it’s on sale and in stock, which is not normal. BAM is gtg dealing with.

I thought the whole problem with the 51T mounting system was the poor lockup? The can would wobble / wiggle on the mount? I've added the o-rings on the chance I would need the can SHTF reasons, but it's been a safe queen. I knew about the pawl breaking, mine is OK right now. AAC would not send me a replacement when I asked for one (as a spare part). They said "Nope, its a suppressor part, you cant own this part." I said OK.

So you like this alternative, the 51T adaptor? You dont care it has the same problem as the original interface? Or does it? It will certainly make a heavy can heavier. Prolly pushing 25 oz with the adaptor in place.

The problem was sometimes poor fit hitting between tooth engagement causing wobble and the teeth/pawl breaking or wearing, as you stated.
I can pick and cull through all my 51t muzzle devices for ones that lock up tight. If I didn’t have so many, I wouldn’t have bothered. That being said, STAMP seems to lock up tighter and I am happy having the option. Maybe just new teeth. Since the STAMP is an adaptor, you should be able to get replacement pawl for it, papers state it is replaceable.
It’s just an option in case you get nauseous looking at a pile of scrap metal/GunBroker garage sale destiny muzzle devices.
The HUB locks up great with the Thunder Beast CB /HUB adaptor.

Wish I would have sold all my 51t muzzle devices while aac was out of business. Could have paid for the new Thunder Beast.

I have the same, sdn-6. I have considered both AAC and Ecco vs a new can. Since people are talking about it again, I wonder if any of you that have had the AAC conversion have used it on a precision bolt rig? I realize TBAC or others are the "best" but I am just trying to find a real use for this can. I have a sandman now for all AR platforms so another safe queen for now. Any of you have experience with this? I reached out to AAC and they discouraged it and recommended a different can they sell. But I got the impression they haven't really tried what I am looking for.

AAC 762SDN6 here…
Didn’t know any better when I got it back in the day. Sat as a paperweight because the 51T system was (is) terrible.

Sent it to ECCO last year and had them do up a SF Warden conversion for it at the same time. Couldn’t be happier with their service and turnaround. The can is still heavy as shit, especially with the SF mount, but their workmanship and CS was fantastic. I actually use my can now.

I’m running it on my LMT MRP and MWS but used to run it on my AXSR until I swapped back to the A419 hellfire system for matches. The SF mount locks up very well and has a great RTZ/consistent shift.

With regards to the stack of 51T mounts you’d have left over, sell them on ARFCOM at like $80 each and they’ll go quick.

I didn’t know about the AAC service until months after doing my ECCO mod, so I don’t know if I’d have went ECCO at that point just for the AAC warranty and weight/size reduction factors.

When I buy my next can, it will be a TBAC SR. …but now that the new Vectronix LRF Binos are out and S&B is putting a useful reticle in the 6-36, my money will be tied up for the next 35 years

I can’t speak to the AAC conversion, however I can to the ECCO which I had done to my AAC-7.62 SD. I am using the Area 419 Hellfire system and there is absolutely no zero change from removing and mounting the suppressor. You do need to clean carbon off the mounting surfaces on the adapter and suppressor which is easily done with a rag or steel wool.

I don’t know what it costs today, it was around $300 total, labor and shipping, when I had my converted and also refinished. For the money I think it’s had to beat. It worked so well I had my AAC 556 SD converted also.

I too use Area 419 mounts with universal adapter. They have an adapter for hub mount to switch between the two. Do you feel accuracy is just as good with the suppressor? It's good to hear no zero change and frankly that wouldn't bother me. I just am hoping to maintain the same level of precision. Also, what range have you shot it to?

Yes, the accuracy is as good with the suppressor as without. I am using it on 308, 6.5CM, 6 CM and 6 BR and have shot out to 1200 yards, mostly to 1000. I don’t shoot my bolts rifles without the suppressor any more.

I had Ecco do HUB conversions on my M4-2000 and my SDN6. Well worth the money. They are heavier now, but I actually use them now (keymo devices on everything)

I just recieved my n6 back from AAC. It went from 24oz to 15.8oz. I haven't shot it yet, but should have an idea this weekend.

I did some load development on my Seekins PH2-NRL 6cm so I didn't swap it around. But for 9 charge weights over 4gr of powder it averaged .62". If i throw out the group i pulled one in it averaged .5" for 8 groups. So i don't think the accuracy is going to be an issue. Sound was similar to my omega on my 6.5cm. Not the quietest can, but definitely will be using it again now.

Can AAC do this on a Cyclone, or is this just for the SD cans?

They said no when I asked.

So I was ready to move and reached out to AAC. Sadly they are out of baffles and waiting. So I am on a waiting list... Just my luck lol!

I was on a waiting list until they said someone backed out. So I was able to send mine in sooner. Was super quick turn around. Trying to decide if I should send my m4 2k in as well. Then i could use it for a 6mm hunting can.

I considered sending my SDN-6 back to AAC for the Ranger conversion but the discounted price they initially quoted me jumped once I was ready to get it done. I sent my SDN-6 and old SWR Specwar 762 in to Ecco for the HUB conversion, they are currently on their way back to me as we speak. I had them remove 3/4" of length from the Specwar which should help with the weight. I still have a Mini4 that I am considering having swapped as well. The Specwar will live on my PAP M92 SBR and the SDN-6 will go on the 6 ARC and I'll put the extra I didn't spend with AAC towards another more modern can for whatever's next.

I've sent my SCAR-H to ECCO last year, before I new of AAC's offering and they did a great job. I may send it to AAC to make it lighter and WM proof, but for now I'm using it with Griffin mounts and I'm happy with the conversion.

No denying the tube on the SDN6 has style. I’ll probably do a mount conversion one day but keep the original front end, too.
