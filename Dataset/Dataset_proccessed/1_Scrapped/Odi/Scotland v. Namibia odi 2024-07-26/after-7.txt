Scotland vs Namibia Betting Tips

We are in for an absolute thriller between the two teams. They both are in close contest in the point table and in desperate need of a win. The two teams have met on 7 occasions in ODI format and Scotland has come out as the winners in 6 meetings. 

In the previous meeting as well Scotland came out as the winners. Namibia has strong players but considering the head-to-head stats and latest meeting between the two teams, we predict a win for Scotland on Friday.

Munsey is the leading scorer in the league with 302 runs in 6 matches at an average of 50.33. He also has two fifties on his name.

The betting tip is...

George Munsey will be the top batsman in the match.
