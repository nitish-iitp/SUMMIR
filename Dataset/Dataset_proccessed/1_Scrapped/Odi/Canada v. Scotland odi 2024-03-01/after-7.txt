Grey’s leg spinner, Xander Elkington played in his 100th 1st XI match celebrated with excellent figures of 5/19 in 8 overs.

Grey sportingly continued the game after passing College’s total declaring on 213/8, Marco Giaconi (52) and Josh Rennie (53 not out) were amongst the runs for Grey. College finished on 70/3 at the close play at 6 pm with Grey in search of the five 2nd innings wickets for an outright victory. William Beamish struck it well for College in the 2nd innings with his fluent 49 runs. Well done to Grey on their win and compelling Saturday of cricket.
