One man has explained how he saved almost £300 this winter by using less energy during “peak” times.

Grahame Case, 38, a picture framer and fine art printer from West Lothian, in Scotland, had been looking for ways to cut his electricity bill after his energy costs doubled. He recently came off a cheap long-term fixed tariff, which meant his winter bill went from £153 to £317.

To try and cut costs, Grahame decided to test out the Demand Flexibility Service (DFS) after hearing about it from his energy supplier Octopus. The DFS is run by the National Grid ESO and pays people to use less energy during peak times, typically between 4pm and 7pm.

This could mean avoiding energy-guzzling appliances during these times, such as washing machines and ovens. The ESO pays energy suppliers and third-party providers at least £3 per unit (kilowatt hour) of energy saved, with the idea that this should be passed back to customers.

This means, the amount of money you get paid will depend on how much less electricity you use compared to normal. You can get paid in cash, or as credit added to your account. Grahame told The Mirror he would use gadgets that run off batteries to avoid plugging into his mains electricity. He said: “To provide some context, I've been an electric car owner since 2018, with solar panels and batteries at home, along with an air source heat pump, making me quite reliant on energy, especially during the colder months.

“The biggest saving I’ve made was by participating in the Demand Flexibility Service scheme with my energy supplier. By adjusting my energy usage during these sessions and utilizing home batteries, I earned rewards totalling £292.07 - which almost covered my December to January bill.”

To take part in the scheme, your energy supplier has to first be signed up to the DFS, or run their own version of it. You must also have a smart meter installed. The ESO said eligible households will be invited to take part in a series of up to 12 test events between November 2023 and March 2024. It has not yet revealed if the scheme will return later this year.

Grahame said: "The only downside may be the need to adjust your routine slightly during events, but the financial and environmental benefits outweigh any inconvenience. So far, I've been a small part of my energy supplier’s customers saving 1,730,000 kWh. That's the equivalent of boiling 58,644,068 million cups of tea.

"Participating in DFS schemes can lead to significant savings and contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing the grids reliance on fossil fuels. For anyone a little unsure how it works I’d thoroughly recommend checking out the Smart Energy GB Website which has a lot of helpful resources."
