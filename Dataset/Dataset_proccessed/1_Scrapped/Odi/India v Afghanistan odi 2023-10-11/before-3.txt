Afghanistan hoping to ‘bounce back’ in World Cup clash against India

Afghanistan faces India on Wednesday in the second of their nine group games, and will be hoping to “bounce back” from their loss against Bangladesh last week.

Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott said while he'd "like to see us bounce back” from Friday’s loss, “we know the areas we need to improve. And we’ve got two big games in Delhi now against India and then England,” he said.

"So, we’ve got to dust ourselves off ... (for) a big match against India, which is going to be a great spectacle.

“I know the boys will be really, really up for it,” he said.

Despite a good start against Bangladesh in Dharamsala last Friday, Afghanistan failed to build its innings and was bundled out for 156 runs. From 83-2, it lost eight wickets for just 73 runs in a six-wicket defeat.

But after beating five-time champions Australia in their opening match, India has gained extra confidence for the rest of the group stage matches.

India beat Australia by six wickets on Sunday in a thrilling, low-scoring game at Chennai, with spinners Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav combining for five wickets to bowl out the Aussies for 199. India struggled initially and was three wickets down for two runs within 12 deliveries before Lokesh Rahul and Virat Kohli joined forces to guide the hosts to victory, Associated Press reported.

“It feels very good when you defeat big teams, and your confidence definitely goes up,” Jadeja said. “I won’t say it will be easy in front of the other teams because every team is good. But if you win in front of the big teams, you have a different level of confidence.”

That makes India a hot favorite against No. 9-ranked Afghanistan.

While the Chennai pitch had plenty to offer the spinners, the Delhi wicket is expected to be harder and offer less turn. And the shorter boundaries should prove advantageous for batters. South Africa belted a World Cup record total of 428-5 in the first game there on the weekend and Sri Lanka replied with 326.

Changes, if any, will be minimal for the home team. India still has concerns over the health of opener Shubman Gill, who is struggling with a virus.

Manchester United ace rumored to be heading for Al-Nassr

Manchester United are unlikely to do big business in January and one high earner could be on his way out.

Ruben Amorim wanted an improved start to 2025 after five defeats in six Premier League games to end 2024.

This did not happen entirely as Sunday’s match saw United draw 2-2 with Liverpool.

That performance sparked some hope for United fans but Amorim will still need plenty of signings in 2025 to make real progress.

Amorim isn’t expecting a major January though and certainly needs players to leave in order to make new signings.

United will however also be looking to offload big earners this year and one player who fits the bill is Casemiro.

Casemiro joined United from Real Madrid in 2022 with the Brazilian arriving in a big-money move – both in terms of fee and wages.

Selling Casemiro this month is something football journalist Fabrizio Romano has claimed is on the cards – a move which could save United a whopping £350,000-a-week (about $440,000).

It is also a move which could prove lucrative for United, with Saudi Arabia appearing to be the likeliest move for Casemiro.
It is thought that United would sell Casemiro for around €30m ($52 million), which represents a huge loss on the €70m ($73 million) which was spent on the Brazilian back in 2022.

If United receive £25m, it would pay off a big chunk of one possible replacement.

Afghanistan triumphs in Test victory against Zimbabwe

Rashid Khan played a key role, claiming 7-66 and helping Afghanistan clinch the series

Afghanistan secured victory on Monday against Zimbabwe in their second test match, winning by 72 runs in just 15 balls at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo. 

Rashid Khan played a key role, claiming 7-66 and helping Afghanistan clinch the series. 

This marks Afghanistan's fourth test win since obtaining test status in 2017.

Zimbabwe was all out for 205 without adding to their overnight score, losing the final two wickets in a quick 13 minutes.

Richard Ngarava's run-out in the day's second over, due to confusion with skipper Craig Ervine, set the tone. 

Ervine fell in the next over, trapped leg before wicket by Rashid Khan's decisive leg-spin, culminating in figures of 7-66. 

Khan's performance on Sunday shifted momentum when Zimbabwe was poised for victory at 157-4, chasing 278.

The first test in Bulawayo ended in a draw, but Afghanistan's win secured their fourth test victory, two coming against Zimbabwe, since acquiring test status in 2017.

Three wickets in the last hour of play for Rashid Khan put Afghanistan on the cusp of victory in the second test against Zimbabwe at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo, with the home team still 73 runs shy of their target at the close of day four.

Zimbabwe were 205 for eight at stumps on Sunday, chasing 278 to win the series after the first test ended in a high scoring draw, Reuters reported.

Captain Craig Ervine (53 not out) and Richard Ngarava (3 not out) will resume on Monday after Afghanistan hauled themselves back into the contest when veteran Khan’s leg-break bowling put the brakes on the home team’s march.
