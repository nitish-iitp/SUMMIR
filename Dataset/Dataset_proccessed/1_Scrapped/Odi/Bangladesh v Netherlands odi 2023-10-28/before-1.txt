Quinton de Kock adjudged POTM:

“To be honest, I am a bit more tired than satisfied (after a spectacular knock), I think we all played really well and everyone did their part and it was nice to get those two points on the board. Not just too sure, it is just happening I guess (speaking about his conversion rate in India). I was a little nervous this morning, but it was a great day and I had a bit of fun and it's great to get another 2 points. He (Klaasen) has been truly amazing, I also need some of the juice that he is having. He has just been special, not just for us but for everyone around the world. He is really taking it by storm and I am very happy for him,” de Kock said.

Winning skipper Aiden Markram said:

“Was another good day. Tough to grind it out towards the end, but all in all it was a great day. Not necessarily (death bowling a problem?). Guys have worked quite hard at the death. Especially against Mahmudullah who played fantastically, we thought it was an opportunity to execute our death bowling plans. What Quinny did tonight was obviously superb. And then to have a guy like Klaasen who walks in and smashes it. It's quite different how each person in the top 6 plays. It's something you can't take for granted and we won't do that. Temba improved quite a lot coming into this game, just wasn't 100 percent. Hopefully he can be ready for Pakistan,” Markram said.

Losing skipper Shakib Al Hasan said:

“We bowled first 25 overs well. We got three wickets, they were going at about 5 an over. From there they kicked on. Quinton batted really well, and the way Klaasen finished was something we didn't have any answer to. On a ground like this it can happen but we should've bowled better. Lost the game in the last 10 overs. Has been lot of talking about whether Mushfiq and Mahmudullah should bat higher. But the role they have, they're doing very well. Our top four batters need to do well. Long way to go in this tournament, anything can happen. Lot to be learnt, and lot to play for. Will love to finish 5-6 if not in the semis. We're not playing like a team that can do it, but hope to finish stronger,” Shakib said.

Match 23 of the ODI World Cup 2023 is set to be played at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, as South Africa will lock horns with Bangladesh. With South Africa's recent rollercoaster performance in the tournament and Bangladesh's quest for redemption, this match promises to be a thriller.

The Proteas entered the tournament with mixed results, winning matches against Sri Lanka and Australia but stumbling against the Netherlands. However, they bounced back emphatically with a commanding 229-run victory over England, displaying their true potential. The absence of captain Temba Bavuma in their previous clash didn't deter them, with Aiden Markram leading the team effectively.

On the other side, Bangladesh have been on a rough journey, facing defeats against England, New Zealand, and India after a promising start with a win over Afghanistan. They've encountered a loss by 137 runs, 8 wickets, and 7 wickets in their last three games, necessitating a massive shift in momentum to challenge South Africa.

In the South African camp, key players to watch include the explosive Heinrich Klaasen, who smashed a breathtaking 109 runs against England. Aiden Markram, the stand-in skipper, has been in scintillating form, and Marco Jansen, the young all-rounder, is riding high on confidence after a stellar performance in the last match. Kagiso Rabada, the pace spearhead, adds depth to their formidable lineup.

For Bangladesh, Litton Das and Najmul Hossain Shanto will play crucial roles in setting up a challenging total. Shakib Al Hasan's experience and match-winning ability, even at less than 100% fitness, can't be underestimated. Shoriful Islam, the left-arm quick bowler, promises to bring life to the contest with his movement off the pitch and through the air.

The renowned batting-friendly pitches at the Wankhede Stadium are expected to provide an exciting contest, with opportunities for both batters and bowlers as the game progresses.
