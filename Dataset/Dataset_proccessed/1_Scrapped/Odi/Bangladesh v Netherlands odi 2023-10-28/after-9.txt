After winning the toss, Edwards opted to bat first in Kolkata. The Dutch got off to a horrendous start, losing both openers Max O’Dowd and Vikramjit Singh in the first three overs. Reeling at 4 for 2, Wesley Barresi and Colin Akermann stitched an important 59-run stand to settle Netherlands’ innings.

Barresi went on to score 41 runs off as many balls before being dismissed by Mustafizur Rahim. Shakib Al Hasan piled on further misery, getting rid of Ackermann in the very next over. Bas de Leede and Edwards formed a 44-run partnership before Taskin Ahmed struck to claim his second wicket of the day.

However, Edwards kept going and completed his 15th ODI half-century while adding 78 runs with Sybrand Engelbrecht. Edwards was eventually dismissed by Mustafiqur after scoring 68 runs off 89 deliveries, smashing six boundaries in Kolkata. Engelbrecht followed his captain back to the pavilion in the very next over as the Dutch lost their seventh wicket.

Logan van Beek remained unbeaten on 23 runs off 16 balls but wickets kept tumbling around him as Bangladesh bowled Netherlands out for 229 runs. Shoriful Islam, Mahedi Hasan, Taskin and Mustafizur all picked two wickets each.

Aryan Dutt provided Netherlands with the perfect start, getting rid of the dangerous Litton Das in the fifth over. Tanzid Hasan and Najmul Shanto couldn’t move the scoreboard much and departed to leave the Bangla Tigers reeling at 45 for 3.

After adding 18 runs on the scoreboard, Bangladesh lost the wickets of Shakib Al Hasan, Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Mustafizur Rahim in quick succession. The triple blow meant Bangladesh had lost six wickets with just 70 runs to show for it.

Mahedi Hasan and Mahmudullah stitched a gritty 38-run stand which was eventually broken by a brilliant direct throw by De Leede to send Mahedy back to the pavilion. Bangladesh’s final hope of getting a result, Mahmudullah, was the next to fall after scoring 20 runs off 41 deliveries.

Mustafizur and Taskin put in a brave effort, scoring 20 and 11 respectively but couldn’t guide their side over the line. Netherlands eventually bundled Bangladesh over for 142 runs in 42.2 overs, winning the match by 87 runs.

Following this win, Netherlands will take on Afghanistan at the Ekana Stadium in Lucknow on November 3.
