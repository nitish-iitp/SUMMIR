Pakistan vs South Africa Live Score, World Cup 2023

Pakistan vs South Africa highlights, Cricket World Cup 2023: South Africa survived a late comeback attempt from Pakistan to secure a thrilling one-wicket victory in Chennai, moving to the top of the table. Aiden Markram was the star of the night, scoring 91 runs, but his dismissal opened the door for Pakistan to mount a comeback. Markram was dismissed in the 41st over with South Africa still needing 21 runs to win and three wickets remaining. Over the next six overs, Shaheen Afridi and Haris Rauf, along with Mohammad Wasim Jr., maintained pressure on South Africa's tailenders, with the former two taking a wicket each. However, with Wasim Jr. bowling his final over in the 47th over and Shaheen and Haris already finishing their spells, Keshav Maharaj had a chance to go for big shots and sealed the game with a four against Mohammad Nawaz in the 48th over....Read More

Pakistan vs South Africa Live Score, World Cup 2023: Soft dismissal! Bavuma falls, Mohammad Wasim picks his first

67/2 in 10 overs; target 271

Pakistan vs South Africa Live Score, World Cup 2023: Temba Bavuma goes big against Shaheen Afridi! The delivery was wide outside the off-stump, and Bavuma elegantly lifted it over the cover fielders. The ball bounces a few times before crossing the boundary rope.

Pakistan vs South Africa Live Score, World Cup 2023: WICKET!

BIG WICKET! Shaheen Afridi gets Quinton de Kock. It was a poor delivery, though; feeds a short delivery for the SA batter and this could've easily been a six. Instead, there isn't enough power in the shot to clear the fence and the in-form SA batter is caught at deep square

SA 34/1 in 3.3 overs; target 271

Oct 27, 2023 6:34 PM IST
Pakistan vs South Africa Live Score, World Cup 2023: Iftikhar continues

Pakistan vs South Africa Live Score, World Cup 2023: Bavuma, as usual, lets de Kock play the aggressor and rotates the strike. Two singles followed by a double from SA captain

Pakistan vs South Africa Live Score, World Cup 2023: Edge and… survives!

Pakistan vs South Africa Live Score, World Cup 2023: This one was a little tough to hold on to. You could see what Shaheen is trying to do. He's trying to get the angle away from the left handed de Kock but on this occasion, the ball flies a little too high over Iftikhar. A full-stretched jump doesn't help the fielder reach the ball. FOUR.

Update: TWO FOURS MORE! This is harsh on Shaheen. A cover drive followed by a flick of the wrist as he targets the midwicket area. Brilliant from de Kock

SA 30/0 in 2 overs; target 271
