Pakistan will square off against South Africa at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on October 27, Friday, with the Babar Azam-led side seeking a crucial win after three straight losses. All eyes will be on the weather situation in the Tamil Nadu capital as Pakistan requires a victory by all means, and they will be hoping that the climate remains  kind and ensure that a victory remains equally within the reach of both teams.



Chennai Weather Update - October 27, 2023 

The atmosphere will be mostly cloudy with the temperature ranging around 32°C with east-northeast winds blowing at 15 km/hr. The wind gusts will be at 28 km/hr. There will be significant humidity at 71% in the afternoon with the dew point being at 26°C.

Cloud cover will be fairly high, at 81%, with the probability of precipitation being at 9% during the time of the start of the game.

The weather will clear up as the game progresses into the second innings. Temperature will slightly cool down to 29°C but humidity will remain constantly at 80%. The wind will blow in the same direction as in the morning, at 22 km/hr by this time. Cloud cover will come down sharply to 20% whereas dew point will be the same at 25°C.

By the looks of it, rain shouldn't be a point of concern in Chennai for this game. However, high humidity will take a toll on the players and put their fitness levels to test.

Predicted Playing XI

Pakistan: Imam-Ul-Haq, Abdullah Shafique, Babar Azam (c), Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Saud Shakeel, Iftikhar Ahmed, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Nawaz, Shaheen Afridi, Hasan Ali,  Haris Rauf

South Africa: Quinton de Kock (wk), Reeza Hendricks, Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Gerald Coetzee, Kagiso Rabada, Lizaad Williams
