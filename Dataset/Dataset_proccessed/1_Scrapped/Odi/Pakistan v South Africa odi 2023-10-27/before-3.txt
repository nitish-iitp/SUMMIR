SA vs PAK, World Cup 2023 Match 26: Team news

South Africa and Pakistan have a relatively even World Cup record with South Africa having won three out of five games and Pakistan having won two. Both teams, however, are heading into this game with contrasting form.

South Africa have won four games out of five in this World Cup, each with margins greater than a hundred runs, while Pakistan have managed only two victories out of five and things are not looking great in their camp. There have been reports of infighting, which the PCB is working overtime to quash, and their on-field display has been abysmal, particularly with the ball and in the field.

Temba Bavuma is expected to return after a stomach bug kept him out of the two South Africa games in Mumbai.

Tabrazi Shamsi might also get a look in given the spin-friendly nature of the Chennai surface. For Pakistan, Hasan Ali might not be available as he is down with illness, meaning they can think about playing the spin-trio of Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan, and Usama Mir together for the first time in this tournament.

South Africa vs Pakistan predicted XIs

South Africa: Temba Bavuma (c), Quinton de Kock (wk), Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Marco Jansen, Kagiso Rabada, Keshav Maharaj, Gerald Coetzee, Lungi Ngidi.

Pakistan: Abdullah Shafique, Imam-ul-Haq, Babar Azam (c), Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Saud Shakeel, Iftikhar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan, Usama Mir, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf.

Match prediction: Who will win today’s SA vs PAK match?

South Africa have been on a roll in this World Cup, but this will be a different challenge for them on the spinning surface of Chennai.

Luckily for them, Pakistan’s spinners have not looked threatening at all, which will keep South Africa at a clear advantage heading into the game.
