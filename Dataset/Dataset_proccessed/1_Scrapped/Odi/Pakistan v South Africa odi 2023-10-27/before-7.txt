As the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 enters its decisive stage, Pakistan is bracing itself for a crucial face-off against South Africa after a series of tough losses, including a heart-wrenching defeat to Afghanistan.

The Green Shirts are expected to make a strategic change in their playing XI for the upcoming clash, scheduled to take place at Chidambaram Stadium on October 27, 2023, at 1:30 PM Pakistan Standard Time.

Predicted Playing XI adjustment

Pakistan is anticipated to introduce a pivotal alteration to its lineup. All-rounder Mohammad Nawaz is set to make his return, potentially replacing Usama Mir, who struggled to make a significant impact with his bowling in the previous encounters against Australia and Afghanistan.

Pakistan's expected playing XI:

Abdullah Shafique
Imam-ul-Haq
Babar Azam (c)
Mohammad Rizwan (wk)
Saud Shakeel
Iftikhar Ahmed
Shadab Khan
Mohammad Nawaz
M. Wasim Jr.
Shaheen Afridi
Haris Rauf

Nawaz's comeback is expected to bolster Pakistan's bowling attack, especially in the spin department, as he possesses valuable experience on Indian pitches. Alongside Iftikhar and Shadab Khan, he is anticipated to infuse vitality into Pakistan's spin bowling.

In the fast bowling department, Pakistan has been striving to contain runs, apart from the consistent Shaheen Afridi. However, the likes of Mohammad Wasim Jr. and Haris Rauf are poised to challenge the South African batters with their pace.

Match Timings

The Pakistan vs. South Africa Cricket World Cup match is scheduled to kick off at 1:30 PM Pakistan Standard Time at the Chidambaram Stadium on October 27, 2023.

Stay tuned for what promises to be an electrifying showdown as Pakistan seeks redemption, and South Africa aims to maintain its impressive form in this year's ICC Cricket World
