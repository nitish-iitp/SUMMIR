History

The first recorded match held on the ground came in 1998 when Bangladesh played Singapore in the 1998 ACC Trophy.

Nepal took part in the inaugural Intercontinental Cup with the matches in the competition having first-class status. The ground held its first first-class match when Nepal hosted Malaysia. Another two first-class matches were held there during the 2005 Intercontinental Cup when Nepal hosted Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates.

These were the first first-class matches to be held anywhere in Nepal. The ground has since hosted a number of international competitions, including the 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Five and 2015-17 ICC World Cricket League Championship.

Controversy arose during the competition in a match between Nepal and the United States with crowd trouble flaring up when a large number of spectators disturbed play when they became unhappy with the performance of the Nepal team.

The match was later investigated by the International Cricket Council for the crowd trouble and the resulting calculations of the net-run rate which denied Singapore promotion to 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Four.

The ground has also successfully hosted domestic tournaments such as Everest Premier League, Prime Minister One Day Cup and so on with a lot of people coming to watch the matches and enjoying domestic cricket.

Renovations

After the devastating 2015 Nepal Earthquake, the basic infrastructures of the ground were destroyed. Thus, the CAN rebuilt its infrastructures and added more facilities such as the addition of ground walls, a pavilion building, media box, view tower and VIP Seating Area.
