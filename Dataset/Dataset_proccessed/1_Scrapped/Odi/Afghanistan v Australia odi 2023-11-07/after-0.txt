That's all from us after the most incredible match of this World Cup so far - and one of the most astonishing innings you'll ever see from Glenn Maxwell!

You can read Callum Matthews' report on Australia's staggering win here.

Pat Cummins' side move into the semi-finals, while Afghanistan's hopes of making the top four have taken a big hit.

Not only were Australia down and out at 91-7, Glenn Maxwell himself looked to be down and out himself at one stage.

Somehow he kept himself going and got Australia over the line...

'Just unreal'

More from Pat Cummins: "We had two New South Welshman ready to go, I think Adam Zampa was up two or three times but Glenn wanted to stay out there... just unreal.

"It's important. Not only from our team, thinking you can win from anywhere, but opposition look at that as well. It gives us real belief and we're into the semi-finals now so that's great.

"Of course you can do things differently and both teams played well but Maxi dragged us out of that one."

'Out of this world'

Australia captain Pat Cummins: "Just ridiculous. I don't know how you describe that.

"A great win but Maxi was just out of this world. It's got to be the greatest ODI innings that has ever happened.

"It's one of those days where you can just think, 'yep, when that happened I was there in the stadium' and feel very lucky.

"I couldn't get on strike! I just let Maxi do his thing, how am I going to say anything to someone batting like that?

"He was great, he was calm. Whenever you're chasing, he's got a plan and even 200 out, he's mapping out a way to win the game. Really special."

It's hard to think of anything that beats that and physically, what Maxwell was up against for those last 60 runs or so. Maybe Viv Richards' 189 when no one made a run around him.

'Dropped catch was the key point'

Afghanistan captain Hasmatullah Shahidi: "Really disappointed. Cricket is a funny game, it was unbelievable."

How did you feel your bowled?: "We were in the game. Our bowlers started really well, we dropped chances for the eighth wicket. Maxwell doesn't stop, I have to give credit to him."

Was the dropped catch the turning point?: "That catch was the key point. He played really well. Maxwell played all the shots, he didn't give any chances out there. I have to give credit to him."

What did you feel about the team's performance?: "I am proud of the team, the team will be disappointed tonight because after that, we didn't think that could happen. We will try our best to come out stronger against South Africa."

Ibrahim Zadran scoring the first century ever in a World Cup for Afghanistan?: "He must be proud of himself and I also feel proud that he is the first Afghan to do so. I wish him the best for the future."

I'm sure when Australia were 200 away, Glenn Maxwell was not thinking it was doable. Once it became a possibility, they had the belief and Maxwell was able to have the belief to do it.

Speaking on TV out here, Aaron Finch has just described that as the most amazing thing he’s ever seen.

I watched that with Aggers and co, plus two Netherlands’ fans, in the hotel bar in Pune.

Extraordinary.

'I've lived a charmed life out there'

17:00 GMT 7 November 2023

Australia all-rounder and Player of the Match Glenn Maxwell: "Horrific, I feel shocking. It was quite hot when we were fielding, I haven't done a whole lot of high intensity exercise in the heat. It got a hold of me today, I was lucky to stick it out until the end."

Plans when you were 91-7?: "Not too much, basically to stick to our own batting plans for as long as we could. For me, it was to stick to being positive, create bad balls. The lbw going over the top was the kickstart I needed."

How much did the pitch change throughout the night?: "I think we saw a little bit more swing and nip round under lights, they bowled brilliantly up front. What we struggled to do is taking early wickets up front."

Is that your greatest ever 100?: "It would've been nice if it was chanceless, I've lived a very charmed life out there. To make the most of it, be not out with Patty out there at the end I'm proud of."

Into the semi-finals?: "Everyone wrote us off after two losses, we've won six in a row now and I hope that belief passes around our changing rooms."

'Maxwell is a genius'

Former England captain on BBC Test Match Special

This tournament hasn't had enough close games, it's had many memorable individual innings, but that surpasses any of it.

Maxwell has all the skill and all the control. Afghanistan bowled the pacers probably too late. If Mujeeb takes that catch, we would've been at our hotels an hour and a half ago.

Glenn Maxwell is a genius. No idea what tablets they were giving him, but I want some.

It's a repertoire of keeping calm. He hit shots into all areas of the ground. What an innings. Australia have won six in six now, they had no right to win that game. In this World Cup, he's had a 40-ball 100 and now this.

Australia were 91-7.

Glenn Maxwell was walking back midway through a review that would have seen him dismissed early.

He had to turn back, Afghanistan dropped him twice and never has a player made the opposition pay more emphatically that Maxwell just did.

People have scoffed at the Big Show nickname in the past. Not today.

Maxwell, who could not walk and was stood in concrete, middled more balls than he missed.

Stunning! I cannot believe what I've just seen!

Massive six to win it by Glenn Maxwell to take him to 200! Has there ever been a better ODI innings!?

A double hundred for Maxwell, a staggering win for Australia.

They're into the semi-finals after one of the finest displays of batting - by a man barely able to walk! - you will ever, ever see.

Take a bow, Glenn Maxwell.

Australia are almost there. Glenn Maxwell is just a six-hitting machine at the moment.

This one off Mujeeb Ur Rahman goes miles over wide long on.

Australia need 15 from 22 balls to win.
