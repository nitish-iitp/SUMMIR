'Ye Keshav Maharaj stud hai' - Ayushmann Khurrana lauds Maharaj's batting with interesting tweet

Bollywood actor Ayushmann Khurrana had quite unique information to share with the world about South Africa's player Keshav Maharaj. Khurrana through a tweet paid emphasis on Maharaj's ancestry which lies in Sultanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India. Maharaj hit the winning runs during nail-biting Pakistan vs South Africa ODI World Cup encounter on Friday.

Babar Azam furious with Mohammad Nawaz for gifting winning runs

An animated Babar Azam could be seen agitated at Mohammad Nawaz for gifting away an easy boundary to Keshav Maharaj in the dying embers of the game. Nawaz bowled a flat delivery on the stumps which was very easily whipped to the backward square for a four. 

As soon as the shot was played, Babar could be seen gesturing at Nawaz, full of anger.

TABRAIZ SHAMSI ADJUDGED POTM:

"Really happy. I knew I had to do a job there, but the guys before me set it up. Credit goes to those guys too. I’ve played enough cricket to know sometimes it goes for you, sometimes it doesn’t. I didn’t expect to be here with my pads on doing this interview. (On the last over) If I tried to play a big shot and if it didn’t come off, the boys wouldn’t welcome me back to the change room. So there was no doubt in my mind that I had to just defend and get Kesh on strike. These are the kind of moments you dream of, to be in the middle at the end and win your team a game. Kesh was unbelievable out there," Shamsi said.

Thank you for joining us tonight. See you in the double header tomorrow. Goodnight!

Winning skipper Temba Bavuma said:

It is chaos at the moment. The guys are enjoying the moment. The guys are picking up Shamsi. Chaos at the moment. Nail-biting finish, if you are a South African fan, you will be happy. Pressure with us chasing, we haven't done well to rectify that. It will be easier to have those conversations especially after the win. You need to have the guys in the best situations and truly speak out as to what they were thinking. Hard to say now but those conversations will happen. It is something we have spoken and something which has been thrown about. We have a blueprint when we bat first, we can't say with conviction we have that when we are cashing. We want to be a lot more clinical with the bat. That's nice to hear. KG (Rabada) is good, it was more precautionary, he is experiencing lower back issues and a couple of days rest before New Zealand and he will be in contention. Ecstatic for Shamsi, started with the ball, came in when conditions were helpful and then with the bat. We have seen Shamsi gloating on social media about his batting. It won't stop for the next two weeks but it's nice for a senior guy like Shamsi to come out with the bat like that.

Losing skipper Babar Azam said:

"We are very close, we did not finish well. Very disappointing for the whole team. We fought back very well. In the batting we were 10-15 short. The fast bowlers and spinners fought well but unfortunately it was not to be. It is part of the game, in DRS it is part of the game. Had he given it out, it would have favored us. We have an opportunity to win this and stay in the race but not to be. We will try our best in the next 3 matches and put our efforts and play for Pakistan. Let's see where we will stand after that," Babar said.

Pakistan will take on South Africa in the 26th match of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023, at MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, on October 27. In the upcoming clash against South Africa, the Men In Green find themselves in the position of underdogs, having garnered a mere four points from their last five matches in the tournament. Their recent form is cause for concern, with three losses in their most recent outings. Consequently, the team management is fervently anticipating a resurgent performance from their players when they step onto the field this Friday.

Pakistan's batting lineup heavily depends on the explosive prowess of Mohammad Rizwan, who stands as the team's top run-scorer in the tournament, amassing an impressive 302 runs at a stellar average of 75.50, complemented by a strike rate of 95.87. This remarkable tally comprises a century and a half-century. In the realm of bowling, the left-arm pace maestro, Shaheen Afridi, leads the wicket-takers' chart, claiming 10 scalps at an admirable average of 25.10.

Aiden Markram's optimism rides high on South Africa's quest to sustain their victorious run. Their latest performance, a resounding 149-run triumph against Bangladesh in Mumbai, signifies their dominant form. Having secured convincing victories against both England and Bangladesh, South Africa currently holds the second position in the standings, amassing eight points from five matches in the competition.

South Africa gradually ticking all boxes at World Cup 2023

The management eagerly anticipates the players' pivotal contributions, both with the bat and the ball, in South Africa's bid to secure a coveted playoff spot in the tournament. The Proteas boast a formidable bowling contingent in this year's World Cup, led by the fiery pacer Kagiso Rabada, who leads the wickets tally with an exceptional 10 scalps at a remarkable average of 21.90. Emerging talent Marco Jansen offers robust support, tallying 10 wickets at a commendable average of 24.70 and a respectable economy rate of 6.50.

South Africa places substantial reliance on the skills of Quinton de Kock, Rassie Van Der Dussen, Aiden Markram, David Miller, and Heinrich Klaasen to amass significant runs. Presently, Quinton de Kock stands as the leading run-scorer for the team, boasting an impressive total of 407 runs at a stellar average of 81.40, adorned with three centuries. Meanwhile, Heinrich Klaasen has contributed 288 runs at an astonishing average of 57.60, complemented by a remarkable strike rate of 150.78.
