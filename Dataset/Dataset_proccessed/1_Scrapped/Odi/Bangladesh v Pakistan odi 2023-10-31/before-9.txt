As we approach the midpoint of the World Cup, Pakistan and South Africa find themselves on a collision course, each driven by unique aspirations and emotions. For Pakistan, it's a battle for survival in the tournament, while South Africa seeks to conquer their longstanding demons and notch their first win against Pakistan in over 24 years.

Historically, South Africa has often appeared strong in the early stages of such tournaments, while Pakistan tends to struggle until they're in a must-win situation, where they suddenly find their form.

South Africa will aim for clinical efficiency, lending them an edge they've sometimes lacked. While their batting remains effective, they face occasional challenges in bowling while dismissing the lower order, making it an area for improvement.

In contrast, Pakistan's campaign has faltered with three consecutive losses, including an upset defeat to Afghanistan. Their once-lethal pace attack has appeared toothless, and fielding has been below par.

With every game turning into a knockout, Pakistan's hopes are dimming. The PCB has issued a statement, urging fans to support the team and pointing fingers at the captain and chief selector for the team's performance. The team will have a lot to prove at Chepauk when they face the rivals they have found easy to beat in recent years.

 

PAK vs SA Match 26 Weather Report, ODI World Cup 2023:

 

Anticipate a day characterised by humidity reaching up to 76%, featuring a mix of clouds and sunshine. The mercury is set to soar to 31°C around midday but will gradually drop to 26°C later in the day. There's a slight 24% chance of rain in the forecast.

 

PAK vs SA Match 26 Pitch Report, ODI World Cup 2023:

 

The pitch for this match will be the same one that hosted the Bangladesh-New Zealand game two weeks ago. It is expected to be a slightly quicker surface than the typical one in Chennai.
The pitch is anticipated to offer a balanced contest between bat and ball. Historically, the average first innings score in ODIs at this venue is around 249 runs.

 

PAK vs SA Head To Head:

 

South Africa has a strong historical track record against Pakistan in ODIs, claiming victory in 50 out of their 82 encounters, with Pakistan tasting success on 31 occasions.
