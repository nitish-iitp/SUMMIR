Pakistan vs Bangladesh live score, world cup 2023: Follow the live scores and updates from the Pakistan vs Bangladesh Cricket World Cup 2023 match to be played at the Eden Gardens, Kolkata. The express pace battery, led by Shaheen Shah Afridi, helped Pakistan bundle out Bangladesh for a below par 204 in the World Cup today. The 23-year-old rattled the Bangladeshi top order and became the fastest Pakistani to reach 100 ODI wickets before ending with figures of 9-123-3. The intent was clear from the Bangladesh perspective as they promoted Mahmudullah to No 5. After Shaheen was taken off the attack, Pakistan also failed to build pressure from both ends, giving Litton and Mahmudullah enough opportunity to make a quick recovery. The likes of Wasim Jr and Mir, who impressed with their tidy show against South Africa, gave a lot of freebies and the Bangladeshi duo was happy to pierce the gaps.

Babar Azam, Pakistan captain

All credit to the boys the way we played in all three departments. We know, if Fakhar Zaman bats for 20-30 overs, it’s a different ball game, he played his natural game. Good to see him. We are trying to win the next two matches, we’ll see where we stand. We started well, the way Shaheen started. After 15-20 overs, they built a partnership, our main bowlers picked wickets. We picked wickets in the middle overs. Thank you fans so much for the support.

Shakib Al Hasan, Bangladesh captain

We did not enough have runs, The wicket was really good, we lost early wickets again. There were some partnerships, but not big partnerships. Disappointing with the bat. Credit should go to Pakistan, the way they bowled and the way they batted in the first 10 overs. (On his batting position) We’ll have to think about that. We are not getting many runs from the top four batsmen. I was batting in the top four, I wasn’t scoring. My confidence was low too. Luckily I got some runs, felling better now. At this moment, changing too many things gets difficult. We have to keep moving forward. We have to perform together. We need collective performance, which is not happening. Two more matches, hopefully we can bounce back. Everywhere we go, they (fans) keep supporting us. We have to give something back to them so they can smile.

Fakhar Zaman in the Player of the Match for his fifty on comeback

After the Asia Cup, I practiced a lot on my batting, I was looking good at the camp and was looking forward to making it to the team. Today, my hard work paid off after I was given a chance. I told Abdullah that I will see off the first few overs, I knew I could hit big sixes. My role is to make it easy for my partner, so it was important to see off the first few overs and then play my shots. NRR was in our mind after we reached 100, the aim was to finish it off in 30 overs. I had too many failures, I was looking towards such a knock and hopefully I’ll make bigger scores in the next few games.

PAK vs BAN LIVE score World Cup 2023:

 

Bangladesh will feel they have let themselves down in a big way. Coming into the tournament, they had some notable wins in bilateral series but have now gone on to lose six games on the trot after winning their opening game and are out of the competition. The batting never really clicked and the bowlers were put under pressure right from the start. Taskin Ahmed bowled well up top but Shoriful Islam was hit away for boundaries and soon Taskin too started to leak runs. Mehidy Hasan was the only bowler who created wicket-taking opportunities and picked up all three wickets, joining the 100-wicket ODI club as well. Shakib Al Hasan was economical but didn’t have much impact on play and neither did Mustafizur Rahman and in the end, Bangladesh were a distant second in this clash.
