Pakistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, PAK vs BAN World Cup 2023: What Shakib Al Hasan said

He said that the wicket looks dry. In the last game that they played here it "was slow and there was turn". Shakib says that Bangladesh have nothing to lose and they have to do well in the first 10 overs and build from there. "We haven’t been consistent enough, we have been doing bits and pieces but haven’t performed collectively and that has been disappointing. There isn’t much difference between in here and Dhaka in terms of culture so hopefully we will have some good support," he said.

Pakistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, PAK vs BAN World Cup 2023: Babar Azam's thoughts

Pakistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, PAK vs BAN World Cup 2023: Babar admits that he would have chosen to bat first as well. There could be some swing later in it early because of moisture on the pitch. He said that Pakistan did well in the last match, a thriller that they lost to South Africa. "I am also waiting for a big innings, I will try to convert into a hundred. Three changes, Imam, Shadab and Nawaz out. Fakhar, Salman and Usama in," he said.

Pakistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, PAK vs BAN World Cup 2023: Shadab Khan

Pakistan vs Bangladesh Live Score, PAK vs BAN World Cup 2023: The spinner all rounder has been a shadow of the player he had been in all the major tournaments Pakistan played in last year. He had been replaced by a concussion substitute in Pakistan's last match at the start of South Africa's chase. If he continues to face problems, Usama Mir could be brought into the squad.
