Will Virat Kohli break Sachin Tendulkar's record at the World Cup?

Kohli's first opportunity to surpass Tendulkar's haul of hundreds comes against the Netherlands in Bengaluru on Sunday, where all eyes will be on the former skipper to see if he can claim outright ownership of the record.

If Kohli fails to break the record against the Netherlands, then he will have at least one more opportunity to do so at the Cricket World Cup with India locked in for a semi-final contest against the fourth-placed team next week.

Virat Kohli hit his 49th ODI century against South Africa on 5 November.

Should India win that cut-throat clash they will book a spot in the World Cup final and Kohli could claim the record on the biggest stage of all at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad in a decider against South Africa or Australia.

Four of Kohli's 49 ODI centuries to date have come at Cricket World Cups, while two have been notched at this tournament after the 35-year-old reached triple figures against South Africa and Bangladesh.

We take a look back at the quartet of World Cup hundreds that Kohli has managed thus far and eagerly await to see whether the India batter can bring up a fifth and break Tendulkar's momentous record over the coming matches.

2011 v Bangladesh, Mirpur (100* from 83 deliveries)

Kohli's first century at a Cricket World Cup came on unfamiliar territory as the then 22-year-old combined with opener Virendar Sehwag to put Bangladesh to the sword.

Kohli came to the crease with India in control at 152/2 in the 24th over and Sehwag seeing them very well, and the pair combined for a 203-run partnership that catapulted the side to a massive total of 370/4.

While Sehwag was the main aggressor of the partnership as he amassed a brilliant 175 from 140 balls, Kohli played an equally important hand as he smashed eight fours and two massive sixes in a superb individual innings.

2015 v Pakistan, Adelaide (107 from 126 deliveries)

Tremendous Knock by Virat Kohli – IND vs PAK

Four years later and Kohli was at it again as he reached three figures for the second time at a World Cup and the second time against India’s arch-rival Pakistan.

It was once again a controlled knock, as Kohli hit eight boundaries and got good support from Suresh Raina (74) and Shikhar Dhawan (73) to help propel India to a winning score of 300/7 after skipper MS Dhoni won the toss and elected to bat first.

There was no Sehwag around this time to deny Kohli the Player of the Match award as the India No.3 gleefully accepted the honour after yet another brilliant innings.

2023 v Bangladesh, Pune (103* from 97 deliveries)

Player of the Match highlights as Virat Kohli steered India to victory with a century against Bangladesh at the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023

Kohli had already given hints of what lay ahead at this World Cup with half-centuries against Australia and Afghanistan early in the tournament, and the ultra-consistent right-hander brought up ODI century No.48 with a sensational innings against Bangladesh in Pune.

It was Kohli's first World Cup century in a run chase and it was crafted superbly to ensure he brought up his milestone and the victory for his side with one massive strike over deep mid-wicket and into the stands.

Kohli finished his knock unbeaten with six fours and four huge sixes - the equal fifth most sixes he has hit in any ODI innings - as India remained undefeated at the World Cup and well on their way to the knockout stages.

2023 v South Africa, Kolkata (101* from 125 deliveries)

Highlights of the Virat Kohli hundred, an innings during which he equalled Sachin Tendulkar's record for most ODI centuries.

Kohli's most recent ODI century came on his 35th birthday as he rose to the occasion once again to show no weakness against South Africa's powerful bowling line-up.

The Proteas tried six different bowlers against Kohli and they all came up empty as the India stalwart put on another show at the famous Eden Gardens ground to draw level with Tendulkar and help his side amass a massive total of 326/5.

Kohli got great support from Shreyas Iyer (77) through the middle overs and always seemed in control as India registered yet another win to ensure they finished the group stage on top of the standings.
