OPINION

Trump went to war with America and lost – he can be beaten

Kamala Harris will not let America forget the sickening Capitol riots

The battle for the presidency began with Donald Trump being called “weird” and is closing with the F-word, fascism. Trump hates being laughed at and would rather be hated, so he won’t be losing sleep over this. The vast majority of Republicans won’t care either. They don’t think he behaved like Hitler when he was president, remember the economy was good before the pandemic and enjoyed being entertained by an outrageous character.

The far right loves the meme about the cartoon character Pepe the Frog. They adopted it as a goofy symbol with a dark undertone about lulling people – boiling them, like a frog – into accepting the unacceptable. It seems astonishing that General John Kelly, a four-star marine general and “gold star” father (meaning his son died in combat in Afghanistan) can call Trump a fascist on the eve of the election and Americans shrug.

The word is used so liberally now that it has lost a lot of impact. But Kelly served as Trump’s chief of staff in the White House. He was at his side in the Oval Office for two years. If Kelly says Trump “falls into the general definition of fascism, for sure”, you would think it matters. General Mark Milley, former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, has also called Trump “fascist to the core”.

These top brass would be more effective if they broadcast their warnings on TV, instead of addressing liberal journalists whom Trump regards as the “enemy within”.

As good soldiers, it would appear they feel compelled to do their duty, but only to the extent that they can say to the American people later, “Well, we did warn you.” This is not exactly a five-alarm fire bell.

Cocking a snook at Kelly, Trump hit back at him in a Truth Social post as “a total degenerate” who was “tough and dumb” and “became JELLO over time”. Haha. Are you not entertained? With the polls showing a dead heat between Kamala Harris and Trump, this election has become all about You Know Who. Trump is sucking up all the oxygen of publicity, the way he likes it.

However, Harris is smart to put her closing argument to the American people at the Ellipse in Washington next Tuesday. This is where Trump ranted and raved about the “stolen” 2020 election and urged his supporters to march on the Capitol. The sight of Maga thugs assaulting the police and breaking into the “people’s house” remains etched on the collective consciousness.

That day, people saw Trump go to war with America – and lose. He can be beaten. Despite heavy gaslighting and Trump’s attempts to portray the 6 January prisoners as political “hostages”, this was a stain on US democracy of historic proportions. It provided a glimpse of a home-grown, American fascism more powerful than any comparisons between Trump and the Nazis. The Maga flags, battering rams, the noose and chants of “Hang Mike Pence”, Trump’s vice-president, were sickening.  Even Chris LaCivita, Trump’s campaign manager, condemned the riot in now-deleted Twitter posts. Almost everybody did. 

Many Republicans have decided to overlook the transgressive nature of the riot. But Harris is fine-tuning her message for the so-called Nikki Haley voters who think Trump is unfit for office. The former UN ambassador, who stood against Trump in the Republican primary, collected 77,000 votes in Georgia and nearly 25 per cent support in key suburban counties in Pennsylvania – even after she had abandoned her campaign.

Haley, cravenly, has been practically begging Trump to deploy her to soften his toxic image with women voters. Trump – who never forgives or forgets – is still hoping he doesn’t need her. But the early voting figures, which show Republicans performing better than in 2020, provide at least one encouraging sign for Harris. Out of the 27 million Americans who have already voted by post, women are outpacing men by 54-44 per cent (where statistics are available). Do they represent her secret army?

The danger with banging on about the threat of fascism and concentrating on a narrow sliver of disaffected Republicans is that Harris is losing the populist edge that powered her surge in the early days of her campaign. The Democrats may also come to rue the “lawfare” conducted against Trump. Putting his foot in it as usual, Joe Biden said this week it was time “to lock [Trump] up” before clarifying he meant, “politically lock him up”.

Although Trump keeps threatening to go after his opponents, using the military if necessary, he is the politician most likely to be jailed if he loses the election. This is a key reason why his opponents’ use of the F-word is regarded as the usual political mudslinging rather than a genuinely frightening forecast of Trump in power, untrammelled by the likes of old-school figures like Kelly and with the Supreme Court providing immunity for his actions.

Still, if Americans do vote for Trump, they can’t say they weren’t warned.
