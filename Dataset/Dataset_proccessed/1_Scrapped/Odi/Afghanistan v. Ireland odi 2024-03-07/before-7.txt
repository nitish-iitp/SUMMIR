UPW vs GG Commentary
5:05 PM IST Right then, that is it from this game. UP gets their second win of the season while Gujarat still have to wait to open their account. Next up in the Women's T20 League 2024 is a clash of the rivals. It will be Bangalore taking on Mumbai in an exciting contest on 2nd March, Saturday. The first ball will be bowled at 7.30 pm IST (2 pm GMT), but as you know, you can always join us early for all the build-up. Until then, cheers and goodbye!
5:04 PM IST Grace Harris is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for her brilliant knock and she is also the current top-scorer in the season. She says that she takes one ball at a time. Adds that she tries not to get frustrated and as she gets older, she controls her emotions better. Tells that she is enjoying playing for UP and embracing her role as a finisher. Mentions that she bowled too many slot balls in this game but in general she feels good while bowling and hopes to do better in the next game. Says that she and Deepti complement each other well and the left-right hand combination works for them and they will look to win a few more games together.
5:03 PM IST Alyssa Healy, the victorious skipper of UP says that Grace Harris is making cricket look so easy right now. She adds that the score was something that could have been chased down on this surface and she is glad that they were able to do it. She further says that the side is very well balanced and there are very good options on the bench as well. With two wins in two matches, they now prepare to take on Bangalore Women in their home ground in the next game and they are very confident walking into the next game.
4:57 PM IST Beth Mooney, the captain of Gujarat says that Phoebe Litchfield and Ashleigh Gardner had a good partnership that got them to a decent total but they didn't bowl well in the second innings to stop the opposition. She further adds that it's the responsibility of the set batter at the top who is getting in and getting those 30 runs to convert it into a 60 or 70 and hold the innings from one end. She ends by saying that it was a good game and they will bounce back well for sure.
4:56 PM IST Presentation Time...
4:56 PM IST Chamari Athapaththu is up for a quick chat. She says that she is very glad to join the team here and is looking to do good in the tournament ahead. She adds by saying that the wicket played really well and she was having fun with the bat in the middle till the time she was there. When asked about Grace, she says that it's always a pleasure watching her play her shots and she has done that time and again for the team.
