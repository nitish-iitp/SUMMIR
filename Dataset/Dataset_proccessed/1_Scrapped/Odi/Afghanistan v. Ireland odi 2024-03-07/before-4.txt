I'll spare you the sob story, but I am officially done shooting comps. I had just finished putting this rifle together and broke in the barrel before SHTF (April '23). I put 2 boxes (40 rds) of Berger Factory 95 gr ammo through it (cleaning every few rounds) to break in the barrel and it went into the safe ready for load development. It stayed there until I pulled it out for pictures for this post. I do not have any group pictures or velocities for the rounds I did shoot. I am not trying to make money, just recoup my expenses.

Below is the rifle:
Tikka Action
Mountain Tactical Rail
Proof Barrel chambered and threaded by Spartan Precision Rifles
APA Gen 3 6mm FB Nitride
MKM Bubble Level
MDT ACC Chassis
ACC internal weight kit
2 Snyder Precision External Weights
Bag Bullet
KRG 2 rd quiver
MDT 10 rd 308 mag
Printed Mag Holder

The optics are:
Meopta Optika6 5-30x56
Tenebraex Objective lens cover
Seekins Rings

The full package will also come with 200 rds of Lapua Factory 6mm Creedmoor 105 Hybrid Ammo.

Everything is $4000 -> $3500
Rifle with no ammo is $3500 -> $3100

Component pricing:
Scope +rings +caps - $1200 -> $1000
Chassis +internal and external weights +bag bullet +magazine - $1300 -> $1100
Barrel w/FB - $700 -> $600

I would prefer to sell locally (Idaho panhandle), but if you want me to ship it, we can figure it out. Contact me for component pricing.

Thanks,
Nick

Make me an offer on the rifle or components. I am not in a hurry to sell, but I do want this gone.

Price drop with old and new pricing. (Can't seem to add strikethrough...)

I have other barrels and stocks, if I don't sell the full rifle, I think I will just keep the action.
