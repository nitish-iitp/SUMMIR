The Super League Kerala: The Super League Kerala 2024 witnessed a historic moment as the highly anticipated first-ever Malabar Derby unfolded between Malappuram FC and Calicut FC at the packed Manjeri Payyanad Stadium, Malappuram, on Saturday.

Despite Malappuram's initial control, Calicut FC gradually found their rhythm and their persistence paid off in the 22nd minute, when Gani Ahammed capitalised on a defensive lapse and chipped the ball brilliantly over Malappuram goalkeeper Midhun, giving Calicut the lead.

The second half saw Malappuram FC come out with renewed determination, making key changes to their lineup to turn the game around. Despite their energetic start, Calicut FC gradually regained control of the match, dictating the pace and exploiting opportunities.
