Afghanistan vs South Africa Commentary
7:43 PM IST Right then, that's all we have from the second ODI, where Afghanistan dominated with both bat and ball, securing the series with a game to spare. They will be eager to inflict further misery on the Proteas and complete a clean sweep. As for South Africa, they will be the first to admit they have been outplayed in both departments by the Asian side across these two games. It's now about pride and a chance to end the series on a high in the final ODI. South Africa face a quick turnaround, with the third and final ODI of the series set for Sunday, 22nd September. The first ball will be bowled at 12 pm GMT. As always, you can join us early for the build-up. See you then. Cheers!
7:40 PM IST Afghanistan captain, Hashmatullah Shahidi expresses immense pride and joy after his team's series win over South Africa, extending his congratulations to the nation. He acknowledges the significance of the victory and how it has delighted both the team and the supporters back home. Shahidi praises the standout performances, particularly the partnership between Gurbaz and Rahmat Shah, and the impactful finish by Azmatullah. He also highlights the contributions of Rashid Khan, Kharote, and Nabi with the ball. Shahidi reassures fans that Rahmat Shah, who walked off due to cramps, is expected to be fit for the third ODI.
7:37 PM IST The captain of South Africa, Temba Bavuma says that the foundation was there, but as the wickets started falling, it became really difficult to stay in the game. Feels that they just weren't good enough on the day, and there aren’t a lot of positives to take from this performance. Reckons that they will need to take the learnings, reflect, and remain as positive as they can heading into the final game. Further says that they need to step up in both departments and admits that Afghanistan have been much more clinical than them so far. Tells that the third ODI will be another opportunity for the boys to regroup. States that they weren't able to take ten wickets, and that's something they need to address.
7:31 PM IST Rashid Khan is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his outstanding performance with the ball. He becomes the first player to take a five-wicket haul on his birthday in an ODI. Rashid expresses his delight after taking a five-wicket haul, his first in a long time. Despite battling a hamstring issue, he is thrilled to have contributed to Afghanistan's victory. Rashid enjoys bowling alongside young talents like Kharote and Ghazanfar, noting their willingness to learn and improve, both in practice and during matches. He emphasizes the importance of seizing the opportunity to win a series against South Africa, crediting the physio for his recovery. Determined to help his team, he pushed through the injury and is pleased with the result.
7:24 PM IST Time for the presentation ceremony...
7:20 PM IST Earlier in the game, after opting to bat first, Afghanistan’s openers gave them a solid platform. Rahmanullah Gurbaz, shaky at the start, grew in confidence and punished any loose deliveries. Rahmat Shah played the ideal supporting role while Gurbaz continued to attack. Gurbaz brought up his 7th ODI century, becoming Afghanistan’s leading centurion in the format, but fell soon after, followed by Rahmat after his fifty. Promoted to number 4, Azmatullah Omarzai kept the momentum going, ensuring the innings stayed on track. With Rashid Khan struggling at the other end due to a hamstring issue, Omarzai needed to bat through and so he did to propel his team to 311.
