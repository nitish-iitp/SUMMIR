Glenn Maxwell's efforts with the bat have illuminated the men's Cricket World Cup, but it is his less-heralded prowess with the ball that could prove just as critical for Australia.

Key points:
Maxwell has been one of the most economical bowlers at the World Cup
Daniel Vettori says Maxwell is an "extremely confident bowler"
Australia is expected to turn to Maxwell's off-spin in the semifinals

Maxwell may be forced to sit out Saturday's final group match against Bangladesh following his breathtaking double century against Afghanistan.

But Australia will rely on his underrated off-spin in next week's semifinal with South Africa in Kolkata.

Australia spin coach Daniel Vettori is credited with helping Maxwell develop his skills, which have made him one of the most economical bowlers in the tournament.

But Vettori said Maxwell's improvement with the ball was due to his unquenchable enthusiasm and dedication.

"I think you have to give Glenn most of that credit," Vettori told reporters in Pune.

"I think he's a very willing bowler and sometimes that can be the hardest part of being an all-rounder, so that even though you do have the skills, the desire is not always there.

The other greatest ODI innings after Maxwell's heroics

Glenn Maxwell's stunning match-winning double century at the Cricket World Cup has been hailed as the greatest ODI innings of all time. Here are the performances he's up against for that title.

"Maxi, he loves bowling and he loves the strategy that goes into it, probably like with his batting.

"You see a bowler that's evolved over the last few years. In particular, he's been able to start to bowl over the wicket to right-handers, which sort of went out of fashion for a period of time.

"So, he's an extremely confident bowler because of all the work he puts in and how skilful and intelligent he is around his bowling."

Maxwell's importance to Australia can be seen in how he has bowled 52.3 overs for the team at the World Cup.

He may only have taken five wickets in India at 52 apiece but the key aspect of his contributions with the ball has been how he is conceding just 4.95 runs per over, comfortably the most economical among all Australian bowlers.

In the whole tournament among bowlers who have played seven or more matches, Maxwell is ranked 11th best on economy rate.
