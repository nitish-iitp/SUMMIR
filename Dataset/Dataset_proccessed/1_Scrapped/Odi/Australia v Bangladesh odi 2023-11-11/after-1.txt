Australia vs Bangladesh: AUS vs BAN, Mitchell Marsh's career-best 177 not out sent Australia into next week's World Cup semi-finals with a convincing eight-wicket win over Bangladesh 
Australia vs Bangladesh Live Score Updates: AUS vs BAN,: Australia's Mitchell Marsh plays a shot during the 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup one-day international (ODI) match between Australia and Bangladesh at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune. (AFP)

Australia vs Bangladesh: AUS vs BAN, Mitchell Marsh displayed his six-hitting prowess on way to a magnificent 177 not out as Australia warmed up for the semifinals with an eight-wicket thrashing of Bangladesh in the World Cup.

Set a target of 307, Australia rode on Marsh's third ODI hundred and fifties from David Warner (53) and Steve Smith (63 not out) to complete the task with 32 balls in hand. The five-time champions will face South Africa in their semifinal in Kolkata on November 16.

Mitchell Marsh scored his second century of the World Cup when he reached three figures against Bangladesh.

The all-rounder took 87 balls to get to the milestone, including 11 fours and four sixes, after making 121 in an earlier group game against Pakistan.

Marsh, in at number three, shared a second-wicket stand of 120 with David Warner as Australia, already into a semi-final with South Africa, looked to chase down a target of 307 in their concluding round-robin fixture of the 10-team tournament.

A Shakib less Bangladesh managed a score of 306 runs in their 50 overs. Tohid Hridoy was the pick of the Bangladeshi batters, scoring his first world cup half-century during this encounter.

Bangladesh batters, however, will look at this total and see that they missed out on another 15-20 runs at least. A lot of Bangladeshi batters got a start but could not capitalize on it. Batters like Litton Das and Tanzid Hasan put up a solid opening stand but got out a score of 36 each instead of taking the innings forward and getting over the 50 or 100 mark.

Moreover, a few of the middle order batters like skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto and veteran batter Towhid Hridoy were run out on calls that could have been completely avoided. 

However, with the over 300 run total on the board, both the teams should be equally happy with Aussies backing themselves to chase it down while the Tigers aiming to exploit the weaknesses in this Aussie batting lineup.

Australia and Bangladesh have had drastically different World Cup campaigns so far, with the Bangladesh Tigers losing all their matches after their opening encounter against Afghanistan, apart from a win in their last outing against Sri Lanka.

The Aussies, on the other hand, have won six games in a row after their opening two defeats to India and South Africa. The Kangaroos have found a hero at every stage of the tournament, from the batting prowess of David Warner, Travis Head, Steve Smith and Mitchell Marsh to the bowling wizardry of Adam Zampa and the Aussie quickies.

Australia's top-order batsman Steve Smith missed the last match against Afghanistan due to a viral infection and the Kangaroos will be keen to get the experienced batsman back into the side as they prepare for the crucial clashes. Australia, who have already qualified for the semi-finals, are likely to face South Africa in the big game.

In their last outing before the semi-finals, Pat Cummins and Co will be looking to keep the momentum going into the knockout stages of the tournament.

Bangladesh, on the other hand, would have been encouraged by a much-needed win over rivals Sri Lanka in their last outing. However, the loss of captain Shakib al Hasan to injury could add to the Men in Green's woes.

Australia and Bangladesh playing XI:

Australia: David Warner, Travis Head, Mitchell Marsh, Steven Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Josh Inglis(w), Marcus Stoinis, Sean Abbott, Pat Cummins(c), Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood

Bangladesh: Tanzid Hasan, Litton Das, Najmul Hossain Shanto(c), Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Towhid Hridoy, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Mahedi Hasan, Nasum Ahmed, Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman

Australia vs Bangladesh: Head to head record

Australia and Bangladesh have played 21 ODIs so far. Australia have won 19 of those. One of those matches did not produce any results. When they faced off in June 2019 during the World Cup, Australia put up 381/5 in 50 overs. Bangladesh fought well and scored a heroic 333/8 in their 50.

In World Cups, these two teams have played against each other 4 times. While one of them did not produce any results, Australia won the remaining 3.

Australia vs Bangladesh: Key highlights so far

1) Pat Cummins won the toss and opted to bowl first at the Maharashtra Cricket Association stadium in Pune. Bangladeshi skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto said he would have liked to bat first as well.

2) Glenn Maxwell and Mitchell Startc miss today's game for Australia while Steve Smith and Sean Abbott take their place in the Aussie playing XI.

3) Tanzid Hasan Tamim and Litton Kumer Das opened the batting for Bangladesh against the bowling pair of Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins.

4) A good opening start that saw the Bangladeshi side go past the 50 run mark in just under 9 overs. 

5) Tanzid Hasan could not capitalize on the start as he departed on a score of 36 while defending a short delivery from Sean Abbott.

6) Travis Head departs after hitting a boundary. Good line and length. Head gets on the front foot and inside edges, the ball gets through, and Head is bowled.

7) Mustafizur Rahman pitches one up, pitching on a good line. Warner pushes forward and drives poorly, and is caught by Najmul Hossain Shanto down the ground.
