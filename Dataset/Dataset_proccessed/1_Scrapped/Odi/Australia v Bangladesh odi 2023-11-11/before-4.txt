CRICKET WORLD CUP: 'DISGRACEFUL' - ANGELO MATHEWS LAMBASTS BANGLADESH AS SRI LANKAN BATSMAN TIMED OUT
BYOLI GENT

UPDATED 06/11/2023 AT 21:20 GMT

Angelo Mathews pulled no punches in the aftermath of being timed out at the Cricket World Cup in Delhi. Appearing to take aim at opponents Bangladesh as well as the umpires, Mathews, who arrived at the crease as number seven in the order, said the incident was "absolutely disgraceful" and said for Bangladesh to "stoop down to that level there is something drastically wrong".

Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews walks back to the pavilion after he was timed out during the 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup one-day international (ODI) match between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi on November 6, 2023.

Angelo Mathews rounded on the "absolutely disgraceful" situation that saw him timed out during Sri Lanka's defeat to Bangladesh at the 2023 Cricket World Cup.
Mathews was dismissed when he failed to take guard in sufficient time after making his way to the crease, prompting Shakib Al Hasan, the Bangladesh captain, to make an appeal to the umpire. By exiting in this manner, Mathews became the first cricketer to be timed out in the history of international cricket.

Mathews’ start to his innings was already delayed as the Sri Lankan struggled with his helmet strap snapping, but the fourth umpire said he had taken too long to prepare himself to face his first ball.

Mathews said afterwards, per BBC Sport: "I hadn't done anything wrong, I have two minutes to get to the crease and get myself ready, which I did, and then it was an equipment malfunction.
"I don't know where the common sense went because obviously it is disgraceful from Shakib and Bangladesh if they want to play cricket like that. To stoop down to that level there is something drastically wrong.
"I still had five seconds to go after my helmet broke. I'm not talking about 'Mankading' [the act of a bowler running out a batter at the non-striker's end] or obstructing the field, I am just talking about common sense. It is absolutely disgraceful.
"We talk about the safety of the players, but you guys tell me if it is right for me to take my guard without my helmet?"

Mathews arrived at the crease seventh in the order, following Sadeera Samarawickrama, who had been caught by Mahmudullah off Shakib’s delivery.
ICC rules stipulate that a batsman must be ready to face his opening ball two minutes after his preceding team-mate’s dismissal.
The match, which meant little by way of qualification for the later rounds with Bangladesh already out and Sri Lanka needing a resounding win to progress, went ahead in spite of the poor air quality in New Delhi.
Bangladesh ultimately triumphed by three wickets, skittling the Sri Lankans for 279, and taking 41.1 overs to reach their target.
Both sides are therefore out of the World Cup, with Champions Trophy qualification - reserved for the top seven teams in the World Cup group stage - the main priority now.
