6:25pm And that is a wrap for this game. We hope you loved our coverage just as much as we enjoyed bringing it to you. There is plenty of World Cup action still going on, with Pakistan tasked with chasing 338 against England. Do hop over to that contest too. Until next time, this is goodbye from me (Shashwat), Alex, Chandan and everyone else at ESPNcricinfo. Take care, folks!

Pat Cummins, Australia captain: It was great. Great win leading to the semis, chasing a good total. We were not at our sharpest in the first innings. it was a really good wicket. We brought it back to a total that we could chase, not too upset with it. (On selection headaches for the semi-final) Good problems to have. All 15 have played this tournament now and I feel we can pick any one of them. (On Marsh's innings) Outstanding. I thought it was impressive the way he finished off the innings. The tempo that he played at was sustainable and he is a scary prospect to have in the next week. Seven games in a row, even when we were not at our best in some of those games, we came away with a win. Chasing 300-plus was something we did not do earlier. Feels like everything is clicking together.

Najmul Hossain Shanto, Bangladesh captain: (Where things went wrong today) I think for me the two run outs were crucial. The way we started was good but after the two run outs, we lost momentum. If we score 340-350, it could have been different. We did not bowl well in the middle overs (the spinners especially). The fast bowlers bowled well. We need to improve in the middle overs. We did not play our best at the World Cup as a team, in both bowing and batting. Want to look at what we can do better moving forward. Mahmudullah batted really well in the World Cup. Shakib bowled really well in a couple of matches. It is not about individual performances. We will look back at all nine matches and see where we have to improve as a team.

Mitchell Marsh, Player of the Match: It feels great. Obviously nice to chase this total down. Now, onto the semis. (On shifting down to No.3) I sort of knew that when Head came back in, I would go down to 3. Important to play with the same intent, back myself. There were a few games where I lost my intent but good to get it back. You will fail some times but important to get it right more times. (On his family back home) I am sure my Nana and Mum and everyone will be watching at home, and hopefully they will have a smile on their faces. My grandfather was a great man and we celebrated his life. Nice to be able to perform (for them) and nice to get the win. (On the semi-finals) Can't wait, mate. It is going to be a ripper. The four best teams are playing in the semis and I cannot wait to get to Kolkata. (On his bowling) Not every day that you get POTM after you concede 50 in four overs (laughs). Started off with -50 when I began batting (smiles). But good to get stuck in.

Srihari: "Marsh's innings reminds me of a certain Watto innings against Bang too" -- Till Tuesday, that was, in fact, the highest individual score by an Australia men's batter in ODI cricket

6:05pm A clinical Australian run-chase to wrap up their group-stage campaign. They did encounter an early blip, with Head departing well inside the powerplay. Marsh and Warner, though, ensured that that was all the joy the Bangladesh bowlers found at the start. They hit boundaries regularly and rotated strike nicely, putting the bowlers under pressure throughout their partnership. Warner perished after getting to a half-century but Marsh carried on, registering his second ton this World Cup. He finished with an unbeaten 177, laced with 17 fours and nine sixes.

Smith, who missed Australia's last game, also got going, picking up his second fifty of this World Cup and looking largely untroubled. He did not get in on the boundary-hitting act as much, but kept things ticking with singles and doubles.

It was a fairly accomplished run-chase overall, and one that will inject even more belief into this Australian camp, especially ahead of a semi-final clash with South Africa.

As for Bangladesh, well, they did get a wicket inside the powerplay, which was a welcome change, considering they have struggled during that phase. Post that, though, they simply lacked penetration. Their lines and lengths were also not great and they were not able to build any sort of scoreboard pressure, despite having more than 300 runs on the board. Today's display perhaps sums up their campaign too. Promising in patches but just not consistent enough to win crucial moments.

Mustafizur to Smith, FOUR runs

Smith seals the deal! Australia make it seven wins in a row, and they have chased down 307 at an absolute canter! Right in the slot on middle and leg. Smith opens up his stance and smokes it over mid on. Australia do not quite go up to second, but this has been a thoroughly convincing display - one that will make their fellow semi-finalists sit up and take notice!
