TIMED OUT - SRI LANKA'S ANGELO MATHEWS IN UNWANTED INTERNATIONAL CRICKET FIRST IN CONTROVERSIAL WORLD CUP DISMISSAL
BYRICHARD NEWMAN

UPDATED 06/11/2023 AT 17:11 GMT

There was controversy at the Cricket World Cup as Sri Lanka’s Angelo Mathews was timed out - the first time the dismissal has ever happened in international cricket. The all-rounder struggled with a broken strap on his helmet and after requesting a new one, was given out for not taking guard inside the two minutes which are permitted in the ICC rules. No player had ever been timed out before.

Sri Lanka’s Angelo Mathews became the first player to be timed out in the history of international cricket in his side’s World Cup defeat to Bangladesh.
Coming in with his side 134-4, the former captain did not take guard inside the International Cricket Council’s permitted two minutes in their World Cup match with Bangladesh in Delhi. Mathews looked in no rush on his way to the middle before he realised the strap was broken on his helmet.

He requested a new one, but Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan had seen enough and appealed to the umpires. Following a long discussion with officials, Mathews appeared to ask Shakib to withdraw the appeal but turned and headed for the dugout when he realised that would not happen.

Mathews looked disgusted as he made his way from the field, slamming his helmet down as he crossed the rope before he was consoled by head coach Chris Silverwood.
It is the first time a player has been timed out across all forms of international cricket - Tests, one-day internationals and T20s.
Though the dismissal was within the laws of the game, it is another incident which calls into question whether it was within the ‘spirit of cricket’, similar to Jonny Bairstow's controversial dismissal in the Ashes last summer.
In the ICC’s World Cup playing conditions, rule 40.1.1 states:
"After the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, the incoming batter must, unless time has been called, be ready to receive the ball, or for the other batter to be ready to receive the next ball within two minutes of the dismissal or retirement. If this requirement is not met, the incoming batter will be out, timed out."
Mathews is one of the most experienced players in international cricket, having played 106 Tests, 224 ODIs and 78 T20s for Sri Lanka.
He was not included in the original World Cup squad but was brought in as a late replacement.

Sri Lanka were dismissed for 279 by Bangladesh before the Tigers eclipsed their opponents' target in 41.1 overs, with top-order batters Najmul Hossain Shanto (90) and captain Shakib Al Hasan (82) putting them on course for victory.
