The ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 follows a format similar to many major sporting events by featuring two distinct phases: a group stage followed by a knockout stage. The round-robin phase of the World Cup takes place from October 5 to November 12 and includes all 10 teams in a single group. In this format, every country faces each of the other countries once before they make it to the knockout stage.

Following the round-robin stage, the top four teams with the highest points move on to the Semi-Finals, scheduled for November 15 and 16. In the Semi-Finals, the team that finishes at the first position in the group faces the fourth-placed team, while the second-placed team competes against the third-placed team. The winners of these Semi-Final match advance to the final, which is set to take place on November 19.

ICC World Cup Points Table 2023 Rules

In the World Cup, teams accumulate points according to their performance in their matches. When a team emerges victorious, they will earn 2 points. In the case of a tied match, both participating teams will gain 1 point each. Similarly, if a match is abandoned or cannot be concluded due to weather or other circumstances, both teams will secure one point each. However, in the event of a loss, a team does not receive any points.

Apart from points, teams are frequently ranked based on additional criteria like the Net Run Rate (NRR). The net run rate is determined by subtracting the average runs conceded per over by the opposing teams from the average runs scored per over by a team. It serves as a tiebreaker in situations where two or more teams have an equal number of points.

ICC World Cup 2023 Standing Trivia

In this World Cup edition hosted in India, the matches are fairly distributed among 10 venues, each hosting five games. Hyderabad, is the exception, as it will host three. The list includes some of the world's most iconic cricket stadiums, such as Eden Gardens and Delhi. 

The World Cup 2023 fixture featuring India and Pakistan has ignited immense global fan excitement. Tickets for the match were sold out within minutes on booking apps and are currently being resold online for a remarkable 57 lakhs. This level of enthusiasm extends beyond just the India matches, with other games also enjoying similar fan affection. 

Moving to the points table of 2023, let us also have a look on how the points table looked like in previous two editions ie 2015 and 2019 where India had a semi-final finish
