Fantastic win.

England totally outplayed with bat and ball on a reasonably good pitch.

Good for them. But I just get the sense that ICC/BCCI are treating the Afghans with scant respect. You mean they could not have a professional interpreter on hand for the post-game interviews?

This is a multi-million dollar international tournament.

No need to....Rashid Khan was perfect for the job...him also being a star performer in this match

Nice win and especially as it comes at this time of grief.

Anybody but England and India.

Hopes the Saffies can bring it home- it will be for all of us.

I don’t recall you congratulating Kenya!

 
jacksparrow 2023-10-15 19:42:34 

India have been the ones actually to give Afghanistan a lift. Can't say I am am big fan of the Afghans since they were caught multiple times barefaced cheating boundaries etc in some matches before they came up to the top, but they have consistent against world class teams, was only a matter of time.

Not arguing wid any of allyuh. The only cricket of significance in Afghanistan pre 1990s was mostly British troops against themselves.
Kenya fielded a team against the rest of the world in the 19th century.
