Two teams that played the first ever cricket match in history and have provided many fierce battles in the past will be up against each other in match no. 36 of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023. This will be a game between England and Australia at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.

Australia are in third place and have a bright chance for the semi-finals. But the defending champions have a contrasting tournament. They are at the bottom of the table and need to win their remaining games to qualify for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in Pakistan. Overall, a game between these two teams is always a treat to watch.
