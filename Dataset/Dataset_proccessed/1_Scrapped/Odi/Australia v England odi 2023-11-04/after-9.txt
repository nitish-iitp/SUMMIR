'My own form is a big concern...'

More from England skipper Jos Buttler: "We did well in the field and it could have been better. It was a frustrating partnership from Mitchell Starc and Adam Zampa at the end. It would have been nice to wrap the innings up quicker.

"We were happy at the halfway point. You look at the dew on the field, and to come up 30 runs short having not played our best... there's areas we could have found those runs."

On the shot which led to his dimsmissal: "It was the right shot to play, but the execution was off. It was a time to be positive and take the game on. It was the time to throw something back. My own form has been the biggest concern. Coming into the tournament I felt in a great space. So to have not played as well as I can in such a pivotal role is disappointing. My own performance with the bat has hurt us."

On facing the Netherlands next, with qualification for the Champions Trophy on the line: "The only way to get back into form and winning games is to front up and go again. You have to keep putting in the hard work as individuals believing it's not far away. The longer it goes on the closer you are to coming out the other side of it."

'The boys have played brilliantly...'

Australia captain Pat Cummins: "It's been great. The boys have played brilliantly, every game we've found a way to win. I feel like every game we've improved a little bit. I still don't think we've played the complete game. But we've had different matchwinners.

"We have a lot of pride. We knew at the start of the tournament we weren't at our best. Everyone's been diving around - I'm all muddy.

"Adam Zampa's been bowling beautifully. He scored 30-odd, took a hanger out there, he's a match winner. You always feel he's close to a wicket.

"Maxy and Mitchy are going to be back at some stage. We've got a squad where everyone can perform if they need to."

"Honestly the dew wasn't too bad tonight. We dried the ball a fair bit, in T20s it can get slippy and you slide around, but it wasn't too bad."

England have just got too many players out of form. They've lost their mojo - and when that happens you make poor decisions.

'A low point. It hurts...'
published at 17:05 Greenwich Mean Time 4 November 2023
17:05 GMT 4 November 2023

England captain Jos Buttler: "Disappointment. I feel like we are having the same chat after every game at the minute. There were improvements again today. We got back to more like how we can play but still short of it to lose by 30 odd.

"There's plenty of ways to find those 30 runs we needed. It certainly feels like a low point. I've had a few but definitely as a captain. To be stood in this position having arrived in India with high hopes is incredibly tough and disappointing. It hurts a lot.

"We haven't done ourselves justice. Coming into the tournament we fancied ourselves to have a real go and push whoever it was going to be all the way. It's incredibly tough to reach those highs absolutely. Everyone knows how much hard work goes into that, and even when you come up short.

"We've let ourselves down. We've let down people down at home, who support us through thick and thin and we wear that on our own shoulders."

'The ball has come out as well as it ever has'

Player of the match Adam Zampa: "We put on a really competitive total, but it was going to be tough to defend. The ground felt really dewey, really wet. Length control, attacking the stumps, trying to guess what the batter was going to do was really important. The ball has come out as well as it ever has."

On his batting performance: "We had to stay positive, try to bat out to the 50 and not throw it away. We came out at 240-odd and it was important to rotate the strike and stick it out to the end."

Is the best still to come? "I hope so!"

Not a bad day for Adam Zampa, who is named player of the match. He made 29 off 19 balls to give the Australia innings some momentum at the end.

The leggie then took 3-21, snaring Moeen Ali, Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler.

There was a stunning catch to boot.

We'll hear from him shortly.

That's five consecutive defeats for England, they've been bowled out each time. They've lost six matches for the first time in a World Cup.

It seems like England have been gone for some time, but there's no amount of playing with abacuses that can save them now - they're out.

England's very faint hopes of making the World Cup semi-finals are now officially over.

What a disaster this tournament has been.

Rashid c Inglis b Hazlewood 20 (Eng 253 all out)

A short ball from Josh Hazlewood which is hooked straight up in the air by Adil Rashid and held by Josh Inglis.

Cannot fault Rashid, really, given it was a big ask for him to get England over the line from this position. He had to go for it.

He's had a good match, Chris Woakes. He's bowled well, taken wickets. He's had a disappointing tournament overall, but not today.

It's gone for six! How has that done that? It's got a leading edge, flown over slip.

Six big ones from Adil Rashid!

It's a full toss trailing down leg side from Marcus Stoinis and comes off, I think, the back of Adil Rashid's bat and in the manner of a lead edge goes over the boundary at third for a maximum.
