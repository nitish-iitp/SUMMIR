England cricket team at session at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on November 3, 2023

Australia (AUS) and England (ENG) will resume their historic rivalry during the 36th match of the ICC World Cup 2023 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Both teams enter this game with different fortunes on their back. While Australia are looking to cement their position in the top four, defending champions England are aiming to keep hanging by a thread in the race for the semifinals.

Pat Cummins-led side recorded a thrilling five-run win against New Zealand in their last game and now are placed in the third position in the points table with eight points. 

England continue to struggle at the bottom of the table with two points in six games and will be eliminated from the semifinal race with a defeat against Australia. The Three Lions have lost all of their last four ODI encounters against Australia and are unlikely to walk away with two points in Ahmedabad.
