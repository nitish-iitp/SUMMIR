Australian skipper Pat Cummins could barely contain a grin when asked about the situation England's defending champions find themselves in at the Cricket World Cup.

Key points:
Pat Cummins said it was 'not ideal' to lose Glenn Maxwell and Mitch Marsh ahead of the clash against England
Ben Stokes said he will have knee surgery after the Cricket World Cup

"It is sad to see. I don't know much else to say," Cummins said, with a sheepish smile, when he was asked about England's results.

With relations between the two sides barely cordial after an acrimonious Ashes campaign earlier this year, Australia are in the enviable position of being able to knock England out of the Cricket World Cup with a victory on Saturday night in Ahmedabad.  

England has lost five of its six games ahead of Saturday's crucial match against five-time champion Australia.

It's arguably the worst run for a title-holder since 1999, when Sri Lanka lost three out of five games and failed to make the playoffs.

And yet, Australia does have its issues with both Glenn Maxwell and Mitch Marsh both ruled out of Saturday's match, meaning another change to the line up.

"Yeah, it's not ideal," Cummins said.

"Both have been star players of the tournament so far at different times.

"That's the way it is. We knew at the start of the tournament we were going to need a full squad of 15.

"And yeah, I'm not even sure we've played the same 11 two games in a row through injury or selection. So, it's kind of unfortunate, but we knew over a two-month tournament you're going to have to chop and change a bit."

Cummins said Maxwell, who has been in superb form in the tournament and hit a 40-ball hundred against the Netherlands, could return for their game against Afghanistan next week.

"He's trained well yesterday and still taking it day by day, but hoping he'll just miss this one game and then Mitch, we'll wait and see," Cummins added.

"He'll definitely come back. I don't think it'll be a super long trip back home to Perth, but the main thing is he's back home and we'll give him as much time and space as he needs."

England can't 'sugarcoat' its 'crap' tournament

England's tournament could not have gone worse.

Five defeats from six matches, including losses to Afghanistan and a humiliating destruction at the hands of South Africa have left the defending champions needing a miracle to make the semifinals.

England's Cricket World Cup defence started poorly, then got worse. On Saturday, Australia has the chance to put the final nail in the coffin.

Ben Stokes, who confirmed that he would have knee surgery after the tournament, said he could not put his finger on what had gone so badly wrong, but they had the chance to make up for it against Australia. 

"We've had a disastrous World Cup and there's no point sugar-coating that because it's the truth. But we know these last three games, for us, we've got a lot to play for," Stokes said.

"I know there will be a lot of noise around England vs Australia in the next game, but we have got to play for pride of what it is to put this shirt on."

When asked why England had underperformed at the tournament, Stokes said they failed to take control of games but apart from that the team could not quite put a finger on what went wrong.

"The problem is that we've been crap," Stokes said. 

"Every opportunity that we've had in front of us where we feel like we can take control of the game, the opposition's managed to get it back towards them.

"We've been nowhere near good enough to be able to compete in a World Cup, which has been incredibly disappointing because we know we're so, so much better than what we've shown out here.

"If we knew what had gone wrong, we would have been able to fix it. But unfortunately, we don't.

"It's one of those tournaments where it's just been a disaster."
