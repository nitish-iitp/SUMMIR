Two teams that played the first ever cricket match in history and have provided many fierce battles in the past will be up against each other in match no. 36 of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023. This will be a game between England and Australia at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.
Australia are in third place and have a bright chance for the semi-finals. But the defending champions have a contrasting tournament. They are at the bottom of the table and need to win their remaining games to qualify for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in Pakistan. Overall, a game between these two teams is always a treat to watch.

ENG vs AUS: Pitch Report

The pitch at Narendra Modi Stadium offers a great batting track where big totals are normal. But under lights, the ball tends to seam and swing more, which will make the batting difficult. The team that wins the toss will look to bat first and post a big total to put pressure on the opposition.

Dream11 Prediction: Looking at the current form of both teams, Australia have a better momentum but England can bounce back anytime. However, with England struggling in both departments, Australia can put them under more pressure. Hence, we bet on a win for Australia.
