10.40pm: Okay then. England's white-ball wonders have run their race, now officially former world champions (even though it was pretty clear for the last couple of weeks that they were done). Andrew Miller's report will sketch out this latest defeat in global technicolor, and there will be plenty of time to pick through the wreckage. Australia move on to 10 points, one more W away from the semis. We'll be back for more tomorrow as the World Cup rolls on. Can New Zealand avert their tailspin? Are Pakistan going to do a Pakistan? Will Afghanistan sneak into the top four? It's all to play for (and even England still need to try and finish in the top eight), so see you again soon. From Gnasher, Chandan and myself, it's cheerio for now. Bye!

10.30pm: Time to hear from the captains, starting with Jos Buttler: "Disappointment. Feel like we're having the same chat after every game. Some improvements again today but still short. It's a low point. To be stood in this position when you arrive in India with high hopes it incredibly tough, incredibly disappointing. It hurts a lot. We certainly haven't done ourselves justice. Fancied ourselves to have a real go at it. Incredibly tough to reach those highs [winning in 2019] and everyone knows the work that goes into that. Feel like we've let people down. You wear that on your own shoulders. [Happy chasing 287] Yeah, thought so, could have been better - frustrating partnership between Zampa and Starc, could have finished it quicker. Having come up 30 runs short, there's certainly areas we can find those 30 runs. [Dismissal] I think it was the right shot to play, execution was off. Felt that was the time to throw something back at the opp. My own form has been the biggest concern. I came in in a great place, but my own form has really hurt us. [Netherlands next] Only way you can get back into form is keep going. The longer it goes on, the closer you are to coming out of it."

Australia's Pat Cummins: "Its been great. Boys played brilliantly. Off to a tough start, but every game found a way to win. Every game's improved. Still don't think we've played the complete game, but different match-winners and feels like it's all coming together. We have a lot of pride in [our fielding], seen a marked improvement, everyone's diving around and all the boys want to be in the hot spots. [Zampa] Been bowling beautifully. Got 30-odd and took a hanger out there. He's a matchwinner, was at his best tonight. Got Maxi and Mitchy who will be in at some stage, so we feel like we've got a whole squad who can go out and perform. Will be tough to pick an XI. [Wet ball] Wasn't too bad, we dried it plenty."

10.20pm: Australia claim the points, the bragging rights and the morality spoils against their oldest rivals. It ended up being closer than expected - the difference almost the same as Australia's ninth-wicket stand - but England were struggling from the moment Jonny Bairstow was dismissed from the first ball of the chase. They limped through the powerplay and were then tied down by Adam Zampa, whose 3 for 21 (following a cameo with the bat) was decisive. He is duly named Player of the Match: [Approach] "Summing up conditions. Thought we put up a competitive total, the ground got really wet. For me, length control, attacking the stumps, trying to read the batter. Probably came out as well as it ever has tonight. [Batting] Stay positive and bat out the 50. Important to rotate strike and get to end of innings. [Willey catch] Sometimes they stick, one of those days."

48.1
W
Hazlewood to Rashid, OUT

Short ball, top-edged up the chimney! Inglis settles under the catch and it's goodnight, Ahmedabad! Pace off into the pitch again, Rashid swung for the hills but the ball went nowhere. And with that, England are officially out of contention for the semi-finals, their defence of the ODI World Cup over

Stoinis to Woakes, OUT

Full toss, picks out deep square leg! Woakes gets the delivery he probably wanted, a knee-high meatball - but his connection wasn't great and Labuschagne circles around to take the catch. A valiant effort from Woakes, but the jig is probably up for England

Chris Woakes c Labuschagne b Stoinis 32 (33b 4x4 1x6 52m) SR: 96.96

Stoinis to Woakes, no run

Slower delivery into the pitch, Woakes backs away but carves out a slice of fresh air

47.4

Stoinis to Rashid, 1 run

Full again and swatted through midwicket

Very tight, but looked to be just dipping below waist height

47.3
6
Stoinis to Rashid, SIX runs

HIGH FULL TOSS GOES FOR SIX! Slipped out at the body, Rashid swings across the line and it comes off the top edge over deep third! But crucially not given as a no-ball

Stoinis to Woakes, 1 run

Well bowled, gets his yorker on target. Dug out down to long-on

47.1
2
Stoinis to Woakes, 2 runs

Full and straight, clipped off the pads fine of deep backward square for two

Now then, three overs to go, 45 needed - and, with the big guns bowled out, Marcus Stoinis on

46.4
1
Cummins to Rashid, 1 run

Into the pitch, again wiped across the line, just a single to deep square

"45.5 That was an overhead helicopter shot from Adil Rashid." Indeed, Galib. MS-approved

46.3
1
Cummins to Woakes, 1 run

Wide blockhole, pace off and dinked into the covers. Australia very happy with singles here

Cummins to Woakes, no run

Cutter in the channel, grips in the pitch as Woakes swings and misses

46.1
1
Cummins to Rashid, 1 run

Short of a length, possible a slower ball. Rashid mows it down the ground but will only get one to long-on

"Cummins is not looking at those 2 overs. He seems to be looking at those 2 balls, which will get this match to a conclusion." That seems the case, Gaja. He's going to bowl out here

Hazlewood to Rashid, 1 run

Slower ball, full outside off and Rashid slaps it through the covers. Just a single

Here's Dave: "Last time a spinner went for less than 21 in full allocation of over in the World Cup was Daniel Vettori in 2015, 5/18 against Afghanistan. And against a full icc member Mohammad Hafeez in 2011, 2/16 against West Indies." Crikey
