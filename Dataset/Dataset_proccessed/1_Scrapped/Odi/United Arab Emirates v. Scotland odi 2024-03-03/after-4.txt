Comprised of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the United Kingdom is a sovereign state situated across from continental Europe’s north-western coast.

The United Kingdom shipped US$519.4 billion worth of exported products around the world in 2023.

That dollar amount results from a 10.9% increase from $468.3 billion for 2019 but a -2.1% reduction compared to $530.5 billion one year earlier in 2022.

More data on UK exports by country, the EU and continent are described below.

The total value of EU purchases from the UK declined by -5.2% from 2022 to 2023.

Below are the top 10 EU customers for Britain’s exported goods during 2023.

Germany: US$39.9 billion (7.7% of total UK exports)

Ireland: $34.1 billion (6.6%)

UK’s Major Trade Deficits by Country

The United Kingdom incurred an overall -US$272 billion trade deficit during 2023. That dollar amount represents -4.8% in shrinkage from -$288.8 billion in red ink one year earlier for 2022.

As defined by Investopedia, a country whose total value of all imported goods is higher than its value of all exports is said to have a negative trade balance or deficit.

It would be unrealistic for any exporting nation to expect across-the-board positive trade balances with all its importing partners. Similarly, that export country doesn’t necessarily post a negative trade balance with each individual partner with which it exchanges exports and imports.

United Kingdom incurred the highest trade deficits with the following countries.

China: -US$64.9 billion (country-specific trade deficit in 2023)
Germany: -$34.5 billion
Norway: -$28.2 billion
United States: -$23 billion
Italy: -$18.1 billion
Spain: -$14.4 billion
Kazakhstan: -$13.9 billion
France: -$11.2 billion
Poland: -$10.8 billion
Vietnam: -$8.3 billion

Among the United Kingdom’s trading partners that cause the greatest negative trade balances, the UK’s deficits with France (up 152.4%), Kazakhstan (up 85%) and Spain (up 24.8%) grew at the fastest pace from 2022 to 2023.

These cashflow deficiencies clearly indicate United Kingdom’s competitive disadvantages with the above countries, but also represent key opportunities for United Kingdom to develop country-specific strategies to strengthen its overall position in international trade.

UK’s Major Trade Surpluses by Country

Based on Investopedia’s definition of net importer, a country whose total value of all imported goods is lower than its value of all exports is said to have a positive trade balance or surplus.

United Kingdom earned the highest trade surpluses at the expense of the following countries.

Switzerland: US$21.8 billion (country-specific trade surplus in 2023)
Hong Kong, China: $13.9 billion
Ireland: $13.5 billion
Netherlands: $10.1 billion
United Arab Emirates: $6.14 billion
Singapore: $4.66 billion
Belgium: $3.1 billion
Qatar: $2.4 billion
Saudi Arabia: $2.3 billion
North Macedonia: $1.3 billion

Among the United Kingdom’s trading partners that generated the greatest positive trade balances, United Kingdom’s surpluses with Belgium (up 138.4%), Saudi Arabia (up 111.1%) and Switzerland (up 4.8%) grew from 2022 to 2023.

In addition, Britain reversed an -$4.55 billion deficit trading with Qatar in 2022 to generate the trade surplus listed above.

The positive cashflow streams for 2023 clearly indicate United Kingdom’s competitive advantages with the above countries, but also represent key opportunities for the United Kingdom to develop country-specific strategies to optimize its overall position in international trade.
