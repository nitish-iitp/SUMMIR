OPINION
By Chris Stocks
Stokes has destabilised England at this World Cup - it's time for him to quit ODIs for good

If Stokes does not retire of his own accord, England should drop him if they are to have any hope of evolving after a car crash World Cup

In hindsight, Ben Stokes’ decision to come out of retirement from one-day international cricket has not helped England at this World Cup. Worse, his presence in India has, however unintentionally, destabilised the team.

It started when he elbowed Harry Brook out of the initial squad for the tournament, a situation that ultimately led to Jason Roy’s exclusion after England had a rethink and included Brook at the 11th hour. His hip injury on arrival in India then overshadowed the start of the campaign.

Once he returned for the fourth match against South Africa in Mumbai, he scored 48 runs in three innings. There was also the contract announcement amid all this, when 48 hours before a crucial match against Sri Lanka it emerged Stokes, England’s Test captain, had rejected a three-year deal and only committed to 12 months.

He has since found form, scoring 64 in 90 balls in a losing cause against Australia and then rescuing England with his first World Cup century, against the Netherlands on Wednesday.

England insiders see Matthew Mott as a joke figure who has lost all authority

That latest rescue act may have salvaged qualification for the 2025 Champions Trophy out of the wreckage of England’s World Cup campaign.

But there is a good argument to say that now is the time to move on from Stokes in white-ball cricket as England look to rebuild for the future.

He came back for this World Cup with the best of intentions. Loyal to the core, Stokes answered the call from captain Jos Buttler and coach Matthew Mott having quit ODIs in July of last year.

It says much about his character that despite the debilitating knee injury that will require an operation on his return home next week he said yes.

However, through no fault of his own it hasn’t worked out.

Hindsight is a wonderful thing and I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t backed Buttler and Mott in inviting him back into the ODI fold.

After he smashed an England-record one-day score of 182 against New Zealand at The Oval in September, it looked an inspired move.

The truism that any England team with Stokes is stronger holds water. He is an amazing player who lifts the whole dressing-room.

Yet in a set-up where he is not captain but where others look to him to inspire, it’s the off-field stuff that is counterproductive – the injuries that create a negative, downbeat atmosphere, the fact Buttler was publicly undermined when Mott referred to Stokes as the team’s “spiritual leader” before that South Africa match.

I have nothing but admiration for Stokes as a man and a cricketer. He has provided us all with moments that will live with us forever – that 2019 World Cup Final against New Zealand, his heroics in the Headingley Ashes Test a few weeks later and the match-winning knock in last year’s T20 World Cup Final against Pakistan in Melbourne.

But he has achieved it all in white-ball cricket. Stokes ensured England became the first country to unite both world titles.

Now 32 and about to have a knee operation that will define the rest of his career, he should concentrate on ensuring England’s Test team go from strength to strength.

His work with Brendon McCullum in the Bazball revolution has been remarkable. They will have their work cut out to win in India early next year.

But Stokes’ legacy as Test captain will be defined by the next Ashes series in Australia in the winter of 2025-26.

Ensuring he is as fit as possible for that and that he leads the team Down Under should be the priority for England.

He will undoubtedly want to play in next summer’s T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and USA. Maybe that could be his last hurrah in white-ball cricket?

But the 50-over team need to move on from Stokes. Asked in the aftermath of that much-needed win against the Netherlands whether Saturday’s final group match with Pakistan in Kolkata would be his last ODI, Stokes replied: “No idea.”

Pressed on whether if it was his last ODI, he’d take satisfaction in ensuring Champions Trophy qualification to make life easier for the next generation of players, he said: “If I’m there or not who knows? I don’t think leaving here there’s any satisfaction for anyone to be honest, it’s been a very disappointing World Cup.”

It might have been even more disappointing had Stokes not stepped up against the Dutch. But like so many great teams who have been over reliant on a superstar player, that icon perhaps has to be moved on for the team to evolve.

It would be some call to tell Stokes he is no longer needed in white-ball cricket – and the only man with the authority to deliver it would be director of cricket Rob Key. But after a World Cup campaign as abysmal as this, brave, difficult calls need to be made.
