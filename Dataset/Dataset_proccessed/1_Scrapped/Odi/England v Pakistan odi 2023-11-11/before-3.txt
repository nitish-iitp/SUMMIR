A special celebration of the CWC23 on the eve of Diwali at the Gateway of India

Some of the finest and greatest moments from the ongoing Cricket World Cup 2023 were showcased through a two-minute projection, with a brilliant display of light and sound.

The brand campaign for the Men's Cricket World Cup, "It Takes One Day", was highlighted like never before in the projection.

Select images of the epic moments from the ongoing World Cup were selected and curated alongside the Navarasa symbols. The Navarasa symbols were reimagined in a cricketing context. They showcased the various emotions the cricketing fans feel while living the drama and excitement of a World Cup match.

A lightshow at Gateway of India celebrated CWC23 and Diwali.

The projection featured 40,000 state-of-the-art lumen projectors, which made this show a powerful blend of technology and emotive storytelling, making this show a must-view event for all cricketing fans around the world.

This projection celebrated the cricket played in the Cricket World Cup so far.

Sir Viv Richards, the West Indies legend and the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 Ambassador, was elated to see the celebrations.

“Ahead of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup semi-final in Mumbai, it is fantastic to see the iconic Gateway of India celebrating epic World Cup moments alongside the stunning Navarasa symbols.

“There has been enthralling cricket on show for all fans to experience a range of emotions and I can’t wait to see what the remaining games have in store for everyone.”
