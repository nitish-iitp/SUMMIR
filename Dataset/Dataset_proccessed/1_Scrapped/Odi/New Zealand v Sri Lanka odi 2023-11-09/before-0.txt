New Zealand and Sri Lanka square off against each other in Match 41 of ODI World Cup 2023, scheduled to take place on November 9 at M. Chinnawamy Stadium in Bangalore. Kane Williamson’s New Zealand remains in the hunt for a place in the final four while Kusal Mendis’ Sri Lanka has already been eliminated from the competition.

The runners-up from the last two editions in 2015 and 2019, the Kiwis are going through a mini-slump as they have now lost four successive games. They began the campaign solidly as they sealed victories in all of their opening four encounters against reigning champions England, the Netherlands, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. Though, they failed to keep their winning momentum going with four losses on the bounce in the next four.

Their defeats came against tournament favorites and the host nation, India, and then against Australia, South Africa, and Pakistan. With eight points and a net run rate of +0.398, they are placed in the fourth position in the table. The BlackCaps need to beat the Lankan Lions to give themselves a chance of sealing that number 4 spot. Pakistan and Afghanistan also remain in contention for that position.

On the other hand, it has been a dismal campaign for the 1996 champions Sri Lanka as they have played eight games with just two victories and six losses. The Asian side never looked like challenging for the semi-final place and is now eliminated from the showpiece event. They will play for pride and look to spoil the New Zealander’s party. In terms of head-to-head fixtures, Sri Lanka is just ahead of the Kiwis with six wins in 11 matches in the history of World Cups.
