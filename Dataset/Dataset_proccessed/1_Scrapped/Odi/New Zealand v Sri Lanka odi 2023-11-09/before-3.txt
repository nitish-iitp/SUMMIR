New Zealand and Sri Lanka will play the 41st match of the 2023 Cricket World Cup. The Black Caps and Sri Lanka are currently ranked fourth and eighth in the rankings of the 10-team tournament.

In the 2023 Cricket World Cup on Thursday, New Zealand will face Sri Lanka in match 41 at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. New Zealand were beaten by 21 runs (DLS) in their last game against Pakistan but need to win this game to give themselves the best chance of finishing in the top four. Sri Lanka have won just two games in the competition so far and were beaten by three wickets by Bangladesh in a contentious game on Monday. The match begins in Bengaluru at 2:00 pm local time.

New Zealand looked set to be one of the first teams to qualify for the semi-finals after a brilliant start to the tournament, but their form has suffered greatly due to the team's injuries. However, they looked much better in their last game and will be very confident of beating Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka almost snatched a late win against Bangladesh on Monday but ultimately they failed to score enough runs in the first innings. The dismissal of Angelo Mathews in this game will be talked about for a long time, but it could also inspire a team spirit that can lead them to a win in this final game of the tournament.

Match Preview


New Zealand will face Sri Lanka in the 41st match of the 2023 ODI World Cup at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Thursday (November 9). It will be the last group stage game for both teams. Sri Lanka have already been eliminated from the tournament while this is New Zealand's last chance to finish in the top four.

New Zealand faced Pakistan in their last game and suffered a defeat despite scoring 401 runs. Rachin Ravindra scored another century in the tournament. Kane Williamson scored an excellent 95 runs and 79 deliveries in his comeback. Pakistan lost their first wicket at the end of the second over. Fakhar Zaman and Babar Azam added 194 runs for the second wicket before the rain break. Pakistan managed to win this game by 21 runs using the DLS method.

Sri Lanka faced Bangladesh in their last game. Kusal Perera was dismissed for just four runs in the first over. They lost two more wickets before reaching 100 runs. Sadeera Samarawickrama scored 41 runs before being dismissed. Angelo Mathews suffered a rare dismissal for a time violation in the 25th over and Charith Asalanka's superb 108-run performance helped Sri Lanka to a total of 279 runs. Tanzim Hasan Shakib picked up three wickets on his World Cup debut.

In the chase, Bangladesh lost two early wickets but had a crucial 169-run partnership between Shakib Al Hasan and Najmul Hossain Shanto. Mathews fired both of them, but it was too late. Bangladesh easily reached the target of 280 runs with three wickets in hand in 41.1 overs. Dilshan Madushanka was Sri Lanka's top bowler with three wickets while Maheesh Theekshana and Angelo Mathews took two wickets each.

Pitch Report

The average first innings score in the last five games in Bengaluru was 320 runs. The batters are expected to dominate in this game and potentially put a significant amount on the board. The team that wins the toss may try to beat and dominate from the start.

Toss Prediction

Two of the three games in Bengaluru were won by the team that came first in the competition. However, with rain forecast for the second half of the game, we expect both teams to elected to field first if they win the toss.

Weather Report

Humid conditions are forecast for this game on Thursday and there is a high chance of thunderstorms disrupting play. The temperature will be around 20°C throughout the game.

Head to Head

New Zealand have won nine of their last 10 completed ODIs against Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankans have not beaten the Kiwis in this format of the international game since 2015. Overall, New Zealand have beaten Sri Lanka 51 times in ODI cricket - and Sri Lanka have beaten New Zealand 41 times.

Venue Details

The average first bat score at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is 265. In the last match played here, New Zealand posted a massive score of 401-6 after batting first against Pakistan here. Earlier in the tournament, Australia had also scored 367 against Pakistan at this venue. So this is without a doubt a high-scoring venue and another game with lots of fours and sixes is on the cards. If the team batting first manages the full 50 overs, they should be aiming for around 350 in total.

Match Prediction


Having scored 401 in their last game before losing to DLS, New Zealand come into this game having found some form and we expect them to be too strong for Sri Lanka with both bat and ball becomes. In Delhi, Sri Lanka showed a lot of character to stay in the game after Mathews' dismissal and fought brilliantly with the ball, but in the end they were not good enough to beat a weak Bangladesh side. Our prediction is that New Zealand will win this game and qualify for the semi-finals.

New Zealand beats Sri Lanka.

Betting Tips

New Zealand have lost their last four ODIs. Sri Lanka have lost their last three ODIs. Neither team has any momentum. One of them can find some here. It will likely be New Zealand that has a penchant for success in major tournaments when it matters most. The Black Caps are considered 1.25 favorites against 4.33 underdogs Sri Lanka to win this game

Top Fantasy Picks Dream11 Prediction
New Zealand Key Players

Kane Williamson - The skipper returned from injury in the last game and hit 95 runs off 79 balls, adding to the 78 runs he scored against Bangladesh in his only previous tournament appearance.

Rachin Ravindra - Only Quinton de Kock and Virat Kohli have scored more runs than the young all-rounder at the Cricket World Cup 2023, who has already completed 500 runs in the competition.

Tim Southee – The right-arm fast medium bowler also recovered from an injury during the tournament but has taken at least one wicket in both appearances so far.

Trent Boult - The left-arm pace bowler went wicketless in the DLS loss to Pakistan at this venue but bowled just six overs before the rain began. In the humid conditions it gets movement through the air.

Sri Lanka Key Players

Pathum Nissanka - The right-handed opener is one of only two Sri Lankan players to score over 300 runs throughout the tournament and he timed the ball very well throughout.

Charith Asalanka – The left-hander hit six fours and five sixes in his 108 runs off 105 balls in Match 38. He comes into this game with an ODI average of 40.84.Dilshan Madushanka – The 23-year-old pace bowler was one of the standout players of the competition, dismissing Tanzid Hasan, Litton Das and Mushfiqur Rahim against Bangladesh.

Angelo Mathews – The veteran batting all-rounder became the first international player to have a layoff in the last game. But he responded with 2/35 with the ball and will be keen to contribute with the bat on Thursday.
