South Africa vs Australia Live Score, SA vs AUS World Cup 2nd Semi-Final 2023: Zampa messes up the fourth ball completely, full toss and Miller smashes that over mid-wicket.

South Africa vs Australia Live Score, SA vs AUS World Cup 2nd Semi-Final 2023: A tight run and a direct hit would have sent Klaasen back! Second ball of the 29th from Zampa, Klaasen plays it towards extra cover. Steve Smith picks up the ball and has a shy at the non-striker's end. He misses the stumps, Klaasen collides with Zampa and it seems a part of his helmet jammed into the bridge of his nose. Physios come out, tend to him and he is ready to go. Miller is on 41 off 60, Klaasen on 37 off 40.

Miller on 36 off 55.

SA vs AUS Live Score: South Africa 95/4 in 27 overs
