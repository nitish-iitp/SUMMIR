SA vs AUS, World Cup 2023 Semi-final: Team news

South Africa have had a settled best XI for the majority of the tournament, with Reeza Hendricks and Andile Phehlukwayo stepping in when injury has demanded. Phehlukwayo came in for Marco Jansen in South Africa’s final group game of the competition, but Jansen is expected to be back and fit for the semi-final. Hendricks came in against England and Bangladesh, both times for Bavuma, but is not expected to appear in their XI in Kolkata.

The biggest selection dilemma South Africa have is over the balance of their bowling attack. With the Eden Gardens deck expected to turn, Tabraiz Shamsi is likely to come into the side as he did against Australia, Pakistan and India. He took seven wickets across those three matches. South Africa’s questions centre around which fast bowler will miss out to allow him back in. It will almost certainly be one of Gerald Coetzee and Lungi Ngidi, the former having impressed in his debut tournament and the latter faltered slightly.

Australia also have some selections decisions to make ahead of the clash. Glenn Maxwell missed Australia’s final group game against Bangladesh, but Pat Cummins has revealed he will be ready to go for the semi-final. One of Marnus Labuschagne of Marcus Stoinis will likely miss-out, with Labuschagne probably getting the nod.

South Africa vs Australia: Predicted XIs

South Africa: Temba Bavuma (c), Quinton de Kock (wk), Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Gerald Coetzee, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi.

Australia: David Warner, Travis Head, Mitchell Marsh, Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Glenn Maxwell, Josh Inglis (wk), Pat Cummins (c), Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood.

Match prediction: Who will win today’s SA vs AUS match?

This could be one of the closest-fought games in the competition, with little to choose between the two sides. Both have explosive power in their ranks with the bat, but Australia’s bowling line-up looks the slightly stronger of the two. The toss will be key, with South Africa having struggled chasing in the competition. Spin will also undoubtedly come into play, with Zampa currently the leading spinner of the tournament. It’s very tight, but Australia just go in as favourites.
