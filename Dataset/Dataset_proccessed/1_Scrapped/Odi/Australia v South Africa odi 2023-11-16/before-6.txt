South Africa will be up against Australia in the second semi-final of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 on Thursday, November 16 at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, India.

The South African cricket team concluded their campaign in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 by securing the second spot in the league table with 14 points from nine matches. They notched up seven victories and faced two losses. The Proteas' run to the semi-finals has been powered by Quinton de Kock, who is the team's leading run-scorer. Captain Temba Bavuma commands a potent bowling line-up, featuring pacers Gerald Coetzee, Kagiso Rabada and spinner Kesha Maharaj.

On the other hand, Australia made the semi-finals with a third-place finish in the league table with 14 points. They won seven matches and lost two in nine encounters. The five-time champions will rely on the explosive batting prowess of David Warner while banking on spinner Adam Zampa to shine with the ball.
