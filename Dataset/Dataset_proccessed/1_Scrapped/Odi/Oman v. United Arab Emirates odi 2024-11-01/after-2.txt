Oman Form

Aqib Ilyas' team has been under a lot of pressure to maintain a steady performance throughout the tournament. They have slipped down to 6th place on the points table after winning only two out of eight games. Their opponents, too, are under pressure.

Ilyas would look toward his batsmen to click in the upcoming match, not having played so well to date. In the two years Kashyap Prajapati has got some decent performance and looking for a proper start that can set him and his fellow player Jatinder Singh off for a healthy total. He needs middle-order lead along with players like Zeeshan Maqsood and Shoaib Khan. The team also expects big contributions from Ayaan Khan and Pratik Athavale for the pressure overs.

A strong batting lineup will see early strikes crucial for the team, and Kaleemullah, Shakeel Ahmed will do the job by getting crucial wickets for the side. Fayyaz Butt and Zeeshan Maqsood are anticipated to continue tightening the strings in the middle overs for Oman.

United Arab Emirates Form

Muhammad Waseem is disappointed with his team's performance this year as they have faced difficulties in securing victories, especially against lower-ranked teams. Their success in the tournament has been limited to only one win, placing them at the bottom of the points table. Waseem looks quite keen to set an example first and then let his team follow and then go successful. Aryansh Sharma and Alishan Sharafu look not capable enough to bring anything worthy in the field to reduce the pressure from their respective shoulders. Waseem is seeing hope in Vishnu Sukumaran and Asif Khan to produce things with the bat from the middle order. Big batsmen Basil Hameed, Rahul Chopra, and Ali Naseer are doing their job for their respective side. The bowling department has struggled in getting wickets up the order. Junaid Siddique and Omid Rahman will have to come and get them the early wickets. Basil Hameed is going to play a key role with experience in middle overs and is supported by Ali Naseer. Muhammad Farooq and Vishnu Sukumaran will also do great support for the side.

Oman vs United Arab Emirates Expert Tips & Prediction

United Arab Emirates will be under immense pressure in the next match as their top order batsmen have not performed well so far in the tournament. They will need strong performance from their top and middle order batsmen. Oman has an excellent bowling side and is playing at their home ground. We would expect a tough contest, but Oman should win this match.
