The dynamic captain and left-handed batter, Charith Asalanka, will continue to lead the Sri Lankan side in the white-ball format. Avishka Fernando and Pathum Nissanka are ready to bolster Sri Lanka’s top order, while Kusal Mendis and Kamindu Mendis will add firepower in the middle order.

They will be assisted by the right-handed batter, Nishan Madushka. With the presence of the spin sensations Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana, Sri Lanka’s spin attack looks lethal. On the other hand, young left-arm finger spinner Dunith Wellalage will be eager to make his mark.

Dilshan Madushanka, Chamidu Wickramasinghe, and Mohamed Shiraz will lead Sri Lanka’s pace department in the upcoming three-match ODI series against the West Indies at home. The Islanders last played an ODI series against India and scripted history by winning the home series 2-0.

Sri Lanka squad for West Indies ODIs:

Charith Asalanka (C), Avishka Fernando, Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis, Kamindu Mendis, Janith Liyanage, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Nishan Madushka, Dunith Wellalage, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Jeffrey Vandersay, Chamidu Wickramasinghe, Asitha Fernando, Dilshan Madushanka, Mohamed Shiraz.

Meanwhile, Kusal Mendis led Sri Lanka to a historic first-ever T20I series victory over the West Indies with an emphatic nine-wicket win in the third and final match on October 17. Chasing a target of 163, Sri Lanka comfortably sealed the game with 12 balls to spare at Dambulla.

Kusal Mendis' heroics lead Sri Lanka to a historic T20I series win over the West Indies

Mendis played an unbeaten knock of 68 runs from 48 balls, hitting five boundaries and three sixes. Opening with Pathum Nissanka, Mendis gave Sri Lanka a flying start, as they added 60 runs in just over five overs. Nissanka’s quickfire 39 from 22 balls, studded with seven fours and a six, set the tone before he was dismissed by Gudakesh Motie in the final T20I.

After Nissanka’s wicket, Mendis was joined by Kusal Perera, who was battling cramps and played a solid unbeaten knock of 55 from 36 balls. Mendis and Perera stitched an unbroken 106-run partnership that sealed Sri Lanka's remarkable series win over the higher-ranked West Indies.

Earlier, the West Indies struggled after opting to bat, collapsing to 68/5 against the hosts. However, Rovman Powell and Gudakesh Motie’s 54-run stand gave the West Indies a fighting chance, but it wasn’t enough, as they could post only 162/8 on the board at Dambulla.

Sri Lanka’s spin attack, led by Maheesh Theekshana and Hasaranga, once again played a key role, each claiming two wickets to play a significant role in the team’s win.
