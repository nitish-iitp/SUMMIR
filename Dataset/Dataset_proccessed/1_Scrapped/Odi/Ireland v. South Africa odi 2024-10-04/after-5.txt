IRE vs SA Commentary
6:49 PM IST Right then, that's it from the coverage of this game. South Africa have taken an unassailable lead in this series. These two teams will meet again for the third and final ODI of this series on 7th October. The first ball will be at 11.30 am GMT, but as you all know you can join us early for the build-up. Until then, take care and goodbye.
6:48 PM IST Temba Bavuma, the winning skipper is in for a chat. He stats by saying that it is a mild discomfort, suggesting a possible aggravation of a previous elbow injury. The extent of the injury will be determined in the coming days. For now, he is relying on medical advice. The team's strategy was to navigate the first 10 overs carefully, given the swinging ball. States that Stubbsy and Kyle Verreynne formed a valuable partnership in the middle order, which helped the team to finish strongly. This performance marked a significant improvement from their first game. Ends by saying that the team's goal is to expand the depth of their playing pool, and the recent performances and opportunities have provided a chance to do so.
6:41 PM IST Paul Stirling, captain of Ireland is in for a chat. He starts by saying that it was a challenging day for the team, as they struggled to take wickets during the middle overs and couldn’t make any early breakthroughs, making the task even more difficult. The team’s approach hasn’t changed much; they aimed to navigate through the new ball, which once again moved around, but couldn’t manage it effectively. Chasing a total like 340 requires partnerships and big scores, as demonstrated by South Africa. It wasn’t about attacking from the start, but they needed to push beyond the 10s and 20s and build bigger innings, something they couldn’t accomplish.
6:38 PM IST Tristan Stubbs wins the Player of the Match award for his outstanding knock. He starts by saying that in the first game, both he and Rickelton got out in quick succession, and today he was determined not to let that happen again. That was his main focus. He acknowledged that the opposition bowled well, forcing them to play towards the bigger side of the ground, but he and his partner managed to rotate the strike effectively, which helped them secure the runs.
6:38 PM IST Stay tuned for the presentation....
6:37 PM IST Earlier in the innings, South Africa got off to a solid start, the opening duo set the tone really well for them. Although, they lost both their openers in a jiffy. Although, whichever batter came out, contributed well and kept the scoreboard ticking. Tristan Stubbs is particular was inspirational with the ball in hand.
