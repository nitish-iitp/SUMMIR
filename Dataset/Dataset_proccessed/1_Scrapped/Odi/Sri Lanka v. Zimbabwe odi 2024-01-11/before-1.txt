Thread title is pretty explanatory.

Have a P320 Spectre Comp and want to mount an Acro-P2. Various plates available. Any idea what the best option is?

I tried duct tape. RTZ sucks. 1/5 stars. Do not recommend.

Danke!

P/N 112-011 because that one is what fits any sig that came with a Romeo1 PRO and the Specter Comp takes a Romeo1 PRO.

Mea Culpa, @TheHorta

Step one, sell the Sig. Step two buy any number of pistols that are better then the Sig.

Don't get CHPWS. There is a thread here.

CHPWS RMR plates are JUNK and their customer service is just as bad
I purchased two of their Sig M17/M18 plates and attempted to install them today. The first issues was the rear sight which they sell and supplied and the plate is supposed to be cut for. The angle of the dovetails are significantly different. I've installed hundreds of sight sets and I fit...

The Tango Down plate I used for my Glock 45 MOS to mount the ACRO has been solid. No issues and I am pretty sure it's steel. I can't help you on the 320. I have an SRO mounted on my comped 320 with the Sig slide being cut for RMR or their optics.

I used the SSM-01LE plate for my spectre comp slide and Acro P2. Worked well. I bought the regular plate from Tango Down but it was the wrong one and didn’t fit. I guess the Spectre Comp slides are closer to the pro version for LE.
