Canada form

Kirton had a troubled time at number 5, scoring just 1 off 4 balls. While the GT20 Canada served the Canadian bowlers well, the batters did little to leave an impact throughout the game. Joining Kirton on the sorry score was Aaron Johnson at the top order, with 1 off 7 balls. Harsh Thaker contributed 35 off 75 and Shreyas Movva scored 65 off 90 to bail Canada out into the decent score. Obviously, both teams had difficulties in high strike rates off a pitch that was challenging all along, making cases for patience and partnership-building. Johnson and Kirton will have to regroup their composure quickly as key batters for Canada. Other batters like Dilpreet Bajwa and Aaditya Varadrajan can bring in valuable contributions. As far as bowling is concerned, Kalim Sana, Saad Bin Zafar, and Dillon Heyliger are key wicket-takers for Canada, with some promising performances coming in the last match.

Canada Predicted Playing XI

Aaron Johnson, Dilpreet Bajwa, Harsh Thaker, Nicholas Kirton (c), Shreyas Movva (wk), Saad Bin Zafar, Kaleem Sana, Jeremy Gordon, Junaid Siddiqui, Aaditya Varadarajan, Dillon Heyliger

United States of America form

In the absence of Sushant Modani, USA are expected to go in with a new opening duo of Steven Taylor and Saiteja Mukkamala, with skipper Monank Patel slated to bat at number 3. All three of these players will have big roles to play as was shown in the previous match where Netherlands' top order paved the way for a successful run-chase. The key to a good score on this pitch would be to build partnerships, and Steven Taylor along with Monank Patel and Aaron Jones will be the key players in achieving the same.

USA lost their last match in the 2023 World Cup Qualifier against UAE by 1 run while chasing a target of 309 runs. USA had fine middle order contributions from Aaron Jones 75 and Gajanand Singh 69. Patel should believe in this middle order to post a fighting total on the board in case they bat first. Having learned from the mistake of Canada batting first in the last game in this venue, USA would want to field first to win this match. They have not played an ODI game for a year now, and with a great bowling attack of the opposition, things might not go as planned.

In the absence of Saurabh Netravalkar or Ali Khan from this series, Jasdeep Singh, Nostush Kenjige, and Harmeet Singh are the key bowlers for USA. The team has to adapt quickly to the conditions and make good use of the opportunity of bowling first in this match.

Predicted Lineup: United States of America

Steven Taylor, Saiteja Mukkamala, Monank Patel (c, wk), Aaron Jones, Shayan Jahangir, Abhishek Paradkar, Harmeet Singh, Jasdeep Singh, Nostush Kengije, Yasir Mohammad, Shadley van Schalkwyk

Canada vs United States of America Expert Tips

Canada batted well in the last game and falls four runs short of the victory. Canada has been playing continuously, but the USA has not played for a while and have some of their core players not playing. Both have talent in batting, but the hard conditions of the pitch can be the gain for the bowlers. Canada has a great bowling attack, so usually, it should get the upper hand and take away the forthcoming match.
