{GS1 – Geo – HG} Tribal Communities in Mizoram
Context (TH): Mizoram’s ongoing efforts to amend its reservation rules are now uncertain due to the Supreme Court ruling which upheld the right of states to sub-classify SCs and STs.
Months before the judgement, the Mizoram Government had put on hold the sub-classification of the State’s ST quota in higher education and started working on amending the rule that provided for it.
Nearly 95% of Mizoram are STs, the highest percentage in India (2011 census).
They comprises of Zo-ethnic tribes such as Mizo (Lushai), Hmar, Pawi, Lai, Mara, Gangte and non-Zo-ethnic people such as Chakma tribes.
Tribal festivals in Mizoram includes Mim Kut, Pawl Kut and Chapchar Kut.
Zo-ethnic people: An indigenous community along the frontier of India and Burma, having cultural similarities and a common ancestor called Zo.

{GS1 – Geo – PG – Geomorphology} Megaquake
Context (IE): Japan to issue its first-ever megaquake advisory after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake recently struck near the Nankai Trough.
A megaquake is a large earthquake with a magnitude of 8 or more and occurs in subduction zones (where tectonic plates collide, and one plate is forced under another).
It is capable of producing intense shaking and massive tsunamis.
Scientists can forecast times of heightened risk but cannot predict exact times of occurrence as there is no equipment.
Nankai Trough
The Nankai Trough is an underwater subduction zone off Japan’s southwest Pacific coast.
It stretches from Shizuoka, just west of Tokyo, to the southern tip of Kyushu Island.

Source: BBC

It is nearly 900 km long where the Eurasian Plate forces the Philippine Sea Plate into the mantle.
This zone has experienced destructive megaquakes, roughly every 100 to 150 years, often in pairs.
The most recent Nankai Trough megaquakes occurred as twin events in 1944 and 1946.

{GS2 – Governance – Issues} Extending PMLA to Political Parties **
Context (TH): Recent Supreme Court observations have questioned the applicability of laws like the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to political parties and the criminal responsibility of individual ministers for collective cabinet decisions.
The court’s suggestion to include the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as an accused under PMLA is unusual and could impact how political parties are treated under this law.
PMLA and Political Parties
Section 70 of PMLA: This section targets offences by companies, defining a “company” as any body corporate, firm, or association of individuals.
Political Party Definition: According to the RPA Act, a political party is an association of people who identify as such. The PMLA’s definition doesn’t fit political parties.
Judicial Interpretation:
Ejusdem Generis Rule: “Association of individuals” in PMLA refers to entities similar to firms or corporations, not political parties (State of Maharashtra v. Lalit Kumar Jain (2020)).
Political parties mainly engage in public mobilization and governance, not business transactions.
Criminal Liability of Individual Ministers
Collective Decision-Making: Article 75 (3) provides that “The Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the House of the People.
Judicial Precedent: Article 363 provides that “The validity of any law relating to any matter which falls within the scope of Article 363 shall not be called in question in any court.“
Challenges
Ambiguity in Legal Definitions: The legal definition in Section 70 of the PMLA is unclear regarding political parties, leading to potential legal confusion.
Impact on Political Stability: Criminalizing political parties could destabilize the political system and undermine democratic governance.
Conflicting Constitutional Principles: Holding individual ministers accountable for collective cabinet decisions conflicts with the principle of collective responsibility.
Risk of Political Manipulation: There is a risk of using legal provisions against political parties as a tool for political retribution rather than justice.
Challenges in Enforcement: Effective enforcement of laws against political parties and individuals is complex and could be hindered by bureaucratic inefficiencies.
Way Forward
Legal Clarifications and Amendments: Amend Section 70 of the PMLA to clearly define the applicability to political parties or explicitly exclude them.
Establishment of Independent Oversight: Create an independent body to oversee and review cases involving political parties to ensure impartiality. For Example, The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) provides a model for independent oversight of financial regulations.
Reaffirming Constitutional Principles: Reinforce the principle of collective cabinet responsibility while ensuring individual accountability for actions outside the scope of collective decisions. For Example, The UK’s adherence to collective ministerial responsibility while holding individuals accountable for personal misconduct can serve as a model.
Preventing Political Manipulation: Implement safeguards to ensure legal actions against political parties are based on objective criteria and not influenced by political motives.
Improving Enforcement Mechanisms: To effectively handle cases involving political entities. The establishment of specialized anti-corruption courts in India to expedite and handle corruption cases can serve as a model for effective enforcement.
{GS2 – Social Sector – Health – Issues} Dangers of Irrational Antibiotic Use on the Microbiome
Context (TH): Antibiotic overuse has serious consequences, particularly on the human microbiome.
While Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is widely recognized, the disruption of the microbiome is an overlooked threat.
The microbiome contains many microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses.
Gut microbiome: Vital for digestion, immune support and nutrient production.
Skin microbiome: Protects against harmful microorganisms and supports skin health.
Respiratory tract microbiome: Defends against respiratory infections.
Genitourinary microbiome: Maintains urinary and reproductive health.
Impact of Antibiotics on the Microbiome
Dysbiosis: It is the imbalance caused by irrational antibiotic use that wipes out a significant portion of gut bacteria which causes Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).
Compromised Colonization Resistance weakens immune function, increasing susceptibility to infections and autoimmune diseases.
Disruption of Gut-Organ Interactions which affects mood, cognition, and mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. It can also worsen skin conditions like acne, eczema, and psoriasis.
Impaired metabolism contributes to obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.
Way Forward
Raising Public Awareness: The UK’s “Keep Antibiotics Working” campaign effectively reduced unnecessary prescriptions by educating the public on the dangers of antibiotic misuse.
Strengthening Regulatory Frameworks:
In 2019, India banned the use of colistin, a last-resort antibiotic, in animal feed and food production due to rising concerns over antimicrobial resistance.
Denmark’s strict regulations on antibiotic use in agriculture, including banning antibiotics as growth promoters, significantly decreased antibiotic use.
Advancing Scientific Research: Georgia has pioneered bacteriophage therapy, showing promising results in treating antibiotic-resistant infections where traditional antibiotics have failed.
Encouraging Global Collaboration: The Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP) facilitates international efforts to develop new antibiotics, particularly focusing on making these treatments accessible in low-income countries.

{GS2 – Vulnerable Sections – Women} Gender-Based Violence in India **
Context (TH): While 642 million voters, over half are female, participate in the election, very few candidates address women’s safety issues, revealing a stark dichotomy.
Current Situation
There are 90 rape cases reported daily, nearly 50% of women face domestic violence, and two third of dalit women experience sexual violence.
77% of women remain silent on violence against them and only 1% of women pursue divorce.
39% of officers believe complaints of gender-based violence are baseless.
Challenges
Institutional violence: Exacerbates the trauma faced by survivors, starting even before the reporting process.
Barriers in Rural Areas: Male and upper-caste-dominated panchayats create obstacles for women seeking justice.
Backlog of Cases: India has a backlog of 40 million court cases, disproportionately affecting survivors.
Ineffective Implementation: Strong domestic violence laws exist but implementation has failed due to outdated processes and inept officials (brutal police system, a lengthy judicial process).
Lack of Data: Insufficient data due to underreporting and silence hinder a comprehensive understanding and access to justice.
Way Forward
Adopt survivor-focused training for police and judicial officials, similar to the initiatives by organizations like Vanangna (a women’s rights collective in UP).
Reform justice institutions to be more trauma-informed and focused on healing.
Collect and share more data and stories publicly to understand the issue’s scale.
Develop national policies that prioritize the insights of survivors, particularly from marginalized communities, to create a fair and just system.
Update criminal law procedures with gender-sensitive training and evaluation measures.
Encourage voters and politicians to advocate for change, ensuring survivors can access justice without fear, similar to the successful national campaign for girls’ education.

{GS3 – Agri – Crops} Cotton Cultivation
Context (TH): India’s cotton cultivation is expected to be 10-12% lower in this season.
India leads globally in cotton production, followed by China and the U.S.
The Central Zone (Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh) dominates India’s cotton output.

Growing Conditions
Climate: It thrives in hot, sunny climates with long frost-free periods (210 days) and requires high temperatures, light rainfall or irrigation, and bright sunshine.
Soil Types: It grows well in the Deccan plateau’s black cotton soil, deep alluvial soils in northern India, black clayey soils in central regions, and mixed black and red soils in the southern zone.
Sensitivity: While cotton can tolerate some salinity, it is highly vulnerable to waterlogging.
Growth Cycle: As a Kharif crop, cotton requires 6 to 8 months to mature.
Challenges in India’s Cotton Sector
Impact of Pink Bollworm Pest: The Pink Bollworm pest has severely reduced cotton yields, especially in Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan (35% reduction).
Unpredictable Cotton Yields: Cotton yields are unpredictable due to limited irrigation, declining soil fertility, and erratic weather, including unexpected droughts and excessive rainfall.
Traditional Farming Methods: Most cotton is cultivated by small-scale farmers using traditional methods with limited access to modern technologies, affecting productivity.
Market Access Issues: Many farmers struggle to access markets, often selling their cotton at lower prices to intermediaries.
Rain-Fed Cultivation: 67% of India’s cotton is rain-fed, with only 33% grown in irrigated areas.
Low Yield: India’s average yield is 480 kg/hectare, far below the global average of 800 kg/hectare.
Government Initiatives
Cotton Development Programme: Under the National Food Security Mission (NFSM), boosts cotton production in 15 key states, led by the Department of Agriculture since 2014-15.
Cotton Corporation of India (CCI): Established in 1970, stabilizes prices through support measures when market rates fall below set levels.
MSP Formula: Ensures MSP at 1.5 times the production cost to protect farmers.
Textile Advisory Group (TAG): Coordinates among stakeholders to address productivity, pricing, and branding in the cotton value chain.
Cott-Ally Mobile App: Provides farmers with MSP rates and procurement center information in a user-friendly platform.
Committee on Cotton Promotion and Consumption (COCPC): Ensures a steady cotton supply to the textile industry, supporting growth.
Way Forward
Combine natural controls, trap crops, and beneficial insects to manage pests effectively.
Initiatives like Kasturi Cotton Bharat can create a unique identity for Indian cotton in the global market.
Utilize schemes like Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (TUFS) and Mega Textile Parks (MITRA) to modernize ginning, spinning, and weaving facilities, boosting efficiency and competitiveness.
The revised MSP formula, set at 1.5 times the production cost, ensures fair returns for farmers; further refinements based on NITI Aayog recommendations can enhance income security.
A robust procurement system, price stabilization funds, and standardized cotton grading mechanisms can help far mers secure better prices and reduce middlemen exploitation.
{GS3 – Agri – Crops} High Yield Crops *

{GS3 – Agri – Crops} Palm Oil Industry **
Context (DTE): The palm oil industry generates 4 tonnes of dry biomass and 3.5 tonnes of effluent per tonne of crude oil as waste, which holds incredible potential for renewable bioenergy,
Palm oil comes from the fruit of the oil palm tree (Elaeis guineensis).
It contains beta-carotene, saturated and unsaturated fats, and vitamin E.
It is used for preventing and treating vitamin A deficiency.
Growing Conditions of Oil Palm
Climate: It requires at least 5 hours of sunlight daily with mean maximum temperatures of 30-32°C. It tolerates 2-4 months of dry spells but needs well-distributed rainfall of 200 cm annually.
Soil Types: Best suited for moist, well-drained, deep loamy alluvial soils rich in organic matter with a minimum soil depth of one meter.
Sensitivity: It can handle occasional waterlogging and prefers well-drained soil for optimal growth.
Issues with Utilizing Palm Biomass for Bioenergy
Higher Impurities: It has more ash and moisture than woody biomass, affecting combustion efficiency.
Pre-treatment Needs: Innovations in pre-treatment technologies are required to improve palm biomass for boiler fuels.
Advanced Technologies: Pyrolysis and gasification can enhance energy recovery, but are still under research.
Logistics Complexity in biomass collection, storage, transportation, and traceability due to costs. The transportation of mill effluents also poses challenge.
Grid Connection: Connecting biogas plants to the national grid depends on distance, local demand, and feed-in tariff availability.
Sustainability Focus
Palm oil is highly efficient, producing 4 to 10 times more oil per hectare than other vegetable oils, thus requiring less land.
The industry now faces criticism for deforestation, but complying with the EU Deforestation Regulation (prevents deforestation-linked products from entering the market) will improve its environmental impact.
Genetic advancements are enhancing oil palm trees’ stress tolerance and doubling oil yield, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Government efforts like the Malaysian government’s (Green Income Tax Exemption, Green Technology Financing Scheme ) reflect efforts to minimize its environmental footprint.
Adopting new technologies and sustainable practices allows the industry to meet global demand while contributing to global decarbonization efforts, showing it can be part of the solution.
Indonesia is the largest producer of palm oil followed by Malaysia.
India is the world’s second-largest consumer and largest importer of palm oil, which makes up 40% of its vegetable oil consumption.
Major Crude Palm Oil Producing States: Andra Pradesh>Telengana>Kerala>Karnataka
Oil Palm is not covered under One District One Programme (ODOP).

{Prelims – In News} Diamond Imprest Licence
Context (TH): Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal reintroduces the Diamond Imprest Licence for the import of cut and polished diamonds including semi processed diamonds and half-cut diamonds.
Diamond Imprest Licence ensures that Indian diamond exporters above a certain export turnover threshold will be allowed to import at least 5 per cent of the average export turnover of preceding three years.
The holder of the licence must achieve a minimum value addition of 10%.
It will provide a level-playing field for MSMEs by stopping the flight of investment of Indian diamantaires to diamond mining destinations.
It increases the import through official channels and generate more jobs.
Kimberley Process
The Kimberley process is an international certification scheme established in 2003 to regulate the trade of conflict diamonds (rough diamonds used to finance wars against governments).
The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) is the core part of this regime which facilitates the States to implement safeguards for certifying shipments of rough diamonds as “conflict-free.”
There are 59 participants (58 countries and the European Union), including India.
Along with governments, civil society groups, the diamond industry and the World Diamond Council are also integral parts of the Kimberley Process.
{Prelims – In News} Tungabhadra River
Context (TH): Karnataka issued a flood warning after a crest gate of the Tungabhadra reservoir (Pampa Sagar dam) got washed away. Remaining gates are opened to reduce the pressure on the broken gate.

Tungabhadra is a tributary of Krishna river that flows through Hampi, the capital of Vijayanagara Empire.
It is formed by the unification of the Tunga and the Bhadra originating from Gangamula in the Central Sahyadri (Western Ghats).
Tributaries: Bhadra, Haridra, Vedavati, Tunga, Varda and Kumdavathi.
The famous Virupaksha temple is on the banks of Tungabhadra.
Tungabhdra Dam (Pampa Sagar Dam)
The construction of the dam began in 1949 as a joint venture between the Kingdom of Hyderabad and the Madras Presidency.
It was completed in 1953 to contribute to the irrigation of 6 chronically drought prone districts of Bellary, Koppal and Raichur in Karnataka and Anantapur, Cuddapah and Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh.
{Prelims – PIN World – Asia} Saint Martin Island *
Context (ET): Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has made an accusation against USA for attempting to overthrow her over her refusal to cede control of Saint Martin island.
Saint Martin Island is the sole coral reef island of Bangladesh and lies in the southernmost part of Bangladesh. It is also known as “Narikel Zinzira” (Coconut island) or “Daruchini Dwip” (Cinnamon island).
It was originally a part of the Teknaf peninsula but was separated due to the submergence of a portion of the peninsula.

{Prelims – S&T – Space} Perseid meteor shower
Context (TH): The Perseid meteor shower to brighten night sky, especially in the northern hemisphere.
Perseid meteors are debris left behind by the comet Swift-Tuttle that rains down over the Earth from space at a particular time of year.
They appear to come from between the constellations of Camelopardalis and Persus, from which they get their name. During its peak, they can produce more than 60 meteors per hour.
When the debris fragments hit Earth’s atmosphere, the air in front of them becomes compressed, generating heat and causing the fragments to burn up, resulting in bright streaks across the sky.
