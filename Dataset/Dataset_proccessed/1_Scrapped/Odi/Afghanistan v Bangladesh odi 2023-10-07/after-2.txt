Bangladesh vs Afghanistan Live Score: A look at their 2015 World Cup tie

The two met in the seventh match of Pool A in Canberra in the 2015 World Cup. Opting to bat first, Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim sitched a century stand while both notched up their respective fifties to power Bangladesh to 267 run in 50 overs. This was followed by a clinical show from the fast bowlers, led by Mashrafe Mortaza, as the three (Rubel Hossain and Taskin Ahmed) picked five wickets between themselves to fold Afghanistan for just 162 runs in 42.5 overs. Samiullah Shinwari and Mohammad Nabi were Afghanistan's stand out batters with their 40 odd scores, but it was never enough.

Bangladesh vs Afghanistan Live Score: Bangladesh, watch out for...!

Do you really need the names? Well, it's the usual suspects - the spin combination in Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Rashid Khan and Mohammad Nabi. The trio have picked 31 wickets in the nine innings they have played together against Bangladesh where the opposition batters have managed to score barely four runs an over.

Bangladesh vs Afghanistan Live Score: All eyes on the Afghanistan openers

Since the start of 2022, Ibrahim Zadran and Rahmanullah Gurbaz have together smashed 771 runs in 17 innings with two century stands and as many fifties. Only two other opening pairs, among the World Cup participants, have recorded more runs than the Afghan combination. The two have also been Afghanistan's top run-scorers as well this season and hence will be raring to add to their impressive numbers, given the team's hot-and-cold batting show in 2023.

Bangladesh vs Afghanistan Live Score: Fazalhaq Farooqi, the key player for Afghanistan

The left-arm pacer has been solid in the powerplay, picking 18 wickets since the start of 2022 at an economy rate of 4.85 which could just add to Bangladesh's woes. Moreover, he has edge over Litton Das, whom he has dismissed twice in his career in 88 balls for 70 runs.

Bangladesh vs Afghanistan Live Score: Where will Mehidy Hasan Miraz bat for Bangladesh?

In a bid to counter Bangladesh's batting issue in the powerplay, where the team tends to start slow, Mehidy Hasan Miraz was promoted up the order to open for the side in Asia Cup and he scored an unbeaten 112 against Afghanistan in Lahore. So should he be opening? Bangladesh do have Tanzid Tamim who looked impressive in the two warm-up games as an opener scoring 45 against England and 84 against Sri Lanka. Mehidy, in fact, walked in at No, 3 against England to score 74 while he notched up an unbeaten 67 at No. 4 against Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, he has also batted as low as No. 7 and 8 this year for Bangladesh. Mehidy could prove to be the trump card in the game and how Shakib uses him as a batter could reflect on the result as well.

Bangladesh vs Afghanistan Live Score: Could Bangladesh also look at Mustafizur Rahman?

Given Afghanistan's weakness against left-arm pace, Bangladesh could go with Mustafizur in place of Hasan Mahmud. Like Shoriful, he too has picked 10 wickets in seven innings against the opposition and has en edge over batters in Rahmanullah Gurbaz (66 runs in 68 balls, 1 dismiss), Ibrahim Zadran (18 runs in 33 balls, 1 dismissal), Rahmat Shah (25 runs in 35 balls), Najibullah Zadran (36 runs in 36 balls).

Oct 7, 2023 8:03 AM IST
Bangladesh vs Afghanistan Live Score: Why Shoriful Islam could play a key role for Bangladesh?

Since August last year, Afghanistan have averaged only 12.31 against left-arm pace in ODI cricket, the least among all member-nations and 10 partcipants at the World Cup. Shoriful, left-arm medium fast, has picked 10 wickets in five innings against Afghanistan in his career, the most he has managed against an opposition. He has dismissed opener Ibrahim Zadran and skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi twice each and has an edge over Rahmat Shah (26 runs in 28 balls, 1 dismissal) and Gurbaz (20 runs in 49 balls, 1 dismissal) as well.

Bangladesh vs Afghanistan Live Score: Why Taskin Ahmed will be Bangladesh's key player in the XI

Afghanistan wicketkeeper-batter Rahmanullah Gurbaz has been in some fine form in ODI cricket over the last couple of months. Since 2022, he has scored 778 runs in 23 innings at 35 with four centuries and two fifties. 294 runs of his career total of 958 in ODIs have come against Bangladesh, the most he has scored against any opposition in the format, at 49 in 7 innings with two tons.

Taskin has managed to contain Gurbaz in their six encounters in the 50-over game - 28 runs in 59 balls with one dismissal. The right-arm pacer also has an edge over No. 3 batter Rahmat Shah, whom he has dismissed five times in 77 deliveries.

Bangladesh vs Afghanistan Live Score: What will the AFG playing XI look like?

It is rather an easy picking for the Afghanistan side for the match against Bangladesh. Nvaeen-ul-Haq, who will retire from ODIs at the end of this tournament, will form the pace attack alongside Fazalhaq Farooqi and all-rounder Azmatullah Omarzai while Rashid Khan, Mohammad Nabi and Mujeeb-Ur-Rahman will be the three spinners.

Afghanistan's likely XI: Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Ibrahim Zadran, Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi (c), Najibullah Zadran, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Azmatullah Omarzai, Mujeeb-Ur-Rahman, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Naveen-ul-Haq
