World Cup captains confident of success ahead of tournament opener

The 13th edition of the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup finally gets underway today, Thursday October 5, and the 10 captains that will lead their side into battle have contrasting thoughts as they prepare for the six-week tournament in India.

The 10 skippers, who will battle it out for the prestigious title over the next 48 days, gathered at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Wednesday for an interactive panel session alongside India great Ravi Shastri and England’s World Cup-winning skipper Eoin Morgan.

India skipper Rohit Sharma was confident that the tournament would be a massive success, given the great support that cricket enjoys in the country. He also stated that winning the World Cup was a childhood dream.

“I have said it from the start, you know, every leader sitting here wants to achieve something really special for their country. It is something that is very highly prized; the 50-Over World Cup is something that I have always dreamt of growing up as a child, and I am sure it is the same for all the guys sitting here as well," Rohit said.

“One thing I can assure, which I am pretty sure everyone knows, is that people are going to love this tournament here; the stadium is going to be jam-packed because people here in India love their cricket as much as they love their team, but they love their cricket as well. But rest assured, it’s going to be a great tournament.”

Pat Cummins, the captain of the five-time Cricket World Cup champions Australia, was enthusiastic about the much-awaited clash between India and Pakistan that is scheduled for 14 October in Ahmedabad.

“I don't think there are too many events around the world where you feel like half the world's tuning in to watch," he said.

"Whenever India play Pakistan in a World Cup, it seems like one of those moments.

“So, although you're personally not involved, you feel like you want to watch it and hear about all the commentary and the passion around the game. So, it's going to be great that it's at this stadium. You can have over 100,000 people.”

Pakistan captain Babar Azam loved the hospitable nature of his hosts, and was hoping that fans all across the world would enjoy the high standard of cricket expected at the tournament.

“We received good hospitality. We were not expecting this. But I think the way people responded to us, everyone enjoyed it. We are here for a week in Hyderabad, so we do not feel like we are in India; it was like we are at home," Babar noted.

“We enjoyed and had a lot of fun. It’s good, and I think it's a golden opportunity for everyone to give 100 percent and enjoy the tournament.”

Jos Buttler, captain of the defending champions England, said his team will continue to play the attacking cricket that helped them claim their first World Cup title at home in 2019.

“The team’s been mainly together for a long time since 2015, since the start of that sort of revolution that you mentioned, and I think you said right through the game. Now in England, young players coming through play a certain way and are determined to carry on the style, and I think we know it gives us the best chance of success," Buttler said.

“We will get it wrong at times, but we’ve made peace with that, and it’s something we want to continue to strive to do, to keep pushing the boundaries. Other teams will push you and move it on further, so we always want to try and be at the head of that curve as well.”

Hashmatullah Shahidi, leading Afghanistan in their third World Cup appearance, expected the crowds and conditions to support them.

“As said before, we will have more crowd and more support, we are expecting the same that the people will come there and support us in the stadium. And we have very good quality spinners and the condition is suitable for us, and that will be with us and also with the batting. I believe in this World Cup, we will give a statement about the batting. That we can do very good. Play very good cricket," he said.

Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan, was confident about his team’s prospects on the back of their performance in the ICC Men’s ODI Cricket World Cup Super League.

“I think we have prepared well. If we talk about the last four years since the 2019 World Cup, we are probably the third or fourth team in the qualifiers' point system. So, we have done really well as a group; now it's time for us to put on a good show. Our team is ready, and the country is expecting a little more than what we did previously.”

Netherlands captain Scott Edwards talked about an exciting contest that lay ahead for his team, not a stranger to causing upsets, against Pakistan in Hyderabad.

“I think all games in this tournament are going to be tricky. But obviously Pakistan's a very good side. But, yeah, for us, we're just excited to get this tournament going. That's against Pakistan in Hyderabad," Edwards said.

South Africa captain Temba Bavuma stated that very few sides carried the unique advantage of knowing India’s conditions well.

“I think that’s something that is relevant to all the teams. A lot of the teams have guys who played in India, have done well in India, so I wouldn’t really say it's an advantage for us. I think all we could do is for the guys who have that experience and knowledge; they can share it among the team or use it in terms of our strategies and plans. But I wouldn’t really say it's an advantage unique to us as a team," Bavuma said.

Despite leading an injury-riddled side, Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka was looking forward to making a statement at the World Cup.

“See, exciting times for us. We have been struggling a lot in the recent past with injuries, but at the same time, we have some good records with us. You know, as a group, we are looking forward to the World Cup. Everyone wants to make a statement that we are here to perform well in this tournament," Shanaka said.

New Zealand’s Kane Williamson, whose side made it to the World Cup finals on the last two occasions, believed that everyone started out fresh in the tournament. He added that the Black Caps would commit to the style that has suited them thus far.

“As you mentioned, you come to another event, and everybody certainly starts from the same position and starts again, and you go from tournament to tournament, teams change, opposition conditions," Williamson noted.

“For us, it's focusing on the style of cricket that we want to keep committing to, and that gives us the best chance of putting on our best performance. It's been nice to have some enjoyable times and certainly full of different challenges over a number of tournaments that we have been involved in, but we're really excited about the challenges that lie ahead for this one. And the difference is that it will bring, compared to other tournaments, a great occasion here in India. Sports is just loved by so many, and it's going to be so well supported as well. So, we're just looking forward to getting involved."

Manchester United ace rumored to be heading for Al-Nassr

Manchester United are unlikely to do big business in January and one high earner could be on his way out.

Ruben Amorim wanted an improved start to 2025 after five defeats in six Premier League games to end 2024.

This did not happen entirely as Sunday’s match saw United draw 2-2 with Liverpool.

That performance sparked some hope for United fans but Amorim will still need plenty of signings in 2025 to make real progress.

Amorim isn’t expecting a major January though and certainly needs players to leave in order to make new signings.

United will however also be looking to offload big earners this year and one player who fits the bill is Casemiro.

Casemiro joined United from Real Madrid in 2022 with the Brazilian arriving in a big-money move – both in terms of fee and wages.

Selling Casemiro this month is something football journalist Fabrizio Romano has claimed is on the cards – a move which could save United a whopping £350,000-a-week (about $440,000).

It is also a move which could prove lucrative for United, with Saudi Arabia appearing to be the likeliest move for Casemiro.
It is thought that United would sell Casemiro for around €30m ($52 million), which represents a huge loss on the €70m ($73 million) which was spent on the Brazilian back in 2022.

If United receive £25m, it would pay off a big chunk of one possible replacement.

Afghanistan triumphs in Test victory against Zimbabwe

Rashid Khan played a key role, claiming 7-66 and helping Afghanistan clinch the series

Afghanistan secured victory on Monday against Zimbabwe in their second test match, winning by 72 runs in just 15 balls at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo. 

Rashid Khan played a key role, claiming 7-66 and helping Afghanistan clinch the series. 

This marks Afghanistan's fourth test win since obtaining test status in 2017.

Zimbabwe was all out for 205 without adding to their overnight score, losing the final two wickets in a quick 13 minutes.

Richard Ngarava's run-out in the day's second over, due to confusion with skipper Craig Ervine, set the tone. 

Ervine fell in the next over, trapped leg before wicket by Rashid Khan's decisive leg-spin, culminating in figures of 7-66. 

Khan's performance on Sunday shifted momentum when Zimbabwe was poised for victory at 157-4, chasing 278.

The first test in Bulawayo ended in a draw, but Afghanistan's win secured their fourth test victory, two coming against Zimbabwe, since acquiring test status in 2017.

Three wickets in the last hour of play for Rashid Khan put Afghanistan on the cusp of victory in the second test against Zimbabwe at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo, with the home team still 73 runs shy of their target at the close of day four.

Zimbabwe were 205 for eight at stumps on Sunday, chasing 278 to win the series after the first test ended in a high scoring draw, Reuters reported.

Captain Craig Ervine (53 not out) and Richard Ngarava (3 not out) will resume on Monday after Afghanistan hauled themselves back into the contest when veteran Khan’s leg-break bowling put the brakes on the home team’s march.
