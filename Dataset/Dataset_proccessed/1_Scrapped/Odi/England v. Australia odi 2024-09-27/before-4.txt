Lancashire make hay on rain-lashed day
Tanya Aldred

Day one was a washout at five grounds, as the County Championship pulled on its bedsocks and rolled into the final week of the season. With the champions already crowned, Sussex up, and Kent down, just one promotion and one relegation spot remain to be played for.

At New Road, Lancashire threw themselves into the relegation dog fight with abandon, reducing Worcestershire to 22 for five under dirty slate skies. Matthew Waite and Logan van Beek then bashed 63 for the eighth wicket, hauling Worcestershire beyond three figures, before the rain returned. Tom Bailey, accurate as ever, finished with three for nine, and there were three wickets for Anderson Phillip.

Theoretically, Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire are both in danger of the drop, but rain washed out all but 15.2 overs at Trent Bridge – Notts finishing 33 for two.

A shell-shocked Somerset were winkled out for 136 at Taunton, before fighting back, on a day when seven batters fell for nought. Tom Kohler-Cadmore was the only Somerset man to pass 29, with 63, an innings that started with carefree abandon but retreated into desperate accumulation as the wickets fell about him, four of them to the unstoppable Liam Dawson, four to Kyle Abbott – who bowled Shoaib Bashir only for the ball to be deemed dead when a towel fell out of his pocket in his delivery stride. Hampshire then wobbled as Jack Leach took three wickets, he and Bashir bowling in tandem for the first time in a Championship match.

There was no play at Hove, much to the frustration of Middlesex, who need to make up a 15-point deficit to have a hope of promotion. A wet outfield prevented any play at Headingley, too, where Yorkshire need a maximum of 10 points to breathe easy.

And as James Vince, one of the most instantly recognisable county cricketers in whites, is caught in ungainly fashion off Leach’s first over, time for me to write up for the paper. Do chat on BTL before the nights fully draw in.

And curtains closed at Trent Bridge

Just 15.2 overs possible, with Notts finishing 33-2.

Some more permutation-musing from the ECB reporter, “Should Lancashire take only the three bowling points against Worcestershire but still go on to win it would leave Nottnghamshire having at least to draw to cheat the drop. If Lancashire do only manage 19 points, safety would be assured for Warwickshire.”

Gubbins the next in a succession of batsmen to have a bad day, caught by Abell off Gregory for five. Hampshire 13-2.

They've called it a day at New Road

No escape from the heavy post-tea downpours. Lancashire on top after reducing Worcs to 119-7, though that marks something of an escape from 22 for five.

Waite and van Beek added an unbroken 63 in seven overs for the eighth wicket, choosing the sword over the pen and the deadbat.

Could have been 0-2, were it not for Aldridge’s slipperly digits at second slip. Albert on 0. Gregory rubs the ball on his shirt and smiles as he walks back to his mark.

The lady in New Road weather house has gone in (or is it out?); but she’s come out at Trent Bridge, where Notts have resumed and are now 33-1.

Somerset have been bowled out for 136 at Taunton – let’s see what Hampshire can do. No Craig Overton for this match.

More big bat news

Worcestershire have been handed a suspended two-point deduction in the Blast for 2025 from an independent panel of the Cricket Discipline Commission. The deduction comes after Josh Cobb used a bat which failed a bat-gauge test during Worcestershire’s game against Durham on 5 July 2024. Cobb had not faced a delivery at the time the bat was tested.

The CDC Adjudicator originally imposed a two-point T20 points deduction for the 2025 season, but the decision was revised on appeal.

CDC interim director Dave Lewis said:

“We also note that this is the second oversized bat case this year, and the Cricket Regulator will be working with counties, players, and officials to inform them about the issue with a view to preventing a recurrence next season.”

Huge grey clouds billowing over New Road, as Anderson Phillip sprints in and Adam Hose postboxes him straight down the ground. Worcestershire have passed fifty.

At Taunton, Somerset have lost JAck Leach. Somerset 124-8. TKC still there on 52.

Hose is still there but George Balderson, who bowled so well at Old Trafford, now sends Brookes on his way. Worcs 39-6.

Five slips for Tom Bailey…

With six games abandoned for the day, and a delay at Trent Bridge, the only other action is at Taunton where TKC (38 not out) is hanging on but Somerset are 104-7, Dawson 3-17.

Play called off for the day at Chelmsford

After a healthy morning’s cricket for Essex (116-1), the rain spoils things. They’d done well to start on time after the groundstaff clocked in at 6.30am to pump 4,500 litres of water off the playing surface.

And lo, a fifth – a third wicket for the miserly pencil-slim Tom Bailey (3-1). Worcs 22-5.

The curtains close at Leicester too.

A nice snippet for Derbys fans from the ECB reporter:
”Mathematically, Derbyshire still have a chance to avoid collecting their 16th wooden spoon but Glamorgan need only to avoid defeat against Gloucestershire in Cardiff to make that impossible”
