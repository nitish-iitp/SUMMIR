England levelled the series to set up a thrilling decider with a 186-run thrashing of Australia in the fourth ODI of the five-match series at Lord’s.

Liam Livingstone struck a rapid 62 at the end of England’s innings after rain delayed the start of play, forcing a shortened 39-over match, although the hosts secured victory with overs to spare.

Ben Duckett got England off to a solid start with the bat, hitting 63 runs, with Harry Brook coming close to repeating his magnificent century at the Riverside on Tuesday, but falling just 13 runs short with 87.

Liam Livingstone’s impressive display of power hitting, with seven sixes and three fours as he put on 62 from just 27 lifted England to what proved to be a match-winning total of 312.

England bowled expertly, after dismissing the opening partnership of Mitchell Marsh and Travis Head, the wickets tumbled quickly, as the Australians collapsed from 68 without loss to 96 for six and were unable to recover.

It was Australia’s first time back at Lord’s since Alex Carey’s infamous stumping of Jonny Bairstow during the Ashes, which led to ugly scenes in the Long Room between MCC members and touring players, but other than boos for the wicketkeeper when he came out to bat, there was none of the animosity of that affair.

Hazlewood out for 0! England win by 186 runs

Can Rashid wrap things up this over? Starc adds runs to the total with an under edge adding two more to the total.

Starc adds another single with one over point. And that’s that, Hazlewood goes for a big hit and the ball just crashes into the stumps.

Wicket! Carey out for 13! Wicket! Zampa out for 0! Australia 122-9 (24) Starc 2, Hazlewood 0, Potts 4-38 (8) - need 191 runs to win

Potts goes up for an lbw, Carey is struck on the pad and England have sent this one upstairs! It’s three reds and Carey has to go!

Adam Zampa comes out to the middle, and he has five balls to face of this over.

The first ball is just defended straight up the pitch. Zampa has gone! He goes for one over the top and it’s just caught comfortably by Livingstone.

Hazlewood joins Starc out in the middle.

Australia 122-7 (23) Carey 13, Starc 2, Rashid 0-7 (3) - need 191 runs to win

Starc comes out to bat alongside Carey and gets off the mark with a flick to a low full toss out to the leg side.

No idea what the plan is here from the Australians, is there anything to gain from just batting out the overs?

Wicket! Abbott out for 10! Australia 119-7 (22) Carey 12, Potts 2-38 (7) - need 194 runs to win

Potts beats the edge again and Carey survives without the ball catching the outside edge on 11.

The dots are building up here...and Jacks fumbles what could have turned into a run out chance. A well-timed drive from Abbott is stopped by a dive from mid on from Liam Livingstone.

Abbott does fine the middle of the next one and it has landed just over the rope for six. He tries to go for another big one and is caught by a backpeddling Livingstone and has to depart for just 10.

Australia 112-6 (21) Carey 11, Abbott 4, Rashid 0-4 (2) - need 201 runs to win

Rashid goes for the googly to Abbott but he plays it off the bottom edge. Abbott digs out another one to the fielder and he’s just starting to look frustrated.

Australia are at a bit of a crossroads here, Abbott goes for a big swing, misses and the ball goes straight through to the keeper.

Australia 110-6 (19) Carey 10, Abbott 4, Potts 1-31 (6) - need 202 runs to win

Potts has come back on from the Pavilion End, and Australia are just tapping the ball around for singles without trying to take anything on.

Australia 105-6 (19) Carey 7, Abbott 3, Rashid 0-3 (1) - need 207 runs

After 18 overs of the second innings, England turn to spinner Adil Rashid for the first time.

The first ball is just turned away for a single, and there is an appeal for the stumping of Abbott, which the umpires have sent upstairs. His foot was just over the line and he has been handed a reprieve.

The weather outside has turned cold after the sunset and anyone who didn’t bring blankets might be wishing they had.

Australia 102-6 (18) Carey 6, Abbott 2, Archer 2-31 (7) - need 210 runs to win

Archer is into his seventh over, and has two wickets to show for it.

Abbott and Carey seem content to just add singles to the total. Archer continues to cause problems as one just goes straight off the toe of Carey’s bat and misses the wicket.

Australia 101-6 (17) Carey 5, Abbott 1, Carse 3-36 (6) - need 212 runs to win

Carse will keep bowling from the Nursery End, he’s into his sixth over. He tries a short ball but it’s too short and rightly called a wide.

Australia have gone into their shell following the loss of wickets and no longer trying the counter attack method employed by Smith and Maxwell, who have both gone back to the dressing room.

Abbott gets a run but it’s a streaky outside edge too wide for the slips.

Wicket! Glenn Maxwell out for 2! Australia 96-6 (16) Carey 2, Abbott 0, Archer 2-31 (6) - need 217 to win

Carey has edged the ball but it bounced just in front of Duckett at slip. Maxwell gets the next one away to add a couple.

Australia have a big rebuilding job to get anywhere close to getting something out of this game now.

But Maxwell has gone! He goes for a big swipe and has been caught behind! Another wicket tumbles and Australia are really struggling here.
