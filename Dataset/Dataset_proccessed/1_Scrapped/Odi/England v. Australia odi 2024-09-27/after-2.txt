Drizzle in Brizzle? Oh. The weather doesn’t look too great in Bristol on Sunday…

Looking at the Bristol forecast, seems like Australia will be saved by the rain from an epic England comeback from 2-0 down for the second time in two summers

A word or two from the Captains:

Harry Brook:

We’ve taken all positives from the first two games and brought them to the last two. We identified times where we could put more pressure on - getting early boundaries for example. The bowlers did beautifully on an interesting wicket. Archer was bowling quick with swing and seam movement.

(On his own form with the bat)

It’s always nice to be scoring runs, it helps think clearly.

Mitchell Marsh:

We were off. Fair play to England. We couldn’t get early wickets and were thoroughly outplayed. Their total was over par. Liam (Livingstone) was brilliant. Bristol will be a great experience… we’re excited for the opportunity.”

Not bad:

Reckon that's the second biggest men’s ODI victory, measured in terms of runs, achieved by England against Australia in this format. Also only Australia’s second ODI defeat at Lord’s in 25 years; a period in which they have played 14 ODIs here.

Just four bowlers used in an ODI, pure class from Brook's England

England win by 186 runs! (Australia 126 all out)

Rashid fizzes a leg break past a hapless Josh Hazlewood and that is comprehensively that. A stellar performance with bat and ball sees England level the series at 2-2 and a deciding duel set up in the Wild West Country (Bristol) on Sunday.

24th over: Australia 122-9 (Starc 2, Hazelwood 0) Potts finishes his evenings work with a double wicket maiden and overall figures of 4-38. Impressive stuff.

WICKET! Adam Zampa c Livingstone b Potts 0 (Australia 122-9)

Adam Zampa blocks out the hat-trick ball but falls tamely off the next -plinking a dolly to Livingstone at midwicket. Australia on the brink.

15.13 EDT
WICKET! Carey lbw b Potts 13 (Australia 122-8)

Potts scuds one into Carey’s pad as the batter jumps across the crease. The umpire says no but the bowler likes it. “That’s close” says the bowler. “Shall I go for it?” asks Brook. They do and IT IS OUT. Three reds and Matthew Potts is on a hat-trick!

23rd over: Australia 122-7 (Carey 13, Starc 2) I wonder if Carey and Starc might open the shoulders here? Nope. Just two more runs off Rashid.

15.06 EDT
WICKET! Abbott c Livingstone b Potts 10 (Australia 119-7)

Abbott tees off and gets Potts away for SIX over long on but then tries to repeat the shot next ball without the same connection – the ball finding Livingstone’s safe clutches three quarters of the way to the fence. Starc joins Carey at the crease. England need three more (wickets) and Australia need a load more (runs)

22nd over: Australia 119-7 (Carey 12, Starc)

21st over: Australia 112-6 (Carey 11, Abbott 4) Rashid spins his web. Abbott can’t pick him and can hardly lay a bat on him either. Just a Carey single off the over. England buzzing about and oozing confidence. So is Simon McMahon on email:

“Call me reckless if you like, but I’m calling this one now, James. Series decider in Bristol on Sunday, weather permitting of course. At least it’s not Manchester…”

20th over: Australia 111-6 (Carey 10, Abbott 4) Matt Potts replaces Jofra Archer who keeps one up his sleeve for later filed Break in case of Emergency. Five singles off the over as the run rate climbs over ten an over.

14.55 EDT

19th over: Australia 106-6 (Carey 8, Abbott 3) Adil Rashid replaces Brydon Carse who takes a well earned breather with figures of 3-36 off his six overs. Close! Rashid rips a big leg break and beats Abbott’s drive… Jamie Smith whips off the bails and celebrates. Upstairs we go and NOT OUT – third umpire Dharmasena thinks there is a smidge of shoe behind the line to save the batter. Ricky Ponting on the Sky commentary isn’t so sure and thinks it was on the line rather than behind it. I’m more in the latter camp but Abbott is given the benefit of the doubt.

18th over: Australia 103-6 (Carey 6, Abbott 2) Archer goes for just two runs off the over and has Abbott hopping about the crease with some well directed short stuff.

14.44 EDT

17th over: Australia 101-6 (Carey 5, Abbott 1) Carse continues round the wicket, Abbott and Carey rotate strike to take five singles off the over and bring up the team hundred but Australia need a whole lot more. The bad news for them is that Archer is probably going to bowl out and he has two more overs left.

16th over: Australia 96-6 (Carey 2, Abbott 0) Jofra Archer is all smiles, he loves playing at Lord’s. Maxwell had a chunter as he walked off, I think about the two-paced nature of the pitch but I think credit goes to Archer there for mixing up his pace and his length. If you are 91mph and full one delivery and then able to bowl a slower ball short one without any discernible change in action then fair play.

WICKET! Maxwell c Smith b Archer 2 (Australia 96-6)

Maxwell is gone and so too Australia’s hopes of the win. A slower short ball comes off at half speed and Maxwell is too early on it, an under edge going through to a diving Jamie Smith behind the stumps.

15th over: Australia 93-5 (Carey 1, Maxwell 0) Glenn Maxwell arrives at the crease and lines up a big yahoo at his first ball from Carse… connecting only with fresh air. Two wickets in the over, Carse has 3-31 from five after going for 19 in his first. Tip of the hat to him.

WICKET! Labuschagne b Carse 4 (Australia 93-5)

Anything you can do Jofra… what a ball from Brydon Carse! Off stump thudded back and Marnus trudging off with a shake of the head and a chew of the gum.

Australia have lost five wickets for 27 runs in the last seven overs.

WICKET! Inglis c Jacks b Carse 8 (Australia 91-4)

Carse gets Inglis with one that holds in the pitch, the batter early on the shot and driving uppishly to Will Jacks at short cover who takes a sharp catch.

14th over: Australia 89-3 (Inglis 6, Labuschagne 4) Another probing over from Archer who has the batters hopping about with his speeds around early 90 mph mark. Australia have been kept quiet with the wickets falling and the run rate is rising like a charmed snake.

13th over: Australia 84-3 (Inglis 4, Labuschagne 2) DROP! Carse should have had another as Marnus cloths a pull to Rashid running in from the deep who fumbles the catch and leaves the field with a cut digit. Hopefully not a double blow for England.

12th over: Australia 82-3 (Inglis 3, Labuschagne 1) Marnus is good to continue and manages to get off strike with a dab to point. Archer looks like he could be in business every ball – Inglis is tentative to a full ball and just manages to get his bat down and squirt the ball into the leg side for another single. Fabulous over from Archer.

Marnus Labuschagne comes to the crease to face Archer with his dander up. We’ve been here before eh? The crowd roar Archer in and eeeesht! he clatters Marnus on the elbow first ball. A long delay whilst the batter is checked over, it looks painful but he should be ok – the replay showed it hit the arm guard.

The delay allows Sky to show a slow mo replay of the Archer stump splatterer to Marsh. Take a look at this:

WICKET! Marsh b Archer 28 (Australia 80-3)

You cannot do that Jofra Archer! What a ball to get rid of Mitch Marsh! Pitched on middle and darted late to knock back the off stump! Nothing the batter, any batter, could do about that one.

11th over: Australia 79-2 (Marsh 28, Inglis 2) Inglis whips off his pads for a couple to open his account. Carse has settled down after the wicket, using the slope to angle the ball past the bat. Just four off the over.

10th over: Australia 75-2 (Marsh 27, Inglis 0) Josh Inglis is the new batter but he’ll be at the non strikers end as Smith fell off the last ball of Potts’ over.

WICKET! Smith ct Smith b Potts 5 (Australia 75-2)

Inside edge and gone! Smith curses as he trudges off, fallen to Potts again. He charged the seamer in an attempt to get his feet moving and the slightest bit of movement in was enough to see a loud snick and a comfortable catch to his namesake behind the stumps. Two quick ones for England.

WICKET! Head b Carse 34 (Australia 68-1)

Bowled ‘im! Brydon Carse comes back well after being tonked in his first over. A full ball from around the wicket whistles past Head’s attempted flick across the line and sends the bails flying skyward like a pair of quizzical eyebrows. Breakthrough for England and it was much needed.

9th over: Australia 68-1 (Marsh 25, Smith 0) Steve Smith joins his skipper and has his feet in concrete for his first two balls. Two runs and a wicket off the over.

8th over: Australia 66-0 (Marsh 24, Head 33) Potts stifles a leg before appeal with the ball thunking into Marsh’s pads but it was heading down the leg side. It’s a change of ends for the Durham seamer but the boundaries are still being found by Australia – Marsh holds the pose as he drives handsomely down the ground for four.

7th over: Australia 60-0 (Marsh 20, Head 32) Travis Head gets stuck into Brydon Carse! A short ball is marmalised for SIX over the Mound Stand and out of the ground. New balls please! Ricky Ponting reckons that is the biggest six of the series so far. It made a frighteningly satisfying sound off the bat and soared into the London night sky. Head hits three more fours off a nervous looking Carse to make it 19 runs off the over. Australia are ticking.

6th over: Australia 41-0 (Marsh 19, Head 14) Marsh flays for four through point and the two batters run extremely well to make it eight runs off the over. England are still on the attack with two slips in place, no breakthrough yet and Australia looking dangerous. Brydon Carse is coming on to replace Potts, he was the pick of the England bowlers in Durham but got plenty of tap the match before at Trent Bridge. What’ll it be this evening from the big man? We’re about to find out.
