England vs Australia Commentary
7:48 PM IST So, on a cold afternoon which turned into a freezing evening, England maintain their recent winning run at Lord's and are a win away from making this a near-perfect summer. With series wins over West Indies and Sri Lanka and just three losses to Australia in 6 white-ball games, the hosts would be keen to have the final say about who is bossing the game, come Sunday, 29th September, 2024, when the 5th and final ODI and also, the final game of England's summer of 2024 will be played. There is a lot of talk about bad weather in Bristol for Sunday but why talk about something which has not happened yet? Weather forecasts keep changing and let's hope for the same come Sunday. Australia would be equally desperate to win the ego battle and remember, they are about to enter into a summer of their own, filled with challenges and they would want to get there with confidence. If everything is fine, the first ball should be balled at 10 am GMT, but irrespective, we shall be in early in advance. So do tune in early and enjoy your Sunday along with us. Until then, you can catch the action from the Sri Lanka-New Zealand Test series, Ireland-South Africa series and also the India-Bangladesh series. ADIOS! TAKE CARE!
7:42 PM IST Victorious England captain, HARRY BROOK, IS ALSO ADJUDGED THE PLAYER OF THE MATCH. Brook asserts that even though England did not win the first two games, they took a lot of positives from those and then a lot of momentum came from the third ODI. On Ben Duckett, Harry says that he is a special player and as long as he is there in the middle, the score keeps ticking. On the batting approach, HB says that the plan was to basically target the boundary early in the over, to put pressure on the bowler. Praises his seamers for bowling consistently and not giving anything loose. Is happy to see Jofra Archer back at his best. Does not want to think too much about his own form and only wants to focus on winning the series in Bristol in the final match.
7:40 PM IST Australia's captain, MITCHELL MARSH, admits that Australia were a bit off the radar in this game. Details that England did not give them early wickets while batting and then, totally outplayed his team. Is at a loss of words when asked about how to best approach a target of 312 in 39 overs and ends up saying that Australia tried to come out hard but just kept losing wickets and that's cricket. Is eager to put this loss behind and come out charging afresh, for the decider on Sunday.
7:40 PM IST ... THE PRESENTATION ...
7:40 PM IST Earlier in the day, Australia started really well after winning the toss, restricting England to 35/0 at the end of 8 overs in a truncated match. However, what followed next was total massacre as the next 31 overs went for 277 runs. Barring Will Jacks and Phil Salt, everyone had a go at the Aussie bowlers, scoring runs at will. Skipper Harry Brook (87) and Ben Duckett (63) scored half centuries while Liam Livingstone's 25-ball half century towards the end, with 7 sixes, which also included 28 runs in the last over from Mitchell Starc (6 0 6 6 6 4), was the icing on the cake. It was a forgettable game for Australia overall but this onslaught on their 'experienced' bowlers by an 'inexperienced' batting unit is something they will not be able to digest. Please stay tuned for the presentation...
7:29 PM IST England, on the other hand, would have shut many a critic, who was calling them an inexperienced unit before this series. Matthew Potts and Jofra Archer could not quite contain the Aussies with the new balls but it was Brydon Carse who started to pile on the pressure on Australia. Potts then got a change of ends and all of a sudden, England's so-called inexperienced bowling attack became unplayable. The duo shared combined figures of 14-2-74-7, which broke the back of Australia. Archer then returned supremely in his second spell, which read 4-0-13-2, wherein, with a kick-off delivery to Marnus Labuschagne, reminding us of his welcome to him as Smith's concussion substitute in the 2019 Ashes, followed by wickets of Marsh and Maxwell, showed that at last, the Archer which the whole of England and the world are waiting for, is at last, back.
