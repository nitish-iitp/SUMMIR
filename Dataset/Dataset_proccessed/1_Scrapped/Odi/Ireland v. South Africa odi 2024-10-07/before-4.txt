Where to Watch Match 9 – England Women vs South Africa Women? Live Streaming Details

In their season opener, England’s Maia Bouchier (23) and Dani Wyatt-Hodge (41) provided a solid start with a 48-run partnership, but in no time collapsed to 76/4. Contributions from the lower middle order pushed England to a defendable 118/7. In response, Linsey Smith (2/11 off 4) and Charlie Dean (2/22 off 4) tore through Bangladesh’s top order, leaving them struggling at 52/3. Further support from Sarah Glenn (1/22 off 4) and Nat Sciver-Brunt (1/20 off 4), alongside others, restricted Bangladesh to 97/7, sealing a 21-run victory.

South Africa, in their season opener against the West Indies, saw Marizanne Kapp (2/14 off 4) strike early and Nonkululeko Mlaba emerged as the standout, finishing with 4/29 (4), reducing the West Indies to 118/6. South Africa’s opening-pair of Laura Wolvaardt (59* off 55) and Tazmin Brits (57* off 52) cruised to an unbeaten 10-wicket victory.

Head-to-head in T20Is, England leads with 19 wins from 24 games against South Africa, who have won only 4, with one match ending without a result. Notably, South Africa defeated England in their most recent meeting at the 2023 T20 World Cup semi-final, setting the stage for an exciting rematch.
