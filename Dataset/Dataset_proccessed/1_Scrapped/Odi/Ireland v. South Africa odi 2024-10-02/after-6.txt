IRE vs SA 1st ODI Live Highlights: Hello and welcome to the live coverage of the Ireland vs South Africa 1st ODI at Sheikh Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi.

South Africa have won the toss and opted to bat first against Ireland.

Captains Speak at Toss:

Temba Bavuma, SA Captain: We’re going to bat. It’s a good wicket, with nice grass covering on it. Want to make use of the good batting conditions. It might do a bit under the lights. We’re not used to this (heat) back home. The next couple of days is our focus. For now, we want to put our best foot forward. Quite a lot of cricket before the Champions Trophy. Some changes from the Afghanistan series. We have a debutant in Ottniel Baartman.

Paul Stirling, IRE Captain: Very proud moment (to play 400 games), back to business though, we’ve got a game to win. It was a difficult decision at the toss, happy to have a bowl. With the dew coming in, it might get a bit difficult later, we’ll take it over by over. Gavin Hoey makes his debut today.

Playing XIs:

South Africa: Ryan Rickelton(w), Tony de Zorzi, Temba Bavuma(c), Rassie van der Dussen, Tristan Stubbs, Wiaan Mulder, Andile Phehlukwayo, Bjorn Fortuin, Lizaad Williams, Lungi Ngidi, Ottneil Baartman.

Ireland: Paul Stirling(c), Andrew Balbirnie, Curtis Campher, Harry Tector, Stephen Doheny(w), George Dockrell, Andy McBrine, Mark Adair, Craig Young, Graham Hume, Gavin Hoey.

We are back for Ireland’s reply. Ireland need 272 runs to record their second ever victory against South Africa in ODIs. South African players stride out and take the field. Followed by Andy Balbirnie and Paul Stirling who walk out to open for Ireland. Lungi Ngidi to start with the first new ball.

Right then, Ireland will need a solid start in reply, but with spin likely to play a role later, it promises to be an intriguing second half of the match. South Africa do have some quality bowlers at their exposal and won’t make it easy for the opposition. Do join us for the second essay.

Ryan Rickelton is in for a quick word. He starts by saying that they found themselves under pressure early on as the ball moved significantly, making batting challenging. Mentioned that their focus was on building a partnership, and got great support from Tristan Stubbs. Adds that after losing three early wickets, the mindset had to shift to a more defensive, Test match mode approach to weather the storm.

Once this crucial stand was broken, wickets fell in clusters, but South Africa’s lower order chipped in with valuable contributions. Williams, Ngidi, and Fortuin’s cameos helped push the total to a competitive score, which should give their bowlers something to defend.

Just when Ireland had the upper hand, Rickelton and Tristan Stubbs mounted a remarkable fightback. Their 152-run partnership not only steadied the ship but also turned the tide in South Africa’s favor. Rickelton’s composed knock anchored the innings, while Stubbs unleashed a flurry of strokes, keeping the scoreboard ticking. Ryan Rickelton though will be gutted to fall short of his ton by just nine runs.

South Africa have posted a fighting total on the board, despite early trouble in the first ODI against Ireland. After opting to bat first, Ryan Rickelton kicked things off in style with a boundary off the very first ball. However, Tony de Zorzi struggled to get going and after an early life, he eventually fell, triggering a top-order collapse. Mark Adair and Craig Young were relentless with the new ball, and Ireland capitalized, leaving South Africa reeling at 39/3 inside Powerplay 1.
