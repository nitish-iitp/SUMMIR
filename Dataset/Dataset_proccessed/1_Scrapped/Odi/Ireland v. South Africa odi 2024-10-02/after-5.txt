A brilliant, fourth-wicket partnership of 152 between Ryan Rickelton and Tristan Stubbs rescued South Africa from an early collapse as they reached a total of 271-9 and victory by 139-runs after choosing to bat first in the first of three one-day internationals against Ireland at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.

Ireland were dismissed for 132 in just 31.5 overs with Lizaad Williams claiming 4-32 in 10 overs and Lungi Ngidi 2-35 in six. Spinner Bjorn Fortuin collected 2-28 from 6.5 overs and there was a wicket apiece for Wiaan Mulder and ODI debutant Ottneil Baartman (6-0-24-1).

Opener Rickelton fell agonisingly short of a maiden international century when he inside-edged a cover drive against offspinner Andy McBrine and dragged the ball onto his stumps but it was an excellent 91 from 102 balls with seven fours and three sixes.

Stubbs followed just seven runs later for a fine 79 from 86 balls when a rasping pull-shot against seamer Mark Adair was clutched at mid-wicket by Andy Balbirnie to end an innings containing two fours and four sixes.

Both players accelerated skillfully having repaired the early damage but both will feel their dismissals were ‘soft’ having worked so hard to regain control of the innings.

Wickets fell regularly throughout the run-chase with Williams’ skiddy change of pace deceiving the Irish top order, Ngidi’s experience proving too smart and Fortuin simply too parsimonious. George Dockrell top-scored with 21 before being bowled by Wiaan Mulder.

South African lost 3-8 in 14 balls during the Power Play to slip from 31-0 to 39-3 forcing Rickelton and Stubbs into extreme defensive mode in order to consolidate as they reached the halfway point of the innings on a modest 112-3.

Opener Tony de Zorzi (12) top edged a pull-shot to fine leg against the excellent Adair (10-0-50-4) to perish for third time in the same fashion on tour while captain Temba Bavuma (4) was bowled between bat and pad by seamer Craig Young (10-1-45-3). Rassie van der Dussen (0) thick edged his fourth delivery against Adair to Balbirnie at third slip.

Hopes of a more dominant total rested with allrounders Wiaan Mulder and Andile Phehlukwayo but they, too, were dismissed in tame fashion with Phehlukwayo (1) driving Adair straight to short mid off and Mulder pulling Young meekly into the hands of Harry Tector at deep square leg.

Williams (13) clubbed a couple of fours, Fortuin chiselled out a useful 28 from from 34 balls and Ngidi’s career-best 20* from 17 balls included the biggest six of the innings over midwicket to push the total from ‘respectable’ to ‘competitive.

The second match takes place at the same venue on Friday with the final game on Sunday, also in Abu Dhabi.

IRELAND:  Paul Stirling (captain), Andy Balbirnie, Curtis Campher, Harry Tector, Stephen Doheny (wkt), George Dockrell, Andy McBrine, Mark Adair, Craig Young, Graham Hume, Gavin Hoey.

SOUTH AFRICA:  Ryan Rickelton (wkt), Tony de Zorzi, Temba Bavuma (captain), Rassie van der Dussen, Tristan Stubbs, Wiaan Mulder, Andile Phehlukwayo, Bjorn Fortuin, Lizaad Williams, Lungi Ngidi, Ottneil Baartman.
