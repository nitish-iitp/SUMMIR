COMMENTRY
Right then, thank you for joining us for this thrilling match. Both the skipper’s come together and lift the trophy as this T20I series ends in a draw. Although, we shall be back on October 2, 2024, when these two side will go up against each other in a 3-match ODI series. The first ball will be at 11.30 am GMT, but you’ll know that you can join us early for the build-up. So, Stay tuned for more exciting cricket action, and until next time, take care and keep cheering!
Paul Stirling, the winning captain is in for a chat. He says that at the halfway mark, the team felt they were 15-20 runs short, as the opposition bowlers applied pressure, leaving them slightly under-par. With less dew on the pitch, however, they managed to pull through and secure the win. Explaining why wickets fell in clusters, it was noted that spending time at the crease was crucial to understanding the pace of the wicket, which ultimately won them the game. With new batters coming in, there was always a chance for a breakthrough. The team was absolutely delighted with the victory, acknowledging that it could have gone either way. Ends by saying that he is over the moon with the result, hoping to carry the momentum into the ODIs.
ROSS ADAIR IS ALSO THE PLAYER OF THE SERIES. He starts by saying that Balbirnie is a significant absence for the squad, but knew that if he stayed at the crease long enough, things could get easier. He expressed hope for Andy Balbirnie’s return soon but was determined to make an impact in this game. Reflecting on his performance, he says that the satisfaction of succeeding, especially with the strong South African is a delightful feeling. Having previously played rugby before switching to cricket after a couple of hip surgeries, he mentioned it felt rewarding to shine on the cricket field.
Aiden Markram, the captain of South Africa starts by saying that there were small moments with both bat and ball, which they missed on. Adds that each guy will have certain areas to improve at, mentions that they will try to improve the game individually. States that losing wickets at the death, did not help their cause at all.
Ross Adair wins the Player of the Match award for his outstanding knock of a century off 58 balls. He says that he wanted to put his mark and get a good score. Adds that he is pleased to get the hundred and the knock is very satisfying.
Stay tuned for the presentation…
Earlier in the innings, we saw Ireland gets off to a flier, but just like the first match, they once again faltered in the death overs, and to their disappointment they could not get over the 200-run mark which was easy to breach with the way Ross Adair and Paul Stirling got going. The former even recorded his ton, but in the end it is the win that matters the most. Paul Stirling will be elated with the way his bowler’s came back in the game.
With 23 runs required off the final two overs, South Africa’s hopes rested on Breetzke, but his dismissal in the penultimate over left them in a precarious position. Ireland’s bowlers and fielders held their nerve in the closing stages, executing perfect death bowling and sharp fielding to stifle any late resurgence. In the end, Ireland’s spirited fightback ensured they defended the total, leveling the series and denying South Africa a clean sweep.
Just as it seemed South Africa had the game under control, Ireland’s bowlers turned the tide. The Irish attack, which had been kept at bay in the first half, suddenly came to life, striking at regular intervals to stall the Proteas’ progress. Matthew Breetzke, though composed, found himself running out of partners as Markram, Stubbs, and Mulder fell cheaply, all failing to get into double figures. Despite South Africa’s early dominance, the pressure began to mount as wickets tumbled.
South Africa’s chase of 196 was always going to be a formidable task, but they began with confidence, thanks to Reeza Hendricks and Ryan Rickelton, who provided a solid platform. Rickelton was the aggressor early on, making his intentions clear with a flurry of boundaries before falling in the final over of the Powerplay. His departure, however, did little to disrupt South Africa’s rhythm, as Matthew Breetzke stepped in to support Reeza Hendricks. The latter timed his knock perfectly, converting his promising start into a well-constructed half-century. By the halfway mark, the Proteas looked well on course, sitting comfortably at 88 for 1.
What a game this one turned out to be. There was a time when we all though South Africa might cruise towards victory, but Ireland fought back till the very end and made solid comeback to level the series. Unfortunately, we won’t be getting a series-decider in this one. Ireland walk out of the series with their heads held high.

OUT! CAUGHT! Another one bites the dust and Hume has his third! Bowls it short, around off. Lizaad Williams looks to slap this but gets the outside edge that flies toward short third where Matthew Humphreys accepts a dolly.
Lizaad Williams is the new batter.
OUT! BOWLED’EM! Graham Hume gets the last recognized batter and this should be the game for Ireland. Full and angling into the middle stump line. Patrick Kruger gets too far across for the scoop and misses it completely. The ball crashes into the stumps and the hopes of South Africa are all but gone now.
