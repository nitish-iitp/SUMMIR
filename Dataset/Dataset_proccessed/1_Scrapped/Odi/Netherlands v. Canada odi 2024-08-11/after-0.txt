With the Paris Olympics complete, the U.S. topped the total medal count and tied China for the most golds.

China held a slight lead over the U.S. entering Sunday and claimed its final gold medal with Li Wenwen’s weightlifting win in the women’s +81 kilogram division. The Americans caught up to China with Jennifer Valente’s gold in women’s cycling and a nail-biting win over France in the women’s basketball gold medal game.

The U.S. and China both leave Paris with 40 gold medals, marking the first time two countries have tied in gold medal total at the Summer Games. In 1948, the Winter Games saw a tie for gold at the St. Moritz Olympics when both Norway and Sweden won four.

In Paris, the Americans topped the total medal count with 126 and China finished second with 91. Great Britain (65), host France (64) and Australia (53) round out the top five.

Team USA’s 126 Olympic medals are the third-highest total for the country and the biggest haul since the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles.
