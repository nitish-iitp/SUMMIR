In a critical turn of events for England, star all-rounder Ben Stokes is set to return to the playing XI for their upcoming World Cup 2023 fixture against South Africa in Mumbai. This news comes after England faced a worrying performance with both bat and ball in their previous match against Afghanistan.

Stokes, who had previously announced his unretirement, was expected to be a cornerstone of England's campaign, but his absence in the initial three matches was not part of their plan. Throughout England's challenging journey in the tournament, Stokes had been a constant presence on the sidelines, symbolising the unwavering hope and expectations that the team and fans have pinned on him.

However, Stokes' return, while eagerly anticipated, presents a dilemma for the English side. It is clear that he won't be contributing with the ball during the tournament, which means that his inclusion won't provide England with an additional seam bowler capable of handling a significant portion of the overs in the top six.

To accommodate Stokes in the playing XI, England must make a tough decision. They can either sacrifice the depth in their bowling attack or persist with a batting lineup that looks top-heavy and potentially precarious. Before the World Cup 2023 began, it was widely believed that Ben Stokes and Harry Brook would not be part of the same XI. Brook had been part of the team under the assumption that Stokes would return when fit. However, England's batting struggles in two out of their three matches make the prospect of playing both Brook and Stokes in the same XI more appealing, particularly after Brook's commanding half-century against Afghanistan.

This decision would also require keeping Liam Livingstone in the side, even though his batting performance has been below par. Livingstone's invaluable contributions with the ball, especially his 10 crucial overs against Afghanistan, have been instrumental in giving captain Jos Buttler the flexibility to not rely on wayward bowlers like Chris Woakes or Sam Curran. 

England could sacrifice either Woakes or Curran 

On the subject of Woakes and Curran, their underwhelming performances over three innings make it likely that at least one of them will be omitted. While David Willey could replace one of them without compromising batting depth, the inclusion of both Woakes and Curran would leave England with Gus Atkinson as the only alternative. Although Atkinson offers added pace with the new ball, he may not contribute as effectively with the bat as Woakes or Curran, resulting in a potentially weaker tail-end batting order for England.

By opting to replace Curran with Stokes, England can alleviate concerns about their tail-end batting order. This change would allow Buttler to return to the number six position, which he occupied during the 2019 World Cup, enabling him to marshal the end of the innings. It would also see Livingstone drop down to number seven, a more natural position for him.

Nonetheless, this solution relies heavily on Livingstone, and to some extent, Joe Root, in terms of bowling contributions. While both have been useful in this regard, relying on them to deliver a substantial number of overs is a different challenge. Regardless of the complexities involved in fitting Stokes back into the team, one thing is certain: England become a much stronger side with his inclusion.
