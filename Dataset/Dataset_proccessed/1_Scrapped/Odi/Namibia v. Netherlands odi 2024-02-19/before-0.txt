Recent arm brace ruling may impact those who received a tax-free amnesty form 1 approval
When those who applied for a tax-free amnesty form 1 registration pursuant to ATF Final Rule 2021R-08F began to receive approvals, I posted an article about the conditions noted on the approved forms. In that article,
johnpierceesq.com

Haven’t seen much on the subject - all the boot lickers that paid to play and got a none stamp stamp - is that none stamp still “valid”. Other than the above I haven’t heard much.

I've been saying this exact thing for a while now.

Fortunately my braces all suffered an unfortunate accident at sea

Just because they wobble and have a strap for extreme anal pounding doesn't mean they are gay.

Recently worked with a guy that had a funny story about the non-stamps. Apparently, he and a buddy found a loophole and set up an AI to submit. They each have 1 million non-stamps in the system. The ATF asked the local sheriff to go ask some questions. Sheriff shows up, hears what they did as a middle finger to the ATF, and busted out laughing.

So now the SC will need to decide to make felons out of all those who submitted for the stamp or the those who didn't.

Let's not let them drive wedges between us.

So what do you think is different between this, any other firearm you've purchased, or any other stamp that ya have? You're already on a list. It's a pretty good defense to prosecution that you acted in good faith by following the law changes, which then changed again, if it were to make it to that point. I don't agree with any of the atf BS but let's be a little real here. If you have ONE sbr stamp wouldn't that put you on this same "list" of people to talk to? You don't think the ATF has record of company's like aero, DD etc who don't make pistols but yet full "pistol" builds were sold at dealers and marked as such when sold?

We are all "on a list", at least one; but if you think it was better to register a brace than remove and "destroy" it than you rolled too easy. ATF has no clue what you bought face to face until you admit it.

Isn't that what we do here? Strive to make it onto every list possible?

I'm working on it. I like motorized vehicles far too much to get onto the thermal or night vision lists though.

The greatest thing about all this is that...it just adds to more of the confusion and bullshit when it comes to the ATF and SBRs. How's the average Joe supposed to keep up? You got the director on video saying one thing the written rules saying something different now this. I think the ATF would be very hard pressed to find a jury that would convict someone on a SBR charge with all the mess they have created concerning SBRs and there on again off again rules.

That's the point, you're not supposed to keep up.

"Did you really think we want those laws observed?" said Dr. Ferris. "We want them to be broken. You'd better get it straight that it's not a bunch of boy scouts you're up against... We're after power and we mean it... There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced or objectively interpreted – and you create a nation of law-breakers – and then you cash in on guilt. Now that's the system, Mr. Reardon, that's the game, and once you understand it, you'll be much easier to deal with."
Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged

The criminals running our nation and ruling over us want to male sure we break their laws so they can keep us distracted obeying their unlawful restrictions. It's our job to restrict their criminal actions and hold them accountable. We've been conditioned to be slaves since the end of the Civil war... when we all became slaves.

Your belief in the intelligence of juries is naive.

A Jacksonville jury last year convicted 2 men for selling "credit card-sized metal strips with an etched design he sold under the product name AutoKeyCard". “Autokeycards are … mere images etched into metal. There is no legal basis for holding that they are machine guns,”, and the ATF tech admitted on the stand that they had to modify them from the etched design in order to "kind of" get them to force a multi shot burst. But the jury decided that a 0.002" deep laser etching still mad the metal strips machine guns.

Kristopher "Justin" Ervin of Orange Park and YouTube gun commentator Matthew Hoover were convicted of violating the National Firearms Act of 1934.

Even still there's not enough manpower willing or otherwise to round us all up. They go randomly attack one of us that sicks his head up to far like Randy Weaver or Gary Willis or murder the occasional family pet and the rest keep their heads down and comply.

I'm the first one to tell folks if they've bought ammo they are on a list.
You are so far off that mark its ludicrous.
You are holding up a banana. This is an apple.
This is a ready list of easy targets.

Exactly! All the people: from this, to DEI, to the pizza stuff won't name, to insider trading and the like........ You fucked up, and now it's time to show the world.

They don't run scared because they're not forced to. I, for one, will not stick my head in the sand.

That's the problem, the vast majority of Americans are giving their power and their responsibility to others and then bitching when the results suck. It's our job to make the laws, congress is there to represent us and our needs, not to create law. These agencies shouldn't exist and they only do because congress pawned off their responsibility that we pawned off on to them to those people, people who are not accountable to us by election. We are the ones who weird the constitution, the Supreme law of the land regardless of the assumed final say the supreme court assumed as their job.

See how this shit show developed? We need to take responsibility for our servants again, but we bicker and argue over little insignificant details instead of setting intention focusing of our desired outcome. Instead we put obstacles in from of us such as " They won't listen to us anyway" "The election won't happen this time" and all maner of tired sound bites that constantly get proven wrong. That, and we focus on the feds too much and neglect our local politics that we have a bigger influence over... because they don't live in Virginia.

Unless Virginia is your home state
