Rwanda Sees Significant Growth in Registered Vehicles: An 18% Increase in Two Years.

04:24, 2025-01-06

The number of registered vehicles in Rwanda has surged by 61,629 over the past two years, reflecting an impressive 18% increase, according to the latest 2024 Statistical Year Book released by the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) last week.

As of 2023, the total number of registered vehicles in the country stood at 330,166, up from 268,537 in 2021. In the previous year, 2022, Rwanda had recorded 297,987 vehicles, marking a steady upward trajectory in vehicle registration.

The latest figures reveal that various vehicle categories have experienced substantial growth. Among the most notable increases are:




Trucks: The number of registered trucks rose from 11,397 in 2021 to 14,496 in 2023.
Jeeps: Registered jeeps grew from 34,622 in 2021 to 41,543 in 2023.
Motorcycles: The number of registered motorcycles increased from 141,532 in 2021 to 177,187 in 2023.
Buses: The registered buses grew from 2,084 in 2021 to 2,892 in 2023.

By 2023, the country's vehicle fleet included 218 tractors, 14,496 trucks, 22,470 pick-up trucks, 6,566 special engine vehicles, 41,534 jeeps, 3,061 microbuses, 7,171 minibuses, 51,262 cars, 177,187 motorcycles, 1,636 trailers, 875 semi-trailers, 648 tricycles, and 138 forklifts.

Experts attribute this rapid growth to several factors, including increased demand for private and commercial vehicles, favorable government policies, and a growing transportation network in the country.




A significant driver behind the surge in registered vehicles has been the rising popularity of hybrid and electric vehicles. Data from Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) shows that the number of hybrid cars imported into Rwanda has increased by 237 times between 2021 and 2024. As of 2024, hybrid vehicles outnumber electric ones in the country.

The RRA reports that electric cars, which were almost non-existent in Rwanda as of 2020, have seen a steady increase, rising from 19 electric vehicles in 2020 to 512 in 2024. Meanwhile, the number of hybrid cars has soared from just 28 in 2021 to 6,660 by 2024. This growth is largely attributed to tax incentives and the convenience of hybrid cars, which can run on both fuel and electricity.

The government’s focus on green and energy-efficient vehicles has played a key role in promoting the shift towards electric and hybrid vehicles. Tax incentives for hybrid and electric cars have made them more affordable and appealing to a growing number of Rwandan drivers.




The rapid increase in vehicle registrations, particularly in the hybrid and electric car sectors, is expected to have significant economic and environmental impacts. The automotive sector's growth is likely to contribute to the creation of more jobs in vehicle sales, repairs, and maintenance, as well as infrastructure development such as charging stations for electric vehicles.

Environmentally, the increase in hybrid and electric cars could help reduce carbon emissions, supporting Rwanda’s broader sustainability goals. However, experts caution that the country will need to continue investing in charging infrastructure and other support systems to ensure the long-term success of electric vehicles.




With the continued growth of Rwanda’s vehicle fleet, the outlook for the automotive sector remains positive. Increased vehicle registrations indicate not only a growing middle class but also expanding opportunities for businesses and investors in the transportation and automotive sectors.

As the country moves forward, a greater focus on electric and hybrid vehicles, coupled with infrastructure development and government policies aimed at reducing carbon footprints, will likely shape the future of Rwanda’s automotive industry.

Vehicle Statistics at a Glance (2023):
Total vehicles registered: 330,166
Tractors: 218
Buses: 2,892
Trucks: 14,496
Pick-up trucks: 22,470
Special engine vehicles: 6,566
Jeeps: 41,534
Microbuses: 3,061
Minibuses: 7,171
Cars: 51,262
Motorcycles: 177,187
Trailers: 1,636
Semi-trailers: 875
Tricycles: 648
Forklifts: 138

This positive growth trend is a reflection of Rwanda’s expanding economy, evolving transport infrastructure, and a shift toward more sustainable and energy-efficient vehicles.

Opposition Politician and Protesters Arrested in Kenya Amid Growing Concerns Over Abductions.

02:54, 2025-01-02

Tensions reached a boiling point in the Kenyan capital on Monday as opposition politician Senator Okiya Omtatah, alongside several protesters, was arrested during a street demonstration demanding an end to alleged government-backed abductions. The protest, which gathered hundreds of people, was fueled by concerns over the recent disappearance of young critics of the government.

Senator Omtatah, a vocal critic of the current administration, joined the crowd as they gathered in Nairobi’s central business district to demand the release of seven individuals who were allegedly abducted by security forces earlier this month. The protesters sat down in the streets chanting for the authorities to free the detained individuals.




As the protestors intensified their calls for justice, police responded by firing tear gas canisters into the crowd, attempting to disperse the demonstrators. The situation escalated when Senator Omtatah and several others, refusing to leave, chained themselves together in protest. This act of defiance led to their immediate arrest by the police, who continued to push back the crowd.

The incident comes amid mounting concerns from human rights organizations regarding a surge in abductions targeting government critics. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) reported that 82 cases of alleged abductions have occurred since June, coinciding with the outbreak of anti-government protests. This alarming trend has raised fears that the country may be returning to a period reminiscent of the "dark days" of forced disappearances during the regime of the late President Daniel arap Moi.




In response to the growing uproar, President William Ruto addressed the issue on Saturday, promising that the government would take decisive action to put an end to the abductions and ensure young people can live in peace. However, rights groups continue to allege that police forces are involved in the abductions, a claim that the police have consistently denied. Authorities have promised to investigate the disappearances, but many remain skeptical of the government’s commitment to addressing the issue.

Following this Senator Omtatah took his case to the High Court in Nairobi, filing a legal petition demanding that the government release the seven youths. He criticized the actions of the police, stating, “If they have committed a crime, let them be prosecuted and presented in court to defend themselves.”

Young people who participated in the protest expressed their solidarity with those who had been abducted. Orpah Thabiti, one of the demonstrators, shared her frustration, saying, “We are existing at a time where we have to live in fear. Every day, we wonder if we will be the next targets for speaking out.”

Among the missing are four social media users who vanished after posting AI-generated images of President Ruto that were deemed offensive by his supporters. These disappearances have fueled growing concerns that the government is using abductions as a tool to silence dissent, particularly targeting young, vocal critics.

The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) has warned that the country risks slipping back into the dark era of political repression, similar to the practices that marked the Moi administration. With public distrust in the security forces growing, the commission has called for urgent reforms to ensure that the rule of law is respected and that no Kenyan citizen is subjected to unlawful detention or abduction.




As the protest ended with several arrests, the fate of those detained remains uncertain. Advocates for human rights are closely monitoring the situation, demanding that the government take swift action to ensure the safety and freedom of its citizens, and put an end to the practice of enforced disappearances.

The festive atmosphere extended into hotels and restaurants, which were buzzing with activity. Popular spots like Crystal Lounge, Riders Lounge, Java House, and Delizia Italiana hosted themed New Year’s Eve parties, with guests enjoying exquisite dishes that celebrated both Rwandan and international cuisine. As the night wore on, the dance floors were filled with people enjoying music, laughter, and festive cheer.




At Imbuga City Walk, located in Kigali’s Central Business District, the energy was electric. A vibrant crowd gathered to enjoy a mix of traditional music and modern entertainment, with DJs spinning the latest hits. The hostesses ensured the event was one to remember, guiding revellers through an evening of non-stop dancing and fun. The fusion of both cultures created a unique atmosphere that perfectly encapsulated the spirit of the night.

Top Formula One Drivers Express Optimism Over Racing in Africa as Rwanda Submits Bid for Grand Prix.

08:23, 2024-12-18

The world’s top Formula One drivers have expressed excitement and optimism about the possibility of racing in Africa, as the continent’s interest in hosting a Grand Prix continues to grow. This comes after Rwanda, the East African nation known for its natural beauty and rapidly growing economy, formally submitted a bid to host a Formula One Grand Prix during the FIA General Assembly held in Kigali on Friday, December 13, 2024.




Rwanda's bid marks a significant moment in Formula One’s global expansion, as it would make the country the first African nation in over three decades to host a Grand Prix. The last African nation to host a Formula One race was South Africa, which did so in 1993. Since then, the continent has been absent from the F1 calendar, despite increasing interest in motorsport across Africa.In his address at the General Assembly, President Paul Kagame revealed that discussions surrounding Rwanda’s bid were progressing well, adding that the government was fully committed to bringing the prestigious event to Kigali.




“There is good progress in our discussions, and we are optimistic about the future,” Kagame said. The announcement was met with enthusiasm from the international motorsport community, including FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem, who acknowledged that it was “long overdue” for Africa to once again be represented on the Formula One calendar.

“Formula One is a global sport, and Africa’s place on the map has been missed for too long,” Ben Sulayem said. “We are excited about the potential of bringing F1 back to Africa, and Rwanda’s bid is a promising step in that direction. The country has the infrastructure, the passion for motorsport, and the leadership to make it happen.”




The bid is part of Rwanda’s broader strategy to enhance its profile on the global stage through events like the Formula One Grand Prix, which would also bolster the country’s tourism and economy. However, the bid is still subject to approval from the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the sport's governing body.

Formula One stars Max Verstappen, Lando Norris, and Charles Leclerc, all of whom were in Kigali for the FIA Awards 2024 gala, voiced their support for the idea of racing on the African continent and, specifically, in Rwanda. Verstappen, the current F1 World Champion, said the prospect of racing in Rwanda was “incredibly exciting.”

“It’s fantastic to see the sport expanding to new territories, and Africa is definitely a place where Formula One should be,” Verstappen said. “Rwanda has the right mix of enthusiasm, infrastructure, and ambition to host a world-class event.”




Lando Norris, another popular driver, agreed, emphasizing the significance of a potential African race. “Motorsport in Africa is growing, and hosting an F1 Grand Prix would be a major milestone for the sport,” Norris said. “Rwanda, in particular, seems like a great place to bring a race to. The fans here are passionate, and the country has a lot of potential.”

Charles Leclerc, a star for Ferrari, also showed strong support, adding that “it would be a dream come true” to race in Africa. “I’ve heard a lot about the incredible landscapes and the welcoming people of Rwanda. Having a race here would bring a unique vibe to Formula One.”




While there are still hurdles to overcome, including approval from the FIA and the necessary infrastructure developments, the positive reception of Rwanda’s bid is an encouraging sign. As Formula One continues to expand its global footprint, Rwanda’s ambition to become the first African host of a Grand Prix could pave the way for more races on the continent in the coming years.

For now, the world’s motorsport community will be eagerly watching Rwanda’s bid as it takes shape. If successful, the Formula One Grand Prix in Rwanda could be a game-changer, bringing the thrills of F1 racing to a new audience and marking the return of the sport to Africa for the first time in 31 years.

Cameroon Becomes First Foreign Buyer of Dangote Refinery’s Petroleum Exports.

14:23, 2024-12-16

Cameroon has become the first international buyer of petroleum from Nigeria’s highly anticipated Dangote Refinery. The landmark transaction saw the export of 60,000 tonnes of refined petroleum to Neptune Oil, a major distributor and retailer operating across Central Africa.

This marks a significant milestone in the Dangote Refinery’s operations, which began domestic gasoline sales in September, initially with Nigeria's state-owned oil giant, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), as the sole buyer.




Dangote Refinery, one of the largest single-train refineries in the world with a capacity to process 650,000 barrels of crude per day, has made it clear that it aims to play a key role in stabilizing the fuel supply chain not just in Nigeria but across the African continent. As part of its strategy, Aliko Dangote, the billionaire owner of the refinery, has set a target to export 56% of its total refined petroleum output to international markets.




“We are working closely with Neptune Oil to establish a reliable and consistent supply chain that will not only stabilize fuel prices but also create opportunities for the entire region,” said a spokesperson from the Dangote Group.




The deal with Cameroon signifies a growing demand for locally refined petroleum products, highlighting the regional appetite for more affordable and sustainable fuel sources, particularly in Central Africa. Strategic Partnership with Neptune Oil.




Neptune Oil, which serves as a key distributor across Central Africa, has lauded the deal, emphasizing the potential long-term benefits it could bring to the region’s energy market. “This partnership with Dangote Refinery is a strategic move to strengthen fuel supply, reduce volatility in fuel prices, and ensure a steady flow of high-quality products to our retail network,” said a Neptune Oil representative. The deal also underscores the refinery’s growing reputation as a reliable supplier of petroleum products, not only in Nigeria but across neighboring countries, where fuel supply has often been disrupted by logistical bottlenecks and the high cost of imports.




While the export deal with Cameroon is a promising step, the Dangote Refinery has faced challenges in sourcing sufficient crude supplies to meet its refining capacity. Ongoing difficulties in securing a stable flow of crude have the potential to impact the refinery’s ability to ramp up production to meet export targets. In October, Dangote Refinery entered into a crude-for-gasoline swap agreement with the NNPC, settling payments in Nigeria's local currency, the Naira. This arrangement is aimed at alleviating some of the pressure on the refinery, which has been struggling to obtain the necessary crude feedstock amidst fluctuating global oil prices and domestic supply constraints.

Despite these challenges, Dangote remains optimistic about the refinery’s long-term prospects. The refinery is expected to significantly reduce Nigeria's reliance on fuel imports, which have historically drained the country’s foreign exchange reserves and contributed to the volatility of gasoline prices.




The Dangote Refinery is poised to play a pivotal role in stabilizing fuel prices across West and Central Africa, providing a more cost-effective solution to regional fuel shortages. As the refinery begins to scale its operations and exports, it is expected to help Nigeria conserve crucial foreign exchange (forex) by reducing its dependency on fuel imports. This, in turn, will support the Nigerian government’s economic stability and growth plans.

According to analysts, the refinery’s full-scale operations could be a game-changer for the African energy sector, not only by increasing fuel availability but also by fostering the growth of local economies through enhanced trade and job creation.




As Dangote Refinery expands its operations, future exports are expected to include not just refined gasoline, but a wide range of petroleum products such as diesel, jet fuel, and other petrochemicals. This diversification will help the refinery meet the growing energy demands of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and beyond, bolstering its position as a key player in Africa’s oil and gas industry.

In the meantime, the deal with Cameroon marks the beginning of what could be a new era of energy cooperation in Central Africa. With Dangote Refinery’s extensive production capacity and its commitment to building regional supply chains, the refinery is well-positioned to become a crucial asset for Africa’s energy future.













Africa’s First Motorbike Helmet Testing Laboratory Opens in Rwanda.

13:59, 2024-12-16

Kigali, Rwanda – Africa’s first laboratory dedicated to testing the quality and safety of motorbike helmets was officially launched in Rwanda on Wednesday, December 11. The new facility, located at the Rwanda Standards Board (RSB), aims to enhance road safety standards across the country and pave the way for the production of high-quality locally manufactured helmets.

Raymond Murenzi, the Director General of RSB, shared that the new laboratory can test between 30 to 40 helmets daily. He emphasized that the laboratory will help enforce the safety standards already set by the RSB for both imported and locally produced helmets.




"After the regulations were put in place, we are now going to be able to examine their implementation by using this laboratory,” Murenzi stated, highlighting the importance of ensuring that helmets meet the country’s strict safety requirements.




The new regulations, designed to protect both riders and passengers, mandate that helmets must meet specific criteria to ensure their safety. According to RSB, a certified helmet should be securely fastened with a retention system under the lower jaw, made from durable materials such as a hard plastic or polymer composite shell. Inside, the helmet should feature an expanded polystyrene liner to absorb energy, along with a soft comfort foam for added interior comfort. Additionally, helmets must be equipped with a quick-release mechanism for easy and safe removal.

This initiative addresses a critical issue in road safety, as Rwanda has seen a rise in head injuries from road accidents despite a national policy enforcing 100% helmet compliance among motorbike riders.




Innocent Nzeyimana, president of Healthy People Rwanda (HPR), a non-governmental organization focused on road safety, noted that the idea for the helmet testing laboratory emerged from the observation that, despite the widespread use of helmets, head injuries were still common in motorcycle accidents.

“Although the helmets are being used, there’s always the question of whether they’re the right kind,” Nzeyimana remarked. “This project aims to pave the way for local manufacturing of helmets in Rwanda. By leveraging the laboratory and established safety standards, we can produce high-quality helmets domestically. This will not only improve access to affordable, certified helmets but will also stimulate economic growth.”

Nzeyimana further stressed that this initiative is expected to contribute to Rwanda’s broader road safety efforts, alongside ongoing public education campaigns.




Sadi Bizumuremyi, a taxi-moto rider based in Kigali, expressed strong support for the laboratory's establishment, emphasizing the need for both personal responsibility and high-quality safety gear.

“One of the most important things a Rwandan can do, aside from taking a safety course before riding on the road, is to wear safety gear,” Bizumuremyi said. “A helmet is the most critical part of our equipment. It’s vital that it’s not just any helmet, but a quality one that meets our country’s standards and can truly protect the head.”




The laboratory will also align with the latest international standards for helmet safety. According to recent United Nations regulations, helmets must undergo rigorous testing, including checks for visor durability. Visors must be resistant to impact and should not shatter upon collision. To ensure this, the UN standards specify that visors must withstand a steel ball impact at a speed of 60 meters per second without fracturing or separating.

Furthermore, new tests will measure rotational acceleration to assess the impact on the brain when a helmet is twisted during an accident. These tests will help ensure that helmets not only protect against direct impacts but also minimize the rotational forces that could lead to brain injuries.




Motorcycle accidents remain a significant concern in Rwanda. According to data from the Rwanda National Police, between March and September, 890 road accidents involving motorcycles were registered. During the same period, police impounded over 1,100 motorcycles for serious traffic violations.The launch of the helmet testing laboratory is a crucial step toward improving road safety and reducing motorcycle-related fatalities and injuries. The facility will serve as a model for other African nations seeking to enhance their own road safety standards.The new laboratory is expected to play a vital role in ensuring that Rwanda’s motorcyclists are equipped with the highest standard of protection, promoting safety for riders, passengers, and the broader community.

Rwanda Shines as Host of Historic FIA Awards Ceremony, Strengthening Bid for African Grand Prix.

21:54, 2024-12-13

In a groundbreaking event that underscored Rwanda’s growing prominence on the global sports stage, President Paul Kagame officiated the 120th Anniversary FIA Awards Ceremony and Dinner, held in Kigali. This marks the first time in history that the prestigious awards ceremony, which honors the world's top drivers, manufacturers, and teams from a range of FIA Championships, has been held in Africa. The evening celebrated the brightest stars from the Formula One World Championship, FIA World Rally Championship, FIA World Endurance Championship, FIA World Karting Championship, FIA World Rallycross Championship, and more.




The milestone event showcased Rwanda’s ability to host major international events, sending a strong signal of its ambitions to become a global hub for sports. As part of the evening’s festivities, Max Verstappen was celebrated for clinching his fourth Formula One Drivers’ title, despite facing fierce competition and overcoming a less dominant car this season. Verstappen’s consistency, racecraft, and resilience have been defining traits in his journey to the top.




However, the evening wasn’t just about recognizing motorsport greatness—it also highlighted Rwanda’s strategic ambitions to bring Formula 1 racing back to Africa. Kagame used the occasion to reaffirm Rwanda’s readiness to host the Formula 1 Grand Prix as part of the country’s wider vision to elevate motorsport in Africa. “We are certain that Rwanda is ready to bring back to Africa the story of motorsports, especially with the ongoing discussions to host the Formula 1 Grand Prix,” Kagame declared, adding that the country is prepared to contribute to the growth of motorsport in the region.




As the event unfolded, Queen Kampinya, Rwanda’s first-ever female race driver, took the opportunity to praise Verstappen’s incredible performance over the season. “Max has not only showcased his talent but also his heart and spirit as a competitor,” she said. “He’s an inspiration to us all, especially as we push for more African participation in motorsports.”

The FIA Awards Ceremony was attended by a stellar lineup of industry leaders, team representatives, and global stakeholders, including big names like McLaren, Toyota Gazoo Racing, Mercedes-Benz, and major corporate sponsors such as DHL, Petronas, and Pirelli. These companies, pivotal to the motorsport ecosystem, were also recognized for their significant contributions to the success of international racing.




What made this event truly unique, however, was how it also celebrated Rwandan culture. Local Rwandan artists were honored for creating masterpieces that marked the FIA’s 120-year legacy, adding an African touch to the global gathering. The anniversary dinner, which kicked off the evening, was an eclectic mix of fine dining, cultural expressions, and reflections on Rwanda’s transformative journey on the world stage.

For Rwanda, hosting the FIA Awards Ceremony is more than just an honor—it’s a strategic move to position the country as a key player in global sports. The ceremony showcased Rwanda’s capacity to host high-profile events, further strengthening the country’s bid to host the Formula 1 Grand Prix. With its world-class infrastructure, stable political climate, and forward-thinking policies, Rwanda is positioning itself as an attractive destination for major international sporting events.

The African Grand Prix, which hasn’t been held on the continent since 1993, has long been an aspiration for many African countries. Kigali, with its modern infrastructure and ambitious vision, is now a strong contender to bring Formula 1 back to Africa. As President Kagame stated, “Rwanda is ready to host the world,” and the FIA Awards Ceremony was a powerful demonstration of that readiness.

This event also highlighted the growing presence of motorsport in Africa, with increasing interest in the sport from both participants and fans across the continent. Rwanda, with its expanding motorsport scene and dedication to developing local talent, is well-positioned to contribute to this rise. The country’s commitment to sports development was evident in the recognition of figures like Queen Kampinya, a trailblazer in Rwandan motorsports, and the celebration of the country’s unique cultural contributions to the global motorsport community.

With Max Verstappen’s victory still fresh in the minds of motorsport enthusiasts around the world, and Rwanda’s role as host of the FIA Awards Ceremony, the future of motorsports in Africa is more promising than ever.

OPEC+ Weighs Delay in Oil Production Increases Amid Sluggish Demand and Competition.

11:04, 2024-12-05

Members of the OPEC+ alliance, a coalition of oil-producing nations, are set to decide on Thursday whether to delay planned production increases as weak global demand and rising competition from non-allied producers continue to put pressure on oil prices. The decision comes as concerns mount that the oil market could face stagnation into the new year. If the OPEC+ group, which includes Saudi Arabia as the dominant member of the OPEC cartel and Russia as the leading non-OPEC member, opts to postpone the scheduled increases, U.S. consumers could continue to benefit from lower gasoline prices.




Impact on U.S. Motorists

For U.S. motorists, the current situation offers a reprieve. Gasoline prices in the United States have fallen to their lowest levels in two and a half years, with the national average nearing $3 a gallon. This drop in prices is seen as a key advantage of OPEC+'s cautious approach to production, with the alliance seeking to balance market supply against ongoing uncertainties in global demand.




OPEC+ Production Plans Under Review

The 23-country OPEC+ alliance has been gradually increasing production after implementing significant cuts in 2020 to stabilize the global oil market during the pandemic. Under the current plan, eight OPEC+ members were slated to restore 2.2 million barrels per day starting January 1, 2024. However, analysts suggest the group may choose to delay these increases for another three months to assess how demand develops in the early part of the year. The move is seen as an attempt by the alliance to navigate persistent challenges in the global market, including the effects of ongoing economic uncertainties and strong output from non-OPEC producers such as the United States. With oil prices hovering around $80 per barrel, the decision to delay could further support price stability and prevent a potential market glut.




The Outlook for Global Oil Markets

As the OPEC+ group continues to monitor the global oil market, the delay in production increases could serve as a temporary measure to avoid exacerbating oversupply risks. While some analysts predict that oil demand will pick up in the second half of 2024, others caution that the growing production from non-OPEC countries, particularly the U.S., may continue to weigh on the market.

The decision on Thursday will have far-reaching implications for global oil prices and economic growth, particularly in oil-dependent economies.

Egypt rallies for humanitarian support for Gaza.

10:58, 2024-12-05

Egypt on Monday hosted an international conference to rally humanitarian support for Gaza which has been wracked by more than a year of war between Hamas and Israel.

The conference in Cairo was attended by many senior regional and Western officials, according to the Egyptian Foreign Ministry.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed and other senior UN officials also attended.




The conference came as the humanitarian situation has rapidly deteriorated in Gaza, especially in the Strip’s northern areas which have been almost cut off for nearly two months.

The conference addressed the political, security, and humanitarian aspects of the situation in Gaza, with a particular emphasis on supporting UNRWA's operations, according to the ministry.




On Sunday, UNRWA, the main aid provider for Palestinians, said it was halting aid deliveries through Kerem Shalom, the main cargo crossing into Gaza because of the threat of armed gangs who looted aid convoys.

The agency blamed the breakdown of law and order in Gaza on Israel's policies.

The UN agency's decision could worsen Gaza's humanitarian crisis as a second cold, rainy winter sets in, with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in squalid tent camps and reliant on international aid.

Experts already warned of famine in the north, which Israeli forces have almost completely isolated since early October.

The Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza said on X that it will continue to work with the international community to increase aid into Gaza through Kerem Shalom and other crossings, and said UNRWA coordinated less than 10% of the aid that entered Gaza in November.

Rwanda to Officially Launch Rubavu Port, Aiming to Boost Regional Trade.

10:54, 2024-12-05

The Government of Rwanda will officially launch the Rubavu Port on Friday, December 6, marking a significant milestone in the country’s infrastructure development and its push to enhance regional trade. The port, located in Nyamyumba Sector on the shores of Lake Kivu in Western Province, is set to become the country’s largest port and a critical link for cross-border trade, particularly with neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).




With a focus on improving connectivity and trade efficiency, the modern facility is expected to foster economic growth and offer new opportunities for local communities by supporting trade activities. Officials say the port will play a central role in strengthening Rwanda's economic ties with the DRC and neighboring countries, positioning Rwanda as a key player in the regional trade network.




Strategic Location and Capacity

Spanning two hectares, Rubavu Port includes two main terminals designed to handle both cargo and passenger traffic. After completing a pilot phase over the past year, the port has proven its capacity to manage up to 700,000 tonnes of cargo and accommodate 2.7 million passengers annually. The facility can simultaneously host two cargo vessels, each with a 60-meter quay and a deadweight tonnage (DWT) capacity of 500, providing enough space for a range of vessels.

Although the port's capacity is considered modest by global maritime standards, officials emphasize its strategic importance for regional trade. One cargo vessel can carry up to 35 containers, a vital contribution to Rwanda’s supply chain.




Potential for Regional Trade Growth

The Rubavu Port is expected to act as a catalyst for economic integration in the East African region, offering businesses in landlocked Rwanda and its neighbors an alternative, cost-effective route for transporting goods. This is especially important for improving trade between Rwanda and DRC, which share a significant border along Lake Kivu.

Jean Marie Ndizeye, Senior Engineer for Inland Water Transport at the Rwanda Transport Development Agency (RTDA), highlighted that the pilot phase had shown positive results. "The primary goal of the pilot was to attract businesses and provide alternative, affordable transport routes for goods," Ndizeye said. The port's full operationalization promises to streamline logistics and reduce transportation costs, further boosting Rwanda's competitiveness in the regional market.




Economic and Social Impact

Beyond its commercial significance, the port is also seen as a catalyst for economic development in Rubavu and surrounding areas. By driving trade and improving transportation infrastructure, the port will create jobs, stimulate local businesses, and contribute to the economic well-being of the Western Province.

As the facility transitions into its full operational phase, the government anticipates increased private sector investment, which will further enhance the port’s capacity and efficiency.

Senate Approves Nomination of Domitilla Mukantaganzwa as President of the Supreme Court.

10:49, 2024-12-05

The Senate of Rwanda has unanimously approved the nomination of Domitilla Mukantaganzwa as the new President of the Supreme Court, along with her deputy, Alphonse Hitiyaremye. This decision follows a thorough vetting process that assessed their qualifications and experience. During a session held on Thursday, December 5, 26 Senators voted in favor of the two legal professionals selected to lead Rwanda's judiciary. The Senate Committee on Political Affairs and Governance reviewed the nominees’ credentials and conducted interviews before making its recommendation.

"Following a comprehensive evaluation of the nominees’ qualifications and




an in-depth interview process, the Committee has concluded that both Mukantaganzwa and Hitiyaremye possess the knowledge and experience necessary to perform the duties expected of them," said Senator Usta Kaitesi, the Committee Chairperson.

President Paul Kagame appointed Mukantaganzwa and Hitiyaremye on December 3. Mukantaganzwa will take over the position of Supreme Court President, succeeding Faustin Ntezilyayo. She becomes the sixth individual to hold this prestigious office since the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi and is only the second woman to serve as the Chief Justice of Rwanda, following Aloysie Cyanzayire, who held the role from 2003 to 2011.




Mukantaganzwa, a 60-year-old legal expert, brings over 30 years of legal experience to her new role. She previously served as the head of the Gacaca courts, where she oversaw the prosecution and resolution of genocide-related cases. Her extensive academic background includes a master’s degree in Peace Studies from Hekima University College in Nairobi, Kenya, a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) from the National University of Rwanda (1987), and a diploma in legal practice from the Institute of Legal Practice and Development.




Alphonse Hitiyaremye, who will serve as her deputy, also brings significant experience to the table. He has previously held the role of Deputy Prosecutor General, further strengthening the leadership of the judiciary.The newly appointed leaders of Rwanda’s Supreme Court will serve a five-year term, which is renewable once, and will play a critical role in ensuring justice and the rule of law in the country.

"Moana 2" Sets Records with $221 Million Thanksgiving Opening

18:16, 2024-12-01

Chrismass season arrived with a bang at the box office this year, as "Moana 2" sailed past expectations and delivered a tidal wave of ticket sales over the Thanksgiving weekend. The highly anticipated sequel to Disney's 2016 hit "Moana" raked in an impressive $221 million in domestic ticket sales, setting a new record for Thanksgiving openings and surpassing even the loftiest of predictions. This five-day haul is not only a triumph for Disney but also a game-changer for the holiday moviegoing season, a time typically reserved for December blockbusters.




Originally envisioned as a Disney+ series, "Moana 2" made a last-minute shift to the big screen — a move that clearly paid off. The film's massive success outpaced the previous Thanksgiving record-holder, "Frozen 2," which took in $125 million in its second week of release back in 2019. The sequel’s dazzling mix of thrilling adventure, heartfelt moments, and vibrant animation resonated with audiences of all ages, drawing families, fans of the original, and newcomers alike.




But the success of "Moana 2" wasn’t an isolated phenomenon this weekend. It was part of a historic confluence of blockbuster hits that set the stage for what feels like a holiday movie season in overdrive. Alongside Disney's juggernaut, Universal’s “Wicked” and Paramount’s “Gladiator II” each brought their own flair to the big screen, contributing to an unprecedented weekend where three massive franchises dominated the box office. Such a trifecta of powerhouse films is typically a hallmark of late December, but audiences were treated to the spectacle much earlier this year.




Globally, “Moana 2” sailed to $386 million in ticket sales, with $165.3 million coming from international markets. With this jaw-dropping debut, the film claims the title of the second-highest global launch of 2024, trailing only behind "Avatar: The Way of Water". The worldwide reception only further solidifies the immense appeal of the film, which continues to ride high on the coattails of its predecessor’s success.

This remarkable box office performance signals an even brighter future for Disney and sets a high bar for other major studio releases still to come. While the Christmas season has traditionally been a time of great moviegoing, "Moana 2" has shown that the holiday magic can come early — and in the case of this box office phenomenon, it’s coming with a splas

China-Rwanda health cooperation initiative to boost Masaka and Kibungo Hospitals' Healthcare with Six New Specialized Treatment Centers.

17:35, 2024-11-26

Masaka and Kibungo Hospitals in Rwanda are set to enhance the country’s healthcare delivery with the introduction of six new specialized treatment centers, focusing particularly on hernia treatment. The new facilities were officially unveiled today as part of the China-Rwanda health cooperation initiative, which aims to improve the quality of healthcare services in Rwanda.

The new centers, which include a range of specialized clinics, are expected to provide more professional, standardized, and refined treatments for various medical conditions, with a particular emphasis on hernia care. Hernias occur when part of an organ pushes through a weak spot or opening in the muscle wall, typically in the abdomen or groin. Left untreated, they can lead to serious complications, but with specialized care, they can be managed effectively.







Masaka Hospital, located in Kicukiro District, will host several of the newly established centers. Among these are:

Hernia Treatment Center: Specializing in the diagnosis and surgical repair of hernias, this facility will offer advanced care for patients suffering from this common condition.

Obstetric Analgesia Center: Focused on providing pain relief during labor, this center aims to improve maternal comfort and safety during childbirth.

Orthopaedic Trauma Center: Dedicated to treating bone and joint injuries, this center will address complex fractures and other musculoskeletal conditions.

Day Surgery Center: This facility will provide simple, non-invasive surgeries that do not require an overnight stay, allowing patients to receive treatment and return home on the same day.

The Day Surgery Center at Masaka Hospital will offer a variety of minor procedures, including the removal of ganglion cysts, lipomas, sebaceous cysts, hemangiomas, and abscesses. These surgeries are typically quick and less complex, making them ideal for a day surgery setup, which allows patients to avoid long hospital stays while still receiving quality care.




Whereas In Ngoma District, Kibungo Hospital will also host two specialized centers that includea hernia treatment cenyter focused on offering advanced care for patients with hernias, similar to the Masaka Hospital facility and a pain clinic, a new center that will address chronic pain management, offering treatments to improve the quality of life for patients suffering from various painful conditions.

The establishment of these centers marks a significant milestone in Rwanda’s healthcare development, particularly in the area of specialized surgery and treatment. The collaboration with China is expected to help Rwanda improve medical standards and build local expertise.







A key aspect of the new centers is the opportunity they provide for Rwandan healthcare professionals to gain specialized skills. Initially, Chinese doctors will perform surgeries and procedures, with Rwandan doctors observing closely. Over time, the goal is for Rwandan doctors to work alongside their Chinese counterparts, eventually gaining the expertise to perform surgeries independently.

This knowledge transfer model is part of the broader China-Rwanda health cooperation, which aims to build local capacity and ensure the sustainability of the healthcare improvements. The collaboration also involves the provision of medical equipment and resources to ensure the centers are equipped to handle a wide range of patient needs.




The new centers are expected to improve patient outcomes, reduce the need for long-distance referrals, and make specialized care more accessible to Rwandans across the country. The partnership with China underscores Rwanda’s commitment to enhancing its healthcare system and addressing the growing demand for high-quality medical care.

As the centers begin to operate, they will play a crucial role in addressing health challenges in Rwanda, particularly in treating conditions like hernias, which are common but often neglected in many healthcare systems. With ongoing training and the gradual transition to fully Rwandan-led operations, these new facilities represent a significant step forward for Rwanda’s health sector.

The new specialized centers are expected to become key pillars of Rwanda’s healthcare system, offering patients better treatment options and improving the overall quality of care across the nation.

G7 Foreign Ministers Call for Immediate Israel-Hezbollah Ceasefire, Avoid ICC Warrant Discussion.

16:34, 2024-11-26

Foreign ministers from the world’s leading industrialized nations on Tuesday voiced strong support for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. However, they sidestepped a contentious issue regarding the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) recent arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant.




At the conclusion of their two-day summit held just outside Rome, the Group of Seven (G7) ministers reiterated their call for an end to hostilities in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The ministers emphasized the urgency of humanitarian relief and the importance of protecting civilian lives in the conflict, which has escalated over the past month, with Hezbollah launching attacks on northern Israel.




While the ceasefire call was clear, the G7 ministers refrained from making any explicit reference to the ICC's recent actions. The Hague-based court issued arrest warrants earlier this month for Netanyahu and Gallant, accusing them of committing war crimes during Israel’s military operations in Gaza. The charges, which include allegations of using "starvation as a method of warfare" by restricting humanitarian aid and intentionally targeting Palestinian civilians, were categorically denied by Israeli officials.




Italy, which hosted the G7 summit, had pushed for the inclusion of the ICC warrants on the official agenda, but the issue divided the G7 members. The United States, Israel’s closest ally, has sharply criticized the court’s decision, calling the warrants "outrageous." The U.S. is not a member of the ICC and does not recognize its jurisdiction over American or Israeli citizens. In contrast, all other G7 nations—Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom—are signatories of the Rome Statute and are legally bound to respect the ICC’s rulings. However, despite the legal obligations, the ministers chose not to engage with the specifics of the arrest warrants in their final communiqué. This diplomatic ambiguity reflects the delicate balancing act the G7 faces in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict while navigating differences over international legal accountability.

The G7 summit concluded with a joint statement calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, with a focus on the protection of civilians and the provision of aid to those affected by the violence. However, it remains unclear how the situation will evolve, as the conflict continues to strain international relations and raise challenging questions about the accountability of world leaders in times of war.




While the issue of the ICC’s arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant remains unresolved on the international stage, the call for an immediate ceasefire has garnered widespread support from the G7, reflecting the growing concern over the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza and the broader Middle East region.






















Lula da Silva Closes G20 Summit, Hands Over Leadership to South Africa.

05:47, 2024-11-20

Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva officially closed the 2023 Group of 20 (G20) summit on Tuesday, marking the end of Brazil’s tenure at the helm of the global economic forum. He handed over the presidency to South Africa, the next nation to lead the influential group of the world's largest economies.

"After South Africa’s presidency, all G20 countries will have led the group at least once. It will be an important moment to assess the role we have played and how we should act moving forward," Lula da Silva remarked, reflecting on the group’s past efforts and future direction.




The summit’s final day featured a lighter schedule for world leaders, following the release of a joint declaration on the previous evening. The statement covered several global issues, including the urgent need for a global pact to combat hunger, increased humanitarian aid for Gaza, and calls for the cessation of the ongoing war in Ukraine.

However, while the document addressed broad and critical issues, it was notably lacking in specific action points or detailed commitments. The leaders reaffirmed their collective desire for a global tax on billionaires and endorsed the idea of reforming the United Nations Security Council to allow for future expansion beyond its current five permanent members.




Despite the general consensus on these points, the declaration did not achieve complete unanimity. Notably, Argentina raised objections to certain aspects of the draft, ultimately becoming the only G20 nation to withhold full endorsement of the final document.




Before the summit convened, there were doubts about Lula da Silva’s ability to steer the group toward concrete agreements. These concerns were heightened by the looming uncertainties surrounding the incoming U.S. administration under President-elect Donald Trump, whose foreign policies could significantly shift the dynamics within the G20.

In addition to geopolitical concerns, ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, including the war in Gaza, and the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine added further complexity to the summit discussions. While the G20 leaders expressed solidarity with the people affected by these crises, the overall atmosphere was one of cautious diplomacy rather than groundbreaking decision-making.




As the summit concluded, Lula da Silva emphasized that his time leading the G20 marked an important period for Brazil and the global community. While the group struggled to forge concrete outcomes, the joint declaration pointed to the G20's potential for addressing long-term challenges like global inequality, the climate crisis, and reforming global governance structures.

Looking ahead, South Africa will now take the reins of the G20 presidency, following a leadership rotation that reflects the diverse representation of the world’s economic powers. Lula da Silva’s final remarks underscored the need for reflection on the group's role in addressing global crises and its potential to lead on pressing issues, including poverty, security, and climate change.

Rwanda’s Proposed Media Policy: A New Era of Regulation for Journalism and AI-Generated Content.

05:32, 2024-11-20

Rwanda’s proposed media policy, which is currently awaiting final approval from the Cabinet, is set to introduce significant reforms aimed at modernizing the country’s media landscape. If approved, the policy will address emerging challenges such as artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content, the rise of citizen journalism, and the evolving role of digital communication in society. The policy, formulated by consultants in 2023, received preliminary approval from the sector cabinet earlier this year and is now in the final stages of approval, though delays have raised concerns over its timely implementation.




Impact on Media Laws and Institutions

One of the most significant aspects of the proposed policy is its focus on reshaping the regulatory framework for media in Rwanda. Several new laws, institutions, and academic adjustments are expected to follow if the policy is passed.

For instance, digital content creators and distributors will be required to label AI-generated content. A standardized digital stamp is set to be developed to help consumers distinguish between human-created and AI-generated media. The increasing use of AI tools in content production has raised ethical questions, and Rwanda’s policy seeks to address these issues head-on.

In addition, the policy is likely to influence the development of a stand-alone defamation law, shifting away from criminal defamation laws in favor of civil defamation remedies. This move is seen as an effort to balance reputational rights with freedom of expression, in line with international trends where defamation is handled as a civil matter rather than a criminal offense.

Jean Paul Ibambe, a Rwandan lawyer and Hubert H. Humphrey Fellow, has emphasized that Rwanda is at a critical juncture in determining how online media content, including defamation, libel, privacy infringement, and rumors, should be regulated. He advocates for a civil defamation law, noting that many countries, including the UK, Kenya, and Australia, have decriminalized defamation and handle it through civil courts instead.




Media Literacy and Curriculum Reforms




The policy also emphasizes the need for reform in academic curricula to ensure journalism training aligns with industry standards. Universities and journalism institutions in Rwanda are expected to revise their programs to incorporate ethical guidelines, new media skills, and digital literacy. Moreover, media literacy courses will be included in school curriculums, and there will be initiatives to enhance media literacy among the broader population through non-formal education programs.

These reforms aim to equip the next generation of journalists with the skills necessary to navigate the complexities of both traditional and digital media platforms, ensuring they adhere to ethical standards while producing high-quality content.

Safeguarding Children in the Digital Age

In an era dominated by digital content, one of the policy’s notable components is its focus on protecting children from harmful media. The policy proposes tighter regulations on television advertisements to protect children, particularly during family viewing hours. Gonzague Muganwa, a Kigali-based journalist and consultant, pointed out that similar measures are already in place in countries like South Africa, where, for example, alcohol advertisements are prohibited during football broadcasts— a time traditionally seen as family viewing.

New Laws to Address Social Media and Online Content

The proposed policy also seeks to address several emerging challenges related to online media. A "right to be forgotten" law is being considered, which would allow individuals who have been falsely accused or proven innocent of crimes to remove damaging information about them from search engines and digital platforms.

Additionally, Rwanda is set to introduce a law that would allow citizens to have their social media pages removed upon their death. This move recognizes the growing importance of managing one’s digital footprint, even after passing away. Citizens will also be encouraged to formally state their wishes regarding the management of their online presence after their death.

To safeguard national security, privacy, and reputational rights, the policy outlines the creation of new laws for judicial redress in cases of online and social media infractions. It also proposes the establishment of a post-publication review regime to hold individuals accountable for content they publish on social media, ensuring that they adhere to community standards and face sanctions when necessary.

Strengthening Journalistic Integrity

The policy also highlights the need to enhance journalistic ethics and professionalism. The media regulator will review and enforce an updated code of ethics that addresses both traditional and digital media. The policy points out that unethical conduct, uncompetitive journalism, and a lack of investigative reporting are undermining the media industry’s effectiveness. It also notes the rise of activists posing as journalists on digital platforms, contributing to a content gap and eroding public trust in media.

Ensuring Media Accountability and Professional Development

Lastly, the proposed policy stresses the importance of a robust accreditation system for journalists. The media regulator will strengthen and enforce a multi-level accreditation system, ensuring that only qualified individuals are allowed to practice journalism. Additionally, all practicing journalists will be required to undergo mandatory professional development courses every two years to keep their skills and knowledge up to date in the fast-evolving media landscape.




With Rwanda moving closer to approving its new media policy, the proposed changes promise to reshape the media landscape by fostering greater accountability, protecting individual rights, and embracing the digital revolution. The policy’s focus on ethical journalism, digital content regulation, and media literacy will likely position Rwanda as a leader in modern media regulation in Africa. However, as delays in cabinet approval continue, the media industry, content creators, and the public eagerly await the final outcome and its potential to transform the media environment in Rwanda

Tottenham's Rodrigo Bentancur Hit with Seven-Match Suspension and Fine for Controversial Comment About Teammate Son Heung-min.

12:11, 2024-11-18

 Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur has been handed a seven-match domestic suspension and fined approximately $126,000 (£100,000) by the English Football Association (FA) following a controversial comment he made about teammate Son Heung-min. The FA's ruling comes after an interview in which Bentancur referred to Son and his cousins as looking "more or less the same," a remark deemed offensive due to its reference to Son’s ethnicity.




The incident took place during an interview with Uruguayan journalist Rafa Cotelo, which was later published in a 45-minute film on Cotelo’s YouTube channel. The FA found that Bentancur’s words constituted an “improper manner” and an “aggravated breach” of their regulations, as they were deemed to be abusive, insulting, and damaging to the reputation of the game. The specific nature of the breach stemmed from the comment’s ethnic reference, which was judged to have brought the sport into disrepute.




Following the incident, Bentancur publicly apologized for the comment in an Instagram post, describing it as an “unfortunate misunderstanding.” He clarified that there was no intention to offend anyone and assured fans that all was resolved with Son. “If someone felt offended because of my words through this media tool I would like to offer my sincere apologies… I’ve never had the intention to offend directly or indirectly anyone,” Bentancur wrote, addressing the controversy.

In June, after the video clip circulated online, Son himself came to Bentancur’s defense, stating that his teammate had acknowledged the mistake. “Rodri apologized for making a mistake. He would never mean to intentionally say something offensive. We are brothers, and nothing has changed at all,” Son said, downplaying the incident and emphasizing the strength of their relationship.




Tottenham Hotspur also expressed its support for Son Heung-min, with the club stating that it “fully supports” the South Korean international. In addition to standing by Son, the club reiterated its commitment to promoting diversity, equality, and inclusion, confirming that Bentancur would undergo further education on these important issues.

"Tottenham Hotspur Football Club takes all matters of this nature seriously, and we will continue to work with all players to ensure that diversity, equality, and inclusion are at the forefront of everything we do," a statement from the club read.




Bentancur, 27, will begin serving his seven-match suspension this Saturday when Tottenham faces Manchester City. He will be eligible to return to action on December 26 against Nottingham Forest in the Premier League. The suspension will also include upcoming Europa League fixtures, meaning Bentancur’s absence will be keenly felt in both domestic and European competition.

So far this season, Bentancur has made 14 appearances for Spurs and scored in the team’s 2-1 defeat to Ipswich Town on November 10. His absence from the midfield will likely be a blow to Tottenham, who are striving for a top-four finish in the Premier League and a strong European campaign.




As Bentancur serves his suspension, Tottenham will hope the incident does not overshadow the strong camaraderie between the players, particularly between the Uruguayan and Son, who have a reputation for being close friends both on and off the field. With the club’s commitment to diversity and inclusion, they will likely take further steps to ensure similar incidents are avoided in the future, reinforcing the importance of respectful conduct in football.

For Bentancur, the suspension and fine serve as a stern reminder of the sensitivity surrounding public comments, especially when they touch on issues of race and ethnicity. While he has apologized and relations with Son appear intact, the incident underscores the continued need for education and awareness in football as the sport strives to maintain its commitment to inclusivity.

Biden’s Shift on Ukraine Strikes in Russia Raises Stakes as War Reaches 1,000-Day.

12:02, 2024-11-18

President Joe Biden’s decision to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia has marked a significant escalation in the ongoing war, drawing stark reactions from Moscow, Kyiv, and Washington’s allies. As the conflict nears its 1,000th day, the move adds a new and uncertain dynamic to the battlefield, with both risks and opportunities now hanging in the balance.




The shift in U.S. policy, confirmed by senior officials on Sunday, allows Ukraine to strike deeper into Russian territory with advanced weaponry, including long-range missiles provided by the United States. This marks a reversal of previous U.S. restrictions, which had aimed to avoid provoking a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia, a delicate issue that had kept the West from fully empowering Ukraine in its defense.




The announcement coincided with a deadly new round of Russian missile strikes in Ukraine, which only heightened the urgency of the decision. On the same day that Biden’s policy shift was revealed, a Russian ballistic missile, carrying cluster munitions, struck a residential area in Sumy, a city in northern Ukraine, killing 11 people, including two children, and injuring dozens more. Later, a Russian missile attack on the southern city of Odesa killed at least eight and injured 18, including a child, according to regional governor Oleh Kiper.

These attacks underscore the relentless toll of the conflict on Ukrainian civilians and come as Ukraine has struggled to push back against Russia’s territorial gains. Biden’s move to lift restrictions on Ukrainian strikes inside Russia may be seen as an effort to tip the balance in Ukraine’s favor and send a strong message to Moscow, but it also comes with significant risks, particularly regarding the potential for escalating tensions with Russia.




The decision to greenlight Ukrainian strikes inside Russia signals a strategic shift by the Biden administration, but the scope and implications of this policy change remain unclear. While U.S. officials have confirmed that limits on the targets Ukraine can strike will be eased, specific parameters are still vague. One key question is whether Ukraine will be permitted to target Russian military installations, infrastructure, or even broader strategic areas within the Russian heartland.

The policy shift comes after months of reluctance from Washington, which had been wary of escalating the conflict to a point where direct NATO involvement could be triggered. Biden had previously rejected such a move due to fears of provoking an all-out war with Russia, a concern amplified by the prospect of nuclear escalation. However, the ongoing atrocities committed by Russian forces in Ukraine, including the recent missile attacks, seem to have tilted the balance in favor of stronger support for Ukraine’s defensive operations.




Moscow has responded swiftly and ominously to the decision, with Russian officials warning that any attacks on Russian territory by Ukraine would cross a red line, further complicating the dynamics of the war. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described the move as a “dangerous escalation” and reiterated that Russia would retaliate if Ukrainian strikes intensify.

Despite these threats, Kyiv’s response to the new flexibility granted by the U.S. has been cautiously measured. Ukrainian officials, while welcoming the increased support, have expressed their awareness of the delicate balance between striking strategic Russian targets and avoiding provoking a more direct confrontation with Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government has made it clear that it will act strategically, keeping in mind both military necessity and international diplomatic considerations.




The timing of Biden’s policy shift is particularly significant given recent reports of North Korean involvement in the war. According to recent intelligence from the U.S., South Korea, and NATO, North Korean troops are allegedly being deployed to help Russia in its efforts to oust Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region, a border area in southwestern Russia. This development has raised concerns in the West about the growing military cooperation between Russia and North Korea, potentially leading to more sophisticated weapons and increased manpower on the battlefield.

North Korea’s support for Russia complicates the global dimensions of the conflict, as it brings together two of the most isolated and heavily sanctioned nations in the world against a backdrop of U.S.-led efforts to support Ukraine. This geopolitical shift is likely to provoke further responses from the West, including new rounds of sanctions or potentially more direct involvement in the war by NATO members.




As the war enters its 1,000th day, the conflict shows no sign of abating, with both sides entrenched and increasingly desperate for decisive victories. Biden’s policy shift signals a potential pivot in U.S. support for Ukraine, though the long-term consequences of this decision remain to be seen.

For Ukraine, the expanded missile capabilities could provide a much-needed advantage in its ongoing struggle to defend its sovereignty and retake occupied territories. However, the risk of further escalation with Russia, particularly as Moscow continues to ramp up attacks on civilian areas, remains high.

The coming days and weeks will likely be pivotal, not just for Ukraine and Russia, but for the broader geopolitical landscape. As the war approaches this grim milestone, the international community will be closely watching to see if Biden’s gamble will shift the course of the conflict, or if it will merely lead to deeper confrontation and a further destabilization of Europe’s security architecture.



















Nigeria and India Pledge Stronger Bilateral Ties, Commit to Supporting Global South Nations.

11:56, 2024-11-18

In a historic visit marking a new chapter in bilateral relations, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Nigerian President Bola Tinubu on Saturday pledged to further strengthen ties between their two countries, focusing on key areas such as defence, energy, technology, trade, and development. Modi's visit to Abuja is the first by an Indian prime minister in 17 years, underscoring the growing importance of this strategic partnership.




During their meeting, both leaders agreed to enhance cooperation on regional and global issues, including counter-terrorism, maritime security, and intelligence-sharing, to address mounting threats in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Guinea. These regions, particularly off the coast of West Africa, are some of the world's most dangerous hotspots for piracy and maritime crime.




A Partnership Built on Shared Interests

Prime Minister Modi, who arrived in Nigeria on Saturday after an official invitation from President Tinubu, stressed that India values its strategic relationship with Africa's largest economy. “We have a strong cooperation in several sectors such as defence, energy, economy, technology, health, education, and culture. Our cooperation is very strong and there are many new possibilities as well,” Modi said, highlighting the wide-ranging areas of collaboration between the two nations.

In turn, President Tinubu emphasized the long-standing ties between Nigeria and India, noting that the two countries have stood side by side on numerous fronts over many decades. He commended India for its steadfast collaboration in various sectors, including technology and defence, and praised the mutual commitment to strengthening the relationship.




“You stood side by side with Nigeria on many fronts for many decades. You’ve navigated through India’s sectors and also ensured joint collaboration to maintain and strengthen our relationship,” Tinubu remarked, signaling the depth of the partnership.




Pledging Support for the Global South

In addition to bilateral cooperation, the leaders also discussed the importance of supporting Global South nations, emphasizing the need for greater solidarity and assistance to developing countries facing common challenges. Both Nigeria and India are key voices in the Global South and have consistently advocated for more inclusive global governance and development support for emerging economies.




“We must work together to advance the interests of our people and those of the wider Global South,” Modi said, underscoring India’s commitment to supporting Nigeria and other developing nations in their pursuit of sustainable development, peace, and security.

New Frontiers in Defence and Maritime Security

One of the key areas of focus during the talks was enhancing collaboration in defence and maritime security. Given the growing threats in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Guinea, both leaders agreed to bolster joint efforts in counter-terrorism, intelligence-sharing, and securing international shipping routes.

The Gulf of Guinea, a crucial maritime corridor off West Africa, has become a focal point for piracy and illegal activities. This has posed significant risks to trade and security in the region. Modi and Tinubu expressed a shared commitment to tackling these challenges and ensuring the safety of the region’s vital maritime routes.




A Grand Honour for Modi

In recognition of his efforts to strengthen bilateral ties, President Tinubu conferred upon Prime Minister Modi Nigeria’s second-highest national honour, the Grand Commander of the Order of the Niger (GCON). The prestigious award reflects the high regard with which Nigeria holds India and its prime minister for their contributions to fostering diplomatic and strategic relations.

“Prime Minister Modi’s visit marks a significant milestone in the deepening of our relations,” Tinubu said, while presenting the award. “This is not just a recognition of his leadership but also of the growing partnership between our two great nations.”







As the two countries look to expand their collaboration, Modi’s visit to Nigeria signals a new era of partnership that spans across multiple sectors, including defence, trade, technology, and education. Both leaders expressed their intention to continue working closely together to address regional and global challenges while enhancing the welfare of their citizens.

With Nigeria and India committed to a shared vision of progress and mutual benefit, the historic visit is expected to open new avenues for cooperation in the years ahead, with both countries playing a key role in shaping the future of the Global South.




Africa Faces USD 1.3 Trillion Financing Gap to Achieve Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, Warns UN Economic Commission for Africa

11:48, 2024-11-18

Africa is facing a staggering financing gap of up to USD 1.3 trillion annually to meet its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, according to Ambassador Claver Gatete, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA). Gatete made this assertion on Monday, November 18, during the opening session of a two-day regional consultation for the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development in Africa, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.




In his remarks, Gatete, who also serves as the United Nations Under-Secretary-General, emphasized that the continent's ability to achieve the SDGs is increasingly jeopardized by a combination of global and local crises, including health challenges, geopolitical tensions, and economic slowdowns. He noted that these multifaceted issues are not only straining Africa’s development progress but are also compounding the financing challenges facing the continent.




“Africa is at a critical juncture today. The challenges we face are more urgent than ever. From diseases and geopolitical instability to economic downturns, these crises are undermining our collective progress,” Gatete said. “To achieve the SDGs by 2030, we need to close the financing gap of up to USD 1.3 trillion annually. This requires urgent action and a unified response from both African governments and the international community.”




The warning comes on the heels of a recent call by Gatete, just a week prior, for five critical policy priorities to ensure a climate-resilient and empowered Africa. His remarks underline the urgency of addressing the financing shortfall in order to realize the continent's long-term sustainable development ambitions.




External Debt and Rising Interest Payments

A significant barrier to Africa’s development is the continent’s rising external debt, which exceeded USD 1 trillion as of 2023. Gatete pointed out that high interest payments on this debt are severely limiting African governments’ capacity to invest in critical development projects, from infrastructure and health to education and climate adaptation.

“Africa's external debt burden is unsustainable. The astronomical interest payments eat into our limited resources, preventing us from investing in the projects that are vital for the continent’s future. We need an urgent overhaul of the global financial system to provide Africa with the financing it needs,” Gatete urged.

He also underscored the importance of effective financial markets to drive sustainable development in Africa. As part of his earlier statements, Gatete highlighted the role of reforming financial markets as essential to unlocking the continent’s potential for green investment, infrastructure development, and resilience-building, particularly in the face of climate change.




Unified Response Needed for Collective Progress

The ECA Executive Secretary emphasized that Africa’s challenges cannot be addressed in isolation and called for a unified, coordinated response from both African leaders and international partners. He stressed that the continent's developmental aspirations could only be realized through greater international collaboration and more innovative financing mechanisms.




“Africa cannot achieve its SDGs without external support, and we must work together to bridge this enormous financing gap. It is time for the international community to step up and contribute more effectively to Africa’s development,” Gatete concluded.

As the regional consultation for the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development in Africa continues, key discussions will focus on how African nations can mobilize domestic resources, strengthen partnerships, and reform global financial systems to close the financing gap. The outcome of these consultations will be critical in shaping Africa’s financing strategy leading up to 2030, as the continent seeks to overcome these pressing challenges and build a more sustainable future for its people.

As Rwanda continues to make strides in technological and educational advancements, the success of these students serves as an inspiration for the next generation of innovators in the country and beyond.

Rwanda Seeks $6.2 Billion Climate Finance by 2030 at COP29.

06:31, 2024-11-15

Rwanda is accelerating its climate action agenda with bold plans to mobilize $6.2 billion in climate finance from 2024 to 2030, aiming to fund critical biodiversity and climate resilience projects across the nation. This ambitious goal was unveiled during the 29th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29), where Rwanda presented its newly adopted National Climate and Nature Finance Strategy.




The country’s overall climate action plan, which is encapsulated in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), has an estimated price tag of $11 billion since it was first introduced in 2020. However, the financing gap to fully implement these plans currently stands at over $6 billion.

Teddy Mugabo, CEO of Rwanda Green Fund, addressed delegates at COP29, outlining the government’s commitment to closing this gap by leveraging innovative climate finance mechanisms and private sector partnerships. Mugabo explained that the new strategy will be rolled out by operationalizing a green taxonomy, enhancing capacity-building efforts, and implementing financial de-risking measures to attract private investment.




“We are focused on creating the financial tools and frameworks necessary to scale up investment in climate and nature-based solutions," said Mugabo. "By 2030, Rwanda aims to secure $6.2 billion to fund climate and biodiversity initiatives, ensuring that our NDCs become a reality for a sustainable future.”

Rwanda’s efforts to address climate change and biodiversity loss are increasingly being recognized as models for developing countries. The country's strategy is centered on ensuring that both domestic and international investors are confident in financing projects aimed at reducing emissions, enhancing climate resilience, and protecting ecosystems.




The new finance mechanisms, which include green bonds, blended finance, and insurance schemes, are designed to encourage greater involvement from the private sector and international climate funds.

Mugabo emphasized that Rwanda’s strategy goes beyond financing, with a strong emphasis on building local expertise and strengthening institutional capacities to implement climate projects effectively. This approach is aligned with Rwanda’s broader vision of integrating climate resilience into national development plans.




The $6.2 billion target is part of Rwanda's broader climate finance goal, which seeks to support the implementation of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), aimed at reducing carbon emissions and enhancing the country’s resilience to climate impacts. The government has also set ambitious goals to increase green energy production, promote sustainable agriculture, and invest in nature-based solutions, such as forest conservation and ecosystem restoration.

Rwanda’s push for a comprehensive, innovative climate finance strategy comes as the world grapples with the escalating impacts of climate change. The success of the strategy will depend on strong partnerships with both local and international stakeholders, including the private sector, development banks, and multilateral climate funds.




Rwanda's presentation at COP29 exhibits the country’s determination to implement its climate action plans at an accelerated pace, ensuring that it remains on track to meet its 2030 targets while contributing to the global fight against climate change. The $6.2 billion funding goal marks a pivotal moment in Rwanda’s climate action journey and sets the stage for a sustainable future for the nation and the region. As global leaders continue to meet in Baku, Rwanda's strategic approach to climate finance is a call to action for the international community to increase support for climate solutions, particularly in Africa, where the effects of climate change are already being felt most acutely.




Rwanda’s National Climate and Nature Finance Strategy signals a new era of climate action and investment, one that aims to deliver both environmental sustainability and economic growth for the country.

BREAKING: Donald Trump wins 2024 US presidential elections after beating Kamala Harris

09:40, 2024-11-06

In a stunning turn of events that has sent shockwaves through the nation, former President Donald Trump is projected to defeat Vice President Kamala Harris in a fiercely contested presidential race, securing 276 electoral votes with key battleground states still counting. The outcome is shaping up to be one of the most significant in American political history—one that marks the return of a polarizing figure to the White House, just four years after his contentious loss in 2020.

With Trump's victory in Wisconsin, a state once considered a toss-up, his electoral count has crossed the 270 thresholds, effectively putting him over the top. As results continue to trickle in from other critical states, all eyes are on a rapidly changing map as both campaigns brace for the final counts.




This moment of historic consequence will undoubtedly shape the future of American democracy, as Trump—a man who faced two presidential impeachments, a criminal conviction, and numerous legal battles—prepares for an unprecedented return to the highest office in the land. If the projections hold, Trump will become only the second president in U.S. history to win two nonconsecutive terms, an achievement that carries a heavy weight in the ongoing debate about the resilience and future of American political institutions.




The road to the White House for Donald Trump was anything but conventional. His 2020 defeat to Joe Biden ignited a bitter battle for the presidency, with Trump refusing to concede and making unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. His attempts to overturn the results fueled the fiery rhetoric that led to the January 6th Capitol insurrection. Now, just a few years later, Trump has triumphed once again, despite the controversies and challenges that have shadowed his political career.




In a speech delivered before his projected victory was called, Trump declared he would usher in a “golden age of America,” focusing on revitalizing the economy, securing the nation’s borders, and addressing immigration reform—issues that have been the cornerstone of his political rhetoric throughout his career. The former president took to the stage early this morning to express his confidence in his projected win and celebrate the anticipated Republican control of the Senate, an outcome that will further solidify his grip on power should the race conclude as expected.

“The American people have spoken,” Trump said, his words carrying the weight of an incumbent returning to power after a turbulent absence. “We will restore greatness to this country, and together we will build a new era of prosperity.”

Despite these triumphs, the shadow of his past remains. Trump’s controversial legacy—marked by two impeachments, ongoing legal troubles, and accusations of undermining the very fabric of American democracy—looms large as the nation braces for his second term. Will his return to office bring the promised revival, or will it deepen the divisions that have fractured the country for years?




While Trump is celebrating his victory, Vice President Kamala Harris, who was originally seen as the heir to the Democratic presidency, faces a moment of reckoning. Harris is expected to address the nation later today, but for now, her silence speaks volumes as the election’s outcome continues to unfold. Her campaign, which struggled to gain momentum against the formidable figure of Trump, now faces the daunting task of regrouping in the face of a monumental defeat.

Political analysts predict that Trump’s comeback will dominate the conversation in the coming days as the nation confronts the implications of his victory. From a divided Congress to contentious battles in the courts, it’s clear that the 2024 election results will shape the course of American politics for years to come. But the question remains: Can Trump truly unite the country he once led, or will his second term be defined by the same divisive rhetoric and bitter partisan warfare that characterized his first?

As the dust settles and the final votes are counted, one thing is clear: the story of the 2024 election is far from over, and its consequences will be felt for generations.

MINEMA Secures Over $26 Million from World Bank for Disaster Recovery Housing Initiative.

03:26, 2024-10-30

Kigali, Rwanda – The Ministry in Charge of Emergency Management (MINEMA) has successfully secured over $26 million (approximately Rwf 33 billion) in loans and grants from the World Bank to support the construction of homes for families in disaster-affected districts across Rwanda. This funding is a key part of a disaster recovery program initiated in response to the devastating heavy rains that occurred on May 2 and 3, 2023, resulting in the deaths of at least 135 individuals and displacing numerous families.




The emergency ministry reports that the allocated funds will facilitate the rehabilitation and reconstruction of a total of 6,218 houses. To date, 2,830 of these homes are currently under construction, 2,052 have been completed, and 1,335 remain to be addressed.

Major General (Rtd) Albert Murasira, the Minister in Charge of Emergency Management, emphasized the government's commitment to providing safe housing for affected families.




“Constructing and rehabilitating homes for families hit by disasters is within the government’s capacity, and it is progressing well,” he stated.

Minister Murasira further explained, “We have constructed houses for those who had plots, and we are now dealing with expropriation for those remaining and ensuring they receive their homes. We have secured the funds, and we aim to complete this program by June next year, ensuring everyone has their house finalized.”




Lambert Dushimimana, the Governor of Western Province, acknowledged the ongoing risks of disasters in the region but highlighted the resilience of the local population. “Even though the region has a high risk of disasters, the population is adapting and finding ways to cope,” he noted.

The World Bank funding not only aims to provide immediate shelter but also seeks to strengthen the resilience of communities against future disasters. As reconstruction efforts continue, the government remains focused on implementing effective disaster management strategies to mitigate risks and enhance community preparedness.




This significant financial support puts MINEMA in an advantaged position of taking crucial steps toward rebuilding lives and restoring hope for families affected by last year’s tragic events.

03:15, 2024-10-30

Kigali, Rwanda – Renowned South African music icon Yvonne Chaka Chaka will take center stage at ACCES 2024, where she will deliver a keynote session aimed at inspiring artists and industry stakeholders. The session will focus on the critical themes of collaboration, fair compensation, and equal opportunities for African musicians within an increasingly globalized music industry.




The keynote presentation, organized in partnership with the Rwanda Arts Initiative, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to the development and professionalization of Rwanda's arts and culture sector, promises to be a highlight of the event.

Chaka Chaka, often referred to as the ‘Princess of Africa,’ boasts an illustrious career spanning over 35 years. In addition to her musical achievements, she serves as vice president of the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers (CISAC), advocating for the rights and interests of artists across the continent.

ACCES, the premier music trade show focused on African music, will feature over 60 speakers from various sectors of the industry, offering a platform for discussions on the future of music in Africa. Attendees can expect to engage in enriching dialogues and networking opportunities designed to foster growth and innovation within the African music landscape. This will also see a couple of other Local artists feature in.




As anticipation builds for the premier of ACCES 2024, Chaka Chaka’s keynote is expected to galvanize support for musicians and advocates for systemic change, reinforcing the importance of solidarity and empowerment within the African music community.




President Kagame's. Address at CHOGM 2024: A Call for Unity and Action

04:49, 2024-10-28

In a compelling address at the 2024 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), President Paul Kagame underscored the urgent need for unity and proactive measures to address pressing global challenges, particularly climate change and youth employment.

Opening his speech, Kagame expressed gratitude to the Government and people of Samoa for their warm welcome and hospitality. He congratulated Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mata’afa on assuming the role of Chair, while reflecting on Rwanda's two-year term as Chair-in-Office with pride.




“It has been a great honour for Rwanda to serve, and we stand ready to support you,” he affirmed.




Highlighting the significance of Samoa hosting CHOGM as the first Pacific island state, Kagame emphasized the critical issues facing small island developing states due to climate change. “This is literally a matter of survival. We cannot ignore the voices of those bearing the brunt of this crisis,” he stated, reminding attendees that two-thirds of the world’s small states are Commonwealth members.

As the world approaches COP-29, Kagame called for decisive action rather than empty promises. “Let’s act and lead by example. Making empty promises can only move the needle for so long,” he urged, advocating for sustainable investments and favorable financial terms for developing nations to combat climate change without exacerbating debt burdens.




Turning to the Commonwealth's strengths, Kagame highlighted its youthful population as a vital asset. He stressed the importance of creating digital jobs for women and young people, framing innovation and technology as essential tools to tackle rising unemployment and irregular migration. “Artificial intelligence should not become a problem. If we use it responsibly, we can transcend the realm of our imagination and become even more resilient,” he noted.




Reflecting on the Commonwealth's evolution from eight founding nations to 56, Kagame reiterated the shared values of equality, diversity, and solidarity that unite member states. “Where we have the opportunity to right our wrongs, let’s do that,” he urged, advocating for respect and understanding as pathways to a common future.

Kagame’s address resonated deeply, setting a hopeful tone for the discussions to follow at CHOGM 2024. His call for unity and action serves as a timely reminder of the collective responsibility to foster a sustainable and equitable future for all Commonwealth nations.

Caffeine and Heart Health: Striking the Right Balance

04:13, 2024-10-28

Recent years have seen a surge in research focusing on caffeine's effects on cardiovascular health, prompting one critical question: How much caffeine is too much? In a roundup of the latest studies, Medical News Today explores emerging evidence regarding caffeine’s impact on heart health, revealing both potential benefits and risks.

Caffeine, a popular stimulant found in coffee, tea, and cocoa, is consumed daily by millions worldwide.




Many individuals rely on their morning cup to boost alertness and combat fatigue, while others enjoy it throughout the day for various health benefits. Given that approximately one in seven deaths globally is attributed to coronary heart disease, the cardioprotective potential of caffeine has become a compelling area of study. Recent findings highlight a dual narrative surrounding caffeine consumption. On one hand, some studies suggest that moderate caffeine intake may bolster vascular health and lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Conversely, excessive caffeine consumption has been linked to an increased risk of stroke, raising questions about safe consumption levels.




The most recent research, published in Rheumatology on October 9, adds to this ongoing discourse. This study found that higher caffeine intake may enhance blood vessel health, particularly in patients with lupus—a condition associated with a heightened risk of cardiovascular issues. This finding is significant, as individuals with lupus face an increased susceptibility to stroke and heart attacks. The implications of these studies are profound. While moderate caffeine intake may offer protective cardiovascular benefits, excessive consumption could pose risks. Health experts are emphasizing the importance of individual responses to caffeine, noting that factors such as genetics, overall diet, and existing health conditions can influence how caffeine affects heart health.




As research continues to unfold, the question remains: How much caffeine is too much? While definitive guidelines are still being established, moderation appears to be key. Most health professionals suggest that up to 400 milligrams of caffeine per day—roughly equivalent to four 8-ounce cups of brewed coffee—can be safe for most adults. As millions of coffee drinkers savor their favorite brews, understanding the delicate balance of caffeine consumption is essential. Ongoing studies promise to shed light on this complex relationship, paving the way for informed choices that can support heart health and overall well-being.



















National Savings Week Campaign Launched to Promote Financial Literacy and Growth.

03:58, 2024-10-28

Nyaruguru, Rwanda – October 24, 2024 – The National Savings Week awareness campaign officially commenced over the weekend, emphasizing the critical importance of saving and investing for personal development and retirement. Under the theme “Save-Invest-Prosper,” this year’s initiative aims to educate the public on the benefits of various financial products, thereby fostering a culture of savings essential for individual and national growth.




The campaign, which kicked off on October 24, highlights the role of mobilizing savings as a priority within the country’s 5-year second National Strategy for Transformation (NST2). The goal is ambitious: to increase the savings rate from the current 12.5% of GDP under NST1 to 26% of GDP by 2029. Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, Yusuf Murangwa, addressed attendees at the launch, stating,




“There have been improvements in terms of savings; however, it is not enough. We need to save more. Increased savings and investments will help offset high interest rates, ensure access to low-interest credit, and contribute to our dignity as a self-sufficient nation.”




The campaign emphasizes the necessity of making saving a habit for Rwandans to secure their financial futures, support their families, and foster sustainable economic growth. Key activities planned for the week include showcases by financial service providers highlighting their savings products, media talk shows featuring financial experts, and mini expos designed to inform the public about practical saving strategies.




The official launch took place in Nyaruguru District, where various stakeholders—including local government officials, banking representatives, development partners, and security agencies—joined community members in a tree-planting initiative aimed at combating climate change. This event also featured savings groups from Kibeho, which showcased products stemming from projects initiated after their involvement with CARE International, a development partner.




National Savings Week will culminate on October 30, 2024, with the celebration of International Savings Day, which aims to promote savings on a global scale. The initiative is a significant step towards cultivating a savings culture that will benefit both individuals and the nation as a whole, paving the way for enhanced economic stability and growth.

Rwanda's Economic Growth Resilient Amid Global Challenges, Says IMF.

11:35, 2024-10-24

Rwanda's economic growth continues to demonstrate resilience despite a challenging external environment, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) team following a two-week mission to the country. The visit aimed to discuss policies, priorities, and progress on reforms as part of the fourth review of Rwanda's Policy Coordination Instrument (PCI), Resilience Sustainability Facility (RSF), and the second review of the Standby Credit Facility (SCF) arrangement.

In a statement released at the conclusion of the mission, IMF team leader Mr. Reuben Atoyan projected Rwanda's Real GDP to grow by 8.3% in 2024. This optimistic outlook is driven by robust performances in the services and construction sectors, along with a recovery in food crop production. Additionally, inflation remains stable within the central bank's target range, bolstered by tight monetary policies and favorable food price developments.




Mr. Atoyan noted that the recent 6.6% depreciation of the Rwandan Franc against the US dollar was a necessary step to facilitate essential external adjustments. He highlighted that international reserves were sufficient, standing at 4.5 months of prospective imports by mid-2024, providing a buffer against potential external shocks.

"Despite the challenging environment, macroeconomic policy performance through the end of June 2024 remained aligned with program objectives under the PCI/SCF arrangement. All quantitative targets were met, and reforms aimed at enhancing the transparency of public investments and strengthening the functioning of the foreign exchange market are progressing well," Mr. Atoyan stated.




The IMF team also emphasized the Rwandan Government's strong commitment to implementing climate-related reforms under the RSF arrangement. Initiatives for climate budget tagging, improving the climate resilience of public investments, adopting sustainability disclosure standards, and developing a green taxonomy are on track for completion in the coming weeks.

However, the IMF acknowledged that recurrent shocks in recent years have complicated the Government’s goal of rebuilding policy buffers. Fiscal consolidation has been slower than anticipated, resulting in a continued increase in the public debt-to-GDP ratio.




In response to these challenges, the Government reiterated its commitment to a prudent strategy focused on concessional financing while advancing a medium-term revenue strategy and associated compensatory measures. Efforts to strengthen oversight of state-owned enterprises, address fiscal risks, and improve corporate governance will continue to progress. Looking ahead, following the completion of the review by the IMF Executive Board in mid-December, Rwanda is set to receive US$ 95.9 million under the RSF and US$ 89.0 million under the SCF, further supporting its economic recovery and resilience initiatives.




Uganda’s Intelligence Foils Assassination Attempt on Former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta.

04:35, 2024-10-22

Uganda’s International Security Organization has revealed dramatic details about how they thwarted an assassination attempt on former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and former First Lady Margaret Kenyatta at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA). The revelation highlights the collaborative efforts between Ugandan and Kenyan intelligence agencies in ensuring the safety of high-profile figures.




According to the Africa Confidential blog, the incident unfolded on July 19, 2019, when Ugandan intelligence received a tip-off regarding a plot to kill President Kenyatta using a suicide bomber. Acting swiftly, they alerted their Kenyan counterparts, prompting immediate security measures at the airport.

The plot involved a lone assassin who had managed to infiltrate JKIA as a casual worker just a week prior to the planned attack. Reports indicate that the individual was hired from Atbara, a city in northern Sudan, and was smuggled into Nairobi by operatives based in Kenya.




The assassin was reportedly set to position himself at the Presidential Pavilion, intending to detonate the bomb upon President Kenyatta’s arrival. Sources suggest that the resulting explosion would have had catastrophic consequences, with a lethal radius of four meters, leaving no chance of survival for anyone nearby.

Due to the threat, President Kenyatta’s departure was delayed by four hours while security teams worked to neutralize the situation. This incident underscores the ongoing challenges faced by leaders in the region and the importance of robust intelligence cooperation to prevent potential threats.




The successful intervention not only saved the lives of the Kenyattas but also showcased the effectiveness of regional intelligence collaboration in combating terrorism and ensuring the safety of prominent figures.

What next :Deputy President Gachagua Impeached by National Assembly.

03:41, 2024-10-14

In a significant political development, the National Assembly of Kenya voted on October 8 to impeach Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, confirming all 11 charges brought against him. The decision came during a late-night voting session that saw a substantial majority of lawmakers rallying to support the motion.

National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang'ula announced that a total of 281 MPs voted in favor of the impeachment, while 44 lawmakers opposed the motion.




"Article 145 (2) of the constitution sets a threshold of at least two-thirds of members of the National Assembly to be considered in support of a special motion for the proposed removal of the Deputy President," Wetang'ula stated.




He confirmed that the vote exceeded the required two-thirds majority.

The matter will now move to the Senate, where the Speaker is expected to convene a seven-day meeting to review the charges against Gachagua. This impeachment marks a historic moment, as Gachagua becomes the first deputy president to be removed under the revised 2010 constitution.




The motion for impeachment was brought forth by Kibwezi West MP Mutuse Mwengi, who accused Gachagua of unlawfully acquiring assets that were inconsistent with his declared salary and violating multiple laws, including the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act. Additionally, Gachagua faced allegations of undermining President William Ruto and the Cabinet through public statements that contradicted government policy.

Other serious accusations included potential violations of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act, with specific sections cited in the motion. The political landscape in Kenya is poised for further developments as the Senate reviews the case against Gachagua, which could have significant implications for the current administration.




28 Drivers Set to Compete in the 2024 Rwanda Mountain Gorilla Rally.

03:30, 2024-10-14

The excitement is building as the 2024 Rwanda Mountain Gorilla Rally prepares to kick off from October 18-20, with at least 28 drivers set to take the wheel in this thrilling annual event. Known for its challenging routes that traverse both Kigali and Bugesera, the rally is a prominent fixture in the African Championship calendar.

Kenyan star Karan Patel, the reigning champion from the 2023 edition, is poised to defend his title. Should he succeed, Patel will secure his position as the 2024 African Rally Championship winner for the second consecutive year. Currently leading the championship standings with 105 points, he faces minimal competition this time around, as two of his closest challengers—Ugandan Jas Mangat and Hamza Anwar—will not be participating.




This year's rally will showcase a diverse lineup of drivers from four African nations: hosts Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Among the confirmed competitors, seven are vying for points in the 2024 African Rally Championship, while 21 others represent national interests, including eight Rwandans and 13 Ugandans.

Patel, who drives a Skoda Fabia R5, has already made a name for himself this season with victories in Jinja, Uganda, Zambia, and Burundi. However, he will face competition from several notable drivers in Kigali. Fourth-ranked Ugandan Michael Jr. Mukula (19 points), his brother Kuku Ranjit Singh (18 points), and Dr. Mukasa Moustapha (17 points) are among those looking to make their mark in the championship.




Exciting this year is the participation of new blood and rising stars such as Prince Charles Nyerere, grandson of the late Tanzanian President Julius Kambarage Nyerere. He will partner with Rwandan co-pilot Fernand Rutabingwa in a Mitsubishi Lancer Evo X, adding a unique flair to the competition.




Rwandan representation is also strong, with drivers like Jean Claude Gakwaya, who previously triumphed in this rally in 2019 alongside Jean Claude Mugabo. Although that year did not feature competitors in the African Championship category, Gakwaya's experience will be invaluable.




The stakes are high in the African Championship, where the winner of the rally earns 35 points, with subsequent positions awarding 28 for second, 24 for third, 19 for fourth, and 18 for fifth. The sixth place finisher will receive 17 points, making every second count in this fiercely competitive environment.

The countdown to the 2024 Rwanda Mountain Gorilla Rally is on , anticipation builds not only for the race itself but also for the potential reshaping of the African Rally Championship standings. Fans and participants alike are gearing up for an exhilarating weekend of speed, skill, and stunning landscapes.

Rwanda Launches $10 Million Agricultural Biotechnology Program to Boost Crop Productivity.

03:17, 2024-10-14

Kigali, Rwanda – The Rwanda Agriculture and Animal Resources Development Board (RAB) and the African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF) have officially launched a five-year initiative aimed at enhancing crop productivity across the nation. The Rwanda Agricultural Biotechnology Program (Cassava, Maize, Potato – CMP), with a budget of $10 million (approximately Rwf 13 billion), is set to run from October 2024 to October 2029.

The program was unveiled on October 11, 2024, with officials highlighting its potential to provide Rwandan farmers access to high-yielding crop varieties, thus mitigating losses caused by pests and diseases. Minister of Agriculture and Animal Resources, Ildephonse Musafiri, emphasized that the program addresses the urgent challenges faced by Rwandan farmers, including the rise of fall armyworm and brown streak disease, which have significantly impacted maize and cassava production.

“This investment will enable Rwandan farmers to access and plant high-yielding crops, thereby saving the yields lost to pests and diseases," Musafiri stated. He reiterated the government's commitment to embracing innovative agricultural technologies, including biotechnology, as part of Rwanda’s strategy to improve agricultural resilience in the face of climate change and other adversities.

One significant legislative move to support this initiative is the enactment of the Biosafety Act in February 2024. This law ensures that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are safely managed in Rwanda, creating a robust framework for the introduction of biotechnological advancements.




The CMP program specifically focuses on three key crops: cassava, maize, and potatoes.

Virus-Resistant Cassava: This strain is engineered to combat the Cassava Brown Streak Disease, a major threat to yield and quality.

Late Blight Resistant Potato: Designed to withstand late blight, this potato variant aims to reduce farmers’ reliance on expensive and environmentally harmful chemical sprays.

Drought-Tolerant Maize: This maize variety is engineered to resist stem borers and fall armyworms, providing a safeguard against significant crop losses.

These innovations are expected to significantly enhance the productivity of crops that are vital to the Rwandan diet and economy. Cassava alone is cultivated by nearly 700,000 households, serving as a crucial calorie source in rural diets.




The program builds on years of collaborative research among various partners, including the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, the national agricultural research organization in Rwanda, and funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has invested over $9.8 million into similar initiatives. This partnership aims to leverage existing research to expedite the introduction of these improved crop varieties to local farmers.

By fostering local scientific expertise and building the necessary biosafety infrastructure, the CMP program is set to not only introduce innovative crop varieties but also enhance Rwanda's agricultural capabilities.

Rwanda continues to position itself as a leader in agricultural biotechnology within the region, the launch of the CMP program represents a significant step towards improving food security and agricultural resilience. The government’s strategic investment in biotechnology underscores its commitment to innovative agricultural practices that promise to transform the livelihoods of Rwandan farmers and contribute to the nation's economic growth.

Brave Students Awarded Full Educational Support for Protecting Rwanda Flag.

04:22, 2024-10-11

Ruhango District, Rwanda – Six courageous children from Cyobe Primary School in Mbuye Sector have been recognized for their bravery after braving heavy rain and a windstorm to protect the national flag on October 2. The Heads of School Organization (HOSO Rwanda) announced on the evening of October 9 that these students will receive full educational support upon their transition to secondary school.




The incident unfolded when nine pupils, aged between 10 and 13, noticed that the national flag was at risk of being blown away during a fierce storm that even ripped off the school roof sheets. In a display of patriotism, six of the students rushed out from their shelter to safeguard the flag, demonstrating a commitment to their country's symbol. Sister Hellen Nayituriki, the founder of HOSO Rwanda, expressed her admiration for the students' actions.




“Seeing a primary school student trying to prevent the national flag from falling, knowing it would mean the country falling down, brought me to tears,” she said. “These children represent the hope of our nation, and that’s exactly the kind of youth we aim to nurture.”




In recognition of their bravery, the HOSO Rwanda pledged to provide the six students with full educational support, including school fees, until they complete secondary school. Additionally, all nine pupils received scholastic materials and hygiene items to assist them in their current studies.

Seth Bayiringire, vice president of HOSO Rwanda, emphasized the organization’s commitment to the students’ education. “We’ve provided them with school supplies, and six of the pupils will receive full educational support until they complete secondary school,” he stated.




Aaron Mugirwanake, headteacher of Cyobe Primary School, praised HOSO Rwanda for its generous support. “The organization has pledged to provide full educational support until the students complete their secondary school studies,” he said. “In addition, they will support the school’s feeding program for the entire term.”




Mugirwanake noted that this initiative has instilled a sense of civic engagement among students. “This means a lot to the learners, as they now understand the importance of civic engagement, starting with protecting the school’s property. It has motivated them to participate in activities, big or small, related to the country’s protection, and other schools will follow our example.” To further cultivate this spirit, the school plans to organize weekly educational activities focused on civic and cultural initiatives, fostering a deeper understanding of community responsibilities among its students.

Kenya's National Assembly Votes to Impeach Deputy Hustler Rigathi Gachagua

19:40, 2024-10-08

Nairobi, Kenya – In a historic move, Kenya's National Assembly voted overwhelmingly to impeach Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, marking the first such action under the 2010 amended constitution. The vote, which took place yesterday, saw 281 Members of Parliament (MPs) supporting the motion, while 44 opposed it, and one MP abstained. This decisive outcome surpassed the required two-thirds majority of 233 legislators in the 349-member house.




The impeachment motion stems from various allegations against Gachagua, though the specifics of the charges were not disclosed during the voting process. The outcome has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, igniting a battle for influence as Gachagua’s fate now lies in the hands of the Senate, which serves as the trial house.




As the Senate prepares to deliberate on the matter, the focus will turn to the political ramifications for Gachagua and his boss, President William Ruto. The duo has faced increasing scrutiny since assuming office, and this impeachment marks a significant challenge for their administration.

Political analysts suggest that the Senate proceedings could reveal deeper divisions within the ruling coalition and test the loyalty of various factions. Gachagua's supporters have vowed to mount a robust defense in the Senate, while opponents are poised to leverage the situation to further weaken the president's hold on power.

In response to the vote, Gachagua expressed disappointment but maintained his commitment to serving the Kenyan people.




“I remain dedicated to my duties and will continue to work for the betterment of our nation,” he stated.

The political landscape in Kenya is now at a crossroads, with all eyes on the Senate as the next chapter in this unprecedented impeachment saga unfolds.

19:33, 2024-10-08

Kigali, Rwanda – The Rwandan government and the German Development Bank (KFW) have solidified their partnership with the signing of an additional grant agreement worth FRW 22 billion for the Pro-Poor Basket Fund. This agreement, signed at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN), follows an earlier commitment of 18 million euros made in 2023.




The signing ceremony was led by Ms. Mutesi Rusagara, the State Minister in charge of Resource Mobilization and Public Investment. She highlighted the significance of the Pro-Poor Basket Fund, explaining that it serves as a collective pool for development partners to contribute to key government priorities.




“This funding will greatly enhance our efforts in infrastructure development, especially as we embark on the National Social Transformation Phase 2 (NST II),” Ms. Rusagara stated.




The Pro-Poor Basket Fund is designed to support various development initiatives, ensuring that resources are allocated to critical areas identified by the Rwandan government. This strategic approach aims to bolster social and economic progress in the country. At the ceremony, the newly appointed German ambassador to Rwanda, Mrs. Heike Uta Dettmann, expressed her country’s commitment to supporting Rwanda's development goals. She praised the Rwandan government for its effective implementation of previous projects, which has encouraged Germany to continue its partnership.




“I travel a lot in this country, and I am pleased to see positive developments, such as children enjoying nutritious meals at school and local leaders engaging citizens on the importance of education and community health,” remarked Ambassador Dettmann.




This latest funding is expected to significantly contribute to Rwanda's ongoing development agenda, reinforcing the government’s commitment to improving the living standards of its citizens and promoting sustainable growth.

President Kagame Begins Historic Visit to Latvia, Inaugurates Genocide Memorial.

06:09, 2024-10-04

Rwandan President Paul Kagame commenced a three-day official visit to Latvia, marking a significant milestone in diplomatic relations between Rwanda and the Baltic state. The visit began with a tour of the Museum of the Occupation of Latvia, a prominent educational institution located in the capital, Riga.




Accompanied by Latvia's President Edgars Rinkēvičs, Kagame participated in a closed-door meeting on Wednesday, followed by a joint press conference. The visit is particularly notable as it includes the inauguration of a genocide memorial at the National Library of Latvia, which symbolizes the country's commitment to preserving the memory of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda and raising awareness about preventing future genocides.




Philbert Gakwenzire, president of Ibuka—the umbrella organization for genocide survivors' associations—hailed the memorial as a significant step toward international recognition of Rwanda's tragic past. He emphasized the importance of Latvia's initiative in commemorating the victims, stating, "This memorial will serve as a powerful reminder of the horrors of genocide and the need for global solidarity in preventing such atrocities."

This visit marks the first official trip by a Rwandan President to the Baltic States, as well as the first by an African leader to Latvia.

The memorial at the National Library, known as "The Castle of Light," will be the first dedicated to the victims of genocide in the Baltic States and Eastern Europe. Latvia, bordered by Russia and Belarus, is one of the three Baltic states, alongside Estonia and Lithuania. The country operates under a parliamentary representative democratic republic, with Prime Minister Evika Siliņa serving as head of government since September 2023. Edgars Rinkēvičs, who became President in July 2023, previously served as the long-standing foreign minister.




Kagame's visit not only strengthens diplomatic ties but also underscores the growing recognition of Rwanda's history on the global stage. As Latvia enhances its role in international efforts to honor genocide victims, this landmark visit signals a deepening commitment to memory, education, and the prevention of future atrocities.

Israel Bars UN Secretary-General Guterres Over Failure to Condemn Iran's Missile Attack

04:48, 2024-10-04

In a significant diplomatic move, Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz announced on Wednesday that he is barring United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres from entering the country. This decision follows Guterres' perceived failure to "unequivocally" condemn Iran's missile attack on Israel, which occurred amid escalating regional tensions.




On Tuesday, Iran launched more than 180 ballistic missiles targeting Israel, intensifying ongoing hostilities involving its proxy group, Hezbollah, based in Lebanon. While many of the missiles were intercepted by Israel's defense systems, some managed to penetrate its missile defenses, though no casualties were reported.




In a statement released on Tuesday, Guterres referenced the "latest attacks in the Middle East," but did not specifically mention Iran. He condemned the broader conflict, describing it as one marked by "escalation after escalation." The situation escalated further that same day, with Israel sending troops into southern Lebanon in response to the growing tensions.




Katz expressed his frustration over Guterres' statements, declaring the UN chief "persona non grata" in Israel. “Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran's heinous attack on Israel, as nearly all the countries of the world have done, does not deserve to set foot on Israeli soil,” Katz asserted. He emphasized that Israel would continue to protect its citizens and maintain its national dignity, "with or without Antonio Guterres."




The Israeli government's decision to bar Guterres reflects ongoing tensions not only between Israel and Iran but also highlights the challenges the UN faces in navigating Middle Eastern conflicts. As diplomatic relations remain strained, this incident adds another layer of complexity to the already volatile situation in the region.

Meet Salima Mukansanga a Pioneering African female referee who made history at the World Cup

04:38, 2024-10-04

Salima Mukansanga, an international football referee from Rwanda, has made history as the first African woman to officiate at the men’s FIFA World Cup. Born in 1988, Mukansanga has been a FIFA-listed international referee since 2012, marking a remarkable journey that began in her youth.

Initially involved in basketball, Mukansanga's foray into refereeing started when she was deemed too young to join the national under-17 basketball squad. Undeterred, she approached the Rwanda Football Federation to enroll in a refereeing course after completing secondary school, only to face initial rejection. However, her determination led her to self-study the laws of football, eventually earning a place in the course.




While pursuing her passion for officiating, Mukansanga also earned a degree in nursing and midwifery from the University of Gitwe. She began her career by officiating local amateur men’s matches and women's national second division games in Rwanda.

Mukansanga's groundbreaking achievements continued to accumulate when, in 2022, she became the first woman to referee at the African Cup of Nations, leading an all-women officiating team, including Fatiha Jermoumi (Morocco) and Carine Atemzabong (Cameroon). Her experience extends to high-profile tournaments, having officiated at the Olympics, FIFA Women’s World Cup, Africa Women Cup of Nations, and CAF Women's Champions League.




In November 2022, Mukansanga made history again as the first female African referee to officiate in a men’s World Cup match, serving as the fourth official during the match where France defeated Australia 4-1. Her contributions to the sport were recognized when she was listed among the BBC 100 Women in December 2022. Looking ahead, Mukansanga has been appointed to the officiating pool for the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, further solidifying her role as a trailblazer for women in football.




In a recent interview, Mukansanga reflected on her journey, expressing gratitude for her achievements and the doors she hopes to open for other women in Africa. “It’s an honor and a privilege because it’s never happened before,” she told the BBC. “It means you’re going to be the first one and going to open the door for other women, especially in Africa.”




She also shared insights into the challenges of becoming a referee, stating, “I didn’t know there is a lot to do – laws to follow, a mentality to follow, professionalism inside – but I started to learn step-by-step. It was very difficult. When you are reading the laws of the game, it’s easy to understand but inside the field of play, it needs some time to have a smell for the job.”




Salima Mukansanga's groundbreaking achievements not only highlight her personal dedication and resilience but also serve as an inspiring testament to the potential for women in sports, particularly in regions where opportunities have traditionally been limited. As she continues to break barriers, Mukansanga is poised to inspire a new generation of female referees across Africa and beyond.

Careless Driving and Poor Maneuvering Major Contributors to Traffic Accidents in Rwanda.

04:51, 2024-10-02

Careless driving and improper maneuvering have been identified as leading contributors to traffic accidents in Rwanda, accounting for 50% of the approximately 3,000 reported incidents from January to August this year, according to the Rwanda National Police (RNP).




The alarming statistics were highlighted by RNP spokesperson ACP Boniface Rutikanga, who noted that motorcycles, a popular mode of transport in Rwanda, have significantly contributed to the rising number of accidents. Among the various causes cited, improper overtaking and failure to navigate sharp corners emerged as critical factors in the increase of road incidents.

"Careless driving, particularly on sharp corners and during overtaking, often leads to vehicles veering off lanes or crashing," Rutikanga stated, emphasizing the need for greater caution among drivers.




According to the RNP, 20% of the accidents reported stemmed directly from drivers failing to properly assess corners or attempting risky overtaking maneuvers. The concern over road safety has intensified, with both rural areas and the City of Kigali seeing varying patterns of accidents. Rutikanga pointed out that while fatal accidents are more common in rural regions where drivers exhibit negligence, the City of Kigali has experienced a notable number of minor accidents.




To combat the rise in traffic incidents, the RNP has implemented various measures, including the deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) speed enforcement cameras. These efforts have reportedly led to a significant reduction in accidents, particularly those caused by speeding and drunk driving. Despite these initiatives, improper road-user behavior continues to be a challenge. Rwanda's unique topography, coupled with a rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the roads, exacerbates the risk of accidents. Ongoing public safety campaigns, such as "Gerayo Amahoro," aim to target specific road users, including motorcyclists and pedestrians, but the persistent issues highlight the need for ongoing education and awareness.




The RNP is urging all road users to take necessary precautions, especially when approaching sharp corners, overtaking, or driving in conditions with poor visibility. Additionally, passengers are encouraged to hold drivers accountable for their actions, report unprofessional conduct, and advocate for responsible driving to enhance their safety on the roads. As Rwanda continues to work towards improving road safety, collaboration among authorities, drivers, and passengers is essential in reducing traffic accidents and ensuring safer journeys for all.

Vice Presidential hopefuls Tim Walz and JD Vance criticize top of the ticket in the debate ahead of 2024 election

04:34, 2024-10-02

 In what may be the final debate of the 2024 presidential campaign, Vice Presidential candidates Tim Walz and JD Vance took center stage on Tuesday, engaging in a policy-driven discussion that highlighted the stark contrasts between their respective running mates. The debate comes just five weeks before Election Day, as millions of voters begin casting early ballots.

This marked the first face-to-face encounter between Minnesota’s Democratic Governor Tim Walz and Ohio’s Republican Senator JD Vance, following a recent debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.




The timing of this debate was particularly significant, coming amidst escalating global tensions after Iran fired missiles into Israel and facing domestic challenges like a devastating hurricane and a potential port strike.

Throughout the evening, Walz and Vance focused their criticisms squarely on their presidential candidates—President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. They took turns outlining not only the policy differences but also the contrasting character traits of their running mates.

Walz emphasized Biden’s commitment to unity and progressive policies, asserting that the President’s leadership is crucial for tackling pressing issues such as climate change and healthcare reform.




“The choice is clear,” Walz stated. “We need a leader who prioritizes the well-being of all Americans, not just the wealthy elite.”

On the other hand, Vance criticized Biden's policies, arguing that they have contributed to the economic challenges facing everyday Americans. He painted a picture of a country struggling under what he described as ineffective governance. “We need a change,” Vance asserted. “Donald Trump’s America First approach is what we need to restore our economy and strengthen our position on the world stage.”




As the debate unfolded, both candidates sought to introduce themselves to the nation, with Walz highlighting his experience as a governor navigating crises and Vance referencing his background in business and his connection to Ohio’s working-class citizens.

The stakes of the debate were underscored by the tumultuous backdrop of current events, as both candidates sought to reassure voters about their ability to lead effectively during uncertain times. With the clock ticking down to Election Day, Walz and Vance are acutely aware that every moment counts in swaying undecided voters.




As they prepare for the final stretch of the campaign, both candidates are expected to continue sharpening their messages and engaging with voters on the critical issues that will define this election. With the political landscape shifting rapidly, Tuesday's debate may prove pivotal as voters weigh their options in a deeply polarized environment.

Uganda Receives First Batch of Coated Line Pipes for East African Crude Oil Pipeline.

03:42, 2024-10-02

Monday marked a significant milestone in the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) project as Uganda received its first batch of insulated line pipes. This delivery, made by China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Co. Ltd (CPP), consists of nine trucks of coated pipes transported from the Nzenga coating plant in Tanzania’s Tabora Region.

The arrival of these pipes at the main camp and pipe yard in Kyotera District signifies the developers' commitment to accelerating the construction of the cross-border pipeline, which will connect oil fields in Uganda's Albertine Basin to the Tanga port in Tanzania.




EACOP Ltd, the project’s developer, indicated that the laying of the pipeline in Uganda is expected to commence soon, as efforts intensify to export the first barrels of crude oil by the end of next year.

"The project remains on track to meet its construction and operational timelines, with a continued focus on safety, environmental sustainability, and local community engagement," EACOP Ltd stated in a release.

Ali Ssekatawa, Director of Legal and Corporate Affairs at the Petroleum Authority of Uganda (PAU), hailed the delivery as a “major landmark” in the construction of the EACOP.




“This is a clear sign of the progress of the project. The government and its partners are committed to ensuring that all developments are completed in the most environmentally responsible and sustainable manner,” he added.

Civil works along the 1,443-kilometer pipeline have already advanced, with ongoing construction at pumping stations, main camps, pipe yards, and storage facilities. To date, the project has received a total of 800 kilometers of line pipes, which are currently undergoing coating and insulation processes at the Nzega Coating Yard.




In a bid to mitigate climate change risks, the EACOP project will utilize renewable energy for all pumping, heating, monitoring, and storage operations. The 296-kilometer section in Uganda is set to be fully carbon neutral, powered entirely by an 80MW renewable energy mix of solar and hydroelectric sources. Plans are also underway to develop similar renewable energy capacities on the Tanzanian side of the project.

With an estimated budget of $5 billion, EACOP is being developed by a consortium that includes Uganda and Tanzania, each holding a 15 percent stake. French supermajor TotalEnergies holds the largest share at 62 percent, while China National Offshore Oil Corporation Uganda Limited owns the remaining 8 percent.




As the project progresses, stakeholders remain focused on balancing economic development with environmental stewardship, ensuring that the pipeline construction benefits both countries while adhering to global sustainability standards.




Premier League Clubs Eye Free Agents After Transfer Window Closes

04:29, 2024-09-04

With the summer transfer window now closed, Premier League clubs have invested heavily in strengthening their squads, spending hundreds of millions of pounds. However, for those who missed out on their key targets or need additional reinforcements, the free agent market remains a viable avenue. This year’s free agent pool features several high-profile players, each with significant experience and potential.




Among the most notable free agents is Keylor Navas, the 37-year-old Costa Rican goalkeeper who recently departed Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). Despite a reported agreement to join Italian side Monza, the deal fell through. Navas, who enjoyed successful stints at Real Madrid and PSG, as well as a loan spell at Nottingham Forest, remains one of the most experienced goalkeepers available.

Former Tottenham and Nottingham Forest full-back Serge Aurier, 31, is also available after leaving Galatasaray. The Ivory Coast defender, a two-time Ligue 1 winner with PSG, offers substantial experience and could be a valuable addition to a Premier League team in need of defensive depth.







Joel Matip, 33, is another prominent free agent. The former Liverpool center-back, who was instrumental in Liverpool’s Premier League and Champions League successes, has departed after eight seasons. Matip has been linked with West Ham among other clubs, and his experience could be a strong asset for any team looking to shore up their defense.

Mats Hummels, a 35-year-old German World Cup winner, is also on the market following his departure from Borussia Dortmund. Hummels, who played in the Champions League final against Real Madrid in June, has been linked with a move to Roma. His experience in top European competitions makes him a highly sought-after option.







Brandon Williams, 24, who made his mark with Manchester United, is another notable free agent. Released after 51 first-team appearances, Williams remains without a new club and could attract interest from teams looking for young, dynamic defensive options.

Adrien Rabiot, 29, has left Juventus after a successful stint that included 212 appearances. The French midfielder, who was part of the squad in the 2022 World Cup final, has been linked with Manchester United. His experience in Serie A and at the international level makes him a valuable potential addition.Anthony Martial, 28, recently announced his departure from Manchester United. Despite his impressive record of 90 goals in 317 appearances, Martial remains without a club. Reports suggest Lille, who will face Liverpool in the Champions League this season, are interested in securing his signature.

Memphis Depay, 30, who helped the Netherlands reach the Euro 2024 semi-finals, is also seeking a new club. The former Manchester United and Barcelona forward has been sidelined by injury for much of Atletico Madrid’s 2023-24 season but remains a potent attacking option.




As the season progresses, Premier League clubs will be monitoring the free agent market closely. These experienced players offer potential solutions for teams needing to address gaps or add depth. With many high-profile names available, the remainder of the transfer period could see several significant moves as clubs seek to strengthen their squads and enhance their chances in the ongoing campaign.

African Leaders Gather in Beijing for High-Stakes Summit Amidst Shifting Dynamics.

03:53, 2024-09-04

Beijing, China – September 4, 2024

Delegations from across the African continent have converged on Beijing for a pivotal three-day summit, underscoring China’s ambition to reaffirm its role as a key partner in Africa’s development despite a slowdown in lending and rising tensions with Western nations.




In recent days, African leaders have been warmly welcomed in the Chinese capital with elaborate ceremonies featuring honor guards and traditional dance troupes. The event, showcased extensively by Chinese state media, is billed as the largest diplomatic gathering hosted by China in recent years. The summit, which begins on Wednesday, marks the first major gathering of Chinese and African leaders in Beijing since 2018. It arrives at a crucial moment in the relationship between Beijing and Africa—a relationship characterized by significant Chinese investments in infrastructure and growing political influence.




Historically, China's substantial funding has driven the development of highways, railways, and power plants across Africa, positioning China as a major economic and political force on the continent. However, this influx of capital has also faced criticism for contributing to unsustainable debt levels among African nations.

Amidst these concerns and a slowing Chinese economy, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his officials are expected to promote a new strategy centered on what they describe as “small yet beautiful” investments. This approach emphasizes sustainable projects and increased collaboration on green technologies, an area where China is a global leader.




The summit provides Beijing with a high-profile opportunity to advance its vision for future cooperation with Africa, particularly as it navigates increasing friction with Western countries. Xi aims to position China as a champion of the Global South, offering an alternative to Western influence, particularly in light of escalating geopolitical tensions with the United States.




African leaders are expected to use the summit to address several pressing issues. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has already called for China to address the trade imbalance and improve the structure of trade relations. Many attending the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation are from nations grappling with significant international debt, including substantial Chinese loans.

Leaders will likely scrutinize whether a 2021 pledge by Xi to import $300 billion worth of African products by 2025 will be met and will seek assurances that increased trade will not merely reinforce a pattern of exporting raw materials from Africa in exchange for Chinese manufactured goods.




The backdrop to the summit includes a notable decline in Chinese lending to Africa. Pre-pandemic, China had been a major source of funding for large-scale infrastructure projects. However, lending to African governments and state-linked entities dropped significantly during the pandemic, falling to approximately $1 billion in 2022 from a peak of over $28.8 billion in 2016. Although there was a modest recovery to $4.6 billion in 2023, it remains a fraction of previous levels.

African nations such as Kenya are confronting significant debt challenges. Kenyan President William Ruto, present in Beijing for the summit, is dealing with public backlash over a new finance bill aimed at managing the country’s substantial debt, which includes nearly $6 billion owed to China.




The summit is poised to be a critical juncture for China-Africa relations, with both sides facing important decisions about the future of their partnership. As African leaders pose critical questions and seek concrete assurances, the outcome of this high-profile event will likely have significant implications for both China’s role in Africa and the continent’s economic trajectory.

Ugandan Opposition Leader Bobi Wine Shot in Confrontation with Police.

03:45, 2024-09-04

Kampala, Uganda – September 4, 2024

In a dramatic escalation of political tensions in Uganda, opposition leader Bobi Wine was shot in the leg by security agents during a confrontation in the northern suburb of Bulindo, Wakiso District, just outside the capital, Kampala, on Tuesday. The National Unity Platform (NUP), the political party led by Wine, reported the incident and condemned the attack.




According to NUP, the shooting occurred during a clash between Wine’s supporters and police forces. Photos circulating on social media depict Wine surrounded by followers who were shouting that he had been injured. Supporters can be seen assisting Wine into a waiting vehicle as he appeared to be in significant distress.

The party's statement on X (formerly Twitter) alleged that Ugandan security operatives “have made an attempt on the life of” Bobi Wine, whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu. The party described his injury as serious, highlighting the dangerous escalation of tensions between the opposition and the authorities.




Kyagulanyi, a former entertainer turned politician, has been a prominent figure in Ugandan politics, especially among the younger population in urban areas. He first gained national prominence in 2017 when he won a seat in the national assembly, and he ran for president in the 2021 elections. Kyagulanyi alleged that the elections were marred by widespread rigging and fraud, which led to President Yoweri Museveni’s continued rule.

The confrontation on Tuesday is notable for being the first time Kyagulanyi has been wounded in such a violent encounter. Historically, clashes between his supporters and police have often turned violent, but this incident marks a new level of aggression.




As of now, there has been no official response from the police or other government authorities regarding the shooting. The lack of immediate comment has fueled further speculation and concern about the state of political freedom and human rights in Uganda.

President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, has faced increasing scrutiny both domestically and internationally. His administration has been criticized for its handling of opposition figures and civil liberties. Despite being a key ally of the United States in regional security matters, Museveni's extended rule and recent constitutional amendments—such as removing the age limit for presidents—have drawn significant criticism.




Uganda has struggled with peaceful transitions of power since gaining independence from Britain in 1962. The ongoing political unrest and violent confrontations reflect deep-seated issues within the country's political landscape.

Kigali Unveils Ambitious Five-Year Strategic Development Plan

03:37, 2024-09-04

Kigali, Rwanda – September 4, 2024

In a significant move towards urban development and environmental sustainability, the city of Kigali has announced its strategic plan for the next five years, marking a transformative phase for Rwanda's capital. The plan, unveiled at the Kigali City Headquarters, promises an array of projects aimed at expanding infrastructure, enhancing green spaces, and improving the quality of life for residents.




Infrastructure Expansion and Road Development

Central to the strategic plan is a comprehensive expansion of Kigali’s road network. The city intends to extend 25 kilometers of existing roads and introduce dedicated bus lanes to streamline public transportation. Additionally, 100 kilometers of new roads will be constructed to ease congestion and facilitate smoother travel throughout the city. These upgrades are designed to align with the Kigali City Master Plan, which envisions a more connected and efficient urban environment.




Swamp Redevelopment for Economic and Recreational Use

One of the most ambitious components of the plan involves the redevelopment of five major swamp areas. These swamps will be transformed into economic and recreational zones, potentially generating income for former inhabitants and the broader community. Kigali’s Mayor, Samuel Dusengiyumva, highlighted the environmental significance of this initiative. “We intend to increase our efforts to make Kigali a green city,” he stated. “These projects will not only make Kigali more sustainable but will also create habitable spaces with water recreational areas that can boost our tourism industry.”




Kinyinya Green Project and Slum Redevelopment

The Kinyinya Green Project is another cornerstone of the plan. This initiative will see the creation of a new eco-village designed to house approximately 250,000 people in its first phase. The development aims to set a benchmark for sustainable urban living. In parallel, a World Bank and French government-funded project will address slum conditions in areas such as Kagugu and Nyamirambo. The Slum Aid Project focuses on the redevelopment and re-planning of these neighborhoods, reflecting Kigali’s commitment to improving living conditions and infrastructure across the city.




Renovation of Nyabugogo Bus Terminal

The renovation of Nyabugogo, Kigali’s main bus terminal, is also a key project in the strategic plan. Vice Mayor Fulgence Dusabimana, in charge of Housing and Infrastructure, emphasized the necessity of updating the terminal. “This project has been long overdue,” he remarked. “The terminal was initially designed for a limited number of buses, but it has now become an international hub serving regional routes.”




Electric Charging Ports and Green Initiatives

As Kigali moves towards lower carbon emissions, the strategic plan includes the installation of electric vehicle charging ports throughout the city and its suburbs. This infrastructure will support the city’s broader goals of sustainability and innovation in transportation.

With these initiatives, Kigali is poised to enhance its infrastructure, foster economic growth, and promote environmental stewardship, setting a forward-thinking example for urban development in Africa.

Volkswagen, Seeking to Cut Costs, Considers German Plant Closures.

05:13, 2024-09-03

Volkswagen warned on Monday that it would consider closing factories in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history and end a decades-old guarantee of job security for workers, as it faces profitability problems amid increasing pressure from Asian competitors.




The company said in a statement that the measures were meant to shore up its namesake brand, but it declined to provide any details.

“In the current situation, even plant closures at vehicle production and component sites can no longer be ruled out without swift countermeasures,” the company said. “The situation is extremely tense and cannot be resolved through simple cost-cutting measures.”




IG Metall, the powerful union that represents German automotive workers, responded by saying it would fight any job cuts. It added that Volkswagen managers had told it that a cost-cutting plan announced last year was not working and that additional savings worth “billions” were needed. Volkswagen declined to confirm that number. Last year, Volkswagen and worker representatives agreed to measures that would save the company 10 billion euros, or $11 billion, by 2026. But those plans, which included job cuts largely based on attrition, are no longer enough, the company said on Monday2 September




“The European automotive industry is in a very demanding and serious situation,” Oliver Blume, chief executive of Volkswagen, said in a statement. “Germany in particular as a manufacturing location is falling further behind in terms of competitiveness. In this environment, we as a company must now act decisively.”




The automaker owns 10 brands, including Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, but its flagship brand remains core to its identity and that of Germany’s storied history as an automobile nation. But Volkswagen has faced falling sales, amid decreased demand in Europe, especially for its electric vehicles. Volkswagen’s share of the Chinese market, its largest market, has shrunk as fast-moving domestic rivals roll out affordable electric cars. Despite plans by the European Union to introduce tariffs on imports of electric cars from China, those competitors are starting to expand into Europe.




The German economy, Europe’s largest, contracted in the months from April to June, shrinking 0.1 percent from a year earlier. The latest figures dampened hopes that the country might be pulling out of stagnation, which analysts say is driven by high energy and labor costs.




Shutdowns of Volkswagen’s German factories would be a first for the company, which was founded in Wolfsburg in 1937. But closing plants, as well as ending the agreement that provides workers with job guarantees through 2029, will face stiff opposition from union leaders and workers’ representatives, who hold half the seats on the company’s supervisory board. Daniela Cavallo, a union leader and the head of the council representing Volkswagen workers, blamed company management for failing to develop a competent strategy and instead seeking to save by cutting jobs.




“We will fiercely defend ourselves against this,” Ms. Cavallo said in a statement. “There will be no plant closures with us.”

Clashes with unions have cost several chief executives at Volkswagen their jobs. Already the unions are gearing up for wage negotiations that are set to begin this fall. Nearly half of Volkswagen’s 650,000 workers around the globe are in Germany.

“The company — and the VW brand — are in a very dangerous situation,” said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Gelsenkirchen, Germany.




Bodies of Three Rwandan Victims and the injured Repatriated Following Fatal Bus Accident

04:55, 2024-09-03

The bodies of three Rwandan nationals who were among the eight fatalities in a tragic road accident have been repatriated to Rwanda, confirmed the Rwanda National Police (RNP). The accident, which occurred on Sunday, involved a Jaguar bus traveling from Kampala to Kigali and resulted in multiple casualties.




The deceased Rwandans have been identified as two men, both aged 62, and a 28-year-old woman. The accident took place around 2 AM in Masaka, District, when the Jaguar bus, registered under plate number UBP 964T, collided with a Canter Tipper truck with plate number UAV 988N. The force of the collision caused the bus to overturn, leading to extensive damage and fatalities.

A total of 30 passengers were injured in the crash, including six Rwandans. The injured Rwandans have been repatriated and are currently receiving treatment at medical facilities in Rwamagana, Nyagatare, and Ruhango.




According to Ugandan officials, the suspected causes of the accident are over-speeding and poor visibility. The tragic incident has drawn attention to road safety concerns and the need for improved measures to prevent such accidents.

The Rwandan government has expressed its condolences to the families of the victims and is working closely with Ugandan authorities to ensure that the injured receive adequate care and support.

Three Anti-Corruption Activists Remanded in Luzira Prison Following Nude Protest at Parliament.

04:33, 2024-09-03

The prosecution, led by Ivan Kyazze, informed the court that investigations were complete. According to the charge sheet, the state alleges that on September 2, 2024, Kobusingye, Aloikin, and Kyenzibo, along with others still at large, conducted a half-naked procession on Parliamentary Avenue, Central Division in Kampala. The protestors, with anti-corruption messages painted on their bodies, allegedly caused public annoyance and obstruction.




The youthful protestors, identifying as ‘Uganda Freedom Activists’, had their breasts painted in the colours of the Ugandan flag and carried placards condemning corruption. They specifically called for the resignation of Speaker Among, who has been widely accused of corruption and is currently facing travel bans from the UK and the US.




The protestors were intercepted by security officers, including plainclothes personnel, as they marched through the streets near Parliament. They also criticised the government for its slow response to the victims of the August 10 Kiteezi landfill disaster, where 35 bodies were recovered, and several others remained missing after the collapse of the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) dumpsite.

Before their arrest, the demonstrators demanded an audit of the earnings and lifestyles of Ugandan lawmakers and accountability from KCCA regarding the landfill tragedy. They described their nude protest as a “symbolic act to denounce unchecked rampant misuse of public resources” by corrupt officials.




Under the leadership of Speaker Among and her deputy, Thomas Tayebwa, Parliament has faced growing public criticism, with social media-fuelled protests since July calling for her resignation. In response, security forces in Kampala have violently suppressed youth-led anti-corruption demonstrations, which President Yoweri Museveni, 79, has dismissed as “foreign-funded attempts to destabilise Uganda,” a country he has ruled since 1986 following a five-year guerilla war.

The protest movement has drawn inspiration from Gen Z-led protests in neighbouring Kenya, which have gained momentum via the microblogging app X (formerly Twitter).




Additionally, the August 10 Kiteezi landfill disaster, which buried residents and livestock under mountains of garbage, has sparked nationwide outrage. Despite repeated warnings about the landfill’s instability, authorities failed to take action until it was too late.

RwandAir Plans Fleet Expansion Amid Record Revenue Growth.

04:19, 2024-09-03

RwandAir has announced an ambitious plan to double its current fleet of 12 aircraft within the next five years, aiming to sustain the significant revenue growth the airline achieved in 2023. The announcement comes as the airline builds on a remarkable 82% increase in total revenues, rising from Rwf341 billion in 2022 to Rwf620.6 billion in 2023.




The news was detailed in the Rwanda Fiscal Risk Statement (FRS) for the financial year 2024/25, which highlights the airline's strategic efforts to mitigate fiscal risks by boosting its revenue streams. This growth trajectory follows a challenging period marked by a revenue dip due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw figures fall from Rwf334 billion in 2019 to Rwf271 billion in 2021.

RwandAir CEO Yvonne Manzi Makolo attributed the airline’s resurgence to several key factors: the burgeoning tourism sector in Rwanda, substantial investments in cargo services, and the expansion of the Kigali hub. “Since the pandemic, we have experienced an exceptional level of growth,” Makolo said.




“IATA projections indicate that air travel demand will triple in the next 20 years. We are positioning ourselves to capitalize on this opportunity.”




The airline has played a crucial role in boosting Rwanda’s tourism industry. In 2023, the country welcomed over 1.4 million tourists, nearly three times the number from 2021. Kigali has also emerged as a prominent destination for conferences, ranking second in Africa only after Cape Town. “Our extensive network and successful European and Middle Eastern routes have been pivotal in driving this tourism growth,” Makolo noted.

RwandAir’s cargo operations have also become a significant revenue driver. The airline recently introduced new cargo routes to Dubai and Djibouti and plans to add more as it receives additional aircraft. “Our cargo growth aligns with Rwanda’s strategy to enhance trade and connectivity. We are now able to deliver fresh produce to various international markets and import critical goods,” Makolo explained.




The Kigali hub has evolved into a major regional base, with over 60% of traffic coming from transit passengers. RwandAir has responded by increasing its European flight frequencies, including daily flights from London starting in May 2024. “Our goal is to solidify our position as a major African hub, enhancing connectivity across the continent,” Makolo said. RwandAir’s current fleet includes four Boeing 737-800NGs, two Boeing 737-700NGs, two CRJ900NGs, two Bombardier Q-400NGs, and two Airbus A330s, all in dual-class or triple-class configurations. Looking forward, the airline plans to expand its route network and explore new markets to drive growth across Africa.




“As we continue to grow, we are committed to improving travel, tourism, and trade. Our expanding fleet and network will support this vision, offering more convenient connections for both short- and long-haul journeys,” Makolo concluded.

This strategic expansion underscores RwandAir’s dedication to becoming a leading African airline and a key player in the global aviation market.

H.E Paul Kagame receives letters of credence from new special envoys to Rwanda.

04:32, 2024-08-29

On Wednesday, August 28, President Paul Kagame received letters of credence from eight newly accredited ambassadors to Rwanda. The envoys represent Russia, Italy, Venezuela, India, Romania, Mexico, Azerbaijan, and the United Kingdom. While some will be based in Kigali, others will operate from various African capitals.




Italian Ambassador Mauro Massoni expressed his commitment to strengthening ties between Italy and Rwanda.

“Meeting President Kagame was a profound experience,” Massoni remarked. “We already have a number of Italian companies in Rwanda, and our goal is to expand this presence.” He highlighted recent cooperation agreements between Rwanda and the Italian multinational energy firm Eni, which focus on agriculture, forest ecosystem protection, technology, and health. Eni, a leading global oil company, had signed these agreements in November 2022.




Massoni also noted the recent scholarships Italy provided to Rwandan students in artificial intelligence, reflecting the strong interest among Rwandan students in scientific fields.

India’s High Commissioner to Rwanda, Mridu Pawan Das, emphasized the warm bilateral relations between the two nations and vowed to elevate them further.

“Our Prime Minister has visited Rwanda, and President Kagame has been to India. I am committed to enhancing these fruitful relations,” Pawan Das stated. He praised Rwanda’s favorable business climate and the opportunities it offers for Indian businesses and investors.

Ambassador Ruslan Rafael oglu Nasibov of Azerbaijan, who will be based in Ethiopia, acknowledged the longstanding and productive bilateral relations between Rwanda and Azerbaijan. “We will work to elevate our interactions and foster deeper ties,”




Nasibov said, noting that 2024 marks the 20th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries. “We are committed to exploring opportunities in various sectors and achieving tangible results.”

Russia’s new ambassador to Rwanda, Alexander Polyakov, expressed his dedication to deepening the historically warm relations between Russia and Rwanda. “I have been instructed to enhance our mutually beneficial ties,” Polyakov said. He lauded Rwanda’s proactive role in African integration and peacekeeping efforts, particularly its stance on the crisis in Eastern DR Congo. Polyakov also highlighted the ongoing cooperation in nuclear energy, military affairs, and trade, and reaffirmed Russia’s support for Rwandan students through state-funded scholarships.




The new envoys’ appointments are expected to foster stronger international partnerships and collaboration in various sectors between their respective countries and Rwanda.
















Namibia to hunt 723 Wild Animals Amid Severe Drought

04:13, 2024-08-29

Namibia has announced plans to cull 723 wild animals, including 83 elephants, in response to severe drought conditions affecting southern Africa. The cull aims to manage wildlife populations in areas where grazing land and water resources are insufficient and to provide meat to those struggling with food insecurity.




According to a statement from the Environment Ministry issued on Monday, the cull will target both national parks and communal areas. The decision comes as Namibia grapples with one of the worst droughts in decades, having depleted 84 percent of its food reserves last month, as reported by the United Nations. The ministry highlighted that nearly half of Namibia's population is projected to face severe food insecurity in the coming months. With human-wildlife conflicts likely to escalate if left unchecked, the authorities have determined that culling is necessary to mitigate these conflicts. The meat from the culled animals will be distributed through a drought relief program.




In addition to the 83 elephants, the cull will include 30 hippos, 60 buffalo, 50 impalas, 100 blue wildebeests, 300 zebras, and 100 elands. Professional hunters and contracted companies have already culled 157 animals, producing over 56,800 kilograms of meat.




"This action is essential and aligns with our constitutional mandate to utilize our natural resources for the benefit of Namibian citizens," the Environment Ministry stated.

Southern Africa is home to one of the world’s largest elephant populations, with an estimated 200,000 elephants spread across Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Angola, and Namibia.
















Tanzania's former deputy health minister elected WHO Africa's regional director.

03:59, 2024-08-29

Dr. Faustine Ndugulile of Tanzania was elected as the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Regional Director for Africa on Tuesday, at the ongoing session of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa in Brazzaville, Congo.

Her secured 25 out of 46 votes, triumphing over candidates from Rwanda, Niger, and Senegal. His election was strongly supported by 25 African countries, including Kenya. He will succeed Dr. Matshidiso Rebecca Moeti of Botswana, whose tenure of two five-year terms concludes with this session.




A seasoned public health expert, Dr. Ndugulile has a background in microbiology and previously served as Tanzania's Deputy Minister of Health. His campaign focused on key priorities such as transforming African health systems to achieve universal health coverage, enhancing maternal and child health, and boosting health security, innovation, and research.




“My candidacy represents a collective effort to revolutionize Africa's health landscape,” Dr. Ndugulile stated in an earlier interview with The EastAfrican. “By prioritizing universal health coverage and improving maternal and child health, we can make significant strides in advancing health across the continent.”

He also emphasized the importance of fostering partnerships between African governments and health institutions. Dr. Ndugulile plans to address the service index for universal health coverage, which remains below 50 percent in many African nations.




Currently serving as a Member of Parliament for Kigamboni Constituency in Dar es Salaam, Dr. Ndugulile is also Vice-Chair of the Parliamentary Committee on Health and HIV/AIDS in Tanzania, and is active in the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and NEAPACOH. His extensive experience and commitment to health reform position him to lead significant advancements in Africa's health sector.
















New Legislation Aims to Enhance Accountability and Prevent Mismanagement in IBIMINA

03:53, 2024-08-29

The newly enacted ministerial order governing tontines, commonly referred to as ibimina, is expected to usher in a new era of accountability and oversight for these popular community-based financial schemes. The order, which took effect on August 21, 2024, introduces a range of regulations designed to curb financial mismanagement and enhance the security of members' contributions.




The order mandates that all tontines must be registered with the relevant sector administration. Registration can be completed online or through the submission of required documents to the sector administration, with no associated fees. This step aims to bring greater transparency and structure to tontines, which are collective savings and lending schemes where individuals contribute funds and extend loans based on mutually agreed terms.




Jean Paul Ibambe, a lawyer and expert on financial regulations, praised the new legislation as a significant advancement in protecting tontine members' investments. “The promulgation of this Ministerial Order is a positive development for the security of funds contributed by tontine members,” Ibambe stated. He noted that the lack of a legal framework and legal personality for tontines had previously led to numerous issues, including fraudulent activities and the inability to seek legal redress.




The new order allows tontines to acquire legal personality upon registration, granting them the capacity to engage in legal actions, such as suing for default. This development addresses a major gap in the previous system, where members were often left powerless in the face of financial misconduct.

In addition to legal recognition, the regulation permits tontines to establish and adopt their own procedural rules. The decentralization of the registration process further simplifies compliance for tontine members, making it more accessible.

Ibambe highlighted the importance of these changes by recounting a personal experience. “I was once part of a tontine where the leader absconded with funds. We were unable to pursue legal action due to the lack of legal personality. I am confident that this new order will prevent similar scenarios and offer recourse for affected members.”




Under the new legislation, sector administrations are tasked with providing guidance and facilitating compliance for registered tontines. They will also oversee adherence to the tontines’ rules of procedure. Additionally, the Ministry of Finance will oversee the promotion and regulation of tontines through its Department of Financial Sector Development.

The introduction of these regulations marks a significant shift towards greater accountability in community-based financial schemes, aiming to foster trust and stability in tontines across the region.
















Walz’s night, Bill Clinton’s dig at Trump, influencers flexing clout: DNC Day 3 takeaways

08:06, 2024-08-22

The Democratic National Convention’s third night showcased a familiar former president, Bill Clinton, and introduced more Americans to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, little known outside his state until Vice President Kamala Harris selected him as her running mate.

Walz, with his background as a former teacher and football coach, used his speech to put a small-town spin on the Democrats’ agenda of protecting individual freedoms and rejecting what they paint as the intrusive policies of Republican Donald Trump.

Wednesday’s program also highlighted plenty of up-and-coming Democratic politicians and media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who gave an energetic speech in support of the party’s ticket.

Here are some takeaways from the third night of the DNC.




Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and his family made an emotional appearance at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, Aug. 21, while he accepted his party’s nomination to serve as Kamala Harris’ 2024 running mate.

Walz came to the biggest stage of his career to applause from thousands in the crowd — and an emotional reception from his wife Gwen, and their two children, Hope and Gus, all of whom could be seen crying as he accepted the nomination.

"That's my dad," Gus could be seen saying, as he applauded and pointed at his dad on stage.




"Hope, Gus, and Gwen you are my entire world, and I love you," Walz, 60, told his family before the crowd at the United Center in Chicago, as Gus stood on his feet in tears, giving his dad an emotional standing ovation.







For years, Republicans have caricatured Democrats as coastal elites who have little in common with ordinary Americans.

Walz tried to use his biography as a hunter, teacher, football coach and national guardsman from the Midwest to disarm those attacks, which Republicans in the past have wielded with merciless efficiency.

His presence on the ticket offers a counterweight in a year when Republicans are trying to paint Harris as a California liberal with dangerous ideas.,







Eddy Kenzo Appointed Senior Presidential Adviser on Creatives by Ugandan President Museveni

07:50, 2024-08-22

Renowned Ugandan musician Eddy Kenzo, born Edrisa Musuuza, has been appointed as the Senior Presidential Adviser on Creatives by President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni. This new role places Kenzo, who also serves as the President of the Ugandan National Musicians Federation, among the growing list of over 160 advisers to the Ugandan Head of State.




Kenzo’s appointment marks a significant step for Uganda's creative industry, which has long felt overlooked by the government. The move is seen as an opportunity to bring more attention and support to the sector, potentially leading to substantial growth and development.

Kenzo, known for his international hits and contributions to the Ugandan music scene, is expected to use his influence and experience to advocate for the needs and interests of creatives in Uganda. His leadership in the Musicians Federation has already highlighted his commitment to advancing the industry, and this new role provides a broader platform to enact change.




Following the announcement, Kenzo’s partner, Phiona Nyamutoro, who serves as the Minister of State for Energy and Mineral Development, took to social media to express her pride and support.




"Congratulations on your well-deserved appointment

@eddykenzoofficial, proud of you always. Thank you H.E @KagutaMuseveni," Nyamutoro posted on her X (formerly Twitter) handle on Wednesday night, August 21.




Kenzo’s new position is being celebrated across Uganda’s creative community, with many hoping that his appointment will lead to increased government support and investment in the arts. As he steps into this influential role, the creative industry looks forward to what promises to be a transformative period under his guidance.

Challenges Loom for BRICS+ Reserve Currency as India Cautions on Feasibility

07:44, 2024-08-22

Creating a BRICS+ reserve currency is proving to be a daunting task, with Indian External Affairs Minister, Dr. Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, underscoring the substantial challenges involved. Speaking to journalists in New Delhi, Dr. Jaishankar highlighted the complexity of aligning the diverse fiscal and monetary policies of the bloc's member states, emphasizing that such an initiative would require considerable groundwork and alignment across multiple domains.







Dr. Jaishankar pointed out that, at present, the emphasis within the BRICS+ bloc is more on settling payments using each member's national currency rather than pursuing a new, unified currency. "BRICS members have their particular currencies, so, many of them say, why do I need a third currency to settle between us? Which is completely understandable. Sometimes it's a liquidity issue, sometimes it’s a trust issue," he explained during a briefing to journalists from the Indo-Pacific region.

The idea of a BRICS currency has been floated within the bloc, which consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, with the recent addition of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates. However, Dr. Jaishankar was clear about the significant hurdles in establishing such a currency. "For countries to have a common currency, you need enormous alignment of their very fundamental fiscal policies, monetary policies, economic policies… And when you look at BRICS’s standards, I think we’ve to be realistic about the extent of alignment among members."




The diversity of the BRICS+ nations poses a significant challenge to the creation of a unified reserve currency. Each country within the bloc has distinct economic frameworks, priorities, and policies that complicate efforts to achieve the necessary alignment. This sentiment is echoed by experts who question the practicality of a BRICS currency as a viable alternative to the U.S. dollar.

Richard J. Grant, a professor of finance and economics at Cumberland University, Tennessee, and an analyst for the Free Market Foundation, elaborated on these concerns in a recent paper. "Certainly, each of the member countries has an interest in maintaining and spreading the reach of its national currency," Grant observed. He emphasized that each currency within the bloc serves multiple roles—as a domestic unit of account, medium of exchange, policy instrument, and a source of government revenue through seigniorage.

Grant also noted that those advocating for an alternative currency within BRICS+ are, in reality, pushing for broader international acceptance of their national currencies rather than the creation of a wholly new currency.




In the lead-up to the BRICS summit held in South Africa in August 2023, India's Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan reiterated the bloc’s current approach, stating that discussions have primarily focused on increasing trade in national currencies rather than on establishing a common currency. This approach reflects the practical challenges that lie ahead in developing a BRICS reserve currency.

Key issues complicating the development of a BRICS currency include the availability and liquidity of the currency, the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, the adequacy of banking infrastructure, and the level of international acceptance such a currency would require.




BRICS+ bloc continues to explore its options for economic cooperation and integration, the idea of a reserve currency remains an aspirational goal rather than an imminent reality. The intricate balance of national interests, economic strategies, and practical considerations suggests that the creation of a BRICS+ currency, while theoretically intriguing, is fraught with significant challenges that may take years, if not decades, to overcome. For now, the bloc seems poised to continue its focus on enhancing trade through the use of national currencies, a path that offers a more immediate and manageable means of fostering economic ties within the group.

Rwanda's Meat Production Nears Target as Strategic Investments Pay Off

07:38, 2024-08-22

Rwanda's ambitious target of producing 215,000 tonnes of meat annually, set in the 2018-2024 strategic plan for agriculture transformation, has been nearly achieved. The Rwanda Agriculture and Animal Resources Development Board (RAB) recently announced that the country reached 91% of this goal in 2023, producing 197,778 metric tons of meat during the 2022/23 fiscal year.

This achievement highlights the steady progress Rwanda has made in the agricultural sector, particularly in meat production. Solange Uwituze, the Deputy Director General of RAB, emphasized the significance of this milestone:

“The current data on meat production indicates that during 2022/23 the country has produced 197,778 metric tons of meat, representing 91% of the set target.”




Meat Production Breakdown

The composition of Rwanda's meat production in 2022/23 reveals a diverse livestock sector. Beef dominated the market, accounting for 35% of the total meat produced, followed by chicken at 22% and goat at 19%. Pork contributed 14%, while rabbit and lamb production accounted for six and five percent, respectively. These figures reflect a balanced and varied meat production industry, catering to different consumer preferences.




Economic Impact

The financial impact of Rwanda's growing meat production sector is evident in the country’s export earnings. According to the National Agricultural Export Development Board, meat exports brought in $22.3 million in the 2022/23 fiscal year, a significant increase from $8.8 million in the previous year. This surge in export revenue underscores the sector's growing importance to Rwanda's economy.




Strategic Investments and Challenges

Rwanda's success in meat production can be attributed to several strategic investments made by the government. These include enhancing the availability of vaccines and drugs for animals, increasing the capacity of hatcheries to produce day-old chicks, and establishing pig breeding centers. To support small livestock farmers, the government has also subsidized access to finance, offering loans at an attractive eight percent interest rate.

However, challenges remain. Uwituze pointed out that a limited number of farmers are engaged in professional beef production, which is essential for scaling up the sector. Another significant challenge is the competition between human and animal nutrition for the same raw materials, primarily maize and soya. This competition limits the availability of animal feeds, a crucial component for increasing meat production.




Looking Ahead

To address these challenges, the government is encouraging investment in professional beef farming. This includes training programs aimed at educating farmers on modern techniques such as breed selection, animal husbandry, and sustainable farming practices. Additionally, farmers are being encouraged to form cooperatives to pool resources and share knowledge, which can lead to better production outcomes.

To combat the issue of limited animal feeds, Rwanda is actively working to increase agricultural productivity, particularly in maize and soya production. The government is also exploring alternative feed sources that do not compete with human food, such as crop residues and agro-industrial by-products.




With Rwanda moving towards finalizing the next strategic plan for agriculture, which will include a new target for meat production, the country is well-positioned to build on its successes. The continued focus on innovation, investment, and sustainable practices will be key to achieving and surpassing future goals, ensuring that Rwanda's meat production sector remains a vital part of its economic growth.

A Cry for Equality: The Struggle of Persons with Disabilities in Rwanda's Public Transport System,

07:23, 2024-08-22

In the heart of Rwanda, where the spirit of resilience and community thrives, there is a quiet but powerful plea echoing from those whose voices are often drowned out in the hustle and bustle of daily life. The National Council for Persons with Disabilities (NCPD) has renewed its urgent call for public transport operators to make critical adjustments to their vehicles, ensuring that all passengers, regardless of their physical abilities, can travel with dignity and ease.




For many, boarding a bus is a simple, almost thoughtless action—a routine part of the day. But for people with disabilities, this everyday task can become an insurmountable challenge. Emmanuel Ndayisaba, the Executive Secretary of NCPD, speaks with a deep sense of responsibility: "We assess whether the available vehicles facilitate persons with disabilities, especially those traveling to districts outside Kigali. Priority should be given to assisting persons with disabilities before anyone else."

Ndayisaba’s words resonate strongly within the community of persons with disabilities. They know all too well the reality of what it means to struggle to board a bus, often relying on the kindness of strangers or the strength of fellow passengers. This struggle is most pronounced outside Kigali, where the few accessible buses in the city stand in stark contrast to the difficulties faced in the provinces.

Donatille Kanimba, the Executive Director of the Rwanda National Union of the Blind (RNUB), voices a concern shared by many: "The lack of accessible buses equipped with ramps or lifts exacerbates this problem, making independent travel a daunting task." Kanimba’s words cut to the heart of the matter—independence is something that many take for granted, but for persons with disabilities, it is a hard-won victory that can be easily snatched away by an unforgiving transport system.




The challenges extend beyond physical barriers. For those with visual impairments, the absence of bus conductors who once called out the arrival of buses has created a new layer of difficulty. "Without conductors, visually impaired passengers must rely on bystanders to alert them of an approaching bus. However, this is not always the case, and it leaves many unsure of when to board," Kanimba explains. The uncertainty, the anxiety of missing a bus or being left behind, is a heavy burden to bear.




Agnes Umutoni, a woman with a visual impairment, speaks with a quiet strength about the vulnerability she and others face. "Visually impaired passengers, in particular, are often targeted by pickpockets or would unknowingly receive incorrect change from dishonest conductors." The introduction of Tap and Go cards has been a welcome relief, but it does not solve all the problems. Umutoni also raises the issue of seating arrangements, noting that not all disabilities are visible. "Ensuring that people with disabilities are considered in seating arrangements, even when their disabilities are not immediately apparent, is vital for a truly inclusive public transport system."




David Gatete, a man with a physical disability, reflects on the progress that has been made in making public buildings more accessible. "As they have managed to establish accessible pathways for persons with disabilities in public buildings, similar efforts should be applied to public buses." Gatete’s words are a call to action, a reminder that true inclusion is not achieved with half measures.

The City of Kigali has made strides in ensuring that only transport companies with wheelchair-accessible buses are allowed to operate. Emma Claudine Ntirenganya, the city's director of communications and education, assures that more inclusive buses will be introduced in other regions. But for many, the pace of change is painfully slow. The need for accessible transport is not a matter of convenience—it is a matter of dignity, of human rights.




As the nation looks to the future, there is hope that these calls for action will not go unanswered. The voices of persons with disabilities, like a persistent drumbeat, remind us that until every person can move freely and independently, our work is not yet done. The journey toward equality is long, but it is one that must be traveled together.

Kenyan Aviation workers to hit the road in protest of the Adani deal.

05:08, 2024-08-13

Kenya's main aviation union said it would call a strike from next Monday over a proposed deal with an Indian company to develop the country's biggest airport – industrial action that could cause major disruption in the East African travel hub.

The Kenya Aviation Workers Union, which represents airport workers, said the proposed agreement announced last month with India's Adani Airport Holdings would lead to job losses and bring in non-Kenyan workers.

It called on the government to scrap what it referred to as the "unlawful intended sale of JKIA (Jomo Kenyatta International Airport) Adani Airport Holdings of India" in a seven-day strike notice issued on Monday.

Kenya's government has said the airport is not for sale and that no decision had been made on whether to proceed with what it called a proposed public-private partnership to upgrade the hub.

An Adani Group spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment.

Any walkout could also cause significant disruption to national carrier Kenya Airways.

"We shall reconsider our intention to engage in industrial action ... only if the Adani Airport Holdings Limited's deal is abandoned in its entirety," Kenya Aviation Workers Union Secretary General Moss Ndiema said in the strike notice.

He repeated a call for the entire board of the Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) to resign.

The KAA confirmed on Monday that it had received a strike notice.

"We are hopeful that a resolution can be reached through negotiation," spokesperson Elijah Miano said.

The authority has said Adani would add a second runway at JKIA and upgrade the passenger terminal.

Kenya Airways CEO Allan Kilavuka did not respond to a request for comment.

The government said in a statement on the Adani proposal last month that JKIA was stretched beyond its capacity of 7.5 million passengers a year and in urgent need of improvements, citing incidents like leaking roofs which it said had caused "international embarrassment".

The statement said modernising JKIA could cost $2 billion, which the government was "constrained to fund due to the current tight fiscal situation".

It said Adani’s offer was currently being reviewed. If a deal is agreed, the government said there would be safeguards to ensure Kenya's national interests are protected.

A nationwide youth-led protest movement that emerged in June over proposed tax hikes has also criticised a perceived lack of transparency over the proposed Adani deal.

Last month police blocked protesters from accessing JKIA, which they had aimed to shut down.




Ethiopia's flag courier Signs Agreement for Africa's Largest Airport, Set for Completion in 2029

04:27, 2024-08-12

Ethiopia has officially signed an agreement for the design of what will become Africa's largest airport upon its completion in 2029. The ambitious project, located near the town of Bishoftu, approximately 45 kilometers southeast of the capital Addis Ababa, is set to revolutionize air travel on the continent.

The new airport will boast four runways and a capacity to handle 100 million passengers annually, with parking facilities for 270 aircraft. This marks a significant expansion from the current Bole Addis Ababa International Airport, which serves as the main hub for Ethiopian Airlines, Africa's largest airline by fleet size and passenger numbers.




Mesfin Tasew, CEO of Ethiopian Airlines, announced the project at a news conference on Friday, highlighting the necessity for a new airport as Bole International nears its maximum capacity of 25 million passengers per year. "It is a five-year project that will be finalized in 2029. It will be the biggest in Africa," Tasew stated. The design contract has been awarded to Sidara, a Dubai-based engineering and consulting firm. Tariq Al Qanni, the company's director of operations, expressed confidence in the project's successful execution, noting that it will set a new benchmark for airport infrastructure in Africa.




The plans for this new airport were first unveiled in 2018, as part of Ethiopia's broader vision to enhance its transportation infrastructure and bolster its position as a key aviation hub. Mesfin disclosed that phase one of the project is expected to cost at least $6 billion, with financing secured through loans and commitments from interested companies.

Ethiopian Airlines continues to experience rapid growth, having carried 17 million passengers during the 2023/2024 financial year. The airline anticipates an increase to 20 million passengers in the current financial year, which began in July. The new airport is expected to play a pivotal role in accommodating this growth and further establishing Ethiopia as a central player in global aviation.




As construction begins, Ethiopia’s new airport is poised to become a symbol of the country's economic progress and a major gateway for international travel in Africa.

President Paul Kagame's Inaugural Speech: A Call for Unity, Hard Work, and African Self-Reliance

04:04, 2024-08-12

President Paul Kagame was sworn in for a new term as President of Rwanda, expressing profound gratitude to the Rwandan people and international guests. In his inaugural address, Kagame conveyed his commitment to serving the nation and highlighted the collective spirit that has driven Rwanda's progress over the past thirty years.

"I can only begin by thanking all Rwandans for putting your trust and confidence in me. It is an honour to serve as your President for another term," Kagame stated, acknowledging the support of the millions who participated in the electoral process. "There is a much deeper meaning behind what all of us saw and experienced. That reality is undeniable; it stems from the spirit of togetherness among Rwandans, as well as a shared determination to be the owners of our future."




Reflecting on Rwanda's journey since the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, Kagame noted, "Over the past three decades, what Rwandans have managed to accomplish is even more than we expected... Our tragic past ignited a fire in each one of us: a fire of hope, resilience, and justice. This is who we have become as Rwandans."

Kagame also addressed the ongoing challenges in the region, particularly the situation in eastern DRC. He emphasized that peace cannot be imposed externally but must be achieved through the efforts of those directly involved. "Peace cannot happen all on its own. We all have to do our part, and the right things, in order to achieve and sustain peace."




Looking forward, Kagame called for continued hard work and unity, underscoring the need for Africa to chart its own path. "This new mandate means the beginning of even more hard work. Why not do even better than we have done? That expectation to keep improving is not a dream, it is realistic. We can do it, and we will do it."

He concluded by reaffirming his commitment to the Rwandan people and to the broader African continent. "Above all, we will be together, and I thank you once again for renewing the privilege to serve our country. May God bless Rwanda and Africa, and all of us Africans."

Paul Kagame Sworn in for New Term as Rwandan President: A Renewed Commitment to Hard Work and National Unity

03:43, 2024-08-12

On Sunday, August 11, Paul Kagame took the Oath of Office as President of Rwanda, marking the start of his new five-year term. The ceremony, held at Amahoro Stadium, was attended by tens of thousands of Rwandans, along with 22 African presidents and other dignitaries.

Kagame, who secured an overwhelming 99% of the vote in the July elections, expressed his deep gratitude to the Rwandan people for their continued trust in his leadership. “Thank you for renewing my presidency and giving me the privilege to serve our country,” he said in his inaugural address.

Reflecting on Rwanda’s progress over the past thirty years, Kagame emphasized that the new mandate signifies the beginning of even more hard work. “For the last thirty years, our country has been a good work-in-progress. This new mandate means the beginning of even more hard work,” he declared.




Kagame’s vision for the future is rooted in a relentless drive for improvement. “Why not do even better than we have done? That expectation to keep improving is not a dream, it is realistic. We can do it, and we will do it,” he asserted.During his speech, Kagame paid tribute to the unity and determination of the Rwandan people, noting that the success of his campaign was a collective effort. The slogan “Ni wowe,” meaning “It’s you,” resonated deeply with him, but he stressed that the success belongs to all Rwandans. “It is not me alone, ni mwebwe, ni twese—it’s all of us,” Kagame told the crowd. The electoral campaign, marked by massive rallies and enthusiastic participation, was, according to Kagame, “a period of joy and satisfaction for all of us.” He attributed this positive experience to the spirit of togetherness among Rwandans and their shared determination to take ownership of their future.




Kagame also reaffirmed his commitment to consolidating national unity and fulfilling his constitutional duties. He highlighted Rwanda’s remarkable achievements since the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, which claimed over a million lives. “Our tragic past ignited a fire in each one of us, the fire of hope, resilience, and justice,” he said, recalling the liberation struggle that halted the genocide. Looking forward, Kagame emphasized the importance of addressing Rwanda’s challenges in various sectors, including security, health, infrastructure, and youth employment. “We are taking responsibility for our challenges and offering solutions. That is the mindset that brings us closer together and creates positive change over time for everyone,” he stated.

Kagame’s vision extends beyond Rwanda, with a focus on the potential of the African continent. He highlighted Africa’s rich history and the energy, innovation, and boldness of its youthful population. “Our youth are not afraid to change the status quo for the better, by demanding more of ourselves and from each other,” Kagame noted.




As Kagame embarks on his new term, the message is clear: the journey of progress continues, fueled by a collective commitment to hard work, unity, and the unwavering pursuit of a better future for Rwanda.

Rwanda and Italy Forge Partnership with 50-Million-Euro Climate Financing Agreement

21:47, 2024-07-30

In a significant stride towards bolstering climate resilience and sustainable development, the Governments of Rwanda and Italy have officially signed a 50-million-euro financing agreement. This collaborative initiative, represented respectively by Rwanda's Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning and Italy's Ministry of Environment and Energy Security, is facilitated through the Italian Climate Fund and managed by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP).




This agreement forms a crucial part of the Italian Mattei Plan’s energy security strategy towards Africa. The primary objective is to support Rwanda’s National Climate Action Plan, which aims to enhance the country’s resilience and adaptive capacity in response to global warming. The financial resources provided will be contingent on the successful implementation of a series of policy and institutional reforms. These reforms are designed to integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies into Rwanda's policy and regulatory frameworks, essential for achieving the national targets for carbon emission reduction.




Yusuf Murangwa, Rwanda's Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, highlighted the importance of this agreement, stating, “Rwanda has placed climate action at the core of its development agenda, as evidenced by our National Determined Contributions (NDCs). To effectively implement the mitigation and adaptation measures outlined in the NDCs, financial, capacity building and technology transfer are essential. Therefore, the agreement we have signed today will significantly contribute to this endeavor, estimated at US$ 11 billion.”

Echoing this sentiment, Gilberto Pichetto, Italy's Minister of Environment and Energy Security, emphasized Italy’s commitment to fostering growth on the African continent through climate initiatives. “Italy, through the Climate Fund, continues its efforts to create the best conditions for growth on the African continent. With Rwanda, we will invest in planning, which is necessary to address the major climate issues affecting that region,” Pichetto stated.




This financing agreement is part of a larger partnership involving a consortium of multilateral and bilateral financing institutions. Notably, it aligns with the framework of the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) agreement worth approximately USD 319 million, previously signed by the Government of Rwanda with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2022. Additionally, other key partners in this broader initiative include the World Bank Group, the European Union (EU), the European Investment Bank (EIB), and various European development financing institutions through the Team Europe Initiative, among others.




The collaboration between Rwanda and Italy marks a significant step forward in addressing climate change impacts and fostering sustainable development. By integrating climate resilience into national policies and leveraging international support, Rwanda is poised to make substantial progress towards its climate goals, benefiting both its environment and its people. This agreement not only underscores the importance of international cooperation in tackling global challenges but also highlights the role of financial support and policy reforms in driving meaningful change.

Weasel Manizo's Return: "Memories of Goodlyfe" Concert Set for August.

21:29, 2024-07-30

In a heartfelt tribute to his late brother and musical partner, Douglas Mayanja, popularly known as Weasel Manizo, is set to stage a monumental concert dubbed "Memories of Goodlyfe." This highly anticipated event is scheduled for August 2, 2024, at the prestigious Hotel Africana in Kampala city.




The concert, organized in memory of the legendary Goodlyfe duo, commemorates the vibrant legacy of Weasel and the late Mowzey Radio, whose real name was Moses Nakintije Ssekibogo. Radio tragically passed away in February 2018, leaving a significant void in the Ugandan music scene. Goodlyfe is celebrated for their numerous hits, including "Bread and Butter," "Nakudata," "Kuku," "Leesu," "Nyumbani," "Lwaki Onumya," "Neera," "Breath Away," "Magnetic," "Nakutamani," "Let’s Go Home," "Mr. DJ," "Juice," "Ability," and many others.




In a recent interview with City Radio, Weasel reflected on the profound impact of Radio's death, describing the period as one of intense personal turmoil. "Since the demise of Radio, who had become my brother, I have been tortured, and a lot has changed in my life," Weasel shared. He revealed that he initially abandoned performing as a form of mourning but later realized that Radio would not have wanted him to give up on his career. This realization propelled him back into the studio and onto the stage.




Weasel has since released several songs, such as "International Bae," "More Time," "Selector," "Kiuno," and "In My Room," a collaboration with Melody, whose real name is Manson Kakooza. Currently based in South Africa, Weasel is working on new projects, continuing to evolve his reggae, ragga, and dancehall fusion style.




According to Sandra Teta, Weasel's PR handler and girlfriend, this concert will not only be a tribute to Radio but also a celebration featuring other regional superstars. Teta hinted that the event might extend its reach to Rwanda, showcasing the far-reaching influence of Goodlyfe's music.




Joining Weasel on stage will be an array of renowned artists, including Jose Chameleon, Melody, Pallaso, Rema Namakula, Spice Diana, and more, many of whom share a deep history with the Goodlyfe duo. This concert promises to be a memorable evening, filled with nostalgia and a vibrant celebration of the enduring legacy of Goodlyfe.




Don't miss out on this historic event as Weasel Manizo and friends honor the timeless memories of Goodlyfe on August 2, 2024, at Hotel Africana, Kampala.

Kagame gives a deep insight on the reflection of Rwanda's Liberation Struggle..

18:31, 2024-07-10

President Paul Kagame shared an in-depth recount of Rwanda’s liberation struggle on Tuesday, emphasizing the challenges and resilience required to achieve victory. Speaking at the National Liberation Museum Park in Mulindi, Gicumbi District, Kagame highlighted the significant difficulties faced during the liberation and the unwavering commitment that led to success.




President Kagame, who led the military wing of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) Inkotanyi, spoke to content creators about the complexities of the struggle that ultimately ended the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi. He emphasized that despite understanding the magnitude of the task, the struggle proved to be even harder than anticipated. “We understood its magnitude and the weight of the work we had, but it turned to be much harder than we thought it would,” Kagame remarked




Kagame recounted the early days of the struggle, noting that the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) soldiers never underestimated the battle ahead. The engagement took place at Mulindi, the site that served as the political and military headquarters for the largest part of the four-year liberation struggle.

During the interactive session, Kagame shared a personal anecdote about his time at the US-based military college of Fort Leavenworth in 1990. Initially, the late Maj Gen Fred Rwigema had been nominated for the Command and General Staff Course. However, Kagame offered to take the course to avoid disrupting the ongoing preparations for the liberation struggle, which they had started while serving in Uganda’s National Resistance Army (NRA).

Kagame explained that Rwigema was leading efforts to mobilize Rwandans for the liberation struggle after peaceful means had failed. At that time, several senior officers of Rwandan origin in the NRA were set to be dispatched for training in different countries. Kagame had a suspicion that their covert plans to mobilize Rwandans to return home had been discovered by the authorities in their host country.




He suggested Rwigema stay and continue their efforts, while Kagame would find his way back when the struggle began. Tragically, Rwigema died on the second day of the struggle’s launch, prompting Kagame to cut short his training in the US and return to lead the movement.

Rwanda recently marked the 30th anniversary of liberation (Kwibohora 30) on July 4. This annual ceremony celebrates the bravery and selflessness of the men and women of the RPF-Inkotanyi, under President Kagame’s leadership, who liberated Rwanda and halted the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi.

'' A milk processing plant is possible here in Gicumbi'' Says Frank Habineza

18:19, 2024-07-10

Dr. Frank Habineza, the presidential candidate and chairman of the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda (DGPR), has made a significant campaign promise to establish a milk processing plant in Gicumbi District if elected. This announcement was made on July 10 during a campaign rally in Byumba Sector, Gicumbi District.

Habineza, who has frequently visited Gicumbi during his tenure as a member of parliament, emphasized the Green Party’s commitment to fulfilling its promises. "We are not afraid to canvass for votes because we have achieved over 70 percent of what was in our manifesto," he stated, underscoring the party’s track record of accomplishment. During the rally, Habineza outlined his plans to enhance public health insurance, ensuring all necessary medications are accessible under the insurance scheme. He also proposed improvements to the school feeding programme, promising to increase the budget to provide more nutritious meals for students.




This District is renowned for its high-quality cow’s milk, but it faces challenges in milk collection. While a milk powder factory exists in neighboring Nyagatare District, Habineza highlighted the need for a processing facility in Gicumbi to better serve the community and create job opportunities. “Although a factory has been built in Nyagatare District, there is a significant distance between there and Gicumbi. We plan to establish a factory in each sector to process the agricultural and livestock products available,” he explained.

Habineza assured area residents that if Green Party candidates are elected, they would help increase the value of milk produced in Gicumbi, allowing it to be marketed in Kigali and beyond. "Collection centres are good for storing milk, but we need to process it, package it well, and send it to Kigali. We can also export to Uganda due to its proximity. The key is to increase the value,” he said.




Habineza is campaigning alongside 50 parliamentary candidates seeking seats in the Chamber of Deputies. The party had two members in the recently dissolved parliament. The promise to establish a milk processing plant in Gicumbi is part of a broader vision to boost local economies and improve living standards. By processing milk locally, the Green Party aims to create jobs, reduce waste, and ensure that the high-quality milk produced in Gicumbi can reach wider markets, thus enhancing the district's economic stability and growth.




As the campaign progresses, Habineza and the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda continue to advocate for sustainable development, improved healthcare, and better education, reinforcing their commitment to a brighter future for all Rwandans.

“The launch of the Timbuktoo Fintech Hub today embodies our shared commitment to fostering and driving solutions to Africa’s challenges. The Hub will catalyze efforts to propel the Continent towards a more globalized way of doing business,” he stated. He further highlighted the importance of collaboration between government, policymakers, and key stakeholders to spur economic development in Nigeria and across Africa.

Timbuktoo represents a bold partnership between UNDP, African governments, and the private sector, positioning itself as the world's largest initiative supporting Africa's innovation ecosystem. It stands as a transformative force and a powerful example of public-private collaboration, poised to reshape the landscape of financial technology and development across Africa.

The launch of the hub signifies a significant milestone in the journey towards a more innovative and financially inclusive continent. By nurturing local talents and fostering cross-border collaborations, the Timbuktoo Fintech Hub is set to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of financial technology in Africa. This initiative reflects UNDP's commitment to harnessing technology for sustainable development.




“Africa is the place where ideas come from to unite the world. Our innovators are finding solutions to the most pressing global problems. Timbuktoo is about changing the way development works and investing in young talents. I invite you all to join and begin to see Africa from the lens of opportunity," mentioned Ms. Ahunna Eziakonwa, UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Regional Director for Africa, during the launch event.

The ceremony brought together key stakeholders—fintech entrepreneurs, investors, regulators, government officials, development partners, and industry experts—to celebrate the hub's potential to transform technological innovations in the financial services landscape for sustainable development in Africa.




Following the launch, the first Pan-African Cohort of Fintech Startups was onboarded, and a Fintech for Development Marketplace was held.

It also featured networking sessions, policy dialogues, and fireside chats with key ecosystem stakeholders, creating a platform for collaboration and knowledge exchange in the African fintech sector. The launch of this Fintech Hub marks the beginning of a new era for financial technology in Africa, promising to be a cornerstone for future innovations and development across the continent.

Somalia Pays Full EAC Budget Contribution for 2024/25, Ahead of DR Congo.

10:56, 2024-07-07

In a notable development for regional cooperation, Somalia has paid its full budget contribution of $7.8 million for the financial year 2024/25 to the East African Community (EAC). This timely contribution highlights Somalia's commitment to regional integration and contrasts with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), which joined the EAC two years ago and has yet to contribute any funds, according to a report by The EastAfrican.

Last month, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud’s government transferred $7,853,071, just before the EAC budget was presented to the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA). This significant contribution underscores Somalia's dedication to fulfilling its obligations within the regional bloc.

"The joining of Somalia places additional responsibilities and obligations on the EAC Organs and Institutions,” remarked East African Legislative Assembly MP Kennedy Mukulia during his presentation of the Committee General Purposes report. “Whereas the budget of the Community may seem to have increased, it should be noted that this increase is largely attributed to the contribution of $7,853,071 from Somalia.”




As of June 2024, DR Congo owed the EAC $14.7 million, Burundi $11.2 million, and South Sudan $8.6 million in budget contributions. Kenya had paid its full contributions, while other EAC partner states had minimal arrears, with Rwanda owing $920,869, Uganda $200,203, and Tanzania $122,694.

“There is an urgent need for disbursement of the outstanding contributions for FY 2023/2024, as well as arrears, to facilitate the activities of the financial year ending on 30th June 2024,” Mukulia emphasized.

Somalia recently reaffirmed its commitment to integrating into the EAC, demonstrating strong participation in a pivotal regional meeting held last month in Nairobi. This proactive approach by Somalia sets a positive precedent for other member states and reinforces the importance of mutual financial support within the community.




This full payment by Somalia not only strengthens its standing within the EAC but also highlights the need for all member states to meet their financial commitments to ensure the smooth functioning and continued development of the regional bloc.

Paul Kagame Promises to Transform Bugesera: "We Will Change the Narrative"

10:51, 2024-07-07

In a spirited campaign rally held at the Kindama site, Bugesera District, Paul Kagame, the RPF Chairman and flagbearer in this month’s presidential elections, addressed over 260,000 supporters from Bugesera and Nyanza districts. This event marked the second stop of the campaign trail in the Eastern Province, following a successful rally in Kirehe District.

Kagame's message was clear and poignant. He explained that his decision to build his home in Bugesera District was motivated by a desire to change the narrative of the region. Historically, the genocidal government had relocated hundreds of Tutsi families to Bugesera, leaving them to die from tsetse fly bites. "I chose to have a home in this district to change the narrative that being called a Bugesera resident sounded like an insult. We will transform Bugesera into a symbol of hope and progress," Kagame declared.




Kagame is set to compete in the presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for July 14-15. His opponents include former lawmaker Frank Habineza of the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda, and independent candidate Philippe Mpayimana.

The rally was marked by emotional moments, including a testimony from renowned singer Knowless Butera, who shared her experience of growing up in Bugesera with only one relative in post-Genocide Rwanda. She spoke about the numerous opportunities provided by the RPF-led government, including access to education and improved infrastructure. "Despite the hardships, I benefited from the opportunities put in place by the RPF-led government. I now enjoy a dignified life in Bugesera, and I assure the RPF Chairman of the young people's commitment to developing the country even further," Knowless said.




Under the leadership of Kagame and the RPF, Bugesera District has witnessed significant development over the past seven years. Key achievements include the construction of 78.8 kilometers of tarmac roads, a sixfold increase in homes with access to electricity, the establishment of the Kanzeze water plant, the building of 1,063 classrooms, the introduction of a mobile clinic at Nyamata Hospital, and the employment of at least 39,000 people under the VUP programme. Kagame's commitment to transforming Bugesera is a central theme of his campaign, and his supporters are hopeful that his leadership will continue to bring about positive change. As the elections approach, the people of Bugesera and Rwanda at large are reminded of the transformative power of leadership dedicated to rewriting history and fostering development.

Rwanda and Korea Sign $1 Billion Framework Arrangement to Boost Key Sectors

10:38, 2024-07-07

In a significant move to bolster Rwanda's development agenda, the governments of Rwanda and the Republic of Korea have signed a $1 billion framework arrangement. This agreement aims to provide concessional funding for a range of crucial projects, with financing channeled through Korea’s Economic Cooperation Development Fund (ECDF).

This new framework arrangement, effective from 2024 to 2028, replaces the previous agreement signed in 2022, which allocated $500 million for the period of 2022-2026. The enhanced funding aligns with Rwanda's second National Strategy for Transformation (NST2) and is set to support projects in key sectors of the Rwandan economy, including transportation, healthcare, and education.




During the signing ceremony, Rwanda's Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, Yusuf Murangwa, emphasized the importance of the partnership. "Rwanda-Korea current bilateral cooperation is aligned to our National Strategy for Transformation and plays a pivotal role in enhancing Rwanda's human capital for the 21st century, transforming our agricultural sector, establishing a foundation for ICT-led governance, and nurturing a thriving business environment. The framework signed is a significant milestone in our bilateral cooperation and provides assurances to achieve even more results in areas of our engagement," he said.




Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Rwanda, Jeong Woo Jin, expressed his confidence in the strengthened partnership. “I trust that the EDCF Framework Arrangement signed today will serve as a robust foundation to elevate the relations between our two countries to the next level after the inaugural 2024 Korea-Africa summit where H.E. President Kagame attended. I believe there is more room to cooperate in bilateral relations, especially based on the continuous cooperation in Agriculture, ICT, Education, Health, and Infrastructure,” he said




Rwanda and the Republic of Korea have enjoyed a longstanding history of warm bilateral and multilateral development cooperation dating back to 1963. Key areas of collaboration between the two nations include education and capacity building, rural development, healthcare, energy, agriculture, and information and communications technology.

This new agreement underscores the commitment of both nations to further deepen their cooperation and achieve significant developmental milestones in the coming years.

Rwanda's Educational renaissance: Ntare School's State-of-the-art campus Sets new standards

16:10, 2024-06-11

Rwanda is witnessing a rejuvenation in its educational landscape, with schools once again stepping up as incubators of talent. Despite past concerns over infrastructural and equipment constraints, there is a growing optimism for the future. Ntare School's recent initiatives exemplify this renewed focus on nurturing talent, heralding a new era of educational excellence.

Recently, Ntare School showcased its state-of-the-art facilities by hosting the national football team at its football stadium for World Cup qualifier training sessions. This comes at a pivotal time as Ntare School Rwanda, located in Nyamata, Bugesera District, begins accepting applications for its first intake, set to commence in September. The school recently opened its doors for a special event, inviting parents and guardians to explore the campus and understand its offerings before the official launch.




During the open house, families toured the campus, while children enjoyed activities such as swimming and other games. This allowed parents to interact and gain insights into the school’s ethos and infrastructure. “We have never had an event where we opened up the campus to parents and children, and families, to visit as potential candidates for our school and also partake in activities like swimming and soccer which we have availed today to incite cheer at our state-of-the-art campus in a natural setting,” said Damien Paul Vassallo, the head of the school. “I have never actually seen young people playing, having fun, and exploring the campus. Today, for the first time, Ntare Louisenlund School felt like a learning community.”




A panel discussion featuring the school’s head, two representatives from the Ntare School Old Boys Association (NSOBA), and interactive sessions with parents highlighted the school’s approach. Charles Kamuru, a university lecturer and NSOBA member, emphasized the founders' vision to integrate cultural heritage with academic excellence and robust extracurricular activities. “When the idea of establishing the school was developed, the founders made sure to preserve cultural heritage, academic excellence, and extracurricular activities,” Kamuru explained. Benjamin Manzi, Vice Chairman of NSOBA-Rwanda, discussed the school’s philosophy of freedom and self-governance. He noted that the school is non-denominational and inclusive of all regions, while emphasizing adherence to Rwandan cultural values. “




We have a Rwandan culture that every learner must adhere to. Learners will participate in proper sanitation of the school and we won’t entertain bullying,” Manzi stated. He also mentioned the formation of a debate club aimed at enhancing communication skills, confidence, critical thinking, and teamwork among students. “Learners ought to be competitive. During our time in Ntare School back in Uganda, we were expected to be present for both morning and evening preps, and teachers roll called. If a student missed preps thrice, they were dismissed from school. Students shouldn’t be chased after,” he added.

Vassallo highlighted the school's commitment to mentoring, with teachers engaging up to 10 learners each to discuss their goals, talents, and overall educational development. “We shall also make learning accessible for learners with special needs,” he pointed out. He elaborated on the school’s focus on academic excellence, particularly in STEM and young entrepreneurship, while personalizing education to meet each student’s needs. “Each child’s background, their special learning needs, interests, passions, and goals in life, play a role in contributing to the instructional design. So, we listen, empathize, and then adapt our instructional design to each learner to accommodate that learner’s goals and needs,” Vassallo said. “It’s really about personalizing learning in a very 21st-century way that schools of the 20th and 19th centuries didn’t do, as it was a one-size-fits-all program for students with some variation.”




The successful event at Ntare School marks a significant step in revitalizing Rwanda’s approach to education. As the school prepares to welcome its first cohort of students in September, it symbolizes a commitment to excellence and innovation in education, ensuring that future generations of Rwandans are well-equipped to thrive in a dynamic world.

Tragic Loss for Malawi: Vice President Saulos Chilima and Nine Others Confirmed Deceased in Aircraft Crash.

15:30, 2024-06-11

 In a heartbreaking announcement on Tuesday, President Lazarus Chakwera confirmed the death of Vice President Saulos Chilima and nine other individuals following the disappearance of their military aircraft on Monday morning. The aircraft, a Donier 228 belonging to the Malawi Defense Force, was found destroyed near a hill in the Chikangawa Forest, with no survivors.

"I am deeply saddened and sorry to inform you all that it has turned out to be a terrible tragedy. The search and rescue team found the aircraft near a hill in the Chikangawa Forest. They found it completely destroyed, with no survivors, as all passengers on board were killed on impact," President Chakwera said in a televised address. "Chilima was a good man, a devoted father and husband, a patriotic citizen who served his country with distinction."




The incident began on Monday morning when the military aircraft carrying the Vice President and nine others went missing from airport radars. According to earlier reports by the BBC, a senior military official suggested that the plane might have crashed in the forested region of northern Malawi. The aircraft was operating in adverse weather conditions when it disappeared.

The Vice President was en route to attend the funeral of the country's former Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Ralph Kasambara, who was found dead at a lodge in Lilongwe on Friday. Kasambara's body was buried on Monday at his home village in Nkhata Bay, a short distance from Mzuzu Airport.

The Donier 228 was scheduled to land at Mzuzu Airport at 10:02 a.m. (0802 GMT) on Monday. However, due to bad weather, the aircraft turned back toward Kamuzu International Airport in Lilongwe before it lost contact with radar. A search and rescue operation was promptly launched by security agencies around the Chikangawa Forest area.




Colleen Zamba, Secretary to the President and Cabinet, provided additional details: "The aircraft failed to make its scheduled landing at Mzuzu Airport due to bad weather and was returning to Lilongwe when it went off the radar."

The loss of Vice President Chilima has sent shockwaves throughout Malawi. He was widely respected for his dedication to public service and his contributions to the nation. As President Chakwera noted, "This is a significant loss for our country. Vice President Chilima was a pillar of strength and a leader who always put the interests of Malawi first."




In the aftermath of this tragic event, the country mourns not only the loss of its Vice President but also the nine other individuals who perished in the crash. Their identities are being withheld pending notification of their families.

The government has declared a period of national mourning to honor the lives lost in this devastating accident. As the nation grieves, President Chakwera urged Malawians to come together in solidarity and support for the families affected by this tragedy

Far-Right Gains in EU Elections Send Political Shockwaves Across the Atlantic.

15:15, 2024-06-11

 In a seismic shift that echoes the political upheaval of recent years, far-right candidates have achieved sweeping gains in the European Union elections, embodying a wave of populist nationalism reminiscent of the political climate that led to Brexit and Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential victory. This surge raises significant questions for U.S. President Joe Biden as he prepares for a challenging re-election campaign. The European elections, held this past weekend, saw a dramatic rise in support for far-right parties. These candidates share many of the hallmarks of Trump’s populist approach: a strong anti-immigrant stance, a fervent economic message, and a disdain for traditional governing elites and globalist institutions. This development arrives just as the U.S. enters its own election season, with Trump positioning himself as a key contender.




While U.S. voters are not typically influenced by foreign elections and the electoral processes of the two regions are distinct, the themes driving the recent European electoral successes are strikingly relevant to the American political landscape. President Biden faces a similar array of public sentiments, including concerns over migration, economic hardship due to inflation, and the financial burden of climate change policies. These issues resonate strongly in battleground states critical to the outcome of the upcoming U.S. presidential election. The European results highlight a broader political vulnerability for incumbents in an era of economic discomfort. As Biden heads to the G7 summit in Italy this week, he will meet with several Western leaders who have been politically weakened by recent events. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are both dealing with the fallout from a significant rebuke in the European elections, where far-right parties capitalized on voter dissatisfaction. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces low approval ratings, casting doubt on his political future, and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is bracing for a potential electoral wipeout in the next general election after over a decade of Conservative rule.




In a twist of political irony, the most secure leader at the G7 summit may be Italy’s right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. Her party’s substantial victory in the European elections positions her as one of the most powerful figures among the Western leaders, underscoring the unpredictable nature of contemporary politics. For Biden, a critical factor in his re-election campaign might be that the upcoming U.S. election is not a straightforward battle between an insurgent outsider and an unpopular incumbent. Trump, despite positioning himself as a challenger, carries the complex legacy of his previous term, including two impeachments and ongoing legal issues. Additionally, the rise of populist nationalism is not a universal trend. Biden’s Democratic Party managed to counteract “Make America Great Again” influences in the 2022 midterm elections. Furthermore, the anticipated victory of the Labour Party in the UK’s general election and Poland’s recent rejection of populist rule offer counterexamples to the far-right’s ascendancy.




As President Biden confronts these multifaceted challenges, the lessons from Europe’s elections underscore the volatile and interconnected nature of global political dynamics. The path to maintaining political stability and addressing voter concerns in an age of economic uncertainty and populist rhetoric remains a complex and ongoing endeavor.

MINECOFIN completes Automation of UMURENGE SACCOs, Paving Way for Advanced Financial Services in Rwanda

15:02, 2024-06-11

The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN), in collaboration with the Ministries of Local Government (MINALOC), Information and Communications Technology and Innovation (MINICT), and Trade and Industry (MINICOM), along with key government agencies such as the National Bank of Rwanda (BNR), Rwanda Cooperative Agency (RCA), and Rwanda Information Society Authority (RISA), and development partners including the World Bank, Access to Finance Rwanda (AFR), Deutsche Sparkassenstiftung für internationale Kooperation (DSIK), and the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), marked a significant milestone on Monday, June 10, 2024. The event at Kagano U-SACCO in the Kagano Sector of Nyamasheke District celebrated the completion of the automation phase for all 416 UMURENGE SACCOs.




This achievement marks a pivotal moment in Rwanda's journey towards enhancing financial services and paves the way for the consolidation of these SACCOs into District SACCOs (D-SACCOs), ultimately leading to the establishment of a cooperative bank.

Since their inception in the 1970s, SACCOs have played a vital role in Rwanda's financial landscape. However, a 2008 Finscope study revealed that 52% of the adult population faced financial exclusion. In response, the National Dialogue Meeting in December 2008 recommended the establishment of at least one SACCO in each administrative sector (UMURENGE) to promote economic development and financial inclusion.




Despite the formation of 416 UMURENGE SACCOs starting in 2009, these institutions encountered several operational challenges. Their business operations were largely manual, their scope of business was limited, and they lacked digital financial services for members. To address these challenges, the UMURENGE SACCOs automation and consolidation project, under the leadership of MINECOFIN, aims to professionalize these financial institutions through a three-step process: automation of U-SACCOs, consolidation into D-SACCOs, and the establishment of a cooperative bank to serve U-SACCOs and their members. The automation phase, now completed, involved transitioning U-SACCOs from manual to automated management information systems to enhance efficiency and member service. This transition is a key step in the broader consolidation process, which will merge automated U-SACCOs at the district level to form D-SACCOs. Existing U-SACCOs will become branches of these new entities.

Minecofin Commemorates Former Employees Lost in the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi.

06:57, 2024-06-03




As Rwanda continues to commemorate the tragic 100 days of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, various entities from both the government and private sector have come together to honor the lives of their employees and heads of departments who fell victim to the militias. In a spirit of remembrance and mourning, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINCOFIN) held a solemn ceremony to honor the 110 former employees of MINI PLAN, MINICOM, and MINFIN—entities that were later merged into MINCOFIN.

The event featured a moment of silence and candle lighting as a way to mourn these innocent lives. Speaking at the event, the head of research at the Ministry of National Unity and Civic Engagement (MINUBUMWE) explained the organized nature of the Genocide. "This was not a war in itself but an organized mass war crime based on discrimination of race and physical features, as described by former colonial masters and the Habyarimana government," he stated.

Survivors and relatives of the fallen were encouraged to stay strong for each other and to share testimonies about their loved ones when called upon. Hon. Richard Tusabe, the Minister of State for Finance in charge of the National Treasury, emphasized the importance of the annual event. "This annual event will continue as a way to appreciate the sacrifices of those men and women who overcame the odds to secure formal employment during highly segregated times, which made them direct targets," he promised. Tusabe also thanked the families of the former employees for providing relevant information so that their loved ones could be remembered.

The event, held at the Ministry Headquarters, saw attendance from various dignitaries including members of the diplomatic corps and MINCOFIN development partners. The ceremony was marked by the sharing of testimonies, particularly highlighting the story of the late Nyonyi Lambert, who worked as the head of finance statistics. Lambert, killed at age 31, left behind a pregnant wife and daughter who survived and now live in Canada.

The event concluded with the laying of wreaths at the memorial wall bearing the names of each victim. The wall features a flame of unfading light, symbolizing that although their lives were tragically cut short, they will never be forgotten.

Uganda Martyrs Day: A world's Pilgrimage of Faith and Unity journey

04:39, 2024-06-03

June is a public holiday in Uganda, dedicated to commemorating Uganda Martyrs Day. This annual event honors 22 Catholic and 23 Anglican converts to Christianity who were executed between 31 January 1885 and 27 January 1887 on the orders of Kabaka (King) Mwanga of Buganda.

Pilgrims' Journey from Lira

This year, approximately 820 pilgrims from the Lira Diocese in northern Uganda embarked on a remarkable journey, walking since 18 May 2024. Their destination is the Namugongo Shrine, where they aim to arrive by 31 May in time for the national liturgy on 3 June. The pilgrimage is more than just a physical journey; it is a spiritual and communal experience culminating in a colorful Eucharistic service.

Nebbi Diocese Leads the Liturgy




The Nebbi Catholic Diocese, located in North Western Uganda, will animate this year’s liturgy at the Namugongo Catholic Martyrs Shrine. The theme for this year is “But as for me and My Household, We Shall Serve the Lord,” inspired by Joshua 24:15. This theme underscores the commitment and faith that the martyrs displayed, a sentiment that resonates deeply with the pilgrims.

The Generosity of Strangers




Throughout their journey, the Lira pilgrims have experienced overwhelming generosity from strangers, parishioners, and schools. They sleep at various designated places, such as schools and parishes, and carry provisions to cook for themselves. Fr. Goddie Akio, the principal spokesperson for the pilgrims, shared with Vatican News the heartwarming support they have received. Locals have cheered them on and offered fruits, beverages, and other food items to help rejuvenate their strength on this walk of faith.

Mr. Akio also highlighted the spiritual activities that accompany their journey. Pilgrims participate in daily evening Mass, recite the Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, and fervently pray the rosary, seeking the Blessed Virgin Mary’s intervention. They carry prayer intentions for their diocese, the bishop, priests, and religious members, as well as for friends and relatives who couldn’t join the pilgrimage. Above all, they pray for love, peace, and unity in Uganda.

Ensuring Safety: Police and Military Protection

Road safety and security are major concerns for such a large group of travelers. Fortunately, the Ugandan government has assigned police and military units to escort the pilgrims from various dioceses, including Lira, Nebbi, and Gulu. The Uganda Police Force and the army have been accompanying the Lira pilgrims throughout their trek, ensuring their safety and providing a sense of security.




Catholic teaching in the Catechism recognizes the value of pilgrimages as an opportunity for Catholics to deepen their faith. Pilgrimages are seen as a reminder of the Christian journey towards heaven and are intense periods of prayer and reflection.

As the pilgrims make their way to the Namugongo Shrine, their journey stands as a testament to faith, community, and the enduring spirit of the Uganda Martyrs. The national liturgy on 3 June will not only honor the martyrs but also celebrate the unity and resilience of the Ugandan people.

























Angola's Petro de Luanda breaks the Jinx to Win BAL Season 4 in Kigali

04:13, 2024-06-03

In a thrilling climax to the Basketball Africa League (BAL) Season 4, Angolan titans Petro de Luanda finally shattered their four-year jinx, clinching the championship in a dazzling showdown at the spectacular BK Arena in Kigali. The electrifying atmosphere, fueled by the presence of President Paul Kagame and First Lady Jeannette Kagame, set the stage for an unforgettable final where Petro de Luanda triumphed over Libya's Al Ahly Ly with a commanding score of 107-94. City Radio's Jean Damas followed the weeklong tournament closely, bringing you five key takeaways from the action-packed event that kept basketball fans on the edge of their seats.




After three previous seasons of near misses, Petro de Luanda finally got their hands on the much-coveted BAL trophy. With a storied basketball legacy that includes two African Champions Cups in 2006 and 2015, the Angolan powerhouse had been aching for this moment. Their triumph not only secures their legacy but also earns them an automatic ticket to represent Africa at the 2024 FIBA InterContinental Cup in Singapore this September.

While many players dazzled in the 2024 BAL, none shone brighter than Al Ahly Ly's Jo-Lual Acuil Jr. The South Sudanese sensation, standing tall at 2.10m, set a new BAL scoring record with 42 points in a single game against Uganda's City Oilers. His stellar performance earned him the prestigious Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, a spot on the 2024 All-BAL Defensive Team, and the Dikembe Mutombo Defensive Player of the Year honor. Acuil Jr. truly left an indelible mark on the tournament.




Nigeria's Rivers Hoopers: A Force to Be Reckoned With

Nigeria's Rivers Hoopers put on a show that resonated across the continent, reaching the semi-finals in a display of basketball prowess. The Kingsmen, who outlasted former BAL champions US Monastir, were the champions of the Sahara Conference, showcasing a level of performance that Nigerian teams had struggled to achieve in previous seasons. Their journey to the semi-finals marks a significant milestone for Nigerian basketball.






Despite APR’s early exit at the conference stage, Rwandan fans did not disappoint. They packed the BK Arena in impressive numbers, creating a vibrant and supportive atmosphere throughout the playoffs. This year marked the worst performance by a Rwandan team since the BAL's inception in 2021, but the local fans’ enthusiasm and energy were unwavering, proving their passion for the game.




The BAL Season 4 wasn't just about basketball; it was a full-blown entertainment spectacle. With no Rwandan team in the playoffs, musicians stepped up to deliver unforgettable halftime shows, turning the BK Arena into a pulsating hub of music and sports. Headlined by Nigerian star Adekunle Gold, alongside Rwandan favorites The Ben, Bwiza, Ish Kevin, Kivumbi King, and Kevin Kade, the performances created a festive ambiance that perfectly complemented the high-stakes basketball action. The synergy between basketball and music was on full display, leaving fans with memories that will last a lifetime. In a season filled with dazzling dunks, record-breaking performances, and unforgettable moments, the BAL Season 4 in Kigali proved that basketball in Africa is not just a sport—it's a celebration of talent, culture, and unyielding spirit.

South Africa's ANC Faces Coalition Dilemma After Historic Election Loss.

04:06, 2024-06-03

South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) entered "permutation mode" on Friday, grappling with its lowest electoral performance since ascending to power in 1994. Preliminary results revealed the ANC falling below the critical 50 percent threshold, prompting the need to seek coalition partners among its political rivals for the first time in post-apartheid South Africa.

The ANC's diminished performance, predicted by a series of opinion polls, marks a significant shift in the country's political landscape. Now, Nelson Mandela’s party must negotiate alliances, an unprecedented move attracting considerable international media attention. The formation of a coalition government, though legally possible for decades, would be a novel development in South African politics.

This coalition-building process will profoundly impact the nation's future governance and international posture, given the divergent ideologies of the competing political parties. The ANC's main rivals include the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) led by Julius Malema, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) of former President Jacob Zuma, and the Democratic Alliance (DA) led by John Steenhuisen.




By Friday, speculation suggested that the ANC might reach out to the DA, which has maintained relatively fewer public conflicts with the ruling party compared to the EFF and MK. However, the DA’s predominantly white membership evokes memories of the pre-ANC era, despite recent efforts to broaden its appeal.

“The ANC needs a partner that can help stabilize governance without deepening existing political rifts,” said Johannesburg-based political analyst Mandla Mzimela. “The DA’s promise to 'Rescue South Africa' and its moderate stance might make it a palatable choice, despite historical tensions.”

The EFF and MK, meanwhile, consist of former ANC members who left the party under contentious circumstances, creating suspicion about their intentions. EFF supporters demonstrated their discontent vividly during the campaign, holding a mock coffin bearing President Cyril Ramaphosa’s face at their "Tshela Thupa" rally.

Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, daughter of former President Zuma, ruled out a coalition between MK and the ANC, citing her father's preference for alliances with "progressive black parties." This exclusion underscores the fractured relationship between Zuma and Ramaphosa, further complicating potential coalitions.




ANC national chairperson Gwede Mantashe stoked controversy by attributing MK's performance to tribalism. “I don’t think we should lock ourselves into Zulu tribalism. Tribalism is a backward form of politics; it has its timeframe and then disappears. If that is the factor, I am not worried,” he remarked.

EFF, originally a breakaway faction of the ANC, presents a more complex option. While sharing some ideological roots with the ANC, their radical positions on land expropriation and nationalization diverge sharply. Despite this, the EFF could still emerge as a coalition partner, given its significant electoral base.

“The ANC faces a challenging decision. Choosing the DA might alienate its core supporters, while aligning with the EFF or MK could introduce instability,” noted Mzimela. “This election result will likely influence regional dynamics, trade agreements, and foreign policy decisions across the Southern African Development Community (SADC).”







The ANC’s declining popularity reflects widespread dissatisfaction with persistent issues like unemployment, which stands at 33 percent, power outages, and rampant crime. Despite its historical achievements, the party has struggled to sustain progress in recent years, leading to voter frustration.

"People want sustainable jobs and basic services, which are absent," said Dominic Maphaka, a scholar from North-West University. "Recounting past successes won't save the ANC; tangible change is needed."

The electoral process itself was marred by protests, power outages, and logistical issues. Voters faced long queues and disruptions, particularly in Eastern Cape and Western Cape. Allegations of IEC property theft and obstructions further complicated the voting day.

Former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, leading the African Union Election Observation Mission, expressed confidence in South Africa’s electoral system but acknowledged the challenges. "I trust in the electoral system and believe in the importance of maintaining calm and confidence in the democratic process," he said.

As South Africa navigates this pivotal moment, the ANC’s coalition choice will shape the nation's future. The implications extend beyond national borders, potentially affecting the entire continent’s political and economic landscape.













Rwanda Poised to Develop National Central Bank Digital Currency.

03:34, 2024-06-03

In a bid to modernize its financial system and secure a foothold in the future global economy, Rwanda plans to develop a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) within the next two years. The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) announced this initiative, emphasizing the potential benefits of a digital currency, including enhanced financial inclusion and improved international trade capabilities. According to the BNR, the proposed digital currency will provide Rwandans with a safe, cost-free, and convenient alternative to physical cash, thus expanding financial inclusion by integrating more unbanked individuals into the formal economy. As digital currencies gain traction worldwide, Rwanda aims to ensure that its government and private sector can engage in international trade with greater ease.

However, the concept of a CBDC remains largely theoretical for many Rwandans, as it does for people around the world. In an exclusive interview, Soraya Hakuziyaremenye, the Deputy Governor at Rwanda’s Central Bank, shed light on the necessary steps to adopt a national digital currency and the potential benefits for the public.




"Rwanda’s main trading partners, like China, are already testing the digital Yuan, and the European Union plans to adopt a digital currency by 2025," said Hakuziyaremenye. "We needed to understand whether there would be benefits for Rwanda as well to embark on this technological journey."

The BNR recently published a feasibility study on the proposed CBDC. When asked about its relevance and findings, Hakuziyaremenye explained, "The CBDC would be a digital form of cash, similar to how Rwandans currently use banknotes, coins, and electronic payments. With Rwanda positioning itself as an ICT hub and striving to become a cashless economy and an international financial hub, it was crucial to conduct this research."

Hakuziyaremenye highlighted the importance of understanding both the technology behind a CBDC and the potential risks. "We didn't do it alone. We worked with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of ICT and Innovation to form a task force that examined developments in other countries. This collaboration started in 2022, and it was essential to consult banks, fintech companies, payment service providers, and other government institutions."

The early findings of the study indicate multiple opportunities for a national digital currency in Rwanda. "We identified four key areas: resilience to current payment systems, boosting innovation and competition among payment providers, accelerating our cashless agenda, and improving cross-border payments," said Hakuziyaremenye.




Regarding the next steps and timeline for introducing the CBDC, Hakuziyaremenye emphasized a cautious approach. "Issuing a national digital currency is not something you take lightly. We published the research paper and opened a public consultation process to gather feedback from the general population. Concerns have been raised about data privacy, resilience, and the potential impact on the financial system."

She further explained that Rwanda is mindful of regional developments. "We have close to 86 countries that have started piloting or are at the same level as us in research. Deciding to launch a CBDC requires collaboration with trading partners to ensure cross-border payments are faster and cheaper."

The public consultation process will close in four weeks, followed by a proof of concept to test the technology on a small scale. "This exercise will take roughly six months and will involve testing the technology in other countries, particularly for cross-border payments. Afterward, we will test the digital currency with a sample of individuals and companies to ensure its resilience and mitigate risks," she added. "Given this pace, we expect to have everything in place within the next two years."




Designing the CBDC also presents challenges. "Our preferred option is a retail CBDC, distributed through banks similar to current deposit and account systems. Another option is an indirect CBDC, where people have direct accounts with the central bank, but we don't think this is the right approach as we want banks to continue their role of intermediation," Hakuziyaremenye explained. "Lastly, we are considering a CBDC accessible offline, which is crucial for areas without internet access or during power outages."

As Rwanda advances in its journey toward a national digital currency, it continues to position itself as a leader in technological innovation and financial inclusion, setting the stage for a more connected and efficient economy.

ANC Faces Potential Coalition Government as Early Results Indicate Decline in Support

05:45, 2024-05-31

Initial results from the KwaZulu-Natal province and the national level suggest that the African National Congress (ANC) may lose its majority for the first time since the end of apartheid, prompting discussions of possible coalition agreements. According to reliable sources, preliminary negotiations between the ANC, Democratic Alliance (DA), and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) were initiated at the provincial level in response to the party's diminishing prospects. These discussions, aimed at ensuring stable governance through a possible tandem agreement between KwaZulu-Natal and the national government, remain in preliminary stages pending a meeting of the ANC National Executive Committee.




By noon on Thursday, the ANC's outlook in KwaZulu-Natal appeared bleak, with the uMkhonto Wesizwe (MK) party narrowly leading. The IFP had 36.8% of the votes, and the DA had 11.4%. By 7:30 PM, the situation worsened for the ANC, which held only 21.27% of the vote, compared to MK’s 43.4%, IFP’s 17.9%, and DA’s 10.3%.

With these percentages, the ANC would require a three-way coalition to govern KwaZulu-Natal, possibly involving a smaller party. However, MK has reportedly ruled out a coalition with the ANC, as per News24. The potential for a coalition involving the IFP remains uncertain, particularly given the presence of former President Jacob Zuma in MK's leadership.

The prospect of a three-way co-governance deal underscores the ANC's potential loss of its historical majority, both provincially and nationally. Since Nelson Mandela led the ANC to victory in South Africa’s first democratic elections in 1994, the party has dominated the political landscape.

Nationally, pollsters on Thursday showed the ANC hovering around 42%, a significant drop from the 57% recorded in the 2019 elections. The DA held around 22%, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) at 9%, and MK at approximately 10%. If these figures hold, MK will make a notable national debut, surpassing the EFF's 6.35% in 2014.




As of 7:30 PM, with only 30% of voting stations counted, the ANC held 42.31% of the national vote, followed by the DA at 24.6%, MK at 9.3%, and the EFF at 9.1%. The Patriotic Alliance ranked fifth with 3.4%, just ahead of the IFP.

The results, still subject to change as more votes are tallied, have caused concern among political representatives at the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) national results center at Gallagher Estate. Township voting stations, often late in reporting, could still impact the final results.

The ANC's position in KwaZulu-Natal has been precarious, even before MK's emergence. In 2019, the ANC secured 55.47% in the province, down from 65.3% in 2014. The province's significant voting population makes its support crucial for national seat calculations.

At the IEC national results center, the mood among ANC representatives was grim. Gwede Mantashe, ANC National Chairperson, criticized the vote for MK as “tribal,” while another insider described the situation as “shocking.”

IEC Chairperson Mosotho Moepya assured that all procedures were above board, despite concerns about the handling of the three ballots and voting inconsistencies. The IEC expects to declare final results and legislature seat allocations by Sunday, after which the new MPs will be sworn in, and the President will be elected and inaugurated.

Moepya acknowledged the ongoing process, stating, “We are looking at something that is still half-baked — no, it’s still in the oven.”

As the final results approach, the ANC faces the reality of forming coalitions to maintain governance, marking a significant shift in South Africa’s political landscape.

Rwanda Secures $20 Million Loan from Kuwait Fund for the Muhanga Road Rehabilitation Project

04:57, 2024-05-31

Nairobi, Kenya — Rwanda and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED) signed a financing agreement on Thursday, May 30, to provide $20 million for the rehabilitation of the Muhanga-Nyange road. The concessional loan deal was signed by Rwanda's Finance Minister, Uzziel Ndagijimana, and Waleed Al-Bahar, the Acting Director General of KFAED, on the sidelines of the African Development Bank Annual Meeting in Nairobi, Kenya.




The funding from KFAED will support the completion of the Rubengera-Muhanga road project. This project is divided into three sections: Rubengera-Rambura (15.15 km), funded by the Saudi Fund for Development; Rambura-Nyange (22 km), financed by the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development; and Nyange-Muhanga (24 km), which will be financed by KFAED.

Minister Ndagijimana emphasized the prompt initiation of the project’s procurement process, attributing it to the “flexibility of financiers” that allowed the process to commence even before the official signing ceremony. “We believe the project implementation will be fast-tracked and movement will be enhanced on that road,” Ndagijimana told City Radio.




He expressed gratitude to the Kuwait Fund for its longstanding cooperation and impactful contributions to various projects in Rwanda, particularly in infrastructure. “The Kuwait Fund has been a reliable partner in our development journey, especially in the education, transport, and health sectors,” Ndagijimana said. The minister highlighted the importance of concessional loans in maintaining Rwanda's debt status while balancing budget expenditures. “Accessing concessional loans enables us to keep our debt in check and manage our budget effectively,” he noted.

In addition to the agreement with KFAED, Minister Ndagijimana met with Pasi Hellman, Finland's Vice Minister for International Development, to sign a public sector investment framework agreement. He also held discussions with Abdulhamid Alkhalifa, the President of the OPEC Fund, to explore ways to enhance bilateral cooperation and establish a medium-term country partnership.




The successful signing of the financing agreement with KFAED marks a significant step towards improving Rwanda’s transportation infrastructure, which is crucial for the country’s economic development. The Rubengera-Muhanga road project, once completed, will significantly enhance connectivity and facilitate smoother transportation across the region.

President Paul Kagame to Attend AfDB Annual Meeting Focusing on Structural Reforms for Africa's Socioeconomic Transformation.

12:31, 2024-05-27

Rwanda's President Paul Kagame is set to attend the African Development Bank (AfDB) Annual Meeting from May 27 to 31. The event, themed "Africa’s Transformation, African Development Bank Group, and Reform of the Global Financial Architecture," will focus on structural reforms essential for the socioeconomic transformation of the continent.




This year’s meeting, held in Nairobi, marks the 59th Annual Assembly of the African Development Bank and the 50th meeting of the African Development Fund. The conference will bring together key officials from bilateral and multilateral development agencies, leading academics, and representatives from non-governmental organizations, civil society, and the private sector.

President Kagame is scheduled to speak during a presidential dialogue on May 29, addressing the conference's central theme. Other prominent African leaders expected to attend include President Felix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of Congo, President Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe, and President Nana Addo Akufo-Addo of Ghana.




In addition to the African presidents, several high-profile dignitaries will be in attendance. These include finance ministers from various countries, Admassu Tadesse, President and Group Managing Director of the Trade and Development Bank (TDB), Muhammad Al Jasser, President of the Islamic Development Bank, Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, Sidi Ould Tah, Director General of the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA), and Alexia Latortue, Assistant Secretary for International Markets and Development at the U.S. Treasury.

Discussions at the meeting will revolve around the necessity of a reconfigured global financial architecture as a catalyst for structural transformation. The AfDB Group’s contribution to Africa’s socioeconomic transformation over its 60 years of existence will also be highlighted.




Despite having 10 of the world's fastest-growing economies and a real GDP growth rate of 4.3 percent annually over the past two decades (compared to the global average of 2.9 percent), Africa remains off track on almost all Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets for 2030. Experts estimate the cost of achieving these goals in Africa at about $1.3 trillion annually, which is 42 percent of the continent's $3.1 trillion GDP in 2023.

The conference aims to identify strategies for accelerating Africa’s economic transformation and redefining the current global financial architecture to mobilize the necessary resources. Additionally, the AfDB will launch its flagship African Economic Outlook 2024 report, which will focus on driving Africa’s transformation and reforming the global financial architecture.

The AfDB partners with African governments on numerous projects across various sectors, including infrastructure and healthcare. As of 2023, the bank’s portfolio in Rwanda consists of 26 projects with a total investment of $1.5 billion.

The outcomes of this meeting are expected to play a crucial role in shaping Africa’s economic future and ensuring that the continent can meet its development targets effectively.

Twelve Injured After Qatar Airways Flight Experiences Severe Turbulence

09:04, 2024-05-27

Twelve people were injured on Sunday when a Qatar Airways flight from Doha to Dublin encountered severe turbulence. The incident occurred as the aircraft, flight QR017, was flying over Turkey.

Upon landing in Dublin shortly before 1 PM local time, the flight was met by emergency services, including airport police and the fire and rescue department. According to a statement from Dublin Airport, six passengers and six crew members sustained injuries, with eight individuals taken to hospital for further assessment and treatment.

In a statement to CNN, Qatar Airways confirmed the safe landing of the flight and acknowledged that "a small number of passengers and crew sustained minor injuries in flight and are now receiving medical attention." The airline emphasized that the safety and security of its passengers and crew are its top priority and that the incident is now subject to an internal investigation.

Despite the turbulence, Dublin Airport reported that its operations were unaffected. The return flight to Doha, QR018, is scheduled to proceed, though with a delay.




This incident comes just days after another severe turbulence event involving Singapore Airlines. On Tuesday, flight SQ321 from London to Singapore experienced intense turbulence at 37,000 feet, resulting in 104 injuries and the tragic death of a passenger with a heart condition. The plane sharply dropped and ascended several hundred feet multiple times, leading to a minute of chaos on board.

Experts have linked the increase in severe turbulence incidents to climate change. Paul Williams, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading, explained to CNN in 2022 that climate change is likely modifying turbulence patterns. "We ran some computer simulations and found that severe turbulence could double or triple in the coming decades," Williams said. This type of turbulence, known as "clear air turbulence," occurs without visual warning and is difficult to avoid.




The specific nature of the turbulence experienced by the Qatar Airways flight remains unclear. Unlike the Singapore Airlines flight, which entered an area with developing thunderstorms, it is not yet known if similar conditions contributed to the Qatar Airways incident.

As the aviation industry continues to adapt to these evolving challenges, ensuring passenger safety remains paramount. Further investigations and technological advancements will be critical in mitigating the risks associated with turbulence in the future.

Rwandan Community in Ghana Commemorates 1994 Genocide Against the Tutsi

04:43, 2024-05-27

As the Rwandan community in Ghana gathered to commemorate the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, the Rwandan High Commissioner to Ghana, Aisa Kirabo Kacyira, emphasized the importance of educating current and future generations about the tragedy to prevent similar atrocities.

During the Kwibuka30 event held on Friday, May 24, in Accra, Rwandans, Ghanaian government officials, and members of the diplomatic corps came together to honor the more than one million victims of the genocide. Kacyira extended her gratitude to the countries that supported Rwanda during the genocide and called for renewed efforts to bring perpetrators to justice.

“Thirty years ago, the world abandoned Rwandans to their bitter end as it has been said time and again but what is more heart-breaking is that for the past three decades, the world has continued to abandon Rwandans by not ensuring that justice gets served,” Kacyira said. “Fugitives incriminated in the Genocide against the Tutsi still roam freely. The world can and should do better.”




Kacyira also urged world leaders to combat genocide denial, hate speech, discrimination, and other forms of negation that distort the truth about the Genocide against the Tutsi. “Understanding the truth about genocide as a crime, particularly the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, requires that education be not a one-off thing,” she said. “We must include modules in schools to teach about this heinous sin, which takes meticulous planning to commit. Only then can we make progress to our global promise of genocide never again.”

Ghana’s Deputy Foreign Minister for Regional Integration, Mavis Nkansah Boadu, expressed her country’s support for Rwanda’s efforts to uphold the values of peace, unity, and humanity, and the memory of the genocide victims. “Let us remember that the fight against genocide and mass atrocities is a collective responsibility,” Boadu stated. “As members of the international community, we must strengthen our resolve to prevent such tragedies, promote human rights, and uphold the dignity of every individual. The lessons of 1994 must continue to guide our actions and our policies, ensuring that such activities never occur again.”




Friday’s event concluded a series of activities organized this year to commemorate the Genocide against the Tutsi. These included a ‘Walk-to-Remember’, a student commemoration of Kwibuka30 at Ashesi University, and a symposium at the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMPA), where delegates deliberated on the need to educate the world about the tragedy and ensure similar atrocities do not happen anywhere in the world.

The Kwibuka30 event in Accra served as a poignant reminder of the importance of remembrance, justice, and education in preventing future genocides and fostering a global commitment to the values of peace and human dignity.

Imbuto Foundation and Basketball Africa League Celebrate Africa Day with Community Service {Umuganda} in Kigali.

04:27, 2024-05-27

In celebration of Africa Day on May 25, Imbuto Foundation, in partnership with the Basketball Africa League (BAL) and other collaborators, engaged in Umuganda, or community service, at the Kimironko Sports and Community Space in Kigali. This initiative brought together participants to contribute to the expansion and beautification of the community space by constructing the foundation and walls of tennis and soccer fields, as well as cleaning and varnishing the basketball court walls.




Clare Akamanzi, Chief Executive Officer of NBA Africa, emphasized the importance of Umuganda in fostering community service and collaboration. “Umuganda is a very important initiative that emphasizes communities coming together to solve problems and address issues. It underpins the need for collaboration and teamwork, much like in sports,” Akamanzi stated. She added that the world could learn from Rwanda’s example of community service and teamwork.




Samuel Dusengiyumva, Mayor of Kigali, commended BAL and the entire basketball community for their trust in the country, and particularly in the city of Kigali. Zephanie Niyonkuru, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Sport, also praised all partners involved in the Umuganda event. “It's a special day for us, not only because it's Africa Day, but also because we are expanding community playgrounds. The Ministry of Sports has been working with partners like Imbuto Foundation, BAL, and local government to ensure we have playgrounds across the country as part of our performance contracts,” Niyonkuru said. He mentioned ongoing projects in Kibagabaga, Gikondo, and Rusororo, among other places nationwide.




Amadou Gallo, President of the Basketball Africa League, expressed gratitude for partnering with Imbuto Foundation. “On Africa Day, we are proud to be here continuing the work we started last year. Our efforts to grow basketball and inspire young people are about creating safe spaces where boys and girls can play, learn, and grow with the values of sports,” Gallo said. He highlighted the significance of Umuganda as a special and inspiring event.




“It should be known all across Africa and around the world, where people in the community commit to acts of kindness, getting out to clean and build, and then really taking a moment to reflect and contribute to the development of their community. We are extremely excited to be here today through our partnership and to bring many members of the BAL family,” he added.

The event underscores the collaborative spirit and community-focused initiatives that are central to both Umuganda and Africa Day celebrations. By involving various stakeholders and focusing on the development of community spaces, the initiative not only enhances local infrastructure but also promotes the values of teamwork, service, and communal growth.

President William Ruto Apologizes to daughter for denying her film Studies, discuses boosting Creative Sector

11:31, 2024-05-24

President William Ruto, during a visit to Tyler Perry Studios in the U.S. on Tuesday, May 21, 2024, issued a heartfelt apology to his daughter, Cullie, for previously denying her the opportunity to pursue a career in film. Reflecting on his changed perspective, Ruto expressed regret over his initial reluctance.

"Eight years ago, my daughter Cullie asked me, 'You know I want to do film.' So I looked at her and asked, 'What did you say?' I must apologize to her today. She was right, and I was wrong," President Ruto admitted. The Head of State's visit to the expansive Tyler Perry Studios left him impressed by the scale and impact of the film industry. "I have a new perspective about what all this is all about. That a whole city, a whole investment of millions of dollars can be dedicated to film. This is different."




Inspiration for Kenya's Creative Sector

President Ruto's tour of the studios served as a significant inspiration for enhancing Kenya's creative sector. He emphasized the importance of investing in and supporting the creative industries, citing the Tyler Perry Studios as a model.

"The Tyler Perry Studios tour was an inspiration to put more effort and resources into the creative sector of our economy. I am encouraged by the huge potential for collaboration and partnership with such institutions that could help our young talented youth to monetize their creativity," he said. This aligns with the Kenyan government's introduction of the Talanta Hela Initiative, aimed at monetizing talent and fostering the creative economy.




Proposal to Host Grammy Awards in Kenya

In a bid to further promote Kenya's creative potential, President Ruto proposed hosting the Grammy Awards in Kenya, suggesting the Maasai Mara as a potential venue with the stunning backdrop of the wildebeest migration.

"I am convinced that Kenya, with its beautiful landscapes and rich cultural heritage, would be an ideal location for the Grammy Awards. The Maasai Mara, especially during the wildebeest migration, would provide a unique and breathtaking setting for the event," Ruto proposed.

The organizers of the Grammy Awards, intrigued by the idea, expressed interest in exploring the proposal. They are scheduled to visit Nairobi in July to discuss the feasibility of hosting the prestigious event in Kenya.






President Ruto's apology and subsequent remarks highlight his commitment to nurturing Kenya's creative industries. By drawing inspiration from international models like Tyler Perry Studios and seeking global partnerships, the President aims to create an enabling environment for Kenyan creatives to thrive. As the discussions with the Grammy Awards organizers progress, and with initiatives like Talanta Hela underway, the future looks promising for Kenya's burgeoning creative sector. The President's new perspective underscores the potential of the arts and entertainment industry to contribute significantly to the nation's economy and cultural landscape.













Russia's moves to expand Baltic Sea borders, drawing sharp rebuke from NATO members

04:24, 2024-05-24

In a move that has sparked alarm among Baltic Sea states and NATO members, Russia's Defense Ministry has drafted a government decree to unilaterally revise the borders of Russian territorial waters in the Baltic Sea. The proposed expansion was made without notifying neighboring NATO members Finland and Lithuania.

The Kremlin's response to the surprise and concern expressed by Baltic Sea states only added to the tension. Insisting that there was “nothing political” about the proposed border change, Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov simultaneously acknowledged that the “political situation” has “changed significantly” since the borders were originally drawn.




“You see how tensions are escalating, what the level of confrontation is, especially in the Baltic region. This requires our agencies to take corresponding steps to ensure security,” Peskov told reporters. His language echoed Putin’s frequent justification for the invasion of Ukraine, which was framed as a necessary measure for “security” against NATO.

The proposed decree, which was initially published on a government portal on Tuesday, stated, “The state border of the Russian Federation at sea will change.” The decree, if approved, would take effect in January 2025. However, following the backlash from Western leaders, the draft decree was abruptly deleted.




The Defense Ministry argued that the 1985 measurements used to determine current borders were based on outdated charts and thus must be “invalidated.” The adjustments would affect the borders around Russian islands in the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland and around Kaliningrad, though the decree did not specify the exact nature of these adjustments.

The move came as a shock to neighboring countries. Finnish President Alexander Stubb expressed his concern on X (formerly Twitter), stating, “Russia has not been in contact with Finland in the matter,” and assured that “the political leadership is monitoring the situation closely.”

Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen urged Russia to adhere to international law, specifically the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and to stop “causing confusion.”




Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis condemned the move as an “obvious escalation against NATO and the EU,” calling for a “firm response.”

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson also criticized the unilateral decision, stating bluntly, “Russia can’t unilaterally decide on new borders.”

The sudden proposal and its equally sudden withdrawal highlight the volatile nature of regional security in the Baltic area. The incident underscores the increasing tensions between Russia and NATO members, with Western leaders viewing the move as another example of Russia’s aggressive stance towards its neighbors. The situation remains fluid, with NATO and EU leaders likely to discuss coordinated responses to Russia's actions. As the political landscape continues to shift, the need for clear communication and adherence to international law becomes ever more critical in maintaining regional stability.

Vital Kamerhe elected Speaker of DRC National Assembly amid turbulence

04:08, 2024-05-24

The Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC) national assembly has elected Vital Kamerhe as its speaker in a delayed vote, marking a crucial step towards forming a government five months after a presidential election. Kamerhe, a close ally of President Felix Tshisekedi, now holds the position of the country's number two authority. Of the 407 members of parliament who cast ballots on Monday, 371 voted in favor of Kamerhe's candidacy for speaker. MPs were also set to vote on candidacies for six other positions in the lower house. This vote clears the way for Congo to establish a government, which it has lacked since the December 2023 presidential election that handed Tshisekedi a second term.




Kamerhe's election comes just days after a violent attack on his home. On May 19, Congolese security forces reported thwarting an attempted coup and repelling an assault on Kamerhe's residence in central Kinshasa. According to Kamerhe's spokesman, Michel Moto Muhima, two guards were killed in the attack. The vote for the national assembly speaker had initially been scheduled for May 18 but was delayed by Tshisekedi. Despite these disruptions, the election proceeded, reinforcing the political stability needed to move forward.




Vital Kamerhe, 65, has been a significant figure in Congolese politics. He campaigned alongside Tshisekedi in the 2018 presidential election and has previously served as Tshisekedi's chief of staff and as deputy prime minister of the economy. However, his career has not been without controversy; in 2020, he was arrested in a graft probe but has since continued to be a prominent political player.

Kamerhe's election as speaker is pivotal for the formation of a new government. President Tshisekedi has already named Judith Suminwa as Congo's first female prime minister on April 1, signaling a historic shift in the country's political landscape. The Sacred Union, Tshisekedi's coalition, holds a substantial majority in parliament, with at least 90 percent of the 500 seats.

The successful election of Kamerhe as speaker is expected to pave the way for further appointments and the stabilization of governance in the DRC. With Kamerhe's close alignment with President Tshisekedi, the government is poised to advance its agenda more cohesively.




As the DRC navigates these significant political developments, the focus will be on how the new government addresses the myriad challenges facing the nation. The recent attack on Kamerhe's home underscores the volatile security situation, which the new administration will need to prioritize.

Kamerhe's role as speaker will be instrumental in shaping the legislative agenda and supporting President Tshisekedi's efforts to implement reforms and foster stability in the country. With the foundation for a new government now in place, the DRC looks to move forward from a prolonged period of political uncertainty.

China Launches Military Drills Around Taiwan, Citing "Punishment" for "Separatist Acts"

05:07, 2024-05-23

China has initiated two days of military exercises surrounding Taiwan, labeling the move as "punishment" for "separatist acts," just days after Taiwan swore in its new democratically elected leader, Lai Ching-te. The exercises, which began early Thursday, pose a significant challenge for Lai as he navigates the complex and tense relations with China.

China's ruling Communist Party maintains that Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled the island, and has vowed to take it by force if necessary. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) launched joint drills involving the army, navy, air force, and rocket force around Taiwan at 7:45 a.m. on Thursday. These exercises are taking place in the Taiwan Strait, and areas north, south, and east of Taiwan, as well as around Taiwan’s outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu, and Dongyin, just off China’s southeastern coast.




“We stand by with firm will and restraint. We seek no conflicts, but we will not shy away from one. We have the confidence to safeguard our national security,” the PLA’s Eastern Theater Command said in a statement.

Taiwan’s presidential spokeswoman Karen Kuo responded, saying, “It is regrettable to see China threatening Taiwan’s democracy and freedom and regional peace and stability with unilateral military provocations. In the face of external challenges and threats, we will continue to defend democracy and have the confidence and ability to protect national security.”



Rising Tensions

Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, China has increased its assertiveness, intensifying diplomatic, economic, and military pressure on Taiwan, especially as the island strengthens its informal ties with the United States. In August 2022, China conducted extensive war games around Taiwan in response to then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei, demonstrating its military prowess with missiles and simulated blockades.

Chinese warplanes now routinely fly into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) and cross the Median Line in the Taiwan Strait, a boundary that Beijing does not officially recognize but had largely respected until recent years. Prior to Lai's inauguration, on May 15, Taiwan reported detecting 45 Chinese military aircraft around the island, marking the highest single-day number this year.

Evan A. Feigenbaum, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, described China’s drills as “an intimidation tactic, part of a pattern, not a sign of imminent war.” He noted, “Beijing has a robust coercion kitbag from which it will mix and match, ratchet up and back and up again to signal its range of options to coerce and inflict pain.”




Defense experts observed that the name of China’s latest military exercises, “Joint Sword-2024A,” suggests additional drills could occur later this year. Drew Thompson, a senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, stated, “It is not a surprise, nor is it a tactical response to President Lai’s speech. These exercises are part of the PLA’s long-term, strategic preparations to fight and win a war over Taiwan.”

PLA Naval Colonel Li Xi, spokesperson for the command, emphasized the exercises as “a strong punishment for the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces and a serious warning against interference and provocation by external forces.”




Taiwan's Response

Taiwan’s Defense Ministry has condemned China’s drills as “irrational provocations and actions that undermine regional peace and stability.” In a statement Thursday, the ministry confirmed it had dispatched sea, air, and ground forces in response to the exercises.

Lai Ching-te, who succeeded two-term president Tsai Ing-wen, has been labeled by Beijing as a “dangerous separatist” due to his advocacy for Taiwan’s sovereignty and distinct identity. In his inauguration speech, Lai called on China to cease its intimidation of Taiwan, a plea that was promptly denounced by Beijing.

As tensions rise, the world watches closely, aware that the stability of the Taiwan Strait is crucial for regional and global peace.

Biden to Designate Kenya as Major Non-NATO Ally During Ruto's State Visit/

04:50, 2024-05-23

In a significant move reflecting deepening ties between the United States and Kenya, President Joe Biden is expected to designate Kenya as a major non-NATO ally during Kenyan President William Ruto's three-day state visit this week. This designation would mark Kenya as the first Sub-Saharan African country to receive such a status, underscoring Washington's commitment to strengthening relations with Nairobi amidst its historical ties with Russia and China. As President Biden welcomed President Ruto to the White House for a meeting with business executives, he announced plans to visit Africa in February, following the US presidential election. The two leaders are set to meet again in the Oval Office on Thursday, culminating in a joint news conference and a state dinner.




Senior administration officials indicated that the discussions between Biden and Ruto will cover a broad spectrum of issues, including trade, debt relief, and the geopolitical situations in Haiti, Ukraine, and Sudan. On Wednesday, President Biden highlighted the launch of a new era of technological cooperation between the US and Kenya, focusing on cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and semiconductors. However, he did not mention the security designation at that time. The US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is also set to announce $250 million in new investments in Kenya, expanding its portfolio in the country to over $1 billion. According to a US official, this investment reflects both nations' commitment to developing and deploying technology in ways that promote transparency, accountability, and human rights.




"Kenya, like the US, has become an engine for innovation," the official said, referencing Kenya’s $1 billion “Silicon Savannah” technology hub, home to more than 200 startups across various sectors, including clean energy, microelectronics, financial technology, and e-commerce.

Among the businesses participating in the tech dialogue were Alphabet, Baylis Emerging Markets, BasiGo, Teneo, and Gearbox Software. Washington also plans to establish a new semiconductor partnership with Kenya and is working with Congress to make Kenya the first African country to benefit from funding through the US CHIPS and Science Act of 2022.

Biden's designation of Kenya as a major non-NATO ally comes at a pivotal time as Kenya prepares to send forces to Haiti as part of a UN-led mission to address the security crisis in the Caribbean. The designation is granted to close, non-NATO allies with strategic working relationships with the US military.

"The White House had no immediate comment," an administration official stated.




This move follows Biden’s March designation of Qatar as a major non-NATO ally, fulfilling a promise made to the Arab country earlier in the year. Gyude Moore, head of the Africa Initiative at the Center for Global Development, noted Kenya's reliability as a US partner, especially as South Africa pursues a more independent foreign policy.

Cameron Hudson, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, remarked, "This move formalizes a shift that has seen Kenya move more squarely into a US orbit in recent years, including greater cooperation on Somalia. It's very significant. No other sub-Saharan African country has it."

As Biden and Ruto navigate these pivotal discussions and collaborations, this state visit marks a historic milestone in US-Kenyan relations, promising to enhance cooperation and strategic alignment between the two nations.

For the First Time Ever, Rwanda Hosts BAL Without a Home Team.

04:34, 2024-05-23

Hold onto your hoops, folks! For the first time in the history of the Basketball Africa League (BAL), Rwanda is set to host the playoffs without a homegrown team hitting the hardwood. This year’s BAL playoffs are missing a bit of that local sparkle, with Rwanda’s own APR basketball club finishing at the bottom of the Sahara conference in Dakar, Senegal.

Despite a stellar turnout for the past three seasons, this year’s playoffs are not creating the same buzz in Kigali as they have in previous years. Last year, the city was a hotbed of excitement, with celebrities from around the globe descending upon the Rwandan capital for the games. Tickets were hotter than a summer day in Kigali, selling out in record time.




Remember last year when the opening match of the BAL 2023 playoffs between Rwanda’s REG and the defending champs Al Ahly had fans scrambling for tickets? Those seats were gone 24 hours before tip-off! Fast forward to this year, and it's a different story. A quick look at Ticqet.rw, the local ticket-buying platform, shows that hundreds, if not thousands, of seats are still up for grabs for the opening match between Libya's Al Ahly Ly and South Africa's Cape Town Tigers. And that game is just hours away!




Ana Christine Gakuba, a die-hard Kigali-based basketball fan, thinks the lack of local excitement might be due to Rwanda’s absence in the playoffs or simply the continent's lukewarm basketball culture. “Sure, we’re missing our team, but Rwandans love a good game,” says Gakuba. “I’m confident people will still turn out in large numbers like they always do.”

While the local fans might be feeling a bit down about not having a Rwandan team to cheer for, the love for basketball in Rwanda runs deep. Even when local teams were knocked out early in previous editions, the stands still saw an impressive turnout.




So, Kigali, don your jerseys and grab your foam fingers. Whether it’s for the love of the game or the thrill of the playoffs, this year’s BAL is still set to bring some serious action. The absence of a Rwandan team might sting a bit, but the spirit of basketball in Rwanda is very much alive and ready to roar!

Rwanda's accountability pays off again as IMF approves more funding.

04:27, 2024-05-23

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a total funding package of $164.6 million for Rwanda, according to an official statement from the IMF. This decision follows a comprehensive review of Rwanda’s implementation of various IMF-supported macroeconomic policy programs.

The funding includes approximately $76.2 million (SDR 57.5 million) under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) and $88.4 million (SDR 66.75 million) under the Standby Credit Facility (SCF). These instruments are designed to assist countries in managing climate shocks and addressing short-term balance of payment needs, respectively.




The IMF praised Rwanda's robust performance under these programs, highlighting successful reforms in social safety nets and spending rationalization. "Progress on the climate agenda under the RSF also remains strong, bolstering Rwanda's resilience to climate shocks," the IMF stated.

Despite facing challenging external conditions and ongoing fiscal consolidation, Rwanda's economy has shown impressive growth. The IMF recommended that Rwanda’s future policy mix should focus on maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability, ensuring fiscal sustainability, and rebuilding economic buffers.




In 2023, Rwanda's economic growth exceeded expectations, reaching 8.2 per cent, driven by strong performance in services, construction, and food crop production recovery following post-flood efforts. Inflation has also been on a steady decline since January 2023, dropping to 4.2 per cent in March, largely due to a slowdown in food prices and core inflation.

The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) has played a crucial role in stabilizing consumer prices by consistently raising the policy rate to address rising inflationary pressures. However, the current account deficit widened more than anticipated in 2023. Despite this, international reserves remained adequate at about 4.1 months of imports at the end of 2023.

Public debt remains a significant concern for Rwanda. In 2023, public debt reached 73.5 per cent of GDP and is projected to rise to 80 per cent in 2024 before gradually declining to 77.5 per cent in 2025 and 74.6 per cent in 2026. External debt stood at 56.9 per cent of GDP in 2023 and is expected to increase to 65 per cent in 2024 and 67.5 per cent in 2025.




Looking ahead, Rwanda's economy is expected to grow at 6.6 per cent in 2024. The IMF emphasized the importance of maintaining the momentum of reforms and continuing efforts to enhance economic resilience and stability.

Rwanda Revenue Authority continues on to pursue the Gold Gender equality seal.

04:22, 2024-05-23

The Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) has reinforced its dedication to fostering a gender-inclusive environment by adopting Gender Equality Seal standards. This commitment was highlighted during a workshop held on May 20 with senior management and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to discuss Gender Equality in Tax Administration.

Osten Chulu, Senior Economic Advisor at UNDP, emphasized the necessity of addressing gender inequalities across all sectors, including economic, social, political, environmental, and governance domains. Chulu highlighted the Equanomics initiative, through which the UNDP aims to create a tax system and fiscal policies that build a gender-equal economy.




“When we talk about Equanomics, we talk of economic equality, where there is an equal distribution of all national wealth and assets,” said Chulu. “Fiscal policies can play a prominent role in advancing gender equality, which is also a necessary condition to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This calls for gender-responsive tax policies and reforms designed to transform existing economic structures and systems and promote equality between male and female taxpayers.”




Key aspects for enhancing gender equality in Rwanda’s taxation system include equal treatment in taxation, progressive taxation to reduce income inequality, tax credits and deductions, access to financial resources, addressing the gender pay gap, and investing in social programs.

Chulu concluded, “UNDP is working with its partners to extend the implementation of the Gender Equality Seal for Public Institutions, including tax administration. Rwanda is one of only three pilot countries in Africa, alongside Nigeria and Ghana, and one of eight globally, selected to implement the Equanomics program.”




RRA Commissioner General, Pascal Bizimana Ruganintwali, reiterated RRA's commitment to gender equality. “RRA is a law-abiding institution, which makes it easy to give equal opportunities to men and women. Women should get more incentives to be economic actors and contribute to economic development,” he stated. Ruganintwali expressed his gratitude for UNDP's support and emphasized RRA’s goal to be certified after evaluating the implementation of gender standards.

Florien H. Rurihose, Deputy Chief Gender Monitor of the Gender Monitoring Office, commended the integration of gender issues into key economic sectors, including tax administration. He noted the expansion of the Gender Equality Seal program from the private sector to public institutions, resulting in certification for some.




“For institutions that implement the Gender Equality Seal program, they are provided with useful tools that help them enhance accountability to gender equality, improve their working environment, and promote inclusive workplaces. This ultimately leads to sustainable development and is good for the country,” said Rurihose.




The workshop participants underscored the importance of viewing taxes as a means for earners to contribute to national development, rather than as a punishment. They stressed the need to ensure that tax policies support gender equity and encourage women's participation in the economy.

“In that case, we should really ensure that the aspect of gender equity is taken care of in our taxation system, making sure that the participation of women in the economy is growing, getting better, and is of higher quality. Our tax policies should, therefore, be geared to create incentives that can attract women in business to become key actors,” remarked one participant.

To further this cause, UNDP and RRA have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) aimed at fostering a tax system and fiscal policies that actively contribute to creating an environment free from gender-based discrimination

Thousands Mourn President Ebrahim Raisi in Tabriz After Tragic Helicopter Crash

04:56, 2024-05-22

Thousands of Iranians gathered in Tabriz on Tuesday to mourn President Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash near the Azerbaijan border over the weekend. The tragic accident also claimed the lives of Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and seven others.

State TV broadcast live images of the somber event, showing mourners, many dressed in black, beating their chests in grief. A truck covered in white flowers carried the caskets, each draped in the national flag, slowly through the throngs of people. "Everyone has come to bid farewell to the martyred president and his companions regardless of their faction, ethnicity, or language," said Tabriz lawmaker Masoud Pezeshkian.




Despite the large turnout in Tabriz, some insiders observed a stark contrast in public grief compared to past commemorations for other senior figures in the Islamic Republic's 45-year history. While Iran declared five days of mourning for Raisi, the emotional rhetoric that marked the death of Qasem Soleimani, a senior commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards killed by a U.S. missile in 2020, was notably absent. Soleimani’s funeral drew enormous crowds of mourners, weeping with sorrow and rage. Raisi's body was flown from Tabriz, the closest major city to the remote crash site, to Tehran airport before heading to the holy Shi'ite Muslim city of Qom. From there, it will return to the capital to lie at Tehran's Grand Mosalla Mosque before being transferred to his hometown of Mashahd in eastern Iran for burial on Thursday. Mourners carried posters bearing images of Raisi, Amirabdollahian, the Friday prayer leader of Tabriz, and other officials who perished in the crash.




The president's death comes amid a deepening crisis between the clerical leadership and the public over issues ranging from tightening social and political controls to economic hardship. To restore legitimacy following a historic low turnout of around 41% in March's parliamentary election, Iran's rulers need to stir public enthusiasm to ensure high participation in the early presidential election scheduled for June 28.

However, Iranians still bear painful memories of the state's handling of nationwide unrest sparked by the death in custody of a young Iranian-Kurdish woman in 2022. The unrest was quelled by a violent crackdown involving mass detentions and executions. Widespread public anger over worsening living standards and pervasive corruption may also deter many Iranians from voting.

"Millions have lost hope that Iran's ruling clerics can resolve an economic crisis fomented by a combination of U.S. sanctions, mismanagement, and corruption," said a political analyst. Raisi, known for enacting the hardline policies of his mentor, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, aimed at entrenching clerical power, cracking down on opponents, and adopting a tough stance on foreign policy, was once seen as a leading candidate to succeed Khamenei. However, two sources revealed that Raisi's name had been removed from a list of potential successors about six months ago due to his declining popularity. Raisi's sudden death has introduced "great uncertainty" into the succession, analysts noted, potentially stirring rivalries within the hardliners' camp over who will succeed Khamenei as the country's ultimate authority.

"The uncertainty in the succession process is significant," said an analyst. "It could lead to intense power struggles within the hardline faction, affecting the country's political stability."




As Iran navigates this period of mourning and political uncertainty, the focus remains on how the leadership will address the economic and social challenges facing the nation, and whether they can rally the public around a new presidential candidate in the upcoming election.

Passengers Recount Terror as Severe Turbulence Hits Singapore Airlines Flight, Resulting in One Fatality.

04:23, 2024-05-22

Passengers on Singapore Airlines flight SQ321 faced a harrowing ordeal on Tuesday when severe turbulence struck the Boeing airliner, causing a sudden and dramatic drop. The flight, carrying 229 passengers and crew, was en route from London to Singapore when the turbulence hit, leading to chaos and injuries on board. The plane was cruising at 37,000 feet when it suddenly plunged, climbed several hundred feet, and then repeated the dip and ascent for about 90 seconds. "The flight was perfectly normal," recalled passenger Andrew Davies, who was traveling to New Zealand for business. "I don’t remember any turbulence at all."




Many passengers were having breakfast when the turbulence began. Davies, who was watching a movie at the time, noticed the seat belt sign light up and promptly fastened his belt. "Thank goodness I did because within moments of doing that, all hell broke loose," he told CNN.

"The plane just felt like it dropped. It probably only lasted a few seconds, but I remember vividly seeing shoes and iPads and iPhones and cushions and blankets and cutlery and plates and cups flying through the air and crashing to the ceiling," Davies described. "The gentleman next to me had a cup of coffee, which went straight all over me and up to the ceiling."

Photos from the aftermath show the cabin in disarray, with debris scattered everywhere and ceiling panels hanging loose. Davies, who was seated toward the front of the plane, witnessed the injuries sustained by dozens of passengers, including Geoff Kitchen, a 73-year-old Briton who tragically died during the flight.




"That gentleman was sitting right behind me," Davies said. "Lots of people needed some help but we tended to this gentleman, and I helped carry him, get him out of the seat, and we laid him on the floor so that some medical professionals could administer CPR." Kitchen received CPR for about 20 minutes amidst the chaos. "There was so much screaming," Davies recalled. "I saw one passenger with a big gash in her head and blood pouring down her face, and another elderly passenger in severe shock."

Another passenger, 28-year-old student Dzafran Azmir, described the turbulence as a "very dramatic drop," adding that "everyone seated and not wearing a seatbelt was launched immediately into the ceiling." He noted that the entire event happened so quickly that nobody had time to react, leaving some passengers in the bathrooms and air crew still standing when the turbulence hit. The flight was diverted to Bangkok following the incident. Of the 211 passengers and 18 crew on board, 143 were transported via a relief flight to Singapore, arriving early Wednesday morning, according to Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong in a video message released on Facebook. The remaining 79 passengers and 6 crew members, including those receiving medical care, remained in Bangkok.




The injured passengers included citizens from Australia, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Spain, the United States, and Ireland. Kittipong Kittikachorn, the general manager of Bangkok airport, indicated that preliminary investigations suggest Kitchen suffered from a heart condition, with the autopsy process ongoing. Several passengers had broken arms, but most injuries were cuts and bruises. CEO Goh extended his condolences to Kitchen’s family and expressed sorrow for the traumatic experience endured by the passengers. "The airline is deeply saddened by this incident," he said. "We are very sorry for the traumatic experience that our passengers endured."

Singapore's Ministry of Transport is investigating the incident and is in touch with its Thai counterparts, sending investigators to Bangkok. The US National Transportation Safety Board is also dispatching personnel to Singapore to assist in the investigation, including a representative and four technical advisors.













Kenya's President Ruto Advocates for Democracy and Financial Reform on First State Visit to the US

04:08, 2024-05-22

On Monday, Kenya's President William Ruto embarked on his first-ever State visit to the United States, using the platform to address critical regional and global issues. Landing in Washington, President Ruto spoke about climate change, financial restructuring, and regional security challenges.

In his first engagement, President Ruto emphasized the precarious state of democracy, particularly in Africa, during a session on “Global Democracy Partnership” at the Carter Center in Atlanta. The event was attended by prominent figures including Jason Carter, the Center’s Board Chairman and grandson of former US President Jimmy Carter, Paige Alexander, CEO of the Carter Center, Meredith Evans, Director of the Carter Presidential Library and Museum, US Congresswoman Nikema Williams, and US Ambassador to Kenya Meg Whitman.




“In several countries, we have seen unconstitutional changes of government that have threatened democratic gains. Consequently, this is a crucial time for reflecting on the need to strengthen democracy worldwide,” President Ruto stated.

He pointed out that many countries are facing economic and debt distress exacerbated by climate change and an inequitable international financial system. “We now run the escalating risk of democracy and free market being associated with poverty and suffering, lending credence to the widespread lamentation that democracy is or has been on the retreat in many parts of the world, including Africa,” he added.




Although President Ruto did not specify the countries, Africa has witnessed six coups in the last three years, with military takeovers in Gabon, Sudan, Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea due to economic and security failures.

He argued that the disappointment with traditional democratic systems has fueled a rise in nationalism, intolerance, and violent political contests globally. Ruto highlighted the need for a fair international financial architecture that supports developing nations with concessional development financing, which is crucial for economic resilience, free-market economies, and democratic governance. President Ruto, who has previously highlighted Kenya’s democratic processes, reiterated his experience of being elected through a transparent system that allowed for judicial review of election results. He is set to meet with US Congress members on Wednesday to discuss the impacts of poverty and debt on democracy in Africa.




In Atlanta, he advocated for the need to provide developing countries with fair financial opportunities. “We are making a case for many countries in Africa, including Kenya, seeking a just international financial architecture that will afford developing countries concessionary development financing to support our economies, build resilience against the effects of climate change, drive our belief in a free-market economy and energize our democratic enterprise,” he said. Kenya, grappling with debt inherited from previous administrations, has continued to borrow while increasing taxes. President Ruto recently defended these measures, arguing that proper taxation is essential, even if unpopular.

President Ruto urged the US to assist in addressing credit issues for poor countries, describing it as crucial for the future of democracy. However, Washington remains concerned about conflicts in regions like Sudan, which pose risks to neighboring areas through potential involvement of militia groups and arms smuggling.




The Global Democracy Partnership session at the Carter Center provided a significant platform for President Ruto to highlight the interconnectedness of democracy, economic stability, and global security, stressing the importance of international cooperation to address these challenges.

President Paul Kagame Highlights Rwandan Unity as Key to National Rebuilding at Global Security Forum.

03:51, 2024-05-22

President Paul Kagame emphasized the critical role of unity in Rwanda's reconstruction and economic progress since the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi. Speaking virtually on Tuesday, May 21, at the 2024 Global Security Forum in Doha, Qatar, Kagame reflected on the nation's journey of reconciliation and development.

"The society has been healing, and it’s something we didn’t expect that it would go this fast," Kagame said during his discussion with Steven Clemons. "We've been working together, trying to bring the country back together – the country that has been divided so badly, with people made to hate each other, and that is the life and the politics they got used to. But now it is the reverse of that, meaning we've tried to build unity and it is happening."




Kagame acknowledged the ongoing discovery of mass graves from the 1994 Genocide, three decades later, as a stark reminder of the past. "Of course, these incidents keep reminding us that, yes, there is that ugly past we’ve gone through," he stated. "We can’t take that for granted. We have to make sure that the division to the extreme that led to the Genocide, as we had it in 1994, should never happen again. We can't allow it."




The President also highlighted how Rwanda's unity has been instrumental in attracting foreign direct investment, particularly in critical sectors like infrastructure, modern airports, and the manufacturing of vaccines and pharmaceuticals. "The foundation in this case, for us, is unity, and we are building on that foundation by investing in people," Kagame explained. "We invest in human capital, we provide the goods for education, and health, and food security and bring in technology, and therefore going to these other industries that will make our economy, our country, vibrant and grow and develop."




Investment projects such as the construction of a modern airport in Bugesera District, in collaboration with Qatar Airways, the modernization of the mining sector, and the enhancement of digital infrastructure were cited as key drivers of Rwanda’s economic growth. Kagame asserted that these initiatives add significant value across various sectors of the economy.

The Global Security Forum is an annual conference where leaders from around the world discuss pressing issues of global security and explore strategies to address them. President Kagame’s remarks underscored Rwanda's remarkable progress and the pivotal role of unity in the nation's ongoing development journey.

US Senate Inquiry Reveals BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, and Volkswagen Used Parts from Sanctioned Chinese Supplier.

06:16, 2024-05-21

In a significant development, a Senate inquiry has revealed that major automakers BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, and Volkswagen have sourced parts from a Chinese company sanctioned for using forced labor. The findings have prompted lawmakers to call for stricter enforcement of laws prohibiting the import of goods made with forced labor.

The Senate Finance Committee, which conducted the two-year investigation, released its report on Monday. The report discovered that BMW imported at least 8,000 MINI vehicles into the U.S. containing parts produced by JWD, a Chinese supplier sanctioned in December 2021 for its involvement in China's forced labor program in Xinjiang. Jaguar Land Rover was found to have imported replacement parts with components made by JWD, even after being informed about the problematic product in its supply chain. Volkswagen, on the other hand, disclosed to U.S. border authorities that a shipment of its vehicles contained parts made by JWD.




The components in question were sourced through two contractors: California-based Bourns Inc. and Michigan-based Lear Corp., the latter being a direct supplier for both BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.

Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, criticized the automakers for their insufficient oversight. “Automakers are sticking their heads in the sand and then swearing they cannot find any forced labor in their supply chains,” Wyden said. “Somehow, the Finance Committee’s oversight staff uncovered what multibillion-dollar companies apparently could not. Automakers' self-policing is clearly not doing the job.” He urged Customs and Border Protection to enhance enforcement efforts.




In response to the report, the automakers stated that they have taken steps to comply with the law. Jaguar Land Rover mentioned that the subcomponent cited in the report "was used in a prior generation of technology and is not in current JLR vehicles for sale." The company added that upon learning of the Chinese manufacturer's sanction, it immediately halted the shipment of the affected parts and quarantined all existing inventory containing the component for destruction.

BMW Group asserted that it has taken measures to stop importing affected products and will conduct a service action, including customer and dealer notifications for affected vehicles. Both BMW and Jaguar Land Rover emphasized their commitment to human rights and the prohibition of forced labor.




Volkswagen, which made the voluntary disclosure about the shipment, reiterated its commitment to preventing forced labor in its supply chain. Lear Corp., the supplier involved, stated that it promptly informed its customers of the issue and worked with its supplier to re-source the manufacture of the components to another sub-supplier.

The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, passed by U.S. lawmakers in 2021, bans the entry of products made with forced labor in Xinjiang, where the Uyghur Muslim ethnic group has been subjected to severe persecution. The U.S. government has described this persecution as an act of genocide. However, Beijing disputes this characterization, claiming its programs in Xinjiang are aimed at countering terrorism and improving job skills and employment opportunities for the local workforce. Human rights advocates argue that participation in these programs can be involuntary.

In the United States, lawmakers have insisted on the strict enforcement of the 2021 law and have criticized automakers for not adequately scrutinizing their supply chains to ensure compliance. This latest Senate report underscores the need for greater vigilance and accountability in sourcing practices to uphold human rights and prevent the use of forced labor.

Artificial Intelligence: Paving the Way for Development in Emerging Economies.

06:01, 2024-05-21

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly becoming a pivotal tool in the developing world and particularly here in Rwanda and the East African region, offering innovative solutions to some of the most pressing challenges faced by these regions. As emerging economies strive for progress, the role of AI in their development cannot be overstated. The technology’s potential to revolutionize various sectors—from healthcare and agriculture to education and financial services—stands as a testament to its transformative power.

Healthcare: Revolutionizing Access and Efficiency

In many developing countries, healthcare systems are often underfunded and overstretched. AI has the potential to bridge these gaps by improving diagnostic accuracy, streamlining patient management, and enhancing the efficiency of healthcare delivery. For instance, AI-powered diagnostic tools can analyze medical images and detect conditions like tuberculosis and cancer at an early stage, where treatment is more likely to be successful. Moreover, AI-driven telemedicine platforms can connect patients in remote areas with doctors, ensuring timely and effective care.




Dr. Sarah Johnson, an AI researcher in healthcare, notes, "AI is not just about replacing human labor; it's about augmenting the capabilities of healthcare professionals and making healthcare more accessible and efficient for everyone."

Agriculture: Enhancing Productivity and Sustainability

Agriculture remains the backbone of many developing economies, yet farmers often face challenges like unpredictable weather, pests, and limited access to resources. AI can address these issues through precision farming techniques, which use data from sensors and satellites to optimize planting schedules, irrigation, and pest control. This not only increases crop yields but also promotes sustainable farming practices.

"AI technologies can provide farmers with the insights they need to make informed decisions, ultimately leading to higher productivity and better resource management," says Raj Patel, an agritech entrepreneur.

Education: Expanding Reach and Personalization

Education systems in developing countries often grapple with overcrowded classrooms and a lack of qualified teachers. AI can democratize education by providing personalized learning experiences and expanding access to quality educational resources. Adaptive learning platforms use AI to tailor educational content to the individual needs of students, helping them learn at their own pace and improve their academic performance.




"AI can transform education by making learning more accessible and personalized, especially in regions where educational resources are scarce," asserts Maria Gomez, an education technology expert.

Financial Services: Promoting Inclusion and Security

Access to financial services is crucial for economic development, yet many people in developing countries remain unbanked. AI can foster financial inclusion by enabling the development of digital banking platforms that offer services like microloans, savings accounts, and insurance to underserved populations. Additionally, AI-driven fraud detection systems enhance the security and trustworthiness of financial transactions.

"AI is a game-changer for financial inclusion, providing scalable solutions that can reach even the most remote and underserved communities," says James Mwangi, a financial technology specialist.




Core Foundations for AI’s Contribution

For AI to effectively contribute to the development of emerging economies, several core foundations must be established:

Infrastructure: Reliable internet connectivity and access to digital devices are essential for the deployment of AI technologies.

Education and Skills Development: Building a workforce capable of developing and maintaining AI systems requires investment in STEM education and training programs.

Regulatory Frameworks: Clear and supportive regulatory environments can encourage innovation while ensuring ethical standards and protecting citizens' rights.

Data Availability: Access to high-quality data is crucial for training AI models. Governments and organizations should promote data-sharing initiatives while safeguarding privacy and security.

Public-Private Partnerships: Collaboration between governments, private sector, and international organizations can drive the implementation of AI solutions and ensure they meet local needs.




As AI continues to evolve, its role in driving development in the global south will likely expand, offering new opportunities for innovation and growth. By addressing critical challenges in healthcare, agriculture, education, and financial services, AI can help build a more equitable and prosperous future for all.

Ugandan Military Captures ADF Commander and rescues Nine Abductees in Joint Operation with DRC.

05:10, 2024-05-21

The Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF), announced on Sunday that it has captured one of the commanders of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) militia and rescued nine abductees during a joint operation in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This development was reported by the local press, New Vision.

The capture comes approximately 10 days after a brutal attack on May 9, which resulted in the death of at least eight civilians at a health center in North Kivu Province, eastern DRC. The attack was attributed to the ADF, a notorious militant group.




The UPDF, in collaboration with Congolese forces, apprehended Anywari Al Iraq, a prominent ADF commander, in Apumu, Ituri Province, on Saturday evening. "Anywari, also known as AA, is an expert in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and is of Ugandan nationality," stated Maj Bilal Katamba, the Ugandan spokesperson for the joint operations dubbed Operation Shujaa. Katamba added, "During the operation, one submachine gun, 45 rounds of ammunition, three walkie-talkies, one RPG (rocket-propelled grenade) charger, and an assortment of IED-making materials were recovered."




The operation also led to the rescue of nine abductees, including four children and five women, from the ADF in the Mambune area of Ituri Province. "The rescued children and women are receiving basic medical attention as arrangements are underway to transfer them to a better medical facility," said Maj Katamba. He further emphasized the ongoing efforts, stating, "The joint forces continue to pursue the ADF terrorists from all directions in their areas of operation."

The ADF, an armed group with allegiance to the Islamic State in Central Africa, is one of over 200 militia groups wreaking havoc in the dense jungles of eastern DRC. Since pledging loyalty to the Islamic State group in 2019, the ADF has been responsible for numerous atrocities, including the recent attack in Beni region in mid-April, which left between 10 and 15 civilians dead, and another attack last October that resulted in at least 20 civilian deaths.

The joint efforts of Ugandan and Congolese troops to combat the ADF began in November 2021. Maj Katamba highlighted the importance of continued cooperation, noting that the rescued individuals are now safe and receiving care.




The ADF, initially a primarily Muslim Ugandan militia, has entrenched itself in eastern DRC over the past three decades, causing the deaths of thousands of civilians. The group's enduring presence, along with other militant factions such as the Red Tabara, FDLR, and Joseph Kony's LRA, underscores the urgent need for a regional solution to the security threats in the region.

As the joint operations persist, the capture of Anywari Al Iraq and the rescue of the abductees mark a significant step towards destabilizing the ADF and restoring peace to the affected regions.
















DR. Habineza of Democratic Green Party of Rwanda Submits Candidature for July Presidential Elections.

04:24, 2024-05-21

In a decisive move, Frank Habineza, the leader of the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda (DGP), submitted his candidature for the upcoming presidential elections to the National Electoral Commission (NEC) on May 20. Habineza is the second aspirant to enter the race following President Paul Kagame, who filed his candidature on May 17 as the flag-bearer of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF-Inkotanyi).




Habineza appeared confident as he laid out his vision for Rwanda’s future. “What we are putting forward is to have a better country, where we have food security; where any Rwandan is certain of food and no one goes hungry, without having to import food, and have ample security not only inside the country but be at resolve with the neighbors too,” he stated. He emphasized the importance of using Rwanda's borders as tools for unity rather than political weapons, asserting, "Our borders should never be used as political weapons because these are for the people and it is these same people that suffer rather than those that close them."




Addressing one of Rwanda's critical issues, Habineza highlighted his commitment to tackling youth unemployment, which he noted stands at 22%. He proposed a plan to create 5,000 jobs each financial year with a strong focus on fostering a Green economy. This ambitious strategy aims to reduce unemployment and stimulate sustainable development within the country.

However, during the submission of his candidacy, it was discovered that Habineza had not included a letter confirming he held no other citizenship apart from that of Rwanda. NEC Chairperson Oda Gasinzigwa pointed out that the DGP still had time to meet these requirements before the May 30 deadline. Habineza clarified that he had renounced his Swedish nationality in 2017, during his first presidential campaign, and had previously submitted the necessary documents to the NEC. He expressed his belief that resubmission was unnecessary, stating, “I thought I would not have to submit it again.”

Gasinzigwa reassured that the election laws allow candidates to file any missing documents within the specified period. Habineza confirmed that he would comply with the NEC’s instructions and submit the required documents in due time.




The deadline for submitting candidatures is May 30, with the NEC expected to announce the final list of candidates on June 14. The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for July 15, with the Rwandan diaspora set to vote on July 14. As the election date approaches, the political landscape in Rwanda is shaping up for a competitive race, with key issues such as food security, unemployment, and regional relations at the forefront of the candidates' campaigns.

Rwandan Government Denies Entry to HRW Representative, Citing Misrepresentation

07:25, 2024-05-20

The Rwandan government has confirmed that a representative from Human Rights Watch (HRW) was denied entry into the country for allegedly misrepresenting the purpose of her visit. Clémentine de Montjoye, a senior researcher in HRW's Africa division, was reportedly refused entry at Kigali International Airport on May 13.

In response to HRW's claims, the Office of the Government Spokesperson released a statement on Saturday, May 18, clarifying the government's stance. "A representative of Human Rights Watch (HRW) was refused entry to Rwanda after misrepresenting the purpose of her visit to the immigration officer," the statement read.




The government further emphasized that there has been no formal engagement between the Government of Rwanda and HRW for many years, and there is no existing agreement permitting HRW to operate within Rwandan territory. The statement accused HRW of consistently fabricating reports and distorting the reality of Rwanda.




"This follows a series of published documents by the same organization in contradiction to what Rwanda represents and against the nation's civic and unity mandate," the statement continued. "HRW has consistently published false information about Rwanda, including allegations regarding the involvement of Paul Rusesabagina in atrocities that led to loss of lives."

The denial of entry to the HRW representative underscores the ongoing tensions between the Rwandan government and international human rights organizations. It highlights broader issues of accountability and transparency in Rwanda's interactions with such organizations, particularly regarding their assessments of the country's human rights situation.




HRW has not yet responded to the Rwandan government's statement regarding the denied entry of their representative. The incident further complicates the relationship between Rwanda and HRW, raising questions about future engagements between the two parties.

New ADR Centre ready to Enhance Dispute Resolution in Rwanda

06:14, 2024-05-20

Kigali, Rwanda – The Government of Rwanda is set to launch an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) centre aimed at enhancing dispute resolution processes in the country. The centre, which will serve as a vital link between public and private ADR initiatives and service providers, is expected to begin operations soon, according to Anastase Nabahire, the Director General of Justice Sector Coordination at the Ministry of Justice.




Speaking at a press conference marking the commencement of the fifth judiciary week and the celebration of 20 years of justice reforms, Nabahire announced that all necessary facilities and materials for the centre had been put in place within the compound of Nyarugenge Intermediate Court. “The facility is complete and it is located in the compound of Nyarugenge Intermediate Court where, in a few days, it will start operations and serve its purpose,” Nabahire stated.

Objectives and Services of the ADR Centre

The ADR centre is designed to offer a neutral and informal setting for parties to resolve disputes outside the traditional court system. It will serve four main purposes:

Gathering information related to ADR cases from grassroots levels.

With its commitment to quality, fairness, and future expansion, the centre is poised to play a vital role in promoting peace and justice in Rwanda.

Rwanda Proposes Tougher Penalties for Illegal Mining and Quarry Operations

05:10, 2024-05-20

Kigali, Rwanda – In a move aimed at curbing illegal mining and enhancing the regulatory framework, the Government of Rwanda has proposed tougher penalties under a new draft law governing mining and quarry operations. The draft law, presented by the Minister in the Office of the President, Judith Uwizeye, seeks to amend the existing 2018 law to address significant gaps and inefficiencies.




The explanatory note of the bill highlights that while the 2018 law contributed significantly to the development of a productive and professional mining sector, its implementation revealed serious shortcomings. "The current law's lenient punishments are not deterring offenders effectively," Uwizeye told lawmakers. "The punishments were so lenient that people committing offences did not fear them, as the penalties were insignificant compared to the gains from illegal activities."




Key Amendments and Penalties

Undertaking Mining Operations Without a Licence

Offence: Engaging in mineral operations without a licence.
Penalty: Imprisonment for 2-5 years and a fine of Rwf25-50 million. For entities, fines range from Rwf60-80 million or dissolution.

Possession of Illegally Extracted Minerals

Offence: Possessing illegally extracted minerals.
Penalty: Imprisonment for 2-5 years and a fine of Rwf30-60 million.

Trading in Illegally Extracted Minerals

Offence: Trading in illegally extracted minerals.
Penalty: Imprisonment for 5-10 years and a fine of Rwf60-120 million.

Allowing Illegal Mining on One’s Land

Offence: Permitting mining activities on land without a licence.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 1-2 years and a fine of Rwf25-50 million.




The draft law also introduces stricter administrative fines for various faults, including failing to rehabilitate damaged areas, illegal displacement of minerals, and not adhering to health and safety standards. Inspectors of mining and quarry activities will now have the authority to impose sanctions directly, expediting enforcement without relying on lengthy court proceedings. "Inspectors were as if they had no powers," Uwizeye remarked, emphasizing the need for more efficient regulatory oversight.




Rwanda’s mineral export revenue surged by 43% to over $1.1 billion in 2023, up from $772 million in 2022. The country aims to generate $1.5 billion by the end of 2024, according to the Rwanda Mines, Petroleum and Gas Board. Strengthening the legal framework is seen as a critical step towards achieving this target by ensuring a more disciplined and law-abiding mining sector.




Minister Uwizeye underscored the importance of the new bill in ensuring sustainable mining practices and protecting the country's resources. "Penalties were increased to deter those who commit offences or faults in this sector of mining and quarry," she said, highlighting the government’s commitment to maintaining the integrity and economic viability of Rwanda's mining industry.

The proposed amendments are set to create a more robust legal environment, aimed at fostering a responsible and compliant mining sector while contributing to Rwanda’s economic growth and development.

Arsenal Boss Mikel Arteta: insists "We Will Win the Premier League"

04:30, 2024-05-20

London – After narrowly missing out on the Premier League title for the second consecutive season, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has boldly declared that his team will come back stronger and ultimately win the league. Despite a valiant 2-1 victory over Everton on the final day, Manchester City's 3-1 win against West Ham secured their fourth consecutive title, leaving the Gunners to reflect on what might have been. In a post-match press conference, Arteta acknowledged the disappointment but remained resolute about Arsenal's future ambitions. "First of all, congrats to Manchester City for winning the Premier League," he said. "Today, there are some mixed emotions. First of all, to be really proud of the staff and those players. They've done an incredible job and they have pushed every limit and every margin that we could to try to win this Premier League."

Arteta emphasized the need for even greater determination and ambition moving forward. "There's only one way to do it – you have to be more determined, you have to be more ambitious, you have to have a lot of courage and push every limit in everything that we have. That's the next step," he stated.




The season finale saw Arsenal secure a late win with goals from Takehiro Tomiyasu and Kai Havertz, ensuring they ended the campaign with an impressive 89 points. This achievement, while not enough to dethrone City, signals significant progress under Arteta's leadership. "They [City] took it away from us. It's the second season," Arteta noted. "If we do what we have to do, we're going to be closer and at the end we'll win it. When? I don't know, but if we keep knocking and being that close, in the end it will happen."

Reflecting on the season's efforts, Arteta highlighted the growth and potential of his squad. "They've done an incredible job and they have pushed every limit and every margin that we could to try to win this Premier League," he said. The team's resilience and continued improvement have laid a solid foundation for future success.




In their final match, Arsenal's performance showcased their determination to finish strong. Idrissa Gueye's deflected free-kick initially put Everton ahead, but Tomiyasu's equalizer and Havertz's late tap-in secured the win, illustrating the team's fighting spirit. Arteta's message to the fans and his players is clear: the pursuit of the Premier League title is far from over. "If we keep knocking and being that close, in the end it will happen," he reiterated, projecting confidence and belief in his team's ability to achieve their ultimate goal.

As Arsenal looks ahead to the next season, the resolve to push beyond their limits and secure the coveted title remains stronger than ever. Arteta's defiant vow encapsulates the spirit of a club determined to reclaim its place at the pinnacle of English football.

Pep Guardiola Hints at Manchester City Departure After Record Fourth Premier League Title

04:20, 2024-05-20

Manchester – In the wake of Manchester City's unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title, manager Pep Guardiola has sparked speculation about his future, suggesting he may be "closer to leaving than staying." The treble-winning manager's comments came after City's 3-1 victory over West Ham on Sunday, securing Guardiola's sixth league title in seven seasons. Guardiola, who has one year remaining on his contract, has achieved unparalleled success at City, winning every major domestic trophy available in English football. Despite this, he admits to feeling uncertain about what more there is for him to accomplish at the club.




"The reality is I'm closer to leaving than to staying," Guardiola told Sky Sports. "It's eight years, will be nine. Right now, my feeling is I want to stay next season. We talked with the club, we have time to talk next season because I have to see the players as well, if they follow me, they follow us. I want to stay next season. During the season, we will talk. But after eight, nine years..."

Reflecting on his achievements, Guardiola confessed to having doubts about his future motivation. "I had that feeling last season [after we won the treble]," he revealed in his press conference. "We were in Istanbul and I said, 'It's over. What am I doing here? There is nothing left.' But I have a contract. I am here and I am still enjoying some of the moments, sometimes tired but some of them I love."




Despite these feelings, Guardiola's competitive spirit quickly reignited. "And after a few days, we start playing good, winning games, different players, and we start to think about how no one has done four in a row. Why not try it?"

Under Guardiola’s stewardship, Manchester City has amassed an impressive collection of silverware, including:

Premier League titles: 2017–18, 2018–19, 2020–21, 2021–22, 2022–23, 2023–24
FA Cup: 2018-19, 2022-23
League Cup: 2017–18, 2018–19, 2019–20, 2020–21
Champions League: 2022-23
UEFA Super Cup: 2023
FIFA Club World Cup: 2023
Community Shield: 2018, 2019

With City potentially on the cusp of a historic "double double" if they beat Manchester United in the FA Cup final, Guardiola’s legacy at the club is already cemented. However, the uncertainty surrounding his future casts a shadow over what could be yet another remarkable season for the club.

Guardiola’s comments have left fans and pundits alike pondering the implications for Manchester City’s future. As the club navigates this period of unprecedented success, the potential departure of their iconic manager could signal the end of an era.

For now, Guardiola remains focused on the present. "We will talk during the season," he reiterated. "But after all these years, we need to see if the players still follow me and if I have the energy to continue."

As the football world watches closely, Guardiola's next move will undoubtedly have a profound impact on Manchester City's trajectory and

Iranian President and Foreign Minister Killed in Helicopter Crash, Plunging Nation into Uncertainty

04:06, 2024-05-20

Tehran – In a tragic and unforeseen event, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and the country's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian were killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday in Iran's remote northwest region, state media has confirmed. The incident marks a significant loss for the nation, already grappling with economic and political challenges and heightened regional tensions. The crash occurred as the helicopter was returning from a ceremony marking the opening of a dam on the border with Azerbaijan. The Red Crescent's drone footage, aired by state media FARS News Agency, revealed the crash site on a steep, wooded hillside, with remnants of the helicopter, including a blue and white tail, scattered among the wreckage.




The ill-fated flight included President Raisi, 63, Foreign Minister Amir-Abdollahian, three crew members, the governor of Eastern Azerbaijan province, an imam, Raisi’s head of security, and a bodyguard, as reported by the IRGC-run media outlet Sepah. Despite a robust search-and-rescue effort aided by the European Union and Turkey, fog and dropping temperatures severely hampered the operations, ultimately confirming no survivors.

President Raisi, a conservative hardliner and a protégé of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had been a pivotal figure in Iran’s government. His death comes at a particularly sensitive time for Tehran, as the nation navigates severe economic strains and intense political discord. The country has been marked by youth-led protests against clerical rule and harsh economic conditions, which led to a sweeping crackdown on dissent following the 2022 death of a young woman in morality police custody.




The loss of Raisi is expected to deepen the uncertainty within Iran, potentially exacerbating the already fraught relations with nearby Israel. Just last month, Iran launched its first direct drone and missile attack on Israel in response to an Israeli airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus, highlighting the escalating conflict between the two nations. Vice President Mohammad Mokhber is next in the line of presidential succession, but his assumption of the role must be approved by Khamenei, who holds ultimate authority over Iran’s domestic and foreign policies. The Iranian constitution mandates that an election to choose a new president must occur within 50 days of Mokhber becoming the acting president, involving the heads of the three branches of government: the Vice President, the speaker of the parliament, and the head of the judiciary.

In a bid to reassure the nation, Ayatollah Khamenei issued a statement during the ongoing search operations, saying, "People of Iran, do not worry. There will be no disruption in the work of the country." His words aim to project stability amid the profound loss and the looming political transition.

The demise of President Raisi and Foreign Minister Amir-Abdollahian marks a pivotal moment for Iran, casting a shadow over its future leadership and the ongoing geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East.
















Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin Pledge to Deepen Strategic Partnership Amid Growing Western Friction

08:25, 2024-05-16

[Date], Beijing – In a clear demonstration of their strengthening alliance, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to deepen their strategic partnership during a state visit in Beijing on Thursday. The visit coincides with escalating international tensions and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Putin, accompanied by top defense and security officials, was received with full military honors at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, marking the start of his two-day state visit. This visit is notably Putin's first overseas trip since commencing a new term as Russia's president last week.

Xi Jinping emphasized the significance of the strengthened ties between China and Russia, formalized through a joint statement signed by both leaders. He remarked that this partnership would "inject strong momentum" into the development of their bilateral relations. "China-Russian relations have stood the test of a changing international landscape and made positive contributions to maintaining global strategic stability," Xi stated, according to a readout from China’s Foreign Ministry.




Putin, whose country has increasingly relied on China economically since the onset of his February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, praised the practical cooperation between the two nations. "Our practical cooperation has reached record levels, particularly in terms of bilateral trade last year," Putin noted. He stressed the importance of further strengthening cooperation in energy, industry, and agriculture, as reported by Russian state media outlet Tass.

The two leaders have met face-to-face four times since the start of the Ukraine conflict, following their declaration of a "no limits" partnership on the sidelines of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. Putin's visit this week underscores the tightening relations between the two countries as they navigate heavy friction with the West.




As the war in Ukraine continues, Putin and Xi are scheduled to hold informal talks later Thursday, which will include discussions on the conflict. Russia’s newly appointed Defense Minister Andrey Belousov and his predecessor Sergei Shoigu, now secretary of Russia’s Security Council, are expected to join these talks. The visit also highlights mounting international concern about the war in Ukraine. The conflict has prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to cancel all upcoming international visits as his forces face a surprise Russian offensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Kyiv earlier this week to reaffirm the Biden administration's support for Ukraine, pledging $2 billion in foreign military financing and promising expedited delivery of ammunition and weapons to the front lines.




Pressure is mounting on Xi from the US and Europe to ensure that soaring exports from China to Russia are not bolstering the Kremlin’s war efforts. White House officials have recently confronted Beijing over what they perceive as substantial support for Russia's defense industrial base, through exports of goods like machine tools, drone and turbojet engines, and microelectronics. Beijing has rejected these accusations, condemning them as "groundless" and insisting that the trade between China and Russia is purely normal economic exchange. The state visit and the discussions between Xi and Putin underscore the complex geopolitical landscape and the pivotal role that the China-Russia partnership plays in it, as both nations navigate their relationships with the West amid ongoing global conflicts and economic sanctions.

Rwanda's New Airport to Propel African Aviation Industry, Construction deadline extended to 2028

08:17, 2024-05-16

16 May 2024 - DOHA The eagerly awaited inauguration of Rwanda's new airport in Bugesera District is set to mark a significant milestone for the country's aviation sector, with operations expected to commence in 2028. This announcement was made by Yvonne Manzi Makolo, CEO of RwandAir, during the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha on May 15.

Originally slated for completion in 2026, the airport's development timeline has been adjusted, with an estimated investment of $2 billion aimed at transforming Africa's aviation landscape. The ambitious project holds promise for fostering regional connectivity and catalyzing economic growth.

Makolo outlined the impressive features of the upcoming airport, which includes a sprawling 130,000-square-meter main terminal capable of serving eight million passengers annually, with projections indicating a potential rise to over 14 million passengers in the ensuing decades. Additionally, the facility will house a dedicated cargo terminal capable of handling 150,000 tons of cargo annually.




"Construction is already underway, with the finalization of horizontal works imminent before transitioning to vertical construction. We anticipate the airport to become operational between 2027 and 2028," Makolo stated, underscoring the progress made in bringing the project to fruition.

The strategic location of the new airport, situated approximately 40 kilometers from Kigali, positions it as a pivotal regional hub, complementing established aviation centers such as Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Makolo emphasized Rwanda's unique geographical advantage, situated at the heart of Africa, providing unparalleled access to diverse destinations across the continent.

"Kigali will serve as an alternative regional hub, capitalizing on Rwanda's central location to facilitate seamless connectivity across Africa," Makolo affirmed, signaling the country's ambition to emerge as a key player in the African aviation landscape.




The development of Rwanda's new airport represents a significant milestone in the country's journey towards enhancing air transport infrastructure and bolstering regional connectivity. As Africa's aviation industry continues to evolve, the inauguration of Bugesera International Airport is poised to unlock new opportunities for economic growth and development across the continent.

Rwanda to Utilize Technology and Monitor Land Use Changes, Combat Deviatio

08:14, 2024-05-16

16 MAY,2024 - KIGALI Rwanda's National Land Authority (NLA) is set to implement a cutting-edge technology aimed at detecting changes in land use, a move intended to address issues such as encroachment on agricultural land and ensure efficient utilization of this vital natural resource.

Marie Grace Nishimwe, the Director General of the National Land Authority, disclosed to The New Times that plans are underway to develop a land administration tracking information system in the next financial year (2024/2025). This system is envisioned to revolutionize land management practices in Rwanda.




"We want [the system] to help us monitor land use before going to the field, providing us with information to target areas where changes are occurring," Nishimwe stated, emphasizing the importance of proactive monitoring to combat deviations in land use.

Highlighting the current challenges in land management, Nishimwe acknowledged issues such as plots being utilized for purposes they were not designed for, including instances where agricultural land is repurposed for construction projects. This inefficient land use often leads to non-compliance with master plans and poses threats to sustainable development.

To address these challenges, the proposed system will utilize satellite or aircraft imagery coupled with artificial intelligence to analyze and detect changes in land use over time. By comparing images from different periods, the system can identify deviations, such as unauthorized construction or encroachment on agricultural land.




"The system will mark areas where changes are detected, allowing us to take timely action to ensure compliance with land use regulations," Nishimwe explained, underscoring the role of artificial intelligence in detecting abnormal changes and facilitating efficient land management practices.

Jules Ngango, an agricultural economist, welcomed the initiative, noting the importance of protecting agricultural land amidst growing population pressures. He emphasized that efficient land use is crucial not only for agriculture but also for overall development outcomes.

"The system, once successful, will be instrumental in safeguarding agricultural land from encroachment, thereby contributing to food security and sustainable development," Ngango remarked, highlighting the potential benefits of the technology in optimizing land productivity and resource utilization.




As Rwanda progresses towards implementing this innovative land management system, stakeholders anticipate its role in promoting sustainable development and ensuring the effective utilization of the country's limited land resources. Through the integration of technology and proactive monitoring, Rwanda aims to address land use challenges and pave the way for inclusive and resilient growth. The airport in Bugesera is being built in partnership with Qatar Airways which has 60 percent ownership and is also expected to acquire 49 percent of shares in the national carrier.

Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al Meer said the Qatar-owned carrier has a model to cover the African continent with a big network across countries, and intends to announce a partnership in Southern Africa, in addition to Rwanda.

“The last piece of the equation is southern Africa,” he said.

“We are at the final stage of an equity investment in an airline in the southern part of Africa. This airline will help us complement the operation of Kigali as a hub.”

While acknowledging the impact of delays manufacturing supply has had on the Bugesera airport project, Al Meer said that they are in constant communication with the suppliers and contractors on the ground to finalise the infrastructure packages.

The contract for the main works will be awarded within two months following the completion of tender process, he added.

Another internet outage hits Africa following another suspected under sea fiber cut.

05:12, 2024-05-14

Several internet service providers (ISPs) across East and South Africa have faced disruptions in service following a submarine cable cut on Sunday, according to a report by TechTrends Ke.

Reports indicate that the outage has severely impacted all sub-sea capacity between the two regions, causing widespread connectivity issues for businesses and individuals alike.




Details surrounding the fibre cut remain unclear, but Ben Roberts, Group Chief Technology Officer (CTIO) at Liquid Intelligent Technologies, shed some light on the situation in a post on X. Roberts stated that faults have been detected in the Eastern Africa Submarine Cable System (EASSy) and the Seacom cables, both crucial components of the region's internet infrastructure.

Moreover, Roberts highlighted that three vital submarine cables in the Red Sea – Seacom, EIG, and AAE1 – have also suffered cuts and are yet to be repaired, exacerbating the extent of the outage and prolonging the restoration process.

This incident marks the second major fibre cut experienced by Africa this year. In March, a suspected underwater rockslide off the coast of Cote d’Ivoire caused several submarine cables to go offline. Among the affected cables were the Africa Coast to Europe and Submarine Atlantic 3/West Africa Submarine Cable systems, impacting connectivity for countries across the region.




The recent submarine cable cut underscores the vulnerability of Africa's internet infrastructure to external factors and the need for robust contingency plans to mitigate such disruptions. ISPs and telecommunications companies are working diligently to restore services, but the widespread nature of the outage presents significant challenges in the interim.

As businesses and individuals await the resolution of these issues, stakeholders are reminded of the critical role that reliable internet connectivity plays in driving economic growth, fostering innovation, and facilitating communication across the continent. Efforts to enhance the resilience of Africa's internet infrastructure and minimize the impact of future disruptions remain a priority for all involved parties.

The UK- Rwanda asylum deal hit another bump as Belfast Judge Rules Provisions of UK's Illegal Migration Act Disapplied in Northern Ireland.

04:57, 2024-05-14

In a landmark decision, Mr Justice Michael Humphreys ruled that provisions of the UK's Illegal Migration Act should be disapplied in Northern Ireland, citing concerns over human rights protections guaranteed under post-Brexit arrangements. The ruling, issued at the High Court in Belfast, has significant implications for immigration policies in the region.

The post-Brexit Windsor Framework, jointly agreed upon by the UK and the EU, explicitly states that there can be no diminution of the rights provisions contained within the 1998 Belfast Agreement. Mr Justice Humphreys emphasized the importance of upholding these rights provisions, particularly in light of the region's complex political and historical context.




The Illegal Migration Act, which provides new powers for the UK government to detain and remove asylum seekers deemed to have arrived illegally, has faced criticism for its controversial scheme to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. This scheme, central to the new laws, has raised concerns among human rights advocates and legal experts. Speaking on the ruling, Mr Justice Humphreys stated,




"The provisions of the Illegal Migration Act undermine fundamental human rights protections guaranteed under post-Brexit arrangements and are incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)." He further emphasized the need to ensure that immigration policies respect the rights and dignity of individuals, regardless of their immigration status.

However, the UK government has announced its intention to appeal the court's decision. Chancellor Rishi Sunak stated that the government will challenge the ruling, particularly regarding provisions of the Act related to the scheme to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. This sets the stage for further legal battles and raises questions about the balance between immigration control and human rights protections in the post-Brexit era.




The decision by Mr Justice Humphreys underscores the ongoing challenges and complexities surrounding immigration policies in Northern Ireland and the broader UK. As the legal battle continues, it highlights the importance of upholding human rights principles and ensuring that immigration policies are both effective and respectful of individuals' rights and dignity.
















ZItto Kabwe of ACT Wazalendo announces presidential aspiartyions and readiness to challenge Samia Suluhu

03:59, 2024-05-13

Retired ACT-Wazalendo party leader, Zitto Kabwe, has made a historic declaration as the first Tanzanian opposition politician to openly express presidential aspirations for the upcoming general election next year.

Speaking at an event commemorating the party’s 10th anniversary in Kigoma on May 5, Zitto Kabwe announced his readiness to shift gears from his previous intention of focusing on reclaiming the parliamentary seat he lost in the controversial 2020 election. Initially planning to defer a presidential bid until a later time, possibly in 2030, Kabwe declared his willingness to stand for the presidency against incumbent President Samia Suluhu Hassan of the ruling CCM party, if called upon to do so by ACT-Wazalendo.




Despite stepping down from day-to-day party leadership in March this year, Kabwe asserted his preparedness to assume the highest office in the country if deemed necessary for the party’s immediate interests. Addressing an enthusiastic crowd of ACT-Wazalendo supporters, he stated, “I have prepared myself psychologically, mentally, and cognitively to be President of the United Republic of Tanzania at any time if that is in the immediate interests of the party.”




In the upcoming 2025 election, President Samia Suluhu Hassan will seek her first mandate as president, having ascended from vice-president to succeed John Magufuli by constitutional decree in 2021. Her eligibility for one full five-year term positions her as the likely candidate for reelection, a tradition upheld by the ruling CCM party, which historically endorses incumbent presidents for reelection. Zitto Kabwe, aged 48 and widely recognized as one of Tanzania’s most prominent opposition figures, had previously dismissed speculation about challenging President Samia while she was in office, citing the low likelihood of success. His primary focus at the time was regaining a parliamentary seat in the Kigoma constituency to revive an effective opposition presence in the House, following the contentious 2020 election marred by allegations of irregularities.




However, during the party anniversary function, Kabwe appeared to shift course following a suggestion from ACT-Wazalendo’s vice-chairperson for Zanzibar, Ismail Jussa. He expressed confidence in other capable party members who could contest and win the Kigoma constituency legislative seat, paving the way for his potential presidential bid.

Kabwe’s announcement marks a significant development in Tanzanian politics, setting the stage for a potentially dynamic electoral contest in the upcoming general election. As the political landscape evolves, all eyes will be on the unfolding narrative leading up to the presidential race in 2025.

Quoting Zitto Kabwe, he emphasized, “I have prepared myself psychologically, mentally, and cognitively to be President of the United Republic of Tanzania at any time if that is in the immediate interests of the party.”




Furthermore, ACT-Wazalendo’s vice-chairperson for Zanzibar, Ismail Jussa, stated, “There are other capable party members who could contest and win the Kigoma constituency legislative seat, paving the way for Zitto Kabwe’s potential presidential bid.” With Kabwe’s announcement, Tanzanian politics enters a new phase, promising a spirited electoral contest in the upcoming general election.

Belgian Sports App IFREQ set to Revolutionize Football Talent Scouting in Rwanda.

07:27, 2024-05-10

Another initiative has landed in Rwanda, poised to revolutionize the way local football talent is scouted and nurtured on the global stage. IFREQ, a Belgian sports tech startup, has set foot in the country with a mission to level the playing field for aspiring footballers and provide coaches and scouts with advanced tools to monitor player progress in unprecedented detail.

IFREQ, internationally recognized for its innovative approach, envisions a world where every talented player has the opportunity to showcase their skills and reach their full potential. With an estimated 300 million footballers worldwide, only a fraction—about 65,000—manage to attain professional status and gain visibility on scouting platforms.




"Every week, more than 100 new players join us from outside the traditional system, don't miss them!" exclaimed a representative from IFREQ, highlighting the platform's growing influence in the global football community.

Former professional soccer star Philippe de Liedekerke spearheaded the development of IFREQ, driven by his own experience of late entry into professional football due to a lack of access to elite academies. "It is time for African talent to be discovered and given a chance to go pro regardless of not being in the system," Philippe emphasized in an interview with City Radio. "I went pro late because I was not from the academy setting, and this made me realize how much trouble players go through before their discovery, which at most times may never come."




The IFREQ platform offers a comprehensive suite of tools, including tech-based tests and player profiling interfaces such as the Demo, App, and dashboard. Coaches can now track players' fitness, abilities, and positions of play, identifying areas for improvement with precision. Similarly, scouts can make informed decisions without the need for extensive travel, thanks to the platform's centralized database of player performances.

In Rwanda, the IFREQ team embarked on a scouting mission, testing players ranging from ages 11 to professionals. Collaborating with local football academies like the PSG Academy in Huye and conducting tests at the Skol grounds in Nzove where they managed to work with Rwanda premier league title contenders Rayon sports club , IFREQ aims to assess talent across various age groups and clubs.




Julien Mette, head coach of "ABARAYO," lauded the arrival of IFREQ, emphasizing the limitations of traditional scouting methods. "It is actually timely for us, especially on the technical bench, to embrace tools like these, as they would help us track players but also help players improve in different areas," Mette remarked. As technology continues to reshape the landscape of football scouting and development, IFREQ represents a beacon of hope for aspiring footballers and a catalyst for change in the sport's evolution.

Olympic Flame Relay sets off in Marseille Ignites Symbol of Solidarity with Ukraine

05:17, 2024-05-10

In a powerful demonstration of unity and solidarity, the Olympic torch relay commenced in Marseille on Thursday, marked by notable sports figures and a special tribute to Ukraine. Basile Boli, the city's revered football legend, initiated the relay at the iconic basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde, passing the torch to a diverse array of athletes, including Ukrainian gymnast Mariia Vysochanska, a 21-year-old from Lviv, led the relay as a symbolic "captain" amidst her father's involvement in defending Ukraine against the Russian invasion. She joined 28 athletes representing each of the 27 European Union countries, among them Poland's Olympic hammer champion Anita Wlodarczyk.




French sports minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra underscored the relay's significance, describing it as a poignant gesture of solidarity with Ukraine during its time of adversity. "This is a sign of unity, hope, and solidarity," she expressed, affirming the collective desire for Ukraine's triumph.

The torch's journey commenced beneath Marseille's famed golden statue of the "Good Mother," a stirring moment described by Boli as "fantastic" and emblematic of the universal values of sport and camaraderie.

With a strong football presence in the relay, former Ballon d'Or winner Jean-Pierre Papin and Ivorian football icon Didier Drogba were among the torchbearers. The torch's itinerary also includes a visit to the Stade Velodrome, home to Olympique Marseille, which will host multiple Olympic football matches.




Tony Estanguet, chief organiser of the event, highlighted the relay's auspicious beginning, underscoring its importance in setting the tone for the upcoming 78 days of the torch's journey. "The start is important in sport," Estanguet remarked, expressing confidence in the relay's momentum as it embarks on its symbolic voyage.

Kenyan police Force Prepares for Deployment to Haiti Amidst Challenges

04:54, 2024-05-10

Civilian contractors have arrived in Haiti to commence the construction of living quarters for an international security force led by Kenya, aimed at combating gang violence in the Caribbean nation, announced the US military's Southern Command.

The Multinational Security Support mission was endorsed by the UN Security Council in October to assist Haitian law enforcement in reclaiming territories controlled by powerful gang alliances, particularly in the capital, Port-au-Prince. Kenya pledged to contribute 1,000 officers to spearhead the force in July last year. However, the deployment has faced numerous setbacks, including legal challenges and a surge in violence in Port-au-Prince, leading to the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry in March. Kenyan President William Ruto informed Reuters last week that the swearing-in of a transition council in Haiti on April 25 had addressed concerns, and discussions were underway regarding the deployment.




According to a statement from Southern Command to Reuters, civilian contractors were flown into Haiti from May 3 to May 5 to facilitate the securing of equipment and supplies. "Additional contractors who have recently been transported are there to set up the temporary living area for the eventual arrival of the Multinational Security Support (MSS) Mission," the statement explained. Besides Kenya, other countries such as Jamaica, the Bahamas, Barbados, Benin, Chad, and Bangladesh have also committed personnel to the force.




The Kenyan contingent, which is scheduled to deploy soon, regrouped this week for the first time since the Kenyan government announced a delay in March, as confirmed by a Kenyan security official who preferred to remain anonymous. A Kenyan government spokesperson affirmed that the deployment was "on course" but did not provide details on the timeline.

The mission has encountered skepticism from foreign governments and local Haitians alike, given the history of international interventions in the country. Previous UN missions have left behind a devastating cholera outbreak and faced allegations of sexual abuse, contributing to apprehensions about foreign involvement in Haiti's affairs.

Déby Declared Winner of Chad's Presidential Election Amidst Controversy

04:09, 2024-05-10

Chad's state election body announced on Thursday that interim president Mahamat Idriss Déby had secured victory in the May 6 presidential election, claiming over 60 percent of the vote according to provisional results. However, his main challenger, Prime Minister Succès Masra, contested the outcome, declaring himself the winner. The electoral commission reported that Déby had triumphed over Masra, who managed to secure only 18.53 percent of the votes. These results are subject to confirmation by the Constitutional Council.

Despite the electoral commission's declaration, Masra asserted his victory earlier on Thursday, alleging manipulation of the election results.




Mahamat Idriss Déby assumed the role of transitional president in 2021 following the death of his father, Idriss Déby Itno, who had ruled Chad for three decades with an iron grip until his demise in a gun battle with rebels.

Initially promising an 18-month transition to democracy, Déby extended the interim period by an additional two years. During this time, opposition figures have either fled, been suppressed, or aligned themselves with Déby's administration. Notably, Déby's cousin and chief election rival, Yaya Dillo Djérou, was fatally shot at close range in an army assault on February 28, as reported by his party.




Critics have raised concerns about the legitimacy of the election. The International Federation for Human Rights cautioned that the election lacked credibility, freedom, and democratic principles. Similarly, the International Crisis Group highlighted several issues in the lead-up to the election, casting doubt on its fairness and transparency. The outcome of Chad's presidential election remains mired in controversy, with allegations of manipulation and doubts about its credibility echoing both domestically and internationally.

Rwanda;s first ever E driving tests facility now fully operational.

04:45, 2024-05-08

The Rwanda National Police (RNP) testing and licensing department has unveiled a groundbreaking initiative—the 'Driving eTesting System,' commencing on Monday, May 6. This innovative system, heralded as a significant leap forward in driving assessment, promises to revolutionize the traditional method of evaluating driving skills through automation.

The tests will be administered at the Busanza Automated Driving Test Centre in Kicukiro District. According to RNP, the system integrates cutting-edge technology, including GPS, car motion tracking formulas, and virtual line plotting technology, to provide a modernized and efficient means of assessing driving proficiency. RNP spokesperson Rutikanga shed light on key aspects of the new system, emphasizing that it will encompass both computer-based provisional tests and definitive driving tests for various categories, including A, B, C, D, and D1. Registration for these tests began on May 3 through the Irembo platform, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for applicants.




Despite the introduction of this advanced testing system, Rutikanga reassured the public that the charges for driving tests will remain unchanged. Candidates will pay the same fees as before, with provisional tests priced at Rwf5,000 and definitive tests at Rwf10,000. However, the costs for hiring vehicles for definitive driving tests will be lower than those typically paid at driving schools, with updated prices available on the Irembo platform.

Applicants must have completed the required driving skills training and possess their original national identity card when undertaking the exams. Rutikanga outlined the various testing stages, including driving through roundabouts, emergency braking, gear changes, and navigating obstacles, ensuring comprehensive evaluation of candidates' driving abilities.

To facilitate candidates' familiarity with the testing center, RNP will provide tutorial videos covering the test stages on social media platforms and display them on screens at the center. Additionally, the center will introduce smart driving tests, enabling candidates to select their preferred testing time and reducing wait times significantly.




Rutikanga emphasized the convenience, intelligence, and transparency of this approach, highlighting the benefits of a streamlined testing process. These developments come on the heels of cabinet approval for the use of automatic transmission in driving tests—an amendment poised to further enhance the efficiency and accessibility of driving assessments in Rwanda.

DRC Accuses smart phone giants of Fueling Conflict for "Blood Minerals"

04:34, 2024-05-08

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has lodged a formal protest against multinational corporations for allegedly perpetuating conflict on its territory by purchasing "blood minerals" to support the energy and digital industries. Kinshasa specifically singled out Apple, accusing the tech giant of sourcing minerals without due diligence on their origins, potentially fueling conflict in the region. This accusation marks a significant escalation in Kinshasa's ongoing efforts to hold external actors accountable for exacerbating conflict in the eastern DRC. The DRC government issued a formal warning to Apple, citing a new report by the expert members of the International Justice Taskforce that highlights human rights violations in the mining regions of the country.




According to the report titled "Blood Minerals-Le blanchiment des 3T de la RDC par le Rwanda et des entités privies," Congolese lawyers at Amsterdam & Partners have issued a formal notice to Apple and posed a series of questions to CEO Tim Cook. The legal team alleges that Apple has been using minerals sourced from regions plagued by grave human rights abuses, stating that the company is complicit in perpetuating the suffering of the Congolese people.

The report asserts that numerous companies, including Apple, have been accused of sourcing minerals from tainted suppliers with direct ties to rebel groups in the DRC. By purchasing minerals from these sources, these companies indirectly empower rebel groups and sustain the conflict in the region. In response, Apple has vehemently denied the accusations, asserting that it conducts independent audits of its suppliers to ensure compliance with international standards. The company emphasizes its commitment to responsible sourcing and due diligence in its supply chain, maintaining that all suppliers have been assessed for any involvement in the conflict.

Despite Apple's rebuttal, the DRC government remains steadfast in its demand for accountability. The government has given Apple and its subsidiaries in France three weeks to provide satisfactory answers to their inquiries. Failure to do so may result in legal action being pursued by the appointed Congolese lawyers.




The accusations against Apple underscore broader concerns about the exploitation of natural resources in the DRC, particularly 3T minerals—tin, tungsten, and tantalum—which are essential components in electronic devices. The illegal mining of these minerals has been linked to fueling the conflict in the DRC, perpetuating human rights abuses and instability in the region.

Pro-Palestinian Campus Protests Erupt Across Europe, Igniting Debate on Academic Response

03:54, 2024-05-08

Campus protests spearheaded by pro-Palestinian activists have surged across Europe, prompting universities to grapple with the challenging question of whether to allow or intervene in these demonstrations. As tensions escalate amidst the ongoing conflict in Gaza, schools are increasingly faced with navigating the delicate balance between upholding academic freedom and maintaining order on campus.

In Berlin, German police dispersed several hundred pro-Palestinian activists who had occupied a courtyard at the Free University. Similar scenes unfolded in Amsterdam, where protesters occupied a university building following the detention of 169 individuals at a separate campus location. The confrontations underscored the intensity of emotions surrounding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.




While some universities have permitted pro-Palestinian encampments, others have taken a firmer stance against occupation of campus spaces. In Berlin, University President Guenter Ziegler emphasized the importance of academic dialogue but condemned the occupation, stating, "An occupation is not acceptable on the FU Berlin campus."

Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner praised the university's decision to involve law enforcement, highlighting the need to maintain order and prevent escalation. However, the protests have not been limited to Germany alone. In Leipzig, about 50 pro-Palestinian protesters set up tents at Leipzig University, leading to calls for intervention from the student association over concerns for the safety of Jewish and Israeli students.

In the Netherlands, police forcefully dismantled a pro-Palestinian demonstration camp at the University of Amsterdam, sparking outrage among demonstrators. The university emphasized the value of dialogue in addressing the conflict but acknowledged the need to restore order on campus.




Jamil Fiorino-Habib, a lecturer at the University of Amsterdam's media studies department, advocated for a total academic boycott of Israel, reflecting the diversity of opinions among faculty and students.

As the protests continue to unfold, universities find themselves at the center of a heated debate over how to respond to pro-Palestinian activism on campus. While some advocate for dialogue and engagement, others call for more decisive action, underscoring the complex and multifaceted nature of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

Prince William and Kate Middleton Face Challenges Amid Kate's Cancer Battle

10:45, 2024-05-06

Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, have been navigating through a trying period as Kate undergoes treatment for cancer. Despite their efforts to maintain a low-key lifestyle away from the public eye, a friend of the couple has shed light on their current situation.

On March 22, the Princess of Wales disclosed the presence of cancer in her body during a heartfelt video message. She revealed




"My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment."




In an interview with the Telegraph, Amaia Arrieta, a designer close to the royal couple, shared insights into William and Kate's ordeal. Arrieta, known for designing attire for the couple's three children — Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis — expressed deep concern for their well-being.

"Dressing the royals gives me so much pride; I really do care about how they look," Arrieta stated. However, her remarks went beyond fashion, revealing the emotional toll the couple's current circumstances have taken.

Arrieta candidly remarked, "They are going through hell." Her words offer a glimpse into the private struggles faced by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during this challenging time.




As the royal family continues to grapple with personal hardships amidst their public duties, their resilience and unity serve as a testament to their strength. The outpouring of support from well-wishers worldwide underscores the universal empathy extended to the royals during moments of adversity

Catholic Nun's Letter Leads to Massacre of Tutsi Refugees at Sovu Monaster

06:49, 2024-05-06

As the genocide against the Tutsi continued to unfold across Rwanda, an appalling tragedy transpired at Sovu Monastery in Huye district on May 5, 1994. Sister Gertrude Mukangango, the head of the monastery, penned a letter to the Mayor of Huye, Jonathan Ruremesha, requesting the removal of Tutsi refugees who sought shelter there due to a lack of resources to sustain them.

The chilling letter, translated into English, pleaded for assistance from the mayor to compel the refugees to leave the monastery premises:




"Mr. Mayor of Huye Commune, BUTARE,

In recent weeks, some people have come to the Sovu Monastery as regular visitors for less than a week, most of them on official missions, while others have come to rest or pray. After the war that has ravaged the country started, there have been others who have come unexpectedly and they do not want to leave. In addition, we don’t have enough resources to support them. I have been asking for days for the communal authorities to come and order them to go back home, or go elsewhere they want to live, because here in the Monastery we do not have any resources left. I strongly request you, Mr. Mayor, to please help us on the matter not later than May, 1994, so that we can resume the usual work of the Monastery without any disturbance. We pray to God to protect you.

Head of Sovu Monastery. Sister Gertrude Consolata MUKANGAGO"

Tragically, instead of offering aid or assistance, the mayor responded by dispatching police officers and Interahamwe militants to the monastery, leading to the massacre of the remaining Tutsi refugees.

Sister Gertrude's involvement in the genocide extended beyond this letter. She had previously participated in attacks against the Tutsi, including supplying fuel to Interahamwe militants who burned Tutsi hiding in the monastery's garage on April 22, resulting in the deaths of approximately 7,000 people.

Following the genocide, Sister Gertrude and her counterpart, Sister Kizito (Julienne Mukabutera), were tried for their crimes in Belgium in 2001. Sister Gertrude admitted to showing the Interahamwe the rooms where Tutsi were hiding and was sentenced to 15 years in prison, while Sister Kizito received a 12-year sentence. After serving their terms, they settled in Maredret Monastery in Belgium.




Meanwhile, on the same day as Sister Gertrude's letter, Radio RTLM broadcasted extremist messages and speeches inciting violence against the Tutsi population, further fueling the genocidal fervor that swept the country.

The atrocities committed at Sovu Monastery serve as a stark reminder of the horrors of the Rwandan genocide and the devastating consequences of hatred and intolerance.

Bomb Blast Kills 10 in IDP Camp near Goma: Rwanda Dismisses Responsibility Amid Accusations

06:33, 2024-05-06

A bomb explosion rocked the Mugunga camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs) near Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on Friday morning, claiming the lives of at least 10 individuals and injuring several others, as reported by local sources.

Witnesses at the scene described multiple bombs being dropped at the camp, located approximately 10 kilometers west of Goma city. Hospital sources confirmed that at least 17 people, including children, sustained injuries and were rushed to Bethesda CBCA Ndosho hospital in the city. The International Committee of the Red Cross deployed a surgery team at the hospital to provide medical assistance. However, amidst the aftermath of the tragic incident, the Government of Rwanda swiftly dismissed accusations from the U.S. Department of State, which claimed Rwanda's involvement in the bombing of IDP camps around Goma.




"The attempt by the U.S. Department of State...to immediately and without any investigation place blame on Rwanda for the loss of lives in the IDP camps, is unjustified," the Rwandan government stated in a release on May 5.

According to the Rwandan government, warnings about the presence of heavy artillery within IDP camps had been issued by organizations in Goma, including Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders). The statement highlighted the deadly shelling witnessed by hundreds, along with the targeted shooting of protesters in the IDP camps by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) and Burundian armed forces deployed in the DRC.




The Rwandan government emphasized the necessity of a credible investigation to determine the facts surrounding the incident, criticizing what it deemed as a pattern of scapegoating Rwanda for the DRC government's shortcomings. The statement questioned the credibility of the U.S. government's role in facilitating peace in the region and underscored the international community's indifference towards the escalating military build-up and armed conflict in eastern DRC. Furthermore, the Rwandan government highlighted persistent threats from the Congolese leadership to invade Rwanda, asserting its commitment to defending its territory and ensuring the safety of its citizens.

As tensions escalate in the region and accusations fly, the urgent need for an impartial investigation to uncover the truth behind the bombing remains paramount. The incident underscores the fragile humanitarian situation in the DRC, where vulnerable populations continue to bear the brunt of violence and instability.

French President Macron Seeks Chinese Support in Ending Ukraine War During Xi Jinping's State Visit

06:17, 2024-05-06

French President Emmanuel Macron is set to engage Chinese President Xi Jinping in discussions aimed at leveraging China's influence to encourage Russia to cease its ongoing war in Ukraine. The two-day state visit to France will also address trade disputes concerning electric cars, cognac, and cosmetics. According to Macron's office, diplomatic efforts to support Ukraine and exert pressure on Russia rank high on France's agenda. Additionally, talks will encompass topics such as the Middle East, trade concerns, and global challenges like climate change. The European Commission president will participate in part of the meetings to address broader EU interests.

Xi Jinping's visit to France marks the initial leg of a European tour designed to mend relations amidst escalating global tensions. Following the French visit, Xi will journey to Serbia and Hungary.




French officials aim to persuade China to utilize its sway with Moscow to facilitate a resolution to the Ukraine conflict, as disclosed by a French presidential official. Despite claiming neutrality in the Ukraine conflict, China's continued support to Russian war efforts, particularly through supplies by Chinese companies, remains a focal point for Macron. Furthermore, France seeks to encourage China to maintain dialogue with Kyiv.

Notably, Macron previously implored Xi to "bring Russia to its senses" without visible alterations in Beijing's stance.

Marc Julienne, director of the Center for Asian Studies at the French Institute of International Relations, highlighted the apparent contradiction in French objectives. Julienne noted that France aims to convince Xi to assist in pressuring Putin while simultaneously dissuading China from providing arms to Russia.




The outcome of Macron and Xi's discussions holds significant implications for the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the broader geopolitical landscape, where alliances and diplomatic maneuvers shape the course of international relations.

LIBERIAN PRESIDENT SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER TO ESTABLISH WAR CRIMES COURT.

07:11, 2024-05-03

Liberian President Joseph Boakai took a historic step on Thursday by signing an executive order to establish a war crimes court, aiming to deliver long-awaited justice to victims of grave abuses during the country's two devastating civil wars. The conflicts, which ravaged Liberia from 1989 to 2003, were characterized by widespread atrocities, including massacres, rape, and the recruitment of child soldiers. Following the cessation of hostilities, a Truth and Reconciliation Committee recommended the establishment of a special court to prosecute those implicated in serious crimes.




However, progress on this front remained stagnant until Boakai's election last year. Since assuming office, President Boakai championed the cause for justice, proposing a resolution to create a special court—a proposal that garnered support from both Liberia's lower house and senate.

In a special address on Thursday, President Boakai expressed his firm belief in the indispensable link between justice and lasting peace. "The conviction that brings us here today is that, for peace and harmony to have a chance to prevail, justice and healing must lay the groundwork," stated President Boakai.

The move has been met with widespread support from activists and civil society groups, who have long advocated for greater accountability for crimes committed during the civil wars. An estimated 250,000 lives were lost during the conflicts, leaving scars that continue to haunt Liberian society.




Once operational, the war crimes court will adhere to international standards and receive support from international institutions, including the United Nations. In addition to prosecuting war crimes, the court will also address economic crimes, ensuring comprehensive accountability.

While the establishment of the court marks a significant milestone in Liberia's journey towards reconciliation and justice, there have been dissenting voices. Some within Liberia have expressed concerns that the court could reopen old wounds and potentially undermine existing amnesty laws that contributed to ending the conflicts.

Nevertheless, President Boakai's decisive action underscores Liberia's commitment to confronting its painful past and building a future founded on justice, healing, and peace.

M23 REBELES SEIZE CONTROL OF KEY COLTAN MINING TOWN IN THE NORTH KIVU REGION.

06:58, 2024-05-03

In a recent development, M23 rebels operating in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo have successfully taken control of Rubaya, a crucial mining town known for its coltan reserves, following days of intense conflict. Coltan, a key mineral used in smartphone production, has long been a source of contention in the region.

Congo's eastern provinces have been marred by violence since the 1990s, resulting in the loss of millions of lives as conflicts over national identity, ethnicity, and resource control have escalated, attracting numerous armed groups.




Willy Ngoma, the military spokesperson for M23, confirmed to international media outlets that Rubaya, located in North Kivu province, is now under their control. Ngoma stated that their operation targeted various armed groups in the region, including the Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, which has been associated with genocidal ideology.

"We never initiated hostilities. The government coalition launched attacks on our positions, forcing us to defend ourselves and prevent what we see as ongoing genocide, particularly in Rubaya. Our primary concern is protecting human life, not mineral resources," emphasized Ngoma during a press briefing. Rubaya, situated in North Kivu Province, is a significant producer of coltan, a highly sought-after mineral essential for the production of tantalum capacitors used in mobile phones and electronics.

Ngoma emphasized that the M23 rebels' mission is to safeguard civilian lives and halt atrocities perpetrated by various armed groups, including Imbonerakure, FDLR, Mai-Mai, and elements of the Congolese and Burundian armies.




When questioned about their strategy, Ngoma outlined their intention to push hostile forces away from populated areas and ensure the security and well-being of civilians. The recent developments echo previous calls for action to address the ongoing violence in eastern DR Congo. Last December, the newly formed Congo River Alliance (AFC), comprising nine rebel groups, including M23, urged President Felix Tshisekedi to halt civilian killings in North Kivu Province. Concerns were raised about indiscriminate bombings by the Congolese army in populated areas.




Former South African President Thabo Mbeki recently advocated for the disarmament of genocidal forces that sought refuge in Congolese territory following the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda. Mbeki emphasized the importance of implementing the Sun City Agreement, signed between Kigali and Kinshasa in April 2003, to address instability in eastern DR Congo.

In response to these developments, Congo's army spokesperson for operations against rebel groups, Lieutenant Colonel Guillaume Njike, stated that they are currently verifying whether Rubaya has indeed fallen to M23 control.

The situation in eastern DR Congo remains fluid, with stakeholders closely monitoring developments and assessing their implications for regional stability and civilian security.

20TH DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS RETREAT SETS AMBITIOUS AGENDA FOR RWANDA'S FUTURE.

04:46, 2024-05-03

Dr. Uziel NdagijeImana, the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning (MINCOFIN), struck an optimistic chord as the 20th Development Partners Retreat commenced, highlighting Rwanda's strengthened economic position since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.




"As we embark on our retreat today for 2024, we reflect on the remarkable achievements of the last 7 years, largely attributable to our partnerships, which have propelled continued progress in recovery and investment in future preparedness. Our holistic approach to managing the COVID-19 pandemic enabled us to swiftly resume economic activities, resulting in a significant recovery of the tourism and services sector," stated Minister NdagijeImana. He also noted that the upcoming NST2 would be expedited, taking only five years compared to the previous seven, to align with the forthcoming governmental mandate post-elections.










While at the same event, the United Nations Resident Coordinator, Mr. Ozonnia Ojielo, emphasized the pivotal role of sustainable finance and robust institutions in achieving sustainable development. "As development partners, we provide guidance and resources, drawing from our varied experiences. However, the foundation of our work rests upon the vision of the Government of Rwanda and its people," asserted Mr. Ojielo.




"These steps not only foster economic growth but also ensure that development efforts yield lasting and impactful results. By uniting and working collaboratively, we can drive progress towards the realization of Sustainable Development Goals. Let's join hands and pave the way towards a better future for all," added Mr. Ojielo.




The Development Partners Retreat (DPR) serves as a crucial platform for addressing pressing issues that may have been overlooked in quarterly Development Partners Coordination Group meetings. It facilitates open dialogue between the government and its development partners, guiding collaborative efforts for the coming year.




Early childhood development and the eradication of stunting, driven by nutritional improvements and enhanced feeding programs in schools, emerged as key highlights of achievements. However, there is a recognized need for further progress to ensure a high quality of life for Rwanda's youth as the nation progresses towards its vision for 2050.




Godfrey Kabera, Head of National Development Strategies and Research, emphasized the imperative to create more jobs, particularly those outside the N.E.A.T category, to enhance living standards, aligned with Rwanda's 2035 goals. Notably, sectors such as agriculture have clear roadmaps for progress. Despite increased government spending, announced to have risen by FRW 85.6 billion in the revised budget, with a direct positive effect on economic growth of 8.2%, development partners were encouraged to continue active participation in sectors where they are directly involved.




The retreat serves as a rallying call for collective action, urging development partners to actively contribute to joint resource mobilization, particularly in areas such as early childhood development and reducing maternal and child mortality rates.




As discussions progress over the coming days, stakeholders are poised to engage in robust dialogue and collaborative planning, aiming to drive sustainable development and inclusive growth in Rwanda.

RWANDA'S DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS CONVENE IN RUBAVU FOR A STRATEGIC RETREAT AND CELEBRATION OF THE NST1 ACHIVEMENTS.

08:28, 2024-05-02

Rwanda's development partners, stakeholders, and government officials gathered in Rubavu district for a crucial two-day retreat aimed at evaluating the previous National Social Transformation 1 (NST1) whose period of relay was seven years having been launched in the year 2017, and charting strategies for the upcoming phase which is going to be the NST 2 . The retreat ran under the theme "THINKING & WORKING TOGETHER TOWARDS NST2". This marks the second of such gathering since the onset of the pandemic, following the precedent-setting meeting on March 9, 2023, which saw the convergence of UN agencies, Heads of missions in Rwanda, Africa Development Bank, International Monetary Fund, JICA, and many others.




The Government of Rwanda participants were led by the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, Dr. Uziel NdagijeImana, expressed gratitude to all participants and partners for their unwavering support. Dr. NdagijeImana also presented a comprehensive report highlighting the achievements of National Social Transformation 1 (NST1). These accomplishments included a notable increase in GDP from 729 USD to 1090 USD, the construction of 7200 new classrooms, the creation of 1.2 million jobs, doubling of water pumping capacity, and significant progress in expanding electricity access across the country. "Currently only 24 sectors are left without a TVET school, and with your increased support, all this will be achieved," stated Minister NdagijeImana. He also acknowledged Rwanda's partial recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and global shocks.




"Ladies and gentlemen, NST2 will demand the active participation of all stakeholders and a heightened level of innovation to realize its objectives," emphasized Minister NdagijeImana.




Furthermore, the event witnessed projections of the NST2, underscoring Rwanda's commitment to continued socio-economic progress. Despite the successes of NST1, challenges persist, particularly in acquiring accurate data, notably household data, which remains difficult to track.

Aissa Toure, the Country Manager of African Development Bank in Rwanda and co-chair of the Development Partners Retreat (DPR), highlighted several tangible achievements, including the substantial increase in revenue from tourism, directly attributable to infrastructure development, climate change mitigation efforts, and advancements in food security and market stabilization.




As discussions unfold over the next two days, stakeholders are poised to deliberate on strategies that will drive Rwanda towards the ambitious goals set forth in NST2. With collective effort and innovative solutions, Rwanda aims to surmount challenges and pave the way for sustainable development and inclusive growth.

INDIA'S MODI AT THE CENTER OF RELIGIOUS DIVIDE AHEAD OF THE GENERAL ELECTION.

09:14, 2024-05-01

In the heart of Varanasi, India's spiritual capital, where the Ganges flows and the call to prayer echoes, tensions between Hindu and Muslim communities are escalating. This ancient city of temples and gods serves as the political stronghold of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who chose it as his constituency a decade ago to merge political and religious ambitions.




Having ascended to power promising development and anti-corruption, Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) now faces accusations of transforming India – constitutionally bound to secularism – into a Hindu rashtra, or homeland. As Sana Sabah, an entrepreneur, celebrated the Muslim festival of Eid with her family in Varanasi, she voiced concerns about Modi's leadership.

"It's scary that someone like Modi... is not only celebrated but validated," Sabah, 33, expressed. She noted that the Hindu-nationalist right-wing is openly advancing its agenda, a development she finds troubling.

With voting underway in the world's most populous nation, a significant portion of its over 200 million Muslim population fears Modi's re-election. Contesting for a rare third term in power, Modi defends his seat in Varanasi, a city of 1.7 million people, marked by diversity and traffic congestion. However, a decade after his rise, many of Varanasi's Muslims feel neglected and betrayed, particularly as a centuries-old mosque becomes the latest flashpoint testing India's secular fabric.




Local Muslim leader Syed Mohammad Yaseen, 78, laments the government's failure to protect his community, which he says is increasingly vulnerable to hate crimes in today's India.

"The worst will happen if Modi gets re-elected," Yaseen remarked from his office in Varanasi. "We are tolerating these things, maybe one day there can be change. But we are hopeless."

THE NATIONAL ELECTRAL COMMISSION WARNS AGAINST FORGING OF SIGNATURES.

05:57, 2024-05-01

The National Electoral Commission (NEC) has issued a stern warning to independent candidates, cautioning them against forging signatures as they strive to meet the criteria for their candidacies in the upcoming elections.

According to NEC, the campaign period is slated to commence on June 22 and will conclude on July 13, paving the way for voting to take place from July 14 to 16. Independent candidates began the process of collecting signatures on April 18 and are required to submit them to the electoral commission by May 30.




Presidential hopefuls are mandated to secure 600 signatures from registered voters across the country, equivalent to 12 individuals from each district. The submission of candidacies for both presidential and parliamentary positions will be accepted by the electoral commission from May 17 to 30.

While the electoral body refrained from disclosing the identities of presidential aspirants collecting signatures at the time of the press, Philippe Mpayimana, a contender in the 2017 presidential elections, has expressed his intention to vie for the same seat once again. The provisional list of approved candidates for both presidential and parliamentary seats is scheduled to be unveiled on June 6, with the final list set to be announced on June 14. Oda Gasinzigwa, Chairperson of the National Electoral Commission, confirmed the presence of independent candidates contending for both presidential and parliamentary positions.




"We will commence the reception of candidacies from presidential aspirants starting May 17. Independent candidates must prepare in advance by gathering 600 signatures, a process that commenced on April 18. Signatories to these independent candidates must be listed voters. Candidates can either seek signatures themselves or appoint representatives," Gasinzigwa elaborated.




"The number and identities of independent candidates will be disclosed shortly. We will conduct thorough verification to ensure that signatures are authentic. Integrity is paramount for aspiring leaders. Any attempts at forgery will be met with legal repercussions," she emphasized.

The campaign period for political parties and independent candidates is slated to kick off on June 22 and conclude on July 13. NEC has established 2,441 polling sites and 17,400 polling rooms nationwide, expecting a turnout of 9.5 million voters.




The provisional voters’ list is anticipated to be released no later than June 14, with the final list scheduled for announcement on June 29. Rwandans are scheduled to cast their votes on July 14 and 16, with those residing abroad participating in the presidential and parliamentary elections on July 14. Meanwhile, Rwandans within the country will vote on July 15.

On July 16, 24 female members of parliament will be elected by special organs, based on the administrative structure. Additionally, voting for two members of parliament elected by the National Youth Council and one Member of Parliament elected by the National Council of Persons with Disabilities will also take place on July 16.

CHINA'S XI SET TO VISIT EUROPE AS PUTIN WILL VISIT BEINJING IN MAY.

06:04, 2024-04-29

China's strategic positioning amidst the ongoing conflict in Ukraine will come under intense scrutiny next month as President Xi Jinping prepares for a pivotal European tour and hosts Russian President Vladimir Putin on home soil. Putin's announcement at a business forum on Thursday regarding a planned visit by Xi in May underscores the strengthening alliance between China and Russia since the outbreak of the war in 2022. This impending visit follows Putin's last trip to China in October, signaling a continued deepening of bilateral relations.




In what promises to be a bustling month of diplomacy for China, President Xi is anticipated to embark on a European journey with scheduled stops in France, Serbia, and Hungary. While China has yet to officially confirm Xi's visits to France and Serbia, Gergely Gulyas, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s chief of staff, disclosed on Thursday that Xi would visit Hungary from May 8 to 10. Dylan Loh, an assistant professor of foreign policy at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, anticipates that discussions during Xi's European tour will heavily feature the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Loh suggests that while the issue will prominently figure in talks with French officials, it may not be as emphasized in discussions with Hungarian officials due to Budapest's closer ties with Moscow.




Quoting Gulyas, Reuters reported Hungary's acknowledgment of China as one of the world's leading powers, surpassing even the European Union in strength. Gulyas underscored Hungary's interest in fostering strong economic ties with multiple nations, emphasizing the country's pragmatic approach to international relations.




"Hungary believes in the importance of maintaining robust economic relationships without erecting ideological barriers," stated Gulyas, expressing Hungary's satisfaction with President Xi's forthcoming visit.

As China navigates its diplomatic relations in the face of geopolitical tensions, President Xi's upcoming European tour and meeting with Russian President Putin are poised to provide significant insights into China's foreign policy priorities and its evolving role on the global stage.

AS AWAY TO CRACK DOWN ILLEGAL GRAZING, BUGESERA AUTHORITIES IMPOUND AND AUCTIOIN ANIMALS.

05:46, 2024-04-29

Bugesera district authorities have taken a firm stance against illegal grazing, auctioning off 21 cows and 50 goats that were found grazing on private land belonging to the Rwanda Institute for Conservation Agriculture. The auction, held on April 25, underscores the district's commitment to enforcing strict regulations on livestock management. Richard Mutabazi, the mayor of Bugesera, clarified that the impounded animals were seized after repeated warnings were disregarded by their owners. The district maintains stringent regulations concerning zero grazing and buffer zones, with livestock owners expected to keep their animals off private properties.




"We've engaged in discussions with farmers regarding the rules and the repercussions of trespassing," stated Mutabazi. "The fines for each animal found in buffer zones amount to Rwf 150,000, and Rwf 50,000 for those straying into other areas, including lands surrounding Bugesera Airport, Gako Military Academy, and the Rwanda Institute for Conservation Agriculture."

According to the mayor, failure to settle fines within 72 hours of impoundment results in the auctioning of the animals to cover incurred costs.

Hyacenthus Uwitonze, Bugesera District's Animal Resources Officer, emphasized the advantages of zero grazing, citing its role in reducing disease transmission, mitigating environmental damage, and enhancing feed efficiency. Uwitonze urged farmers to confine their livestock to avoid fines and potential auctioning.




"The fines serve to promote responsible farming practices and enhance productivity among compliant farmers," he added. "When livestock stray, they pose risks of disease transmission and crop damage to neighboring farms."

In response to the issue, farmers have established cooperatives to improve livestock management. These cooperatives facilitate resource-sharing, enable access to private veterinary services, and promote the adoption of modern farming techniques, including the upgrading of cattle breeds.

The shift from traditional to more controlled and efficient breeds has notably curbed incidents of trespassing. Despite repeated attempts to solicit their perspective, the owners of the impounded animals declined to comment to City Radio.




Bugesera district's decisive action underscores the importance of adherence to livestock management regulations, ensuring sustainable agricultural practices and harmonious coexistence within the community.

RWANDA'S HORTICULTURE CONTINUES TO WIN BIG ON THE WORLD MARKET

05:29, 2024-04-29

Rwanda's agricultural sector continues to blossom as fruit, vegetable, and flower exports surge, generating an impressive $46 million between July 2023 and February 2024, according to data released by the National Agricultural Export Development Board (NAEB).

The statistics reveal a substantial growth trajectory, with horticulture exports soaring to $58.1 million in the fiscal year 2022/2023 from $42.8 million the previous year. Janet Basiima, Division Manager of Export Markets Development & Innovation at NAEB, attributes this remarkable surge to concerted efforts in agricultural advancement and efficient market linkage strategies benefiting local farmers. Basiima emphasized the pivotal role of increased international market access and enhanced productivity techniques in augmenting Rwanda's exports. Notably, the shift from 40 tonnes per month in 2017 to an impressive 1,000 tonnes per month in 2024 underscores Rwanda's burgeoning presence in global markets.




"Horticulture farming's short growth cycle provides multiple export opportunities annually," stated Basiima, highlighting the advantage for exporters. The government's initiatives to allocate suitable land for horticulture and facilitate access to international markets have propelled farmers to ramp up production significantly. The success story is further amplified by strategic branding and marketing initiatives, including participation in international exhibitions like Expo Doha 2023, where Rwanda showcased its agricultural prowess to millions of visitors worldwide. Basiima stressed that such platforms enable exporters to secure lucrative deals and glean insights into evolving market demands.




However, challenges remain, as Rwanda aims to bolster its capacity to meet escalating international demand. Patrick Kagabo Rubega, CEO of Bella Flowers, emphasized the importance of market research and leveraging international exhibitions to enhance product quality and secure fair deals.

In the fiscal year 2022-2023, Rwanda's flower exports, valued at $4.5 million, found their way to key markets such as the United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Korea. Notably, 66% of exports were destined for the Netherlands, underscoring the country's significance in Rwanda's export landscape.

Looking ahead, Rwanda sets its sights on tapping into the lucrative avocado market, with trial shipments to Dubai and Europe via sea routes showing promising results. The recent shipment of Hass avocados to the Netherlands marks a significant milestone, with Rwanda eyeing substantial revenue gains from this sought-after fruit.




Rwanda's ambitious target to generate $1 billion from agricultural exports in the fiscal year 2023/2024 reflects the country's unwavering commitment to harnessing its agricultural potential and fostering economic growth. With the stellar performance of the previous financial year serving as a testament to its progress, Rwanda strides confidently towards realizing its agricultural export ambitions.

US SECRETARY OF STATE BLINKEN EMBARKS ON THE SEVENTH DIPLOMATIC TRIP TO THE MIDDLE EAST SINCE THE ISRAEL- HAMAS WAR.

03:52, 2024-04-29

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is gearing up for his seventh diplomatic mission to the Middle East since the eruption of the Israel-Hamas conflict over six months ago. As he prepares to engage with key stakeholders in the region, Blinken faces a daunting task ahead. The conflict, which has persisted since Hamas’ deadly attacks on Israel on October 7th, shows no signs of abating. With over 34,000 Palestinians killed and hundreds of thousands displaced, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is reaching critical levels. Internationally, the conflict has sparked widespread protests, including on American college campuses, where U.S. support for Israel has come under intense scrutiny.







The Biden administration is acutely aware of the potential political ramifications, especially in an election year. Ahead of Blinken’s diplomatic tour, President Joe Biden held a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday. The discussions come amid renewed concerns about the conflict spreading across the Middle East. Blinken's itinerary includes stops in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Israel, with a primary focus on facilitating dialogue and de-escalation efforts. However, prospects for Israeli-Saudi rapprochement remain uncertain, as Israel's reluctance to consider key conditions set by the Saudis, including the creation of a Palestinian state, hampers progress. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has been actively engaged in negotiations with Egypt and Qatar to broker a deal between Israel and Hamas. The aim is to secure the release of Israeli hostages abducted during the initial attacks in exchange for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.




However, despite ongoing negotiations, tangible progress has yet to materialize. Additionally, there are growing concerns within the Biden administration about the potential for a major Israeli military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. While Israel has not initiated such an offensive, Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly emphasized its necessity to eliminate Hamas.

As Blinken embarks on his diplomatic mission, all eyes are on the Middle East, with hopes pinned on diplomatic efforts to bring an end to the protracted conflict and pave the way for lasting peace in the region.

GLOBAL AMERICAN ALLIES START TO BRACE THEMSELEVES FOR A POTENTIAL TRUMP RETURN TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

04:19, 2024-04-26

As the specter of former President Donald Trump's return to power looms large ahead of the November elections, US allies worldwide are taking proactive measures to safeguard their interests and navigate potential challenges under a Trump 2.0 administration. Recent opinion polls in swing states suggest an even chance of Trump reclaiming the presidency, prompting allies to ramp up their preparations for various scenarios. From Germany's charm offensive within the Republican Party to Japan's efforts to establish direct channels of communication with Trump's inner circle, countries are leaving no stone unturned in their bid to mitigate the potential fallout of another Trump presidency.




In a bid to prevent a recurrence of the tumultuous "America First" policies that characterized Trump's previous tenure, allies are actively engaging with key figures within the Republican Party and reaching out to Trump himself. Reuters' conversations with diplomats and government officials across five continents have revealed a flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at anticipating and managing the implications of Trump's potential return to the White House.

For instance, Mexican officials are reportedly deliberating the appointment of a new foreign minister equipped with the savvy to navigate Trump's diplomatic approach. Meanwhile, Australia is rushing to fortify its defense ties with the US through legislative measures designed to withstand any potential policy shifts under a Trump administration.




Despite the diplomatic delicacy of engaging with Trump directly, some foreign leaders have opted to establish direct lines of communication with the former president. Saudi Arabia's crown prince recently phoned Trump, signaling the kingdom's interest in maintaining ties with a potential future administration. Similarly, Hungary's prime minister and Poland's president have met with Trump in person in recent weeks, underscoring the importance of maintaining bilateral relationships regardless of the prevailing political landscape in the US.

As the world watches the unfolding dynamics of the 2024 elections, the global community braces itself for the potential resurgence of Trump's brand of politics and the far-reaching implications it could have on international relations.
















BOTSWANA REJECTS UK DEAL TO HOST ASYLUM SEEKERS AMIDST CONTRAVERSY.

04:09, 2024-04-26

Botswana authorities have firmly rejected proposals from the United Kingdom to accommodate asylum seekers in the country, amid a contentious move by the UK government to address increased illegal migration by seeking partnerships with African nations. In a bid to tackle the issue of illegal migration, the United Kingdom has explored the option of sending asylum seekers to Africa, with Rwanda being the only African country to agree to the proposals thus far. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has indicated that the deal with Rwanda is scheduled to commence within 10 to 12 weeks.




However, Botswana has declined a similar offer from the UK, citing concerns about the lack of clarity regarding the long-term implications of hosting asylum seekers. Lemogang Kwape, Botswana's Foreign Affairs minister, stated that the country could not commit to hosting individuals without a clear understanding of the ultimate objectives of such an arrangement.

The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) NGO Working Group, representing civil society organizations, has thrown its support behind Botswana's decision to reject the UK's asylum proposal. Kutlwano Relontle, UPR's program manager, emphasized the need for Botswana and other countries to distance themselves from the controversial UK program, which appears to selectively protect certain asylum seekers while disregarding others.




"We noted that in the case of the conflict in Ukraine, those seeking asylum were fast-tracked into the system, and citizens even encouraged to host them in their homes," added Relontle, highlighting inconsistencies in the UK's approach to asylum seekers. British authorities have cited a surge in migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats in recent years, attributing the increase to various factors such as war, climate change, and economic uncertainty. Official data reveals that 45,774 migrants arrived in Britain via small boats in 2022, with the figure dropping to 29,437 last year following government measures to combat illegal migration.

As the UK government continues to grapple with the complex issue of migration, its efforts to seek partnerships with African nations have sparked debate and raised questions about the efficacy and ethics of such arrangements.

PROPOSED TAX CHANGES ON MINERALS SHINE A RAY OF HOPE TO BOOSTING PROCESSING AND REVENUE

03:46, 2024-04-26

Industry insiders have welcomed proposed amendments to mineral taxation laws, including significant cuts in gold rates, asserting that these changes could stimulate interest in processing and lead to higher revenues from precious metals and stones.

The government's draft law establishing a tax on minerals aims to promote value addition by implementing lower rates for minerals supplied to local smelters and refineries, while simultaneously discouraging the exportation of unprocessed minerals through higher rates.

Bosco Kayobotsi, Managing Director of Gasabo Gold Refinery (GGR), highlighted the potential impact of these changes on the mineral processing sector. GGR, a mineral processing company based in Rwanda, specializes in adding value to silver and gold, serving clients locally, regionally, and internationally. Kayobotsi noted that the current tax rate of six percent on gold was impeding profitability for traders, resulting in limited capacity utilization at the refinery.




"With the proposed tax rate reduction to 0.5 percent, the mineral business could see a significant boost, allowing for increased sourcing of gold and supply to the refinery," Kayobotsi stated.




The draft law sets low rates of mining royalty tax for minerals supplied to local processing facilities, aiming to incentivize value addition. The proposed tax rates vary depending on the mineral type, with gold subject to the lowest rate of 0.5 percent of the norm value. Jean Malik Kalima, Chairperson of the Rwanda Mining Association, emphasized the positive impact of these tax changes on the mining sector's development and revenue generation. Kalima highlighted the potential for Rwanda to become a hub in mineral trading, particularly in the gold sector, by encouraging investment and promoting processed mineral sales.




The proposed amendments also include additional tax rates applicable to exported raw minerals to discourage such practices. These rates range from one to three percent of the norm value, depending on the mineral type, with raw gold exports subject to an additional 0.5 percent tax rate.

Kayobotsi supported the additional tax on raw gold exports, noting that it would incentivize traders to export refined minerals instead, reducing unnecessary charges and promoting purity.

Data from the Rwanda Mines, Petroleum, and Gas Board (RMB) indicates a significant increase in mineral export revenue, with expectations to surpass $1.5 billion by the end of 2024. The proposed tax changes aim to further enhance reven

KING CHARLES THE 111 ASSENTS THE TRANSFER OF ASYLUM SEEKERS TO RWANDA.

13:07, 2024-04-25

In a pivotal moment for British politics, King Charles has officially granted royal assent to legislation crucial to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's contentious plan to relocate asylum seekers to Rwanda. Royal assent, the final stage in the legislative process, effectively rubber stamps the decision taken by parliament earlier this week to approve the bill, following a protracted battle between the government and opponents of the plan.

The announcement of Royal Assent was made in the House of Lords on Thursday, signaling the enactment of the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill into law. Parliament had given its approval to the legislation in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Prime Minister Sunak had previously indicated that he expected the first flights to Rwanda to commence within 10 to 12 weeks after the bill's passage.




However, the policy has faced criticism from various quarters. Moderates have raised concerns about the extremity of the measures, echoing sentiments expressed by the United Nations' refugee agency, which stated that the Rwanda plan "is not compatible with international refugee law."

On the other hand, hard-liners within Sunak's party argue that the bill does not go far enough in deterring migration to the U.K. Efforts by hard-liners to strengthen the bill through amendments were thwarted on Wednesday, with lawmakers rejecting proposals including one that would have allowed British authorities to routinely disregard emergency injunctions from the European Court of Human Rights. Critics argue that such actions would breach international law, but hard-liners like Suella Braverman, a former interior minister, maintain that the European court's influence infringes upon the country's sovereignty.




Despite internal divisions, Sunak remains steadfast in his support for the bill, emphasizing that it represents the government's maximum effort in light of the agreement with Rwanda, which could be jeopardized if the U.K. were to violate international law. The Labour Party has seized on the Conservative Party's internal discord, with leader Keir Starmer likening the situation to "hundreds of bald men scrapping over a single broken comb."

As the legislation takes effect, Britain braces for the implementation of a policy that has sparked intense debate and raised profound questions about the nation's approach to asylum and immigration.

A HISTORIC, INAUGURAL WOMEN'S GOLF TOURNA SET TO TAKE PLACE IN KIGALI.

06:12, 2024-04-25

The Kigali Golf Resort and Villas is set to make history as it prepares to host its inaugural ladies' golf tournament, a pioneering event dedicated exclusively to women. Scheduled to take place on April 26, the tournament aims to empower women and nurture their interest in the sport, highlighting the commitment of the resort to the development of women's golf. Corneille Nsabimana, the Marketing Manager of Kigali Golf Resort and Villas, emphasized the significance of the tournament in promoting women's participation in golf. "The motive behind the tournament is to underscore our commitment to the development of women’s golf as well as to increase participation of women in this sport," stated Nsabimana.




The tournament will span one day, with the second edition tentatively planned for June, aligning with the resort's ongoing efforts to promote women's golf throughout the year. Nsabimana revealed that the subsequent edition is slated to take place on the last Friday of June. With the inaugural tournament generating significant interest, approximately 30 golfers, comprising both locals and expatriates, have confirmed their participation, signaling a promising start for the event. "This is very good considering the fact that this is the first edition," noted Nsabimana, highlighting the enthusiasm and anticipation surrounding the tournament.




Participants in the tournament can look forward to an award ceremony honoring various achievements on the golf course. Awards will be presented for the longest drive, nearest to the pin, as well as for winners and runners-up in different handicap categories. This recognition underscores the inclusive nature of the tournament and celebrates the accomplishments of all participants, regardless of skill level. As the Kigali Golf Resort and Villas embarks on this historic endeavor, it reaffirms its commitment to promoting gender equality in sports and providing opportunities for women to excel in golf. With the inaugural ladies' golf tournament poised to become a highlight of the golfing calendar, participants and spectators alike can anticipate a day of camaraderie, competition, and celebration of women's achievements in the sport.

FERWABA ADDS RWANDA BASKETBALL CUP TO THEIR CALENDAR IN A BID TO ELEVATE LOCAL TALENTS.

06:00, 2024-04-25

The Rwandan basketball landscape is set for a transformative boost as the local governing body, Ferwaba, announces the addition of the "Rwanda Basketball Cup" to its annual basketball calendar. This ground-breaking tournament, slated to run from April 26 to August 9, is poised to revolutionize the sport in the country, encompassing teams from both the topflight and lower divisions.

Formerly, Rwanda's basketball calendar was dominated by the league and the Genocide Memorial Tournament. However, with the introduction of the Rwanda Basketball Cup, Ferwaba aims to expand opportunities for teams, foster their development, and elevate the overall standard of play in the nation.

In an exclusive interview with Times Sport, Ferwaba Executive Director Fiona Ishimwe shed light on the tournament's purpose, eligibility criteria, structure, and anticipated impact on Rwandan basketball.

"The tournament aims to increase the number of teams playing in the country, fostering their development and raising the overall standard of play," Ishimwe stated, emphasizing the tournament's pivotal role in nurturing talent and promoting competition.

The Rwanda Basketball Cup welcomes teams from both the first and second divisions, across male and female categories. This inaugural edition will feature 21 men's teams and nine women's teams, showcasing the depth and diversity of basketball talent in Rwanda.

To ensure a competitive and fair tournament, the participating teams have been organized into groups. Seventeen men's teams from the first and second divisions have been distributed into four groups, with the top four teams from the 2023 season standings securing direct entry into the quarter-finals. In the women's category, the nine participating teams have been divided into two groups.

Notably, the stakes are high for the tournament's champions. The winner of the Rwanda Cup in the women’s category will represent Rwanda in Zone 5 competitions, while the men's division champion will earn the privilege to compete in the forthcoming East Africa Cup, sanctioned by FIBA.

Furthermore, the victors of both the Rwanda Cup and the league will converge in the prestigious Rwanda Super Cup tournament, held before the commencement of the new season. Adopting a single-game format, this tournament will determine the ultimate winner after a thrilling 40-minute, four-quarter contest, showcasing the best of Rwandan basketball talent.

With the Rwanda Basketball Cup set to become a highlight of the national basketball calendar, fans can anticipate exhilarating matchups, fierce competition, and the emergence of new stars, propelling Rwandan basketball to greater heights on the continental stage.

RWANDA CONSIDERS TO BAN CEMENTED AND TILED TOMBS TO ADDRESS BURRIAL SPACE SCARCITY.

05:52, 2024-04-25

A proposed amendment to Rwandan law aims to ban the construction of burial tombs using cement, tiles, and metallic materials in efforts to tackle delays in land reuse and alleviate cemetery scarcity, according to the Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC).

Joseph Curio Havugimana, Head of Communications at MINALOC, emphasized the need for the amendment, citing concerns that tombs built with non-biodegradable materials can impede the natural decomposition process of bodies, leading to prolonged periods before land can be repurposed for other uses.




"The scarcity of cemeteries in Rwanda has affected a large number of local citizens and non-natives in various ways," stated Havugimana, highlighting the urgency of addressing the issue.

Cement and tiles, commonly used in tomb construction, are known for their durability and resistance to natural degradation processes. This durability poses challenges to timely land reuse, exacerbating cemetery scarcity nationwide. To address this, MINALOC proposes promoting the use of biodegradable materials for burial tombs, facilitating quicker decomposition and allowing for more efficient land reuse. Under the proposed amendment, standard burial plots could be reused after 10 years, while special tombs would have a 20-year reuse period from the last interment.

The existing law distinguishes between ordinary and special tombs, with ordinary tombs excavated into the soil and not fully constructed, while special tombs are fully constructed and placed in reserved areas of public cemeteries.




Additionally, MINALOC acknowledges cremation as another alternative for burial, permitted under current law with proper authorization. However, public cremation facilities are lacking in Rwanda, posing a challenge to wider adoption of this method. Private investment in cremation facilities has been encouraged, but cultural resistance remains a barrier.

Havugimana noted that Rwanda's foreign population, with cultural practices favoring cremation, underscores the need for accessible cineration facilities to accommodate diverse burial customs.

As Rwanda grapples with cemetery scarcity, the proposed law amendment and exploration of alternative burial methods reflect the government's commitment to addressing the issue while respecting cultural diversity and environmental considerations.

BIDEN'S TIK TOK PUTT RAISES EYEBROWS AMIDST LEGISLATION TO BAN THE APP.

04:52, 2024-04-25

When President Joe Biden showcased his putting skills during a campaign stop at a public golf course in Michigan last month, the moment garnered attention on TikTok, the popular social media platform. Forced indoors by a rainstorm, Biden engaged in a friendly putting competition with 13-year-old Hurley “HJ” Coleman IV, with the exchange captured and shared on the app by the Coleman family.

In the video, Biden sinks a putt, followed by Coleman expertly responding with his own successful shot, accompanied by the caption, “I had to sink the rebuttal.” Notably absent were the network television cameras that typically trail the president during public appearances.




However, amidst Biden's engagement with TikTok, he signed legislation on Wednesday that could potentially lead to the banning of the app in the United States. This move has sparked criticism, particularly from avid users of TikTok, which researchers have identified as a primary news source for a significant portion of Americans under the age of 30.

Kahlil Greene, a prominent TikTok user known as the “Gen Z Historian” with over 650,000 followers, expressed concern over what he sees as a contradiction in the Biden administration's stance. “There’s a core hypocrisy to the Biden administration supporting the TikTok ban while at the same time using TikTok for his campaign purposes,” Greene stated.

However, the Biden campaign defends its use of TikTok, asserting that it would be imprudent to disregard any platform where people engage with information about the president. Rob Flaherty, deputy manager of Biden’s reelection campaign, emphasized the necessity of meeting voters where they are in today's fragmented media landscape.




Flaherty noted that the Biden team established relationships with TikTok influencers during the 2020 election and acknowledges the platform's increasing influence as a driver of narratives about the president. The campaign insists that engaging with platforms like TikTok, alongside others such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, is essential in reaching potential supporters. While opponents of TikTok raise concerns about its Chinese ownership by ByteDance and the potential implications for national security, including data privacy and content manipulation, no concrete evidence has been made public regarding Beijing's influence over the app. Nonetheless, the legislation signed by Biden aims to address these concerns by forcing ByteDance to sell TikTok to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban.

ByteDance has contested the legality of the law, citing First Amendment concerns, and has vowed to challenge it in court. As debates over TikTok's future in the U.S. continue, Biden's engagement with the platform amid legislative efforts to ban it underscores the complexities surrounding technology, national security, and political strategy in the digital age.

RWANDA'S ZIPLINE DRONE COMPANY CELEBRATES A MILLIONTH DELIVERY.

04:36, 2024-04-25

Zipline, a pioneering drone services delivery company based in Rwanda, has marked a significant achievement in the logistics sector by reaching its one-millionth delivery to customers. The milestone delivery, consisting of two bags of IV fluid transported from a Zipline distribution center in Ghana to a local health facility, underscores the company's commitment to revolutionizing last-mile delivery. Since its inception in Rwanda, Zipline has expanded its operations across four continents, leveraging substantial investments from prominent firms like Sequoia Capital, a16z, and Google Ventures. Keller Rinaudo, the company's chief executive, attributed the milestone to Zipline's unwavering dedication to key markets, particularly healthcare, quick commerce, and food delivery.

"The three areas where the incentive makes the most sense today are health care, quick commerce, and food," Rinaudo emphasized, highlighting Zipline's strategic partnerships with leading brands and institutions to drive innovation in logistics through autonomous drone technology. Currently, Zipline operates in Rwanda, Ghana, Kenya, Côte d’Ivoire, and Nigeria.

In Rwanda, Zipline's impact on healthcare delivery is profound, with the company responsible for delivering 75 per cent of the country's blood supply outside of Kigali, leading to an 88 per cent reduction in maternal mortality rates due to postpartum hemorrhage. In Kenya, Zipline's collaboration with the Elton John AIDS Foundation has facilitated the efficient delivery of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment products, empowering individuals to manage their health effectively.

Medical personnel receives the drone delivery




In Nigeria, Zipline's reach extends to over 500 health facilities in Kaduna, more than 350 in Cross River State, and 200 in Bayelsa, demonstrating the company's commitment to addressing healthcare challenges across diverse regions. Across Ghana, Zipline has completed over 540,000 drone delivery flights, transporting essential medical supplies including vaccines, medical products, blood products, and animal health products.

"The achievement of the one millionth delivery milestone underscores dedication to enhancing healthcare outcomes and addressing societal needs across Africa," Rinaudo remarked in a press statement, reflecting on Zipline's mission-driven approach to advancing healthcare access.

As Zipline continues to innovate and expand its reach, the company remains poised to shape the future of healthcare delivery not only on the African continent but also globally. Since commencing operations in 2016, following a groundbreaking partnership with the Rwandan Government, Zipline has been at the forefront of delivering innovation and technology products and services, aligning closely with the country's ambitions of fostering technological advancement and inclusive growth.
















CHINA READYS CREW TO MAN THEIR SPACE STATION AS THEY EYE MEN ON THE MOON BY 2030.

04:22, 2024-04-25

China's space agency is gearing up to send a fresh crew to its burgeoning space station on Thursday, marking another milestone in its ambitious space exploration agenda that eyes lunar missions by 2030. The upcoming Shenzhou-18 mission underscores China's rapid progress in space exploration, despite being excluded from the International Space Station (ISS).

The three-member crew, comprising Commander Ye Guangfu and astronauts Li Cong and Li Guangsu, is poised to relieve the current team at China's Tiangong space station. This mission follows China's independent development of its space station, forged in response to exclusion from the ISS,

largely attributed to geopolitical tensions, notably with the United States.







According to Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA), the Shenzhou-18 crew will engage in a diverse array of tasks during their approximate six-month stint aboard the space station. These include scientific experiments, installation of space debris protection equipment, payload experiments, and efforts to promote science education.

Lin emphasized China's commitment to international collaboration in space endeavors, expressing intentions to welcome foreign astronauts and even space tourists aboard China's space station. "We definitely expect to see astronauts of different identities on China's space station," he stated during a press conference. The lift-off for the Shenzhou-18 mission is scheduled for 1259 GMT from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, situated on the fringes of the Gobi Desert in China's northwest.

China's foray into space exploration began with its first manned mission in 2003, positioning it as the third nation, after the former Soviet Union and the U.S., to independently launch humans into space. While the U.S. space program maintains a considerable advantage in spending, supply chains, and capabilities, China has made notable strides in recent years, including lunar sample returns and rover missions to the far side of the moon.




Meanwhile, the U.S. is reviving its lunar ambitions, aiming to land astronauts on the moon by the end of 2025. Leveraging partnerships with private sector entities like SpaceX and Blue Origin, the U.S. seeks to reclaim its status as the sole country to have put astronauts on the lunar surface.

Currently, only four countries — the U.S., Russia, China, and India — have achieved the feat of landing spacecraft on the moon, underscoring the exclusivity and complexity of lunar exploration endeavors. As China looks to expand its presence in space and beyond, the global stage braces for heightened competition and collaboration in the final frontier.

HAMAS SIGNALS WILLINGNESS TO TRUCE AND POLITICAL TRANSITION WITH THE UNIFICATION OF THE INDEPENDENT PALASTINIAN STATE.

03:49, 2024-04-25

In a surprising turn of events, a top Hamas political official has indicated the Islamic militant group's openness to a truce lasting five years or more with Israel. Khalil al-Hayya, speaking in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, suggested that Hamas would be willing to lay down its weapons and transition into a political party if an independent Palestinian state is established along pre-1967 borders.




"The suggestion that Hamas would disarm appeared to be a significant concession by the militant group officially committed to Israel’s destruction," al-Hayya remarked during the interview.




The remarks from al-Hayya come amidst a deadlock in months of cease-fire negotiations. However, the feasibility of such a scenario remains uncertain, given Israel's steadfast opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state on territories captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

"We want to join the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and form a unified government for Gaza and the West Bank," al-Hayya emphasized, highlighting Hamas's aspirations for political integration.

In the event of certain conditions being met, al-Hayya asserted that Hamas's military wing would dissolve, mirroring the transition of other liberation movements into political entities with national armies upon achieving independence.




"All the experiences of people who fought against occupiers... when they became independent and obtained their rights and their state, what have these forces done? They have turned into political parties," al-Hayya reflected on the potential transition.

While Hamas's position on the prospect of a Palestinian state alongside Israel has evolved over time, with occasional moderation in its public stance, the group's official political program continues to reject any alternative to the full liberation of Palestine.




"While we entertain the idea of a truce and political transition, our ultimate goal remains the full liberation of Palestine," al-Hayya concluded, reaffirming Hamas's long-standing objectives amidst the ongoing diplomatic efforts.

As diplomatic efforts continue to navigate these challenges, the possibility of a lasting peace in the region hangs in the balance, with Hamas's latest overture offering a glimmer of hope amidst the protracted stalemate.

TESLA TO MAKE SMALLER AND AFFORDABLE CARS AS AWAY TO GET OUT OF THE DIP.

07:53, 2024-04-24

Despite a notable 55% dip in first-quarter net income, Tesla Inc. witnessed a surge in its stock price during after-hours trading on Tuesday following the company's announcement to expedite the production of new, more affordable vehicles.

The electric car manufacturer, headquartered in Austin, Texas, disclosed that it generated $1.13 billion in revenue from January through March, a significant decrease from $2.51 billion recorded during the same period a year ago. However, investors and analysts found optimism in Tesla's commitment to ramp up the production of smaller, cost-effective models, signaling potential growth opportunities for the company.




Tesla's decision to prioritize the production of smaller models, including the anticipated Model 2 small car with an estimated price tag of $25,000, garnered attention. These new models, built on advanced vehicle underpinnings and incorporating features from current models, are expected to commence production ahead of previous guidance. CEO Elon Musk indicated during a conference call with analysts that production could begin in the second half of next year, if not by late this year. Notably, Musk emphasized that the production of these new vehicles would not necessitate the establishment of new factories or extensive production lines, thus ensuring a more cost-efficient approach amid prevailing uncertainties.




While Musk provided limited details regarding the specifics of the new vehicles, he expressed confidence in Tesla's ability to surpass last year's vehicle sales figure of 1.8 million units.

Furthermore, Tesla appears to be banking on the development of a fully autonomous robotaxi as a catalyst for future earnings growth, with Musk announcing plans to unveil the robotaxi on August 8th.

Following the announcement, Tesla shares surged by 11% in after-hours trading, signaling investor optimism despite a year-to-date decline of more than 40% in the company's stock value. Despite the challenges posed by the volatile market conditions, Tesla's strategic initiatives to accelerate production and introduce innovative offerings reflect its commitment to driving long-term growth and sustaining its position as a leader in the electric vehicle industry.

LUKA DONCIC, IRVING LEAD CHARGE AS THE MAVERICKS SEIZE GAME 2 VICTORY AGAINST CLIPPERS.

05:06, 2024-04-24

Led by a stellar performance from Luka Doncic and supported by Kyrie Irving, the Dallas Mavericks orchestrated a remarkable comeback to snatch away home-court advantage from the Los Angeles Clippers, evening the score in their Western Conference first-round playoff series. Doncic showcased his scoring prowess with an impressive 32-point display, complemented by Irving's 23-point contribution, as the Mavericks secured a hard-fought 96-93 victory on Tuesday night, drawing level in the series at one game apiece.

Reflecting on the pivotal win, Mavericks forward P.J. Washington Jr. emphasized the team's collective determination to respond after a disappointing Game 1.




"Obviously, it was a must-win, and everybody was locked in," stated Washington. "They punched us in the mouth in Game 1, and we just wanted to respond."

With the series now poised at 1-1, the spotlight shifts to Game 3, slated to take place in Dallas on Friday, setting the stage for another intense showdown between the two contenders.

For the Clippers, the return of Kawhi Leonard after an extended absence injected a sense of optimism. Despite rustiness from his prolonged layoff due to knee inflammation, Leonard contributed 15 points and seven rebounds in 35 minutes of action, expressing satisfaction with his performance and optimism for the games ahead. "I felt good," remarked Leonard. "We still got more games to play and more time to get better. Just keep trying to get a rhythm back."




In contrast to their Game 1 defeat, the Mavericks asserted control for much of the contest, displaying resilience and determination. Coach Jason Kidd praised his team's gritty performance, describing the matchup as a showcase of physical basketball reminiscent of the '90s era. Meanwhile, the Clippers, led by Paul George and James Harden, faced challenges with poor shooting efficiency, shooting just 37% from the floor and struggling from beyond the arc.




Despite the Clippers' late surge in the third quarter to seize a narrow lead, the Mavericks maintained composure, with Doncic rallying the team and ensuring they remained competitive until the final buzzer.

As the series intensifies, both teams are poised for an enthralling battle, with the Mavericks buoyed by their Game 2 triumph and the Clippers seeking to regain momentum as the series shifts to Dallas. With the stakes high and tension mounting, basketball fans can anticipate another thrilling installment in this fiercely contested playoff series.

ARSENAL MAKE TITLE STATEMENT WITH THUMPING CHELSEA AND WAIT IN WATCH OF LIVERPOOL AND MAN CITY.

04:46, 2024-04-24

In a stunning display of dominance, Arsenal showcased their title credentials by dismantling Chelsea 5-0 at the Emirates Stadium, propelling themselves three points clear at the summit of the Premier League table. The match witnessed a relentless onslaught from Mikel Arteta's side, with Kai Havertz and Ben White leading the charge with a brace each in a scintillating second-half performance. The onslaught came after Leandro Trossard had set the tone with an early opener, setting the stage for an exhilarating encounter.




This emphatic victory comes hot on the heels of Arsenal's resilience, bouncing back from recent setbacks against Aston Villa and Bayern Munich with a resolute 2-0 triumph over Wolves just three days prior. With this win, Arsenal now boasts a three-point lead over second-placed Liverpool and sits four points ahead of reigning champions Manchester City. Meanwhile, in contrast to Arsenal's meteoric rise, Brighton finds themselves grappling with uncertainties surrounding their future, both on and off the field. Despite securing a commendable sixth-place finish in the previous campaign, Brighton's form has taken a nosedive, with only three wins in their last 13 Premier League matches in 2024.




Currently languishing in 10th position, Brighton faces an uphill battle in their quest for European football next season, trailing behind both Manchester United and Newcastle United by six points with only six games remaining. However, the team remains optimistic, buoyed by the prospect of four home fixtures out of their remaining matches.

Brighton's home record at the Amex Stadium provides a glimmer of hope, having suffered only one defeat in their last 15 home games across all competitions. Nevertheless, their upcoming clash against Manchester City poses a formidable challenge, given their dismal record of 11 defeats in their last 13 Premier League encounters with the reigning champions.




Despite the odds stacked against them, Brighton draws inspiration from past triumphs, including a memorable 1-1 draw against Manchester City last season, highlighted by Julio Enciso's stunning long-range strike, a goal that etched its place in Premier League folklore as the Goal of the Season. As Brighton braces for the challenges ahead, they remain resolute in their pursuit of redemption and resurgence in the Premier League.

UK ASYLUM SEEKERS AWAIT A 12 WEEKS PROCESSING AFTER UK PARLIAMENT APPROVES THE RWANDA BILL.

03:56, 2024-04-24

After two years of legal battles and political debates, the UK Parliament has finally approved the government's Rwanda bill, marking a significant step towards the implementation of the UK-Rwanda migration deal. However, despite the bill's passage, the engines on the planes bound for Kigali will remain silent for now.

Technically, a flight could take off as soon as 12 days after receiving royal assent, which formally turns the bill into law. However, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak indicated that the practical timeline for the first flight is expected to be later than that, estimating a timeframe of 10 to 12 weeks, likely placing the inaugural flight in late June or early July.




"We acknowledge that the timeline is later than we initially aimed for," stated Prime Minister Sunak on Monday. "But we have consistently emphasized that the processing of asylum seekers will require time."




The approval of the government bill by the United Kingdom’s upper house of parliament on Tuesday, April 23, represents a pivotal milestone for the UK-Rwanda migration deal. The agreement, forged in December in Kigali by Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Vincent Biruta and UK Home Secretary James Cleverly, aims to revive the Migration and Economic Development Partnership (MEDP), which was deemed unlawful by the UK Supreme Court in November of the same year.

Under the terms of the deal, individuals who arrive in the UK illegally via small boats will be transferred to Rwanda, where they will have the opportunity to claim asylum.




Despite the approval of the bill, there had been hesitancy in the House of Lords regarding the agreement, with demands for additional safeguards to be incorporated.

With the bill's passage through Parliament, attention now turns to the operationalization of the UK-Rwanda migration deal, which is anticipated to occur in the coming weeks. As both nations navigate the complexities of migration policy and international cooperation, the fate of asylum seekers awaiting processing hangs in the balance, contingent upon the successful implementation of this landmark agreement.
















RWANDA RECORDS A REMARKABLE DECREASE IN MALARIA INFECTIONS, AHEAD OF THE WORLD MALARIA DAY.

03:45, 2024-04-24

As Rwanda gears up to commemorate World Malaria Day on April 25, the nation has reason to celebrate significant strides in the fight against malaria. According to the Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC), the country has witnessed a remarkable 60% reduction in malaria-related deaths, accompanied by an impressive 88% decrease in malaria cases as of 2023.




Dr. Aimable Mbituyumuremyi, Division Manager of the Malaria, Neglected Tropical Diseases, and Other Parasitic Diseases Division at RBC, highlighted the substantial progress achieved. "In 2016, the country grappled with approximately five million malaria cases," he stated. "However, concerted intervention efforts have slashed these numbers to a mere 600,000 cases by 2023, marking an 88% reduction."

Dr. Mbituyumuremyi further elaborated on the tangible impact of these interventions, noting a staggering 90% reduction in severe malaria cases, from 18,000 in 2016 to just 1,300 in 2023. Moreover, malaria-related fatalities plummeted from over 600 in 2016 to a mere 51 in 2023, representing a remarkable 91% decrease.

One pivotal factor contributing to this success story is the expanded role of community health workers in managing malaria cases. In 2016, these frontline healthcare providers handled only 18% of cases, whereas they now oversee a staggering 60% of malaria cases across the nation.




Emphasis on the indispensable role played by community health workers in timely diagnosis, treatment, and management of malaria cases, revealing that there are now two dedicated workers per village tasked with this critical responsibility can never be downplayed .

Rwanda's approach to malaria control has been multi-faceted, incorporating evidence-based strategies such as information dissemination, distribution of Long-lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs), Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), and early diagnosis coupled with effective management of malaria cases. Dr. Mbituyumuremyi underscored the effectiveness of extensive IRS campaigns across 12 districts, coupled with LLIN distribution efforts spanning 18 districts, which collectively contributed to a 71% reduction in malaria cases between 2016 and 2021.




Innovative measures have also been adopted to combat malaria, including the introduction of larviciding using drones in 2020. Additionally, an integrated vector management approach has been embraced, involving training for communities and local leaders to identify and mitigate mosquito breeding sites, further bolstering malaria prevention efforts. Despite encountering challenges such as mosquito resistance to insecticides and pesticides, Rwanda remains steadfast in its commitment to malaria elimination by 2030. Aligning with the World Health Organization's global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030, Rwanda aims to reduce malaria incidence and mortality rates by at least 90% by 2030, alongside the ambitious goal of eliminating malaria in at least 35 countries by the same year.




With Rwanda hosting the 8th Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM) Society Conference from April 21-27, under the theme "Grassroots Mobilization to End Malaria: Invest, Innovate, and Integrate," the nation reaffirms its dedication to fostering global collaboration in malaria research and control. Through concerted efforts and collective action, Rwanda is poised to realize its vision of a malaria-free future, safeguarding the health and well-being of its citizens and communities.
















AIRBNB TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR RENTERS TO BE HOTS AMIDST REGULATORY CHALLEMGES.

06:12, 2024-04-22

Airbnb is broadening its horizons by extending hosting opportunities to renters, not just homeowners, on its short-term rental platform. The company announced on Friday its commitment to advocating for short-term rental rules that allow renters to participate in the lucrative side-hustle of leveraging their space to earn extra income.

The move reflects Airbnb's dedication to inclusivity and economic empowerment, aiming to provide opportunities for renters amidst regulatory challenges in various jurisdictions. Theo Yedinsky, Airbnb's Vice President of Public Policy, emphasized the company's mission to support both landlords and renters in listing their homes on the platform.




"A lot of the early laws that were made limited short-term rental to homeownership," Yedinsky stated, highlighting Airbnb's efforts to challenge existing regulations that restrict renters' participation in short-term rentals.

Yedinsky underscored Airbnb's origins, tracing back to 2007 when co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia struggled to pay rent in San Francisco and welcomed guests on air mattresses during a design conference to make ends meet. This grassroots beginning informs Airbnb's commitment to democratizing access to its platform for both homeowners and renters alike.




Airbnb recently achieved a significant victory in Virginia, where Governor Glenn Youngkin signed a bill into law requiring localities to issue short-term rental permits to tenants with permission from property owners. This legislative milestone represents a step towards empowering renters to engage in the sharing economy.

The initiative to include renters as hosts on Airbnb comes at a time when homeownership is increasingly out of reach for many Americans, particularly younger generations, amid soaring mortgage rates and living expenses. Yedinsky highlighted the opportunity for disenfranchised and lower-income communities to benefit from Airbnb's platform, providing a pathway to supplemental income.




However, renters seeking to host on Airbnb must obtain permission from their landlords, and regulatory challenges persist in major cities like New York, where restrictions on short-term rentals are tightening.

Rahul Bhaskar, a tech consultant in San Francisco, exemplifies the potential for renters to participate in short-term rentals. Despite renting his two-bedroom apartment, Bhaskar obtained permission from his building management to host on Airbnb, benefiting from the platform's initiatives to support renters in earning additional income.

As Airbnb expands opportunities for renters to host, the company navigates regulatory landscapes and advocates for policies that foster inclusivity and economic empowerment in the sharing economy.

NORTH KOREA HEIGHTENS REGIONAL TENSIONS AS THEY FIRE SHORT RANGE BALLISTIC MISILES IN THE SOUTHERN WATERS .

05:52, 2024-04-22

North Korea escalated tensions in the region on Monday 22 Mrch by firing multiple suspected short-range ballistic missiles towards its eastern waters, according to South Korea’s military. This latest provocation adds to a series of recent weapons launches by the reclusive state. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff reported the launches, which originated from North Korea’s capital region, but provided no further details regarding the range or capabilities of the weapons. South Korea swiftly responded by reinforcing its surveillance posture and maintaining readiness in coordination with the United States and Japan.




Japan confirmed the launches and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's office issued instructions to gather information and ensure the safety of aircraft and vessels. The recent missile tests underscore North Korea’s ongoing efforts to bolster its military capabilities amidst stalled diplomacy with the United States and South Korea.

North Korea's announcement of a successful test of a "super-large" cruise missile warhead and a new anti-aircraft missile on Friday, coupled with earlier tests in April, including a solid-fuel intermediate-range missile with hypersonic warhead capabilities, reflect the regime's determination to advance its weaponry.

In response, the United States and South Korea have intensified their military cooperation, conducting bilateral drills and trilateral exercises with Japan. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, Kim Myung-soo, held discussions with U.S. Space Command Commander Stephen N. Waiting to address the evolving threats posed by North Korea.




Amid speculations of further provocations, South Korea's military revealed evidence suggesting North Korea's preparations for a second spy satellite launch, although no imminent launch was detected. Concerns persist that North Korea may resort to major provocations, such as a banned satellite launch, to mark key state anniversaries later this month. The latest missile launches heighten regional tensions and underscore the challenges of maintaining stability on the Korean Peninsula. As diplomatic efforts remain deadlocked, the international community faces the daunting task of preventing further escalation while seeking avenues for dialogue and de-escalation.

CONTROVERSY ERUPTS OVER UNPUNISHED DOPING CASES INVOLVING CHINESE SWIMMERS.

05:10, 2024-04-22

Revelations of positive doping tests for nearly two dozen Chinese swimmers, which went unpunished, have ignited a heated dispute between the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the CEO of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), Travis Tygart, triggering a flurry of accusations and legal threats. The controversy stems from WADA's acknowledgment that it cleared 23 Chinese swimmers who had tested positive for a banned heart medication to compete at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. WADA attributed its decision to contamination of the samples and defended its process, asserting that it acted in good faith and in accordance with due process.




However, Tygart swiftly condemned WADA's handling of the matter, alleging that the organization and Chinese anti-doping authorities had "swept positive tests under the carpet" by failing to adhere to global anti-doping rules. He emphasized the seriousness of the case, particularly regarding the use of trimetazidine (TMZ), a medication known for its performance-enhancing effects and its potential to incur severe penalties under anti-doping regulations.

Tygart highlighted USADA's distinct approach to contamination cases, emphasizing that previous instances did not involve TMZ and underlining the agency's commitment to upholding anti-doping standards. Unlike WADA's handling of the Chinese swimmers' cases, Tygart emphasized that USADA had consistently followed protocol, including provisional suspensions and public disclosure of violations.

The disagreement between WADA and Tygart underscores longstanding tensions between the two entities, rooted in diverging opinions on how to address doping scandals and enforce anti-doping regulations.




Tygart's criticism of WADA's leniency towards Russia following the Sochi Olympics doping scandal in 2014 has fueled ongoing friction between the organizations.

WADA responded to Tygart's accusations by labeling them as "outrageous" and "completely false," dismissing them as politically motivated and asserting that similar contamination cases involving U.S. athletes had been accepted by USADA in the past. The organization emphasized the challenges of conducting investigations in China amid COVID-19-related restrictions and defended its decision not to appeal the case based on legal advice.

The clash between WADA and USADA underscores the complexities and controversies surrounding anti-doping efforts in international sports, raising questions about transparency, accountability, and the enforcement of anti-doping regulations on a global scale. As the dispute unfolds, it underscores the imperative for greater cooperation and transparency in combating doping in sports worldwide.

MASKED MEN STOP MEXICAN PRESIDENTIAL FRONT RUNNER, THEY SEEK INTERVENTION FOR THEIR REGION OF CHIAPAS.

04:55, 2024-04-22

A dramatic incident unfolded on Sunday 21st March as masked men halted a vehicle carrying Mexico's leading presidential candidate, Claudia Sheinbaum, between campaign stops. Former Mexico City Mayor Sheinbaum, representing the governing Morena party, remained composed as the masked men approached her vehicle, seeking assurances that she would address the escalating violence in the southern state of Chiapas if elected in the June 2 election.

The masked men, identifying themselves as local residents, expressed their frustration and sense of powerlessness due to the government's failure to provide adequate security in their community of Motozintla, along Mexico's southern border with Guatemala. They implored Sheinbaum to take decisive action to prevent their township from descending into chaos, citing concerns over the escalating violence plaguing the region.




In a show of solidarity, Sheinbaum engaged with the men, listening attentively to their grievances with her window down. The interaction was captured on cell phones by the masked men, emphasizing the gravity of their concerns. Despite the tense moment, one of the men extended his hand to Sheinbaum before allowing her vehicle to proceed. The incident underscores the deep-seated issues of insecurity and violence gripping parts of Mexico, particularly in regions contested by rival cartels. The border area of Chiapas has been a hotspot of violence as the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels vie for control over lucrative smuggling routes. This power struggle has resulted in widespread displacement and forced recruitment of locals by the warring cartels.

Sheinbaum's campaign swing through Chiapas was accompanied by a security detail comprising army and national guard personnel, underscoring the gravity of the security situation in the region. Despite the encounter with the masked men, Sheinbaum maintained her stance on tackling crime and gang violence, echoing her previous efforts as the mayor of Mexico City.




Later, Sheinbaum confirmed the incident, downplaying its significance and refuting claims that the masked men were affiliated with organized crime groups. She described the encounter as "very strange," particularly noting that a media outlet critical of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's administration first published it.

The incident, although unsettling, has not deterred Sheinbaum's lead in the presidential race, according to polls. Despite the challenges ahead, Sheinbaum remains steadfast in her commitment to addressing the root causes of violence and insecurity in Mexico, offering hope for a safer and more prosperous future for all citizens.

UGANDAN PROMINENT BUSINESSMAN THOBANI AWARDED WITH THE UMURINZI W'IGIHANGO AWARD FOR HIS PHILANTHROPIST WORK EXTENDED TO THE GENOCIDE VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS

04:07, 2024-04-22

Mohamood Noordin Thobani, a prominent Ugandan businessman, was bestowed with the prestigious "Umurinzi w’Igihango" award on Saturday, April 20, for his significant contributions to preserving the remains and burring them in honor of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Uganda. The award was presented to Thobani by Rwanda’s High Commissioner to Uganda, Col. Joseph Rutabana, during a poignant commemoration event held at Ggolo Memorial Site in Mpigi district, Uganda.




The ceremony, attended by hundreds of mourners, including members of the Rwandan community, friends of Rwanda, and heads of diplomatic missions in Uganda, served as a solemn tribute to the victims of the genocide. Thobani, who was unable to travel to Kigali last year to receive the award, was deeply honored to accept it in front of such a distinguished audience. Col. Rutabana expressed his admiration for Thobani's commitment to preserving the memory of the genocide victims and commended his unwavering dedication. "I am honored to hand it to him today, in front of you all, but especially in front of the 100 Humura members who came from Rwanda," Col. Rutabana remarked.




Thobani, upon receiving the award, was presented with a certificate, a pin, and a data storage device containing citations and videos from the 16th Unity Club Annual Forum, where he was originally recognized. Unity Club - Intwararumuri, an organization founded by First Lady Jeannette Kagame, had awarded Thobani on October 29th, 2023, for his exceptional humanitarian efforts.

In the citation by Unity Club, Thobani was lauded for his profound compassion towards humanity, particularly the Tutsi victims of the genocide. His courageous act of burying approximately 10,000 bodies, which were dumped into various tributaries flowing into the Akagera River, resonated deeply with the Rwandan community. Thobani's remarkable achievements also included the construction of three memorial sites: Kasensero in Rakai district, Ggolo in Mpigi district, and Lambu in Masaka district, where thousands of genocide victims found their final resting place.




Furthermore, Thobani's ongoing involvement in organizing commemorative events and his support for genocide survivors exemplify his enduring commitment to justice and remembrance. Unity Club highlighted his benevolent gesture of donating 50 bicycles to Genocide survivors living in Rukumberi, Ngoma district, during the 24th commemoration of the genocide in 2018.

In his emotional remarks, Thobani expressed his gratitude to Unity Club and First Lady Jeannette Kagame for the honor bestowed upon him. He recounted a poignant encounter with a Genocide survivor during a visit to the Nyabarongo community in Rwanda, where victims were thrown into the river. "Tears rolled in my eyes," Thobani recalled, reflecting on the survivor's heartfelt gratitude and the profound impact of his efforts in preserving the memory of the genocide victims.




Mohamood Noordin Thobani's selfless dedication to honoring the memory of the genocide victims serves as a testament to the enduring spirit of compassion and solidarity in the face of adversity. His exemplary actions inspire hope and reaffirm the importance of remembrance in fostering healing and reconciliation.
















''BELGIUM ORDERED RWANDA'S QUEEN GICANDA TO LEAVE, WEEKS BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED'', SAYS MINISTER BIZIMANA.

03:40, 2024-04-22

As Rwanda progresses through the solemn 100 days of commemorating the Genocide against the Tutsi, disturbing revelations have emerged shedding light on hidden facts surrounding this tragic chapter in history. Shockingly, it has been disclosed that Belgium ordered Queen Rosalie Gicanda, the last Queen of Rwanda, to depart its territory in 1994, mere weeks before the Genocide against the Tutsi unfolded, despite her critical need for medical attention.




During the commemoration of Gicanda, held on Saturday, April 20, Jean Damascene Bizimana, the Minister of National Unity and Civic Education, unveiled this unsettling truth. Queen Gicanda, the consort of King Mutara III Rudahigwa, met a tragic end at the hands of the genocide perpetrators when she was 66 years old.

Bizimana highlighted that despite Belgium possessing knowledge of the genocidal plans brewing within Rwanda, they instructed Queen Gicanda, who was receiving medical treatment in Nivelle, to leave their territory, even though her visa was still valid. The Minister emphasized that this directive came in February 1994, a crucial period when the preparations for genocide were alarmingly evident.

"Before the Genocide began, Queen Rosalie Gicanda was in Belgium for medical treatment. Her visa was still valid, and Belgium had sufficient information about the preparation of the Genocide," Bizimana asserted.




The Minister referenced a letter dated February 3, 1994, purportedly from the mayor of Nivelle, Maurice Dehu, informing Queen Gicanda of Belgium's decision. The letter mandated her departure from Belgian soil by February 12, 1994, under threat of prosecution and deportation if she disobeyed. Furthermore, Bizimana revealed that despite pleas from medical authorities highlighting the critical nature of Gicanda's treatment, Belgian authorities remained resolute in their stance. Although an extension was informally granted until March 1994, it was not confirmed in writing, leaving Gicanda in a precarious position.

Tragically, Queen Gicanda, resigned to her fate, expressed her intention to return to Rwanda, indicating her compliance with Belgium's demands. "That is the wish of God. I will go back home to see my mother," she said, displaying her unwavering resolve amidst adversity.




Minister Bizimana underscored Belgium's complicity in Gicanda's murder, pointing to documented evidence of their awareness of the impending genocide. He referenced a damning 1997 assessment by the Belgian Senate, which outlined Belgium's knowledge of Rwanda's genocidal plans as early as January 1994.

In a chilling revelation, Bizimana noted that on January 15, 1994, the Belgian Ambassador to Rwanda had alerted his government about the impending genocide. Subsequent reports by Belgian intelligence officers and UN forces in Rwanda further corroborated Belgium's awareness of the looming catastrophe.




Captain Ildephonse Nizeyimana, the individual responsible for ordering Queen Gicanda's execution, faced justice in 2012 when he was convicted of genocide crimes by the UN International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, receiving a 35-year prison sentence.

The commemoration of Queen Rosalie Gicanda serves as a poignant reminder not only of the profound loss suffered by Rwanda but also of the international community's failure to prevent a genocide foretold. As Rwanda mourns the victims of this dark chapter, it stands as a beacon of resilience and remembrance, ensuring that such atrocities are never forgotten nor repeated.
















THE TWO ENGLISH TITLE CONTENDERS OUSTED FROM THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE.

18:11, 2024-04-18

In a tense showdown at the Allianz Arena, Arsenal found themselves grappling with a familiar dilemma – the absence of a decisive focal point upfront. Despite the dynamic displays from wingers Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli, the Gunners faltered due to a lack of presence in the box, a void left by Kai Havertz's deep-lying role against Bayern Munich.

Havertz, entrusted with the responsibility of spearheading Arsenal's attack, mirrored the playing style of Gabriel Jesus, dropping deep and drifting wide in an attempt to initiate link-up play. While this approach enhances Arsenal's fluidity in build-up, it often leaves them devoid of a target in the penalty area when the wingers deliver crosses.




This deficiency proved costly for Mikel Arteta's side, underscoring the need for tactical adjustments in the upcoming summer transfer window as Arsenal prepares for another campaign and sets their sights on trophy aspirations. Amidst Arsenal's struggles, Bayern Munich found solace in the performance of Joshua Kimmich, who emerged as the standout player of the match. Kimmich's decisive goal tilted the balance in Bayern's favor, earning him the prestigious 'PlayStation Player of the Match' award and sealing their victory at the Allianz Arena.

For Bayern, the triumph carries immense significance as they aim to salvage a potentially trophyless season. With aspirations pinned on securing a seventh Champions League title, Thomas Tuchel's men have kept their dreams alive with a gritty display against Arsenal, propelling them into the semi-finals of the prestigious tournament.

However, Bayern's journey to European glory faces stiff competition, with other contenders vying for the coveted trophy. In Spain, the reigning champions faced a dramatic exit in a penalty shootout, highlighting the intensity and unpredictability of the Champions League knockout stages.




As Arsenal and Manchester City cling to their hopes of clinching the English Premier League title, the competition intensifies on both domestic and European fronts. With Bayern Munich and other elite clubs eyeing silverware, the race for footballing glory promises exhilarating twists and turns in the coming weeks.

MIDWEST DIASPORA COMMEMORATES 1994 GENOCIDE AGAINST TUSTI, THEY CALL FOR ACTION AGAINST HATE SPEECH.

04:51, 2024-04-18

Gathering in remembrance of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, the diaspora of the Midwest of America convened in the City of South Bend to honor the victims and survivors. Among the attendees was Col Raoul Bazatoha, the Defense Attaché in Rwanda’s embassy in Washington DC, who delivered a poignant message urging global vigilance against the resurgence of hate speech targeting the Tutsi community in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Addressing the audience of approximately 300 individuals at the Century Center's Bendix Theater, Bazatoha, representing Amb. Mathilde Mukantabana, Rwanda’s envoy to the United States, Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil, condemned the ongoing discrimination faced by Congolese Tutsi.




“As we commemorate this solemn anniversary, the world must remain vigilant against the resurgence of hatred and divisionism in the region, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo,” he asserted, emphasizing the urgency of preventing violence against Tutsi communities.

Calling upon the Midwest diaspora to unite in the fight against genocide ideology and denial, Bazatoha emphasized the importance of preserving the memory of the genocide and ensuring justice for its victims and survivors.




“The memory of the genocide remains painfully present. We continue to confront the scourge of denial and distortion, and as some seek to rewrite history and minimize the horrors that were inflicted upon our people. We must ensure that the truth is preserved and that the voices of the victims are never silenced,” he declared.

The commemoration event featured testimonies, songs, and speeches reflecting on the passage of three decades since the genocide, symbolizing the emergence of a new generation committed to a future free of hatred and division.

In attendance was James Mueller, the Mayor of the City of South Bend, who presented a proclamation from his office affirming the importance of memory and education in combating genocide ideology.




“We advocate establishing memory; memory symbols of those we have lost, and to serve as a reminder of the importance of remembrance. We call for the inclusion of course lessons about genocide in schools to educate the young and the next generation, on the needs to fight hate ideology and stand against discrimination and divisionism,” the proclamation read.

Mueller expressed gratitude to the Rwandan American Community of the Midwest for their efforts in raising awareness about the root causes and consequences of genocide.




A panel discussion moderated by Nxumalo Ruhaya delved into the multi-generational impact of the genocide, while David Simon, a lecturer at Yale University, provided insight into the international community's failure to intervene during the genocide despite ample evidence of impending atrocities. The commemoration served as a poignant reminder of the importance of collective action in preserving memory, combating hate, and fostering a future marked by unity and understanding.
















HEAVY RAINS TRIGGER DEADLY FLASH FLOODS AND DISRUPTS TRANSPORT IN THE ARAB AND GULF STATES.

04:38, 2024-04-18

Heavy rainfall continues to wreak havoc across Gulf states, unleashing deadly flash floods and halting operations at Dubai International Airport, the world's second-busiest airport.

Dubai International Airport issued warnings of "very challenging conditions" as torrents of rain inundated vast areas, prompting advisories for some passengers to avoid turning up altogether. The deluge has not only disrupted travel but also claimed lives, with reports of casualties emerging from various regions.

In a tragic incident further north, a man lost his life after his car was swept away by flash floods. In Oman, rescuers recovered the body of a young girl in Saham, marking the 19th fatality in the country since Sunday.







The impact on air travel has been substantial, with approximately 300 flights to and from Dubai International Airport canceled yesterday, according to Flight Aware data. Hundreds more faced delays, causing significant disruptions in the travel plans of thousands of passengers. The airport, renowned as a pivotal hub for connecting flights worldwide, anticipates a protracted recovery period. Emirates, a major international airline headquartered in Dubai, took decisive action by suspending check-in services for departing passengers until Thursday, in response to the adverse weather conditions.




Authorities have issued warnings of impending thunderstorms, heavy rainfall, and strong winds, exacerbating the already dire situation in low-lying areas still submerged under water. The United Arab Emirates, Oman's neighboring state, witnessed its most significant rainfall event in 75 years on Tuesday, as reported by the National Centre of Meteorology. Khatm al-Shakla, in the al-Ain region, bore the brunt of the deluge, recording a staggering 254.8mm (9.7in) of rainfall in less than 24 hours.




These recent rainfall figures stand in stark contrast to the region's typical precipitation patterns. While the United Arab Emirates averages 140-200mm of rainfall annually, Dubai typically receives a mere 97mm. The sudden deluge has surpassed monthly averages, with April usually experiencing only about 8mm of rainfall.

Footage captured from the heart of Dubai depicts submerged vehicles lining flooded sections of Sheikh Zayed Road, exacerbating traffic congestion on the sprawling 12-lane highway.

As Gulf states grapple with the aftermath of relentless downpours, efforts are underway to mitigate further damage and ensure the safety and well-being of affected communities. However, with forecasts predicting continued inclement weather, the region remains on high alert, bracing for potential additional disruptions and challenges in the days ahead.
















UGANDAN SINGER EDDY KENZO THOUGHT TO BE FONDOLING WITH NEW MINISTER NYAMUTORO.

14:29, 2024-04-17

Uganda's entertainment scene is buzzing with rumors and speculation following Ugandan musician Eddy Kenzo's recent revelation about his alleged child with the new Minister of State for Energy and Mineral Development, Hon. Phiona Nyamutoro.

Kenzo, who made headlines when he appeared alongside Nyamutoro at her inauguration at State House in March, has further fueled gossip with his latest remarks at the Comedy Store UG event held at UMA Showgrounds.




During his performance, Kenzo referred to Hon. Nyamutoro as his "personal person" and dropped the bombshell announcement, stating, "I have to tell you this. Hon. Nyamutoro is my personal person and we have a kid together."




The revelation comes after a flurry of social media frenzy surrounding the duo, with fans and onlookers speculating about the nature of their relationship. Photos of Kenzo and Nyamutoro together, dressed in matching fashion colors or attending social gatherings, have only added fuel to the speculation.

Notably, Nyamutoro had previously acknowledged her acquaintance with Kenzo in an interview with Galaxy TV in October 2023, stating, "Yes. I do know Eddy Kenzo. I cannot ascertain to say he is a friend but I do know him. I have known him not just now, Eddy Kenzo is one of those artists that I have known for years. I knew him before I was a member of Parliament."




In response to Kenzo's claims, Hon. Nyamutoro stated, "While I respect Eddy Kenzo as an artist, his recent statements about our relationship and parenthood are inaccurate and unfounded. I categorically deny any such involvement with Mr. Kenzo."

With both Kenzo and Nyamutoro's statements adding to the intrigue, fans and followers eagerly await further developments in this captivating tale of music, politics, and romance.
















SELF EXILED BUSINESS MUGUL RUJUGIRO DIES AT 82

14:22, 2024-04-17

The global business community mourns the loss of Tribert Rujugiro Ayabatwa, a prominent Rwandan entrepreneur and industrialist, who passed away at the age of 82. The news of Rujugiro's death emerged late Tuesday, initially spreading through social media channels before being confirmed by various media outlets, including Voice of America, which cited sources close to his family.

As of Wednesday morning, the cause of Rujugiro's death remained undisclosed. The influential tycoon was reported to have been residing in South Africa at the time of his passing.

Rujugiro gained widespread recognition for his entrepreneurial acumen, particularly in the tobacco industry, where he founded and spearheaded Africa's largest tobacco company, the Pan African Tobacco Group.




Born in Rwanda, Rujugiro's journey as an entrepreneur transcended borders, as he forged a business empire across multiple sectors. His ventures, however, were not devoid of controversy.

In April 2021, a report on East Africa's efforts to combat extremism, crime, corruption, and illicit trade implicated the exiled Rwandan dissident in activities related to illicit trade and terrorism financing.

The passing of Tribert Rujugiro Ayabatwa marks the end of an era for Rwanda's business landscape and leaves behind a legacy of entrepreneurship and innovation that will be remembered by many.

This story continues to develop, with further details awaited regarding the circumstances surrounding Rujugiro's demise

PLANE MAKER BOEING BACK IN HOT SEAT AS TOP CUSTOMERS REGISTER LOSSES.

11:28, 2024-04-17

Boeing, the embattled aircraft manufacturer, finds itself under intense congressional scrutiny as back-to-back hearings on Wednesday shine a spotlight on allegations of major safety failures within the company. The first session will feature testimony from members of an expert panel that uncovered serious flaws in Boeing's safety culture, raising significant concerns about the company's commitment to ensuring the safety of its aircraft.




However, the main event of the day will be a second hearing featuring Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour, who has blown the whistle on potential safety issues with sections of the skin on 787 Dreamliner jets. Salehpour claims that these sections are not properly fastened and could potentially break apart, posing a significant risk to aircraft safety. Despite raising these concerns internally, Salehpour alleges that Boeing has ignored his warnings and prevented him from discussing the defects with experts. Salehpour's revelations have prompted an investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) into the quality and safety of Boeing's manufacturing processes, further intensifying the scrutiny surrounding the company.

Scheduled to testify before a Senate investigations subcommittee, Salehpour will be joined by another Boeing whistleblower, Ed Pierson, a former manager on the Boeing 737 program, along with two aviation technical experts. The panel, chaired by a Democrat and its senior Republican member, has requested extensive documentation from Boeing spanning the past six years, underscoring the seriousness of the allegations.




Coinciding with these hearings, United Airlines, one of Boeing's largest customers, has announced significant financial setbacks. The airline reported a $124 million loss in the first quarter, attributing it to a three-week grounding of all Boeing 737 Max 9s following a panel incident on an Alaska Airlines Max jetliner in January.

United Airlines has indicated that it will receive fewer new planes from Boeing this year than originally anticipated, leading the airline to begin leasing Airbus jets to supplement its fleet. Despite these challenges, United Airlines reported continued strength in demand for air travel, particularly within the United States and across the Atlantic, and forecast better-than-expected profits for the second quarter.

In the wake of safety concerns and financial setbacks, shares of United Airlines rose 5% in after-hours trading, signaling investor confidence in the airline's ability to navigate the challenges ahead. However, United's CEO reassured travelers of the airline's safety despite recent incidents, as the Federal Aviation Administration intensifies its oversight of the carrier amidst ongoing scrutiny of Boeing's safety practices.

DIVERSE JURY SELECTION UNDERWAY IN TRUMP HUSH MONEY TRIAL AMIDST PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.

10:35, 2024-04-17

In the high-stakes hush money trial against former President Donald Trump in Manhattan, a diverse panel of jurors is being meticulously selected to decide the fate of the controversial case. Among the seven individuals chosen so far are a nurse, lawyer, teacher, and immigrant from Ireland, representing a cross-section of New York society. Court proceedings on Wednesday were dedicated to jury selection, with the aim of assembling a panel of 12 New Yorkers and possibly six alternates. However, despite the day's efforts, the process will continue into Thursday until the desired jury is finalized.




Prior to seating jurors, a thorough questionnaire phase took place, during which prospective jurors were extensively interviewed by both the district attorney's office and Trump's legal team. Trump himself was observed attentively reviewing the jury questionnaire, an act that punctuated the gravity of the trial.Trump's attorney, Todd Blanche, exercised several challenges against potential jurors, citing concerns such as social media activity. Each side possesses 10 peremptory strikes to remove jurors without needing to provide justification. Additionally, successful challenges for cause obviate the need to use a strike.




Amidst these legal proceedings, a remarkable pivot was witnessed as Trump made an unexpected visit to a New York bodega, Sanaa Convenient Store, where a recent violent incident occurred. This visit marked Trump's first campaign appearance since the commencement of his criminal trial, positioning him as the first former U.S. president to stand trial as a criminal defendant.

Trump's campaign activities are notably constrained by the ongoing trial, limiting his mobility and political engagement. In contrast, President Joe Biden, whom Trump's campaign aims to blame for rising crime rates, continued his campaigning efforts in Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state.




However, Trump's campaign team has devised strategies to mitigate these limitations, planning rallies and political events on weekends and Wednesdays, the latter being the sole weekday when court is not in session. Moreover, local appearances are scheduled for Trump to make after the court recesses each day, ensuring a continued presence amidst the legal proceedings.

As the trial unfolds and campaign dynamics evolve, the intersection of legal scrutiny and political ambition sets a distinctive backdrop for Trump's unprecedented legal battle and his quest for political resurgence.

TANZANIA REFLECTS ON MAGUFULI'S LEGACY AMIDST SAMIA SULUHU'S REFORM AGENDS

08:35, 2024-04-17

As Tanzania commemorates the third anniversary of the passing of former President John Pombe Magufuli but also preparing to go to the polls come 2025, the nation finds itself at a pivotal moment of reflection, balancing the enduring legacy of Magufuli's tenure with the evolving reforms under current President Samia Suluhu Hassan.




Magufuli, who assumed office in 2015 and was re-elected in 2020 amidst controversy, left an indelible mark on Tanzania's political landscape during his six-year tenure. His leadership style evoked diverse reactions, both domestically and internationally.

Within Tanzania, Magufuli garnered both adoration and criticism in almost equal measure. To his supporters, his administration was hailed for its decisive action and unwavering commitment to fiscal discipline. Magufuli's no-nonsense approach resonated strongly as he publicly held government officials accountable and championed initiatives aimed at curbing corruption and inefficiency.

However, his detractors lamented what they perceived as a decline in political and civic freedoms, coupled with Tanzania's increasing isolation on the global stage during his presidency. International observers raised concerns about human rights violations and restrictions on media freedom.




Since assuming office following Magufuli's passing, President Samia Suluhu Hassan has embarked on a path of reform, seeking to address some of the challenges and criticisms that characterized her predecessor's administration. President Suluhu has emphasized the importance of dialogue and inclusivity, signaling a departure from the more confrontational style of governance seen under Magufuli.

While honoring the achievements of Magufuli's tenure, President Suluhu's administration has pledged to uphold democratic principles and promote transparency and accountability. Initiatives aimed at fostering dialogue with opposition parties and civil society organizations have been met with cautious optimism.




As Tanzania navigates this period of transition, the nation continues to grapple with the complexities of balancing the legacy of a transformative leader with the imperative of embracing reform and progress. The commemoration of Magufuli's legacy serves as a reminder of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead on Tanzania's path towards development and democratic consolidation.

IBUKA RE ECHOS THE NEED FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE STILL MISSING BODIES OF THE 1994 GENOCIDE VICTIMS.

06:07, 2024-04-17

As Rwanda solemnly marks the passage of time in the 100 days of remembrance for the horrors of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, a poignant plea resounds once more through the scarred land. Ibuka, the overarching organization representing Genocide survivors, has issued a heartfelt call to arms, urging individuals to step forward with any information regarding the whereabouts of those yet to find their final rest. The echo of this plea came painfully as the remains of 126 victims, unearthed in the somber years of 2023 and 2024, are tenderly laid to rest at the Ntarama Genocide Memorial in Bugesera. Once a sanctuary of worship, now consecrated as a final sanctuary for over 5,000 souls, this memorial stands as a haunting testament to the atrocities of the past.




Tuesday's 16 March ceremony at Ntarama bore witness to the culmination of a harrowing journey for these newly discovered victims. Discovered in the heart-wrenching landscapes of Musenyi, Nyamata, Mwogo, and Ntarama, each body tells a silent tale of anguish and loss, preserved in the earth for decades, waiting to be reunited with dignity. Yet, as each coffin was lowered into the hallowed ground, the weight of unfinished stories hung heavily in the air.

''For every victim granted a proper burial, countless others remain lost to time, their resting places shrouded in silence. The soil of Rwanda, soaked with the blood of innocents, still holds secrets untold, refusing to relinquish the full extent of its sorrow.'' Said Akamanzi one of the mourners

Amidst the tears and prayers of those gathered, there lingers a haunting question: How many more souls lie undiscovered, waiting to be reclaimed from the shadows of history? Ibuka's call for information is not just a plea for closure but a desperate cry to honor the memory of every life stolen too soon.




As Rwanda continues to grapple with the legacy of its darkest chapter, the search for truth and reconciliation presses on. For those who survived, and for the generations yet to come, the memory of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi remains a solemn obligation—a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of unspeakable evil.

EVENING WORKOUTS ARE LINKED TO IMPROVED HEALTH FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH OBESITY.

05:10, 2024-04-16

A groundbreaking study conducted by researchers at the University of Sydney in Australia, published in the journal Diabetes Care, reveals that engaging in the majority of daily physical activity during the evening may offer significant health benefits for individuals with obesity. The study comes at a critical time as global rates of obesity continue to rise exponentially. With projections indicating that the number of individuals classified as obese could reach 4 billion by 2050, understanding effective strategies for managing obesity-related health risks is paramount.




According to Angelo Sabag, lead author of the study and a researcher at the Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, obesity poses a significant risk factor for a multitude of chronic illnesses, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and various types of cancers. To investigate the potential impact of timing on physical activity and health outcomes, Sabag and his team analyzed data from the U.K. Biobank, encompassing nearly 30,000 individuals over the age of 40, all of whom were classified as having obesity. Additionally, approximately 3,000 participants had type 2 diabetes.

Utilizing wearable device data tracking participants' physical activity levels throughout the day for over eight years, researchers were able to discern patterns and correlations between timing of physical activity and health outcomes.




The study yielded compelling results: individuals who engaged in the majority of their aerobic moderate to vigorous physical activity between 6 p.m. and midnight exhibited the lowest risk of premature death and death from cardiovascular disease.




"These findings underscore the importance of considering timing when incorporating physical activity into daily routines, particularly for individuals with obesity," Sabag emphasized.

The implications of this research extend beyond individuals with obesity, offering valuable insights into the optimization of physical activity regimens for overall health and longevity.

As the global health community grapples with the obesity epidemic and its associated health challenges, studies such as this provide valuable guidance for developing targeted interventions and strategies aimed at mitigating the impact of obesity-related conditions.




Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving the observed associations between evening physical activity and improved health outcomes. Nonetheless, these findings offer promising avenues for enhancing public health initiatives and promoting healthier lifestyles worldwide.

US ,ISRAEL DISCUSS REGIONAL STABILITY FOLLOWING IRAN'S ATTACK, AS CHINA EXPRESSES CONCERN

04:38, 2024-04-16

US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin reaffirmed the strategic goal of regional stability in a conversation with his Israeli counterpart, Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, on Monday. The call, according to a readout, focused on the aftermath of Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel over the weekend.

"We reaffirmed the strategic goal of regional stability," stated the readout, highlighting the ongoing dialogue between the US and Israel amidst escalating tensions in the region.

Secretary Austin reiterated the steadfast support of the United States for Israel's defense, underscoring the strong alliance between the two nations.




In response to Iran's attack, Israel's war cabinet is currently deliberating on potential responses. The attack, which saw more than 300 projectiles fired at Israeli territory, was met with interception systems, with most projectiles neutralized. China, in a phone call between the foreign ministers of China and Iran, noted Iran's assertion that the actions against Israel were an exercise of the right of self-defense. However, China condemned the attack on a consulate building in the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus, labeling it a violation of international law.




Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasized the need for restraint in the current regional situation, echoing Iran's commitment to avoid further escalation. Separately, China's Special Envoy on the Middle East, Zhai Jun, engaged in discussions with Israel's Ambassador to China, expressing China's deep concern about the escalating tensions in the region.

"Conflicts and bloodshed serve the interests of no one," stated Zhai, emphasizing the importance of de-escalation and dialogue in resolving regional conflicts.




In previous communications, Secretary Austin had requested Minister Gallant to inform the US in advance of any potential response to the Iranian attack, underscoring the close coordination between the US and Israel in matters of regional security.

The conversation between Secretary Austin and Minister Gallant occurred shortly after Iran's barrage of drones and missiles targeted Israel, highlighting the urgency of diplomatic efforts to address the escalating tensions in the region.

03:57, 2024-04-16

President Paul Kagame, who is also the Chief of Defense Forces, recently commissioned 624 cadet officers from the General Military School in Gako. Addressing the event, President Kagame emphasized the broader responsibilities of the officers beyond combat, highlighting the importance of nation-building and safeguarding the progress achieved in the last 30 years.

"In this profession, your responsibilities go beyond fighting wars on battlefields. They extend to building the nation and protecting the progress achieved in the last 30 years," President Kagame remarked during his speech.

"The officers have reached this stage because of good conduct and capacity. I believe you are ready and have all requirements to fulfill your responsibility to protect the sovereignty, security, and development of the country and its population," President Kagame commended the officers for their dedication and readiness to serve.

"The profession of the army is not for causing wars or provocations," President Kagame reiterated, emphasizing Rwanda's commitment to peace and stability.




Reflecting on Rwanda's history, President Kagame noted the country's unique challenges, including internal conflicts fueled by external support. He emphasized that Rwanda does not seek conflict but is prepared to defend itself against any threats to its sovereignty and security. The newly commissioned officers, including 33 who underwent training in partner countries, took a solemn oath pledging allegiance to Rwanda and its leadership, reaffirming their commitment to safeguarding national sovereignty.

Among the graduating officers, 102 pursued long-term studies in various fields such as medicine, IT, social sciences, mathematics and physics, biology and chemistry, law, and mechanical engineering. Additionally, 522 officers completed a one-year program, demonstrating their dedication to professional development and service to the nation. President Kagame commended the officers for their dedication to national security and their outstanding performance in their academic pursuits.

ISRAEL SUCCESSFULLY INTERCEPTS IRANIAN MISSILES IN UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK

07:46, 2024-04-15

Late Saturday, in an unprecedented attack, almost all the ballistic missiles and drones launched by Iran at Israel were intercepted, failing to meet their mark, according to Israeli and American officials. This highlights the formidable and multi-layered missile defense deployed by the two allied partners.

Israel's military stated on Sunday that "99%" of the projectiles fired by Iran were intercepted by Israel and its partners. Despite the launch of more than 300 Iranian munitions, the majority of which were believed to have been launched from inside Iran's territory during a five-hour attack, only "a small number" of ballistic missiles managed to reach Israel.




The military disclosed that around 170 drones, over 30 cruise missiles, and more than 120 ballistic missiles were launched at Israel by Iran overnight Saturday. In a call on Sunday, US President Joe Biden conveyed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that this interception constituted a win for Israel as nothing of "value" was hit, according to a senior US administration official.

US officials revealed that over 70 drones and three ballistic missiles were intercepted by US Navy ships and military aircraft. At least three ballistic missiles were shot down using the Aegis missile defense system aboard two guided-missiles destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean.




Additionally, US warplanes intercepted Iranian ordnance. Although the location of these US jets' operation was not disclosed, there are US Navy aircraft carriers and land-based aircraft well within range of the region. President Biden affirmed the US's preparedness to assist Israel in defending against Iranian attacks. He stated, "Thanks to these deployments and the extraordinary skill of our servicemembers, we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles."




Britain expressed readiness to intervene using Royal Air Force aircraft in the region, stating that UK jets would intercept any airborne attacks within range of existing missions, as required.

An Israeli military spokesperson also acknowledged France's involvement in blocking the Iranian attacks, stating, "We are working closely with the US, UK, and France who acted tonight. This partnership has always been close, but tonight it manifested itself in an unusual way." The successful interception of the Iranian missiles underscores the effectiveness of the collaborative efforts between Israel and its allies in countering external threats and safeguarding regional stability.

REMEBERING THE LIVES OF THOSE DROWNED IN LAKE MUHAZI IN 1994.

06:25, 2024-04-15

On Sunday, the 14th of April, mourners from the Eastern province districts of Rwamagana and Nyagatare gathered at Lake Muhazi to honor the memory of those who tragically lost their lives to its waters during the dark days of the Genocide against the Tutsi. With solemn hearts and a shared commitment to remembrance, they laid wreaths and flowers upon the lake's surface, paying homage to the victims whose lives were cut short by unimaginable violence and cruelty. As the horrors of the Genocide against the Tutsi continued to unfold in April 1994, the district of Rwamagana became a scene of unspeakable tragedy. In the face of relentless attacks by Interahamwe militias, Tutsi refugees sought shelter at the Muhazi Commune offices, hoping to find safety within its walls. It was there, amidst the chaos and desperation, that a courageous few dared to resist the tide of hatred and violence.




On the fateful day of April 15-16, as the Interahamwe launched a brutal assault on the commune offices, a small group of Tutsi individuals, armed with just two guns they had accessed from the offices, valiantly fought back. Led by a brave government Tutsi soldier named Kanamugire, they stood their ground against overwhelming odds, determined to protect their fellow refugees and defy their oppressors. Despite their heroic efforts, the attackers eventually overwhelmed them, forcing the survivors to flee for their lives. With no other refuge in sight, they made their way to Lake Muhazi, seeking sanctuary across its waters where the Inknotanyi were believed to be. But their journey to safety was fraught with danger and despair, as they approached the shores of Lake Muhazi, they were intercepted by government soldiers who engaged them in a fierce battle. Outnumbered and outgunned, they fought with all their might, but their ammunition soon ran dry. With no means of defense remaining, they were left vulnerable to the merciless onslaught of their pursuers.




In the final moments of their struggle, as they sought to escape the clutches of their tormentors, tragedy struck once more. The Interahamwe, relentless in their pursuit of destruction, caught up with them at Kavumu and callously drowned them into the depths of Lake Muhazi, condemning them to a watery grave.




''Today, as we gather to remember the victims of Lake Muhazi, we pay tribute to their courage, resilience, and unwavering spirit in the face of unimaginable adversity. Theirs is a story of defiance in the face of despair, of solidarity amidst chaos founded on sectarianism, and of hope in the darkest of times.'' said one of the mourners.

The of honor their memory, let us also reaffirm our commitment to never forget the atrocities of the past and to stand united against the forces of hatred and intolerance.'' Mukandori added

May the souls of those lost to the waters of Lake Muhazi rest in peace, and may their legacy inspire us to build a future rooted in peace, justice, and reconciliation.

RWANDAN YOUTH RALLY AGAINST HATE SPEECH AND GENICIDE IDEOLOGY IN THE DIGITAL AGE.

06:06, 2024-04-15

As Rwanda solemnly commemorates the Genocide against the Tutsi, a new generation of young Rwandans, born after the tragic events of 1994, is rising to confront the scourge of hate speech and genocide ideology with unwavering determination. Their pledge to combat these destructive forces, particularly rampant on social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube, stands as a testament to their commitment to uphold the principle of ''Never Again.''




In the words of Gerard Mbarushimana, the Head of Ibuka in Rubavu, hate speech and genocide ideology are not confined to Rwandan borders but have insidiously spread to neighboring countries such as the DR Congo and even farther to nations like Belgium. The digital revolution has blurred geographical boundaries, turning the world into a digitally interconnected village where dangerous ideologies can permeate with alarming ease. Despite the challenges posed by this digital landscape, young Rwandans refuse to be passive bystanders. Armed with resilience and a deep sense of responsibility, they have taken it upon themselves to amplify the voices of unity, reconciliation, and remembrance, while vehemently opposing any rhetoric that threatens to incite division and hatred.




In a recent gathering, individuals under the age of 30 came together to share their perspectives on genocide, unity, reconciliation, and the urgent need to combat genocide ideology. Their discussions underscored the gravity of the task at hand and the collective resolve to build a future marked by peace and mutual understanding.

For these young Rwandans, the fight against hate speech and genocide ideology is not merely a duty; it is a moral imperative. They recognize that the wounds of the past are still raw and that the seeds of division must be rooted out to prevent history from repeating itself. Through education, advocacy, and active engagement on social media, they aim to counter misinformation, promote dialogue, and foster a culture of empathy and tolerance.

''As we continue to remember those we lost in the the 100 of atrocities of the past, let us heed the call of Rwanda's youth and stand in solidarity against the forces of hatred and division. Together, we can build a future where the lessons of history guide us toward a more just and compassionate world.'' concluede Alaine, on of the youth in Rubavu.




ENGLISH CLUBS STAGE DRAMATIC COMEBACKS IN THE UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE QUARTER FINALS

23:32, 2024-04-09

Manchester City and Arsenal Rally to Secure Draws Against European Giants In a thrilling night of UEFA Champions League action on Tuesday, both English clubs in the quarterfinals staged remarkable comebacks to secure crucial draws against their formidable opponents.




Manchester City traveled to the iconic Santiago Bernabéu Stadium to face Real Madrid in a highly anticipated clash. The Citizens got off to a flying start, with Bernardo Silva finding the back of the net in just the second minute. However, their lead was short-lived as Real Madrid responded swiftly with an own goal forced by relentless pressure, courtesy of Dias, in the 12th minute. The hosts then took the lead through Rodriygo in the 14th minute, sending shockwaves through the City camp. But Pep Guardiola's magic man, Phil Foden, stepped up to the plate, equalizing for Manchester City and reigniting hope amongst the fans. Gvardiol's strike in the 71st minute seemed to seal the win for City, only for Real Madrid to snatch a late equalizer through Valverde in the 79th minute. The stage is set for an epic showdown in the second leg.




Meanwhile, back in England, Arsenal, under the tutelage of Mikel Arteta, faced the formidable Bayern München at the Emirates Stadium. The Gunners took the lead early on, courtesy of the dynamic Bukayo Saka, who bypassed the defense to give his side the advantage. However, former Arsenal player Serge Gnabry leveled the score for Bayern, converting their momentum into a lead with a spot-kick from English skipper Harry Kane. With the game slipping away, Arteta made bold substitutions, bringing on Jesus and Trossard for Martinelli and Harvertz. The move paid off handsomely as Trossard received a pass from the Brazilian maestro, turning the tide in Arsenal's favor with a swift goal just five minutes later.




As the dust settles on an enthralling night of football, all eyes turn to the decisive second legs next week. Manchester City and Arsenal have demonstrated resilience and determination, setting the stage for what promises to be an exhilarating conclusion to their quarterfinal ties. Football fans around the world eagerly anticipate the outcome as these two English clubs seek to secure a coveted spot in the semifinals of the UEFA Champions League.

EID AL-FITR CELEBRATIONS TO SUBDUED THIS YEAR, AS IT COINCIDES WITH THE 30TH COMMEMORATION OF THE GENOCIDE AGAINST THE TUTSI.

22:54, 2024-04-09

As the Muslim community around the world prepares to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, the joyous occasion marking the end of Ramadan, a solemn atmosphere envelops Rwanda this year. The festivities, traditionally marked by prayer services and social gatherings, are subdued as Rwandans honor the memory of the victims of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi.




Eid al-Fitr, meaning the "Festival of Breaking Fast," typically heralds a day of communal prayer followed by shared meals and joyful interactions. However, this year's commemoration is marked by a sense of restraint and reflection, as Muslims across Rwanda adhere to guidelines set forth by the Rwanda Muslim Community (RMC) and the national leadership. In a statement issued by the Mufti of Rwanda, Sheikh Salim Hitimana, the leadership of RMC emphasized the need for sensitivity during this period of remembrance. With Eid al-Fitr coinciding with the solemn days of Genocide commemoration, the Muslim community is urged to refrain from engaging in festive activities out of respect for the mourning period.




"The period in which we are does not permit us to hold social events and invite people as we used to," Sheikh Salim Hitimana explained.

Instead of the customary gatherings, Eid prayers will be conducted at designated sites across all districts of Rwanda. This decision underscores the commitment of the Muslim community to observe religious obligations while honoring the somber significance of the commemoration week.




The announcement from RMC extends heartfelt condolences to the families affected by the Genocide against the Tutsi, emphasizing solidarity and support for survivors. It underscores the importance of standing united in remembrance and ensuring that the atrocities of the past are never forgotten. As the nation observes a day of reflection and remembrance, the Ministry of Public Service and Labour has declared Wednesday, April 10, a public holiday in observance of Eid al-Fitr. This gesture acknowledges the importance of religious observance while recognizing the need for solemn reflection during this poignant period.

While the celebration of Eid al-Fitr may be muted this year, the spirit of resilience and unity prevails among Rwandans. Through collective remembrance and solidarity, the nation pays homage to the past while reaffirming its commitment to a future of peace, reconciliation, and mutual respect.




''As the sun sets on this day of commemoration, let us carry forward the lessons of the past and strive towards a future built on compassion, understanding, and unity. In honoring the memory of the victims and standing with survivors, we renew our commitment to never forget and to ensure that such atrocities never occur again.'' Sheikh HitiMana concluded

GLOBAL SOLIDARITY, SIGNIFIES A MILESTONE TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING OF THE GENOCIDE AGAINST THE TUTSI.

22:34, 2024-04-09

In a profound display of global solidarity, nations worldwide have united in support of Rwanda as it solemnly commemorates the 30th anniversary of the Genocide against the Tutsi. While the presence of esteemed world leaders and former presidents was significant, the outpouring of solidarity has extended far beyond physical borders, echoing the resilience and spirit of a nation that continues to heal from the wounds of its past.




From tele-recorded messages of remembrance to the symbolic raising of national flags at half-mast, countries across the globe have joined hands with Rwanda in a powerful gesture of empathy and unity. Yet, perhaps most touching of all has been the illumination of iconic buildings and national monuments in the colors of Rwanda's flag – blue, yellow, and green – a poignant tribute to the strength and endurance of the Rwandan people.




For the survivors of the genocide, this global outpouring of support serves as a beacon of hope in the face of persistent denial and historical revisionism. The atrocities of 1994, which claimed the lives of nearly one million ethnic Tutsi in just 100 days, remain a haunting reminder of humanity's capacity for cruelty. However, as the international community stands in solidarity with Rwanda, it sends a clear message to those who seek to distort or deny the truth: never again.




To understand the depths of such a tragedy, it is essential to confront the historical context that paved the way for genocide. Rooted in the legacy of Belgian colonialism, the seeds of division were sown long before the horrors of 1994 unfolded. Through policies of divide and rule, social stratification, and ethnically divisive politics, colonial officials perpetuated a system of discrimination and inequality that laid the groundwork for ethnic tensions to escalate into violence.




Yet, even in the darkest moments of history, there are glimpses of light and hope. As Rwanda remembers the lives lost and the resilience of those who survived, the global community stands as a testament to the power of solidarity and compassion. In honoring the memory of the victims and standing with the survivors, we reaffirm our commitment to a world where such atrocities have no place – where the lessons of history are not forgotten, but serve as a beacon of hope for future generations.




As the sun sets on this solemn day of remembrance, let us carry forward the spirit of solidarity that has united nations and peoples around the world. In doing so, we honor the past, we stand with the present, and we pledge to build a future defined not by division and hatred, but by compassion, understanding, and unity.

ISRAEL ADMITS AND DISCHARGES SOLIDIERS IN THE ATTACK ON AID WORKERS.

12:00, 2024-04-05

In a tragic incident that has sparked global condemnation, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have admitted to mistakenly killing seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen (WCK) in Gaza on Monday 1 March. The shocking revelation has raised serious questions about the IDF's tactics and accountability in the volatile region.

"The IDF deeply regrets the loss of life in this tragic incident. Our thoughts are with the families of the victims and the World Central Kitchen organization," stated an IDF spokesperson.




The IDF's publication of a report into the killings on Friday, March 5, admitted that the incident violated its own protocols and should never have occurred. However, the WCK has swiftly called for further independent investigations, expressing a lack of trust in the IDF's ability to impartially investigate its own actions in Gaza.

"The IDF's acknowledgment of their mistake is only the first step towards justice. We demand a thorough and independent investigation into this egregious error," declared a spokesperson for the World Central Kitchen.




The IDF has been engaged in efforts to track down and eliminate Hamas militants in Gaza for nearly six months, accusing the group of embedding itself within civilian populations. According to the IDF, its forces identified a gunman in an aid truck on Monday and subsequently identified an additional gunman.

"We deeply regret the tragic loss of life and offer our sincere condolences to the families of the victims. This incident highlights the challenges of operating in a complex and volatile environment like Gaza," explained an IDF official.




An IDF spokesperson revealed to CNN that the unit responsible for the attack mistook "something slung over one of the passenger’s shoulders as a weapon," which later turned out to be a bag. Furthermore, it was confirmed that some of the aid workers who survived the initial strike fled to other vehicles, only to be targeted again.

"The IDF's actions demonstrate a reckless disregard for the safety of humanitarian workers. We demand accountability for this grave error," emphasized a representative from the WCK.

The IDF explained that surveillance drones were unable to discern the WCK logo on the vehicles during the nighttime operation, prompting consideration of measures such as distributing thermal stickers for aid vehicles to prevent similar incidents in the future.

"In light of this tragic incident, we are reviewing our procedures to ensure that such mistakes do not happen again. We remain committed to the safety and security of all individuals in the region," affirmed an IDF spokesperson.




In response to the grave errors, the IDF has dismissed two senior officers over the strikes, including the brigade fire support commander and the brigade chief of staff. The brigade commander and the 162nd Division commander have also faced disciplinary action.

"While we welcome the dismissal of the officers involved, it is imperative that broader systemic changes are implemented to prevent future tragedies," urged the WCK in a statement.

As the international community reacts with outrage to this devastating loss of innocent lives, calls for greater accountability and adherence to humanitarian principles echo across diplomatic corridors. The incident serves as a grim reminder of the urgent need for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Gaza and underscores the importance of ensuring the safety of humanitarian workers operating in conflict zones worldwide.

TITLE RACE REACHES FEVER PITCH AS ARSENAL, LIVERPOOL, AND MAN CITY BATTLE FOR SUPREMACY.

With each victory, Liverpool reaffirms their status as genuine contenders for both domestic and European glory.




Not to be outdone, reigning champions Manchester City, under the guidance of Pep Guardiola, remain relentless in their pursuit of another league triumph. City's emphatic 4-1 victory over Aston Villa, highlighted by a sensational hat-trick from England midfielder Phil Foden, propelled them to within striking distance of the league summit. Guardiola has urged his players to brace themselves for a grueling title race that may well be decided on the final day of the season. As the season unfolds, the intensity of the title race shows no signs of abating. With each match bringing new twists and turns, fans are treated to a spectacle of top-tier football as these three footballing giants vie for supremacy. Liverpool's upcoming clash with Sheffield United presents an opportunity for them to reclaim the top spot, further intensifying the battle for league dominance.

With Arsenal, Liverpool, and Manchester City locked in a fierce battle for the title, football fans around the world are in for a captivating spectacle as the drama unfolds on the pitch.
















CLINTON SLATED TO BE IN RWANDA FOR THE 30TH KWIBUKA OF THE GENOCIDE AGAINST THE TUSTI.

05:14, 2024-04-05

In a solemn gesture of solidarity and remembrance, the United States announced a distinguished delegation of government officials to attend the 30th Commemoration (Kwibuka@30) of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda. Led by former and then President Bill Clinton, the delegation underscores America's commitment to honoring the memory of the victims and supporting Rwanda's journey of healing and reconciliation. Accompanying President Clinton will be a cadre of esteemed officials, including US Ambassador to Rwanda Eric Kneedler, Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of African Affairs Mary Catherine Phee, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Legislative Affairs Casey Redmon, and Assistant Administrator of the Bureau for Africa, U.S. Agency for International Development Monde Muyangwa. Their presence signifies the enduring partnership between the United States and Rwanda in advancing peace, stability, and prosperity in the region.




The commemoration, slated to begin on April 7th, marks the start of a week-long period of mourning and reflection, coinciding with the 100 days of Kwibuka—the duration of the genocide that claimed over one million lives. Global leaders, including heads of state, will converge to honor the victims and survivors, reaffirming their commitment to the theme of this year's commemoration: Remember, Unite, Renew.

Central to the event is a poignant "Walk to Remember," symbolizing the collective vow to never forget the atrocities of the past while forging a path towards unity, reconciliation, and renewal. Amidst solemn remembrance, the occasion also serves as an opportunity to celebrate Rwanda's remarkable achievements over the past three decades, including strides in national unity, economic growth, and development.




The significance of this year's commemoration is underscored by the persistent threat of genocide denial and hate speech, particularly in the volatile eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Tutsi communities in the area continue to face persecution and violence, with the involvement of militia groups like the FDLR, linked to the genocide in Rwanda. This ongoing crisis has elicited grave concerns within the region and the broader international community. Against this backdrop, the United Nations has reiterated the importance of vigilance and action in preventing further atrocities. The violence in eastern DRC serves as a stark reminder of the dangers posed by hate speech and incitement, especially in regions scarred by a history of genocide. As the world gathers to commemorate Kwibuka30, it is a solemn reminder of the collective responsibility to remember, unite, and renew our commitment to preventing such atrocities from ever happening again.

The 30th commemoration also coincides with a significant milestone in the global recognition of the genocide against the Tutsi. In September 2023, four memorials were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List, marking a historic victory in the fight against genocide denial and revisionism. This acknowledgment underscores the importance of preserving the memory of the victims and safeguarding against the distortion of historical truth.




As global leaders and dignitaries gather in Rwanda to pay tribute to the lives lost and reaffirm their commitment to prevention, the 30th Commemoration of the genocide against the Tutsi serves as a poignant reminder of the enduring legacy of resilience, hope, and unity in the face of unspeakable tragedy.

UN REPORT HIGHLIGHTS URGENT NEED FOR ACTION TO COMBAT FOOD WASTE

03:58, 2024-04-05

In a stark revelation, the UN Environment food index report, initiated in 2022, has unveiled a staggering truth: more than 1.3 billion tons of food are lost annually, from farm to fork, imposing severe strains on vital resources like water. The report paints a troubling picture of inefficiencies and negligence across various stages of food production and consumption, exacerbating global hunger and environmental degradation. A significant portion of this colossal food loss occurs during production and processing stages, with over 500 million tons wasted due to factors such as crop pests, suboptimal harvesting techniques, and inadequate irrigation. Postharvest handling and storage, as well as consumer habits, contribute equally to this crisis, squandering approximately 350 million tons each. Shockingly, these three stages alone constitute nearly three-quarters of all food waste.




However, the report also underscores the immense potential for waste reduction at every stage of the food supply chain. Evidence gathered from waste management entities, particularly in urban centers like Rwanda, highlights that a substantial portion of discarded food remains perfectly edible. Approximately 35% of wasted food is needlessly thrown away by supermarkets, shops, and households, exacerbating the already dire situation. The United Nations has set ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to halve global food waste at retail and consumer levels per capita by 2030, alongside reducing food loss in production and supply chains. While commendable, this target faces significant challenges. Even if achieved, it might not be sufficient to counteract the rise in total global food waste, given the projected increase in the world population to 8.6 billion by 2030—an additional 800 million people compared to 2020.




This demographic surge intensifies the urgency of addressing food waste. Over 2 billion more individuals are expected to inhabit the planet by 2050, necessitating a 60% increase in food production to sustain them. Alternatively, curbing food waste presents a more immediate and viable solution. Astonishingly, the food lost or wasted in the United States and Europe alone could potentially feed all 800 million people suffering from hunger and undernourishment worldwide. As we confront the reality of a burgeoning global population, the imperative to tackle food waste becomes paramount. Every morsel discarded represents not just a squandered resource, but a missed opportunity to alleviate hunger, mitigate environmental degradation, and promote sustainability. It is incumbent upon governments, businesses, and individuals to heed the warning sounded by the UN report and take decisive action towards a more equitable and sustainable food system. Failure to do so imperils the very future of our planet and its inhabitants.




Food waste and climate change

As though it is not a problem enough every part of the food supply chain releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Energy is used to grow, store, process, transport, and cook the food. In addition, discarded food ending up at landfills also contribute. In addition, meat production (especially beef!) releases huge amounts of methane gas because of farting cows. Methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas with a 84 times higher global warming potential than CO2 (over a 20 years period).

The global food system accounts for up to 30% of greenhouse gas emissions. And food waste is part of this. The carbon footprint of food waste is estimated to be 3.3 billion tons of CO2 equivalents released into the atmosphere a year.







ARSENAL CONTINUES THEIR WINNING STREAK, AS THEY HUMBLED LUTON TOWN 2;0

05:42, 2024-04-04

In the midst of a challenging fixture list, Arsenal faced off against Luton Town with the opportunity to seize the top spot in the league standings. Sandwiched between matches against Liverpool and Manchester City, the encounter with Luton posed another formidable test for Mikel Arteta's side. Acknowledging the threat posed by Luton, Arteta praised their prowess, emphasizing the credit they deserve in the league. With the potential to leapfrog Liverpool and claim the top position, the importance of the match for Arsenal was monumental, offering a significant psychological boost.




As the match commenced, Arsenal's attacking prowess was on full display, much to the delight of the fans. Odegaard broke the deadlock with a clinical finish, setting the tone for a dominant performance. Despite Luton's attempts to retaliate, Arsenal maintained relentless pressure, ultimately forcing an own goal from the opposition. With Saka sidelined due to injury, Arsenal's commanding display in the first half effectively sealed the contest. Possessing the ball for the majority of the match and registering numerous shots on target, Arsenal showcased their superiority on the pitch.




Securing the victory and three crucial points, Arsenal affirmed their status as the league leaders. Their remarkable run of form, winning nine out of the last ten fixtures, propelled them to the forefront of the title race. However, the pressure remains palpable as Liverpool closely trails Arsenal in the standings, with only a single point difference. Additionally, the looming threat of Manchester City, currently leading their match against Auto Villa, adds further tension to the title race.

With Arsenal fans anxiously eyeing the table, the realization that Liverpool has played fewer matches adds to the intensity of the competition. Despite their commanding position, Arsenal understands the importance of maintaining consistency and composure as they navigate the challenges ahead in pursuit of league glory.

EV GIANT TESLA GIVEN A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY AS BYD RAISES LEVEL.

05:17, 2024-04-04

Founded by metallurgy graduate Wang Chuanfu in 1995, BYD started as a small Chinese company specializing in the production of rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries at a lower cost compared to Japanese competitors.

Fast forward nearly 30 years, and the Shenzhen-based company has evolved into the foremost manufacturer of electric vehicles (EVs) globally, surpassing even the American giant Tesla (TSLA) in pure-play electric car sales during the final quarter of 2023.

Despite this milestone, the competition between the two companies remains fierce, with Tesla reclaiming its leading position in the first quarter of 2024.

According to car news, the most valuable car makers;

Tesla stock was priced at $17 a share when it listed in June 2010. Nearly 14 years later, the company’s shares trade above $166, giving it a market capitalization of about $560 billion, making it the most valuable car company in the world. It’s also among the biggest companies globally by market value.

As for BYD, its $81 billion market cap places it among the top 10 automakers in the world, according to Murthy Grandhi, business fundamentals analyst at Global Data, a data and analytics company in London.




Still, it trails far behind Tesla and other car makers like Toyota (TM) and Stellantis (STLA), a conglomerate created from the 2021 merger of French PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The group sells cars under 14 brands, including Chrysler, Citroën, Jeep, Maserati and Peugeot.

But BYD has already surpassed BMW and Ford (F) and is catching up to Mercedes-Benz and Ferrari (RACE),







In 2023, Tesla sold around 230,000 more cars than BYD. But the gap has been narrowing from 400,000 in 2022 and 600,000 in 2021.

And in the last quarter of 2023, BYD hit a major milestone: selling more battery electric vehicles (BEVs) than Musk’s company did globally, due in part to a slowdown for Tesla in one of its biggest markets, China, and to a general deceleration in demand for EVs.

However, the Chinese company stumbled in early 2024. It sold only 300,114 BEVs in the first quarter, down from the 525,409 it sold in the final three months of last year.

That drop was big enough for Tesla, which sold 386,810 BEVs in the same period, to retake its former position despite posting plunging sales.

UNDERSTANDING AUTISM AND BREAKING MYTHS TO FOSTER AWARENESS, THIS AUTSIM AWARENESS MONTH.

04:52, 2024-04-04

April marks Autism Awareness Month, a time dedicated to increasing understanding, acceptance, and support for individuals on the autism spectrum. As we embark on this month-long campaign, it's essential to dispel myths, promote accurate information, and advocate for inclusivity. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition characterized by differences in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors. It affects individuals in various ways, ranging from mild to severe, and no two individuals with autism are exactly alike. According to the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network, the prevalence of ASD has risen nearly 123% from 2018 to 2022. Based on 2018 data, the ADDM reported that 1 in 150 children was diagnosed with ASD. Now, based on 2022 data, 1 in 68 children is identified as having ASD.

While the numbers show that ASD diagnoses are on the rise, it's difficult to pinpoint why. This rise could be due to increased risk factors, including parents' ages, nutritional factors, political instabilities which have increased access to medical care hard. or it could also be that we have more awareness and better tools to recognize ASD in children.




However here are some of the symptoms;




Parents should pay close attention to their child's developmental milestones. Developmental milestones are skills or tasks that children perform at certain ages to ensure they are developing normally. For example, a three-month old child should make cooing sounds and turn towards the sound of someone's voice. If a child isn't meeting these developmental checkpoints, parents should discuss their concerns with their child's doctor. Certain behaviors, especially those involved with communication (such as not saying their first word by 16 months or not using two-word phrases by 24 months) tend to be alert flags that call for further evaluation.




According to DR Sbarina Kitaka a renown East African pediatrician, doctors might start screening for autism and other development disorders as early as nine months, but signs of autism generally become clearer as a child gets older. Parents can screen their children between 18 and 30 months for ASD with the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers-Revised (M-CHAT-R).

The M-CHAT-R has parents answer 20 questions about their child's behavior, such as whether a child responds to his or her name, makes eye contact, smiles back, and plays pretend. If a parent mostly answers 'no' to these questions, their child could be a risk for ASD.




However not all hope is lost in as much as there is no cure for autism, but identifying someone as being on the autism spectrum doesn't have to prevent him or her from leading a normal life. Early intervention can help children with social difficulties learn tools and behaviors that play to their strengths and allow them to function comfortably.

Important to note is , a non-verbal autistic child might communicate better with pictures, symbols, or gestures instead of words. Other intervention strategies could include modeling, play therapy, or computer instruction. Early intervention is different for every child due to their needs, but by starting early, children will develop the necessary tools to set them up for success as they get older.

Now take these autism facts that you just learned and share them with someone else to boost their knowledge and awareness, too!

UNESCO'S AZOULAY SET TO BE IN RWANDA FOR THE GENOCIDE MEMORIAL.

04:14, 2024-04-04

As Rwanda prepares to solemnly mark the 30th anniversary of the Genocide against the Tutsi, the Director-General of UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay, is poised to partake in a series of commemorative events. Scheduled from April 5th to April 7th, Azoulay's visit holds significant importance in honoring the memory of the victims and fostering remembrance among younger generations.

On Saturday, April 6th, Azoulay will visit the Murambi Genocide Memorial in Nyamagabe District, where she will engage with survivors, site management, and local youth. The memorial, a former technical school turned into a site of tragedy, stands as a testament to the brutality of the genocide, preserving the memory of over 50,000 victims.




Reflecting on UNESCO's commitment to educating future generations about violent histories, Azoulay's visit coincides with the recent inscription of four Rwandan memorial sites, including Murambi, on UNESCO's esteemed World Heritage List. This recognition underscores the global significance of these sites in promoting remembrance and national reconciliation.




"In transmitting this history and paying homage to the victims, we aim to prevent such atrocities from recurring," Azoulay emphasized during her previous visit to the Kigali Genocide Memorial, where over 250,000 victims are interred. She reiterated the crucial role played by memorials across Rwanda in this collective endeavor.

Azoulay's itinerary extends beyond Murambi, as she is expected to participate in the official inauguration of the commemoration week in Kigali on Sunday, April 7th. Furthermore, UNESCO will host a ceremony at its Paris headquarters on the same day, honoring the victims at the initiative of Rwanda's permanent delegation.

During her stay, Azoulay will present the official certificate of inscription of the genocide memorials to the Government of Rwanda, reaffirming UNESCO's solidarity in preserving the memory of the genocide and promoting reconciliation.




The commemoration of the 30th Genocide Memorial serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of remembrance, education, and international solidarity in confronting the horrors of the past and building a more peaceful future. Through initiatives like UNESCO's engagement and the preservation of sites like Murambi, Rwanda continues its journey towards healing and reconciliation.

THE RACE IS ON FOR THE LIKELY 2020 REMATCH FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.

04:21, 2024-04-03

Voters across Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, and Wisconsin made their voices heard on Tuesday 2nd, participating in primary elections to signal their preferences for the Democratic and Republican nominees for the upcoming presidential race. Despite the outcome being largely anticipated, the results offer insights into the sentiments and enthusiasm among party supporters as the nation gears up for the 2020 rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.




Both Biden and Trump secured decisive victories in the primaries, further solidifying their positions as the presumptive nominees for their respective parties. The wins in these states contribute to their delegate counts for the upcoming party conventions slated for this summer. However, beyond the expected outcomes, the primaries shed light on the dynamics within each party. Within the Democratic ranks, Biden encountered opposition from activists urging fellow Democrats to register their disapproval of his handling of the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas. This sentiment was reflected in the support garnered by protest campaigns in states like Minnesota and Michigan, where "uncommitted" voters represented a significant portion of the electorate.




Similarly, among Republicans, some dissenting voices persisted, with Trump critics continuing to rally behind candidates who have since dropped out of the race. Despite Trump's firm grip on the nomination, pockets of resistance within the party remain evident.

In Rhode Island and Connecticut, the "uncommitted" faction within the Democratic electorate garnered a notable share of the vote, echoing the sentiments expressed by protest campaigns elsewhere. Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, the "uninstructed delegation" received a comparatively smaller portion of the vote, indicative of varying degrees of dissent within the party across different regions.




As the primaries unfold and the party conventions draw nearer, these symbolic votes serve as a barometer for the enthusiasm and sentiment among base voters, offering a glimpse into the broader political landscape ahead of the highly anticipated 2020 rematch. Despite the lack of suspense surrounding the outcome, these primaries underscore the complexities and nuances within each party as they rally behind their respective nominees in preparation for the upcoming presidential race.

PRESIDENT KAGAME REFLECTS ON THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE AND THE JOURNEY OF RWANDA'S DEVELOPMENT.

12:05, 2024-04-01

As Rwanda prepares to mark the 30th commemoration of the Genocide against the Tutsi, President Paul Kagame sheds light on the tumultuous events of 1994, recounting his pivotal role in the liberation struggle during a broadcast on Royal FM and Radio 10.

Speaking candidly, President Kagame reminisced about the challenges faced in the aftermath of the death of Maj. Gen. Fred Gisa Rwigyema, a key figure in the liberation movement, near the Kagitumba border. He stated,

"I was already on my way to join the struggle, albeit delayed due to prior commitments and military course. However, the loss of our leader necessitated my immediate return."




Addressing inquiries regarding the Arusha peace process, President Kagame emphasized the RPF's willingness to engage in dialogue, lamenting the former government's reluctance to embrace true freedom for Rwandans. He cited chilling remarks from Col. Bagosora, signaling a grim determination to unleash havoc upon the nation, as a stark reminder of the urgency of their cause. President Kagame elaborated,

"We were open to talks, but the government at the time was not ready to agree to the total freedom of Rwandans. Col. Bagosora's statement about returning to Rwanda to reign in an apocalypse instilled fear in many, but we were resolute in our determination to continue the fight."




President Kagame elucidated on the resilience of the RPF, highlighting the transformation of the struggle from an RPF endeavor to a nationwide movement. "It ceased to be just our war; it became the people's war. Rwandans, both at home and abroad, rallied behind the cause, providing crucial support and sustenance," he affirmed. "The struggle was no longer confined to the RPF; it became a collective effort of Rwandans from all walks of life. The solidarity and determination of our people fueled our resolve to press on despite the hardships."




Touching on recent political discourse, President Kagame defended the sovereignty of African nations, asserting that external intervention in domestic affairs is unwarranted. He underscored the African people's discernment in determining their leaders, dismissing notions of foreign superiority in governance. "Africans possess the wisdom to hold their leaders to account. Democracy is not a monopoly of the West," President Kagame asserted. "It is imperative that we as Africans assert our independence and chart our own course towards progress and prosperity."




In a moment of introspection, President Kagame affirmed his commitment to democratic principles, expressing readiness to heed the will of the people. "No leader, including myself, should cling to power if they fail to serve their nation effectively. Accountability is paramount," he affirmed. "Leadership is a sacred trust, and it is incumbent upon us to honor that trust by delivering tangible results and upholding the welfare of our citizens."

As Rwanda prepares to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Genocide against the Tutsi, President Kagame's reflections serve as a poignant reminder of the nation's journey from tragedy to triumph, reaffirming Rwanda's resilience and determination to forge a brighter future.




ABSENT BALLOTS: UKRAINE YET TO MARK WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ELECTION DAY.

11:17, 2024-04-01

In an alternate reality, today would have marked Election Day in Ukraine, where citizens would have had the opportunity to cast their votes and weigh in on the presidency of Volodymyr Zelensky. However, amid ongoing conflict and displacement, the country finds itself devoid of the democratic process it so desperately craves.




Five years ago, Volodymyr Zelensky, renowned for his talents as an actor, comedian, and producer, ascended to the presidency, propelled by a wave of public support. However, with Russian forces still present within Ukrainian territory and millions of citizens displaced or living abroad, the prospect of an election remains a distant dream. In recent months, some US Republicans have cited the impending expiration of Zelensky's term in May as a reason to withhold military aid. While Zelensky initially entertained the idea, he has since emphasized that holding an election amidst ongoing conflict would be neither feasible nor advisable.

Although Ukraine's constitution designates Sunday as Election Day, it also prohibits elections during wartime. While the alternative of suspending martial law during an election period exists, Zelensky has deemed it "not the right time" given the current circumstances.




Opinion polls further underscore the reluctance among Ukrainians to pursue an election at this juncture, with just 15% of respondents expressing support for holding one, according to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. Last August, President Zelensky appeared sympathetic to the idea of holding a poll during an interview on Ukrainian television. However, the realities of ongoing conflict and displacement have since tempered any enthusiasm for such a venture.




As Ukraine reflects on what should have been Election Day, the absence of ballots serves as a stark reminder of the challenges the nation continues to face. Despite the longing for democratic expression, the specter of conflict looms large, casting a shadow over the prospects of a free and fair election.

LESSONS FROM TRAGEDY: REFLECTING ON RWANDA'S JOURNEY 30 YEARS AFTER GENOCIDE.

05:22, 2024-04-01

As Rwanda marks the 30th anniversary of the Genocide against the Tutsi, known as Kwibuka, the nation stands as a beacon of resilience, reconciliation, and hope. From the ashes of tragedy, Rwanda has emerged as a testament to the indomitable spirit of its people and the transformative power of unity and forgiveness. As the world observes this solemn occasion, it is imperative to reflect on the lessons that both modern-day Rwanda and the global community can glean from the dark chapters of history.

Rwanda's commitment to preserving the legacy of the genocide serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of acknowledging and confronting the past. By bearing witness to the atrocities and ensuring that the stories of survivors are heard, Rwanda underscores the necessity of collective remembrance in preventing future atrocities.




2. Embracing Unity in Diversity: One of the most profound lessons from Rwanda's journey is the transformative power of unity in the face of division. In the aftermath of the genocide, Rwanda has embarked on a path of reconciliation and nation-building, transcending ethnic divisions to forge a shared identity grounded in unity and inclusivity. By embracing diversity and fostering a culture of dialogue and understanding, Rwanda has charted a course towards healing and sustainable peace.




3. Justice and Accountability: Rwanda's commitment to justice and accountability led to the establishment of home based solutions like GACACA, that if taken on in the world would solve the backlog of cases rotting in courts of law which stands as a cornerstone of the nation's recovery and reconciliation efforts. Through national and international mechanisms, perpetrators of genocide have been held accountable for their crimes, demonstrating that impunity will not be tolerated. By upholding the principles of justice and the rule of law, Rwanda sends a clear message that reconciliation is inseparable from accountability.




4. Investing in ideology Education and Healing: Education plays a pivotal role in Rwanda's journey towards healing and reconciliation especially with the introduction of initiatices such as ''Ndi Umunya Rwanda'', which would see the unity doctrine passed on to the youngsters. Through such educational programs, memorial sites, and community initiatives, Rwanda is fostering a culture of remembrance and dialogue, ensuring that future generations understand the importance of peace, tolerance, and human rights. By investing in education and healing, Rwanda is laying the groundwork for a more just and compassionate society.




5. Global Solidarity and Prevention: As away to contribute globally to the ''Never Again'', The initiative is not limited to Rwanda but rather to the entire world which would is prone to genocidal ideology. Kwibuka serves as a call to action for the global community to stand in solidarity with survivors and victims of genocide everywhere. By amplifying the voices of survivors, supporting genocide prevention efforts, and promoting peacebuilding initiatives, the world can honor Rwanda's resilience and commitment to never again allowing such atrocities to occur.




As Rwanda commemorates the 30th anniversary of the Genocide against the Tutsi, the lessons learned from its tragic history serve as a guiding light for both the nation and the world. By remembering the past, embracing unity, seeking justice, investing in education, and fostering global solidarity, Rwanda offers a powerful testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the enduring quest for peace and reconciliation.




LIVERPOOL ASCEND TO SUMMIT, ARSENAL HOLD FIRM AGAINST CITY IN TITLE RACE DRAMA

03:53, 2024-04-01

In a day rife with title race drama, Liverpool emerged as the big winners, surging to the top of the Premier League table with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Brighton. The win propelled Liverpool two points clear of Arsenal and three ahead of reigning champions Manchester City, setting the stage for a thrilling climax to the season with nine games remaining.




Meanwhile, a share of the spoils at the Etihad Stadium saw City's unbeaten home run extend back to November 2022, while halting Arsenal's impressive eight-match winning streak in the league. Despite City's dominance in possession, they were thwarted by Arsenal's resolute defense, which boasts the fewest goals conceded in the Premier League this season.

Arsenal, adopting a counter-attacking approach, managed to stifle City's attacking prowess, denying Pep Guardiola's side from scoring at the Etihad for the first time in two years. Gabriel Jesus, making his return to the Etihad, had Arsenal's best chance in a first half characterized by a lack of clear-cut opportunities.

City's defensive woes were compounded when Nathan Ake limped off in the first half, leaving Guardiola with a makeshift backline. Despite an uptick in tempo after the break, both sides struggled to break the deadlock, with chances at a premium.

Erling Haaland, closely marked by Arsenal's defensive pairing of Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba, found little joy in front of goal, while substitute Leandro Trossard squandered Arsenal's best opportunity late in the game.




City's failure to secure a winner leaves them still searching for a victory against any of the top five teams in the Premier League this season. As the title race intensifies, City now rely on results from Liverpool and Arsenal to keep their hopes of a historic fourth consecutive title alive. With Liverpool's ascent to the top and Arsenal's resilient display against City, the Premier League title race promises to deliver more twists and turns in the coming weeks, captivating football fans worldwide with its thrilling narrative of competition and intrigue.

''FRANCE TO HELP BRAZIL BUILD NUCLEAR POWERED SUBMARINES,'' SAYS PRES MACRON.

20:28, 2024-03-27

French President Emmanuel Macron has extended his country's support to Brazil's ambitions of enhancing its naval capabilities, including the possibility of nuclear propulsion, while emphasizing the importance of adhering to non-proliferation commitments. Speaking at the launch of a conventionally powered Franco-Brazilian submarine in Itaguai near Rio de Janeiro, Macron pledged France's assistance in opening new chapters for submarine technology.




"I want us to open the chapter for new submarines ... that we look nuclear propulsion in the face while being perfectly respectful of all non-proliferation commitments," stated Macron during the ceremony. "You want it, France will be at your side."




The event marked the launch of Brazil's third French-designed submarine, a crucial addition to the nation's naval arsenal aimed at securing its extensive coastline, often referred to as the "Blue Amazon." The construction of these submarines was part of a 2008 deal struck between former Brazilian President Lula and then French President Nicolas Sarkozy, which also included the procurement of 50 Caracal helicopters.

In addition to conventional submarines, Brazil is eyeing the development of its first nuclear-powered submarine, the Alvaro Alberto, with support from French naval defense manufacturer Naval Group. However, the transfer of nuclear technology has posed challenges, with France cautious due to concerns regarding nuclear proliferation.




"There are discussions on the possibility of France cooperating with us, including on nuclear energy, nuclear fuel," stated Maria Luisa Escorel de Moraes, the European head of Brazilian diplomacy, acknowledging the sensitive nature of the matter.

Despite efforts to advance the project, significant delays have been encountered, primarily attributed to budget constraints. The launch of the nuclear submarine is now projected between 2036 and 2037, according to the Brazilian navy.

President Macron's visit to Brazil, a key economic partner, has included initiatives aimed at environmental conservation, such as a plan to mobilize over a billion dollars in green investments to protect the Brazilian and Guyanese Amazon. His engagement underscores the multifaceted nature of Franco-Brazilian relations, encompassing defense cooperation, technological advancement, and environmental stewardship.
















FROM PRISON TO MATCHING INTO THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE, THE REMARKEABLE STORY OF SENEGAL'S PRESIDENT ELECT.

20:09, 2024-03-27

With history being in his favor all event agreed that, Bassirou Diomaye Faye has emerged victorious in Senegal's presidential election, defying all odds and capturing the imagination of a nation. The 44-year-old, who was released from prison just 10 days prior to the election, has secured a significant lead, placing well ahead of the governing coalition's candidate, former prime minister Amadou Ba.




Faye's remarkable victory, which still awaits validation by Senegal's top constitutional body, marks a watershed moment in the country's political landscape. If validated, he is poised to become the youngest president in Senegal's history, ushering in a new era characterized by a "break" from the existing political order.

The significance of Faye's win cannot be overstated, as it would mark the first time since Senegal's independence from France in 1960 that an opposition candidate has triumphed in the first round of elections. This unprecedented achievement underscores the winds of change sweeping across the nation, signaling a resounding call for reform and renewal.

Despite facing formidable adversaries, including former prime minister Amadou Ba, Faye's grassroots movement and message of change resonated deeply with the Senegalese electorate. His pledge to break away from the status quo and champion the aspirations of the people struck a chord, propelling him to victory against all expectations.




With third-placed candidate Aliou Mamadou Dia trailing far behind, Faye's resounding mandate reflects a clear mandate for change and a rejection of the old guard. The announcement of the election results at the Dakar court by the president of the national vote counting commission, Amady Diouf, solidifies Faye's decisive triumph and sets the stage for a new chapter in Senegal's political history. As the nation awaits the validation of Faye's victory by the constitutional body, anticipation and hope abound for a brighter future under the leadership of a man who has defied adversity and risen from prison to the presidential palace, embodying the resilience and spirit of the Senegalese people.

STATE OWNED COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA RECOVERS $11M LOST IN A SOFTWARE GLITCH.

19:59, 2024-03-27

In a remarkable turnaround, the State-owned Commercial Bank of Ethiopia has announced the recovery of over three-quarters of the $14 million lost due to a software glitch earlier this month. According to the bank's president, Abie Sano, approximately 78 percent of the 801 million birr withdrawn or transferred during the incident on March 15th has been successfully returned, totaling 622.9 million birr, or $11 million.




Addressing the media yesterday, Abie Sano stated that the bank has taken significant strides in retrieving the lost funds. He revealed that the names of over 500 individuals who have yet to return the balance have been made public. The bank's proactive approach in reaching out to those involved underscores its commitment to rectifying the situation swiftly.

Previously attributing the incident to a group of university students who allegedly spread news about the glitch through social media channels, Abie Sano reiterated the bank's stance on holding those responsible accountable for their actions.

The software malfunction, which occurred during a routine system update, was promptly addressed by Ethiopia's central bank earlier this month. Assurances were provided that there was no imminent risk to customers or the overall stability of the financial system.




The swift recovery of the majority of the lost funds stands as a testament to the efficiency and resilience of the State-owned Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, as it continues to uphold its reputation as a cornerstone of the nation's financial infrastructure.

In 2024, as three hubs are set to launch, beginning with a FinTech in Lagos, HealthTech in Kigali, and AgriTech in Accra.

Crucially, timbuktoo will provide early-stage risk capital to empower Africa's youth in their entrepreneurial endeavors. This support will be facilitated through a fund based in the Kigali International Financial Centre, leveraging Rwanda's status as a leading financial hub in Africa. The journey of timbuktoo began with its global launch at the 54th World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where it garnered support from leaders including President Paul Kagame of Rwanda and President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana. The Foundation's founding members include African governments and key stakeholders from the private sector and innovation ecosystem.




Ms. Natalie Jabangwe, a renowned leader in business, finance, and technology, has been appointed as the Ad Interim Executive Secretary to lead the Foundation's operations.

She called on African governments and partners to join forces in driving sustainable growth and prosperity through innovation and entrepreneurship.




As timbuktoo embarks on its journey, it symbolizes the collective aspirations of Africa's youth and the commitment of stakeholders to harness the continent's potential for innovation and economic transformation. Today's milestone in Kigali marks the beginning of a new era of opportunity and progress for Africa.

TRAGEDY STRIKES: BALTMORE'S FRANCIS SCOTT KEY BRIDGE COLLAPSE CLAIMS LIVES.

06:15, 2024-03-27

In a devastating turn of events early Tuesday morning, the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland, collapsed following a collision with a cargo ship, leaving six individuals missing and presumed dead. As the search and rescue efforts transition into recovery operations, the grim reality of the situation begins to unfold.

Halted Search Amid Dangerous Conditions

Overnight, search and recovery operations were suspended due to hazardous conditions, including precarious sections of the collapsed steel bridge and dangling shipping containers from the cargo ship. Despite the challenges, divers are set to resume their efforts Wednesday in hopes of locating the missing individuals. Maryland Governor Wes Moore reiterated the commitment to employing every available resource to bring closure to the affected families.




Hazmat Threat Looms

The US Coast Guard is now faced with the daunting task of assessing the potential hazmat threat posed by damaged shipping containers onboard the crashed vessel. Teams are meticulously inspecting the ship's manifest to identify any materials that may pose health risks, intensifying the complexities of the recovery operation.




Investigation Underway

The National Transportation Safety Board has taken charge of the investigation, aiming to gather crucial evidence to understand the circumstances leading to the tragic incident. While initial reports suggest no foul play, authorities remain vigilant in their pursuit of answers.

Heartbreaking Details Emerge

As the identities of the missing individuals slowly emerge, stories of loss and anguish begin to surface. Among those unaccounted for is Miguel Luna, a construction worker from El Salvador, described as a devoted husband and father who has called Maryland home for nearly two decades. Additionally, two Guatemalans and an undisclosed number of individuals from Mexico remain missing, compounding the international scope of the tragedy.

Ship Malfunction Preceded Collision

Preliminary findings indicate a sudden blackout of engine and electrical power on the cargo ship just moments before the collision. While emergency measures were initiated, the timing proved catastrophic, resulting in the tragic collision with the bridge.




Long Road to Recovery

As the nation grapples with the aftermath of the collapse, attention turns to the daunting task of rebuilding the Key Bridge. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg acknowledges the substantial time and resources required for restoration, emphasizing the need for federal support in the endeavor.

Impact on Supply Chains

The closure of the vital shipping port in Baltimore reverberates across supply chains, with significant disruptions expected. As efforts to clear the channel and reopen the port commence, the extent of the economic repercussions remains uncertain.

The collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge stands as a poignant reminder of the fragility of infrastructure and the profound human toll of such tragedies. As communities mourn the loss of lives and grapple with the aftermath, solidarity and support become paramount in the journey toward healing and recovery.

RWANDA WELCOMES NEW ENVOYS , A TASTAMENT OF STRONG BILATERAL RELATIONS.

06:06, 2024-03-27

President Paul Kagame of Rwanda received letters of credence on Tuesday, March 26, from three distinguished envoys who will represent their countries in Rwanda. The officials, Ambassador Nermine Mohamed Essam of Egypt, High Commissioner Julie Crowley of Canada, and Kenyan High Commissioner Janet Mwawasi Oben, each expressed their commitment to bolstering bilateral ties between their respective nations and Rwanda.

Egyptian Ambassador Essam, after presenting her letters of credence, expressed her honor in evaluating bilateral relations with Rwanda alongside President Kagame. She emphasized the political will on the Egyptian side to engage and enhance relations across various sectors, including the economy, health, and security.




Rwanda's cordial relations with Egypt extend across multiple domains, from military cooperation to agriculture and trade. The recent proposal of Dan Munyuza as Rwanda's ambassador to Egypt further underscores the commitment to strengthening ties.

Canada's new High Commissioner, Julie Crowley, affirmed her dedication to advancing the already robust bilateral relationship between Rwanda and Canada. She highlighted plans to deepen commercial ties, leveraging Canadian firms in Rwanda and engaging with the Rwandan diaspora in Canada. Areas of collaboration include mining, renewable energy, education, and ICT, acknowledging Rwanda's regional leadership in the latter.

Kenyan High Commissioner Janet Mwawasi Oben reiterated Kenya's commitment to maintaining its position as one of Rwanda's key trade partners. She outlined the array of goods exchanged between the two nations and underscored the importance of implementing existing cooperation agreements, particularly those signed during President William Ruto's visit to Kigali in April 2023.




In her capacity, Oben pledged to oversee the implementation of these agreements to expand opportunities and deepen bilateral relations. Emphasizing the shared goals of expanding trade, investment, and regional peace and security, she echoed the sentiment of continuous collaboration between Kenya and Rwanda. The exchange of letters of credence and subsequent interviews with the envoys exemplify the strong foundation of diplomatic ties between Rwanda and each represented nation. As Rwanda continues to position itself as a hub for innovation and development in the region, these engagements serve as testament to the mutual commitment to advancing prosperity and cooperation.

US SECRETARY OF STATE EMBARKS ON ANOTHER TOUR TO THE MIDDLE EAST IN HOPE TO SECURE THE GAZA CEASE FIRE.

05:07, 2024-03-21

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken embarked on another tour to the Middle East this week, underscoring ongoing efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and increase humanitarian aid deliveries to the enclave. Blinken's diplomatic mission follows a series of developments that underscore the complexities of the situation in the region. One such development emerged as a senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, announced in a press conference in Beirut on Wednesday, March 20, that Israel had responded negatively to the group's latest ceasefire proposal. The rejection came despite mediators facilitating discussions between the two parties.




Simultaneously, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu expressed determination to proceed with a potential ground offensive in Rafah, despite reservations voiced by US President Joe Biden. Netanyahu's commitment underscores the persistent tensions and differing approaches to resolving the conflict. In an interview with FRANCE 24, the executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) raised concerns about the dire situation facing children trapped in the conflict in Gaza. The escalating violence has taken a heavy toll, with thousands of Palestinians killed and wounded since the conflict began with the October 7 attack on Israel.




According to statistics provided by the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave, at least 31,923 Palestinians have been killed and 74,096 wounded in the ongoing conflict. The October 7 attacks, led by Hamas, resulted in the deaths of approximately 1,140 people, with 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli figures. Tragically, 132 individuals remain missing, adding to the uncertainty and anguish felt by families affected by the violence. Amidst these grim realities, Blinken's diplomatic efforts signal a renewed commitment to finding a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Gaza. By engaging with key stakeholders and advocating for humanitarian assistance, the United States seeks to alleviate the suffering of civilians caught in the crossfire and pave the way for a sustainable ceasefire.

As the international community continues to grapple with the complexities of the Middle East conflict, Blinken's tour underscores the urgency of finding a diplomatic solution that addresses the root causes of the violence and restores hope for a brighter future for all parties involved.













EXPORT DEVELOPMENT FUND LAUNCHES PERMANENT OFFICES IN RWANDA, PLEDGES TO BOOST EXPORT INVESTMENT ACROSS AFRICA.

04:39, 2024-03-21

The Fund for Export Development in Africa (FEDA) has taken a significant step forward in its mission to drive investment and promote industrialization across the continent with the launch of its permanent offices in Rwanda. The inauguration of these offices, which took place on March 20, marks the official commencement of FEDA's operations in the country and underscores its commitment to playing a pivotal role in advancing investments in Africa.

FEDA, the investment platform of the African Export Import Bank (Afreximbank), has chosen Kigali as the location for its new offices, situated in the heart of the Central Business District within the I&M Bank building. This strategic decision reflects Rwanda's instrumental role in supporting FEDA's establishment, being the first of 12 African countries to accede and ratify the FEDA Establishment Agreement, and in hosting both FEDA and the AfCFTA Adjustment Fund Corporation.




"The opening of FEDA's permanent offices in Rwanda signals a significant milestone in our efforts to promote industrialization and enhance intra-Africa trade," remarked [Official Name], [Title]. "Rwanda's commitment to facilitating investment and fostering a conducive business environment has positioned it as an ideal hub for organizations like FEDA to thrive."




FEDA, as the Impact Investment Fund for Africa's export transformation, aims to bridge the $110 billion gap in equity financing on the continent, thereby catalyzing economic growth and development. One of its key objectives is to facilitate collaboration between investment partners and financial institutions to mobilize capital and support export-oriented enterprises.

Herbert Asiimwe, Head of Financial Sector Development at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, highlighted the significant benefits of having FEDA domiciled in Rwanda. "The presence of FEDA not only strengthens Rwanda's foreign exchange reserves but also provides a vital source of financing for our private sector," stated Asiimwe. "Access to additional capital will enable local businesses to expand their operations and contribute to Rwanda's economic resilience."




Rwanda's strategic efforts to position itself as a financial hub have been instrumental in attracting international banks and investment funds. "The government's proactive approach in creating an enabling regulatory environment and nurturing a skilled workforce has positioned Rwanda as an attractive destination for international investors," noted Asiimwe.

Patient Sayiba Tambwe, Executive Chairman of African Desk and Board Member of the AfCFTA Adjustment Fund, commended Rwanda's effective implementation of trade facilitation measures. "The establishment of FEDA's offices in Rwanda underscores the country's commitment to fostering regional trade and economic integration," remarked Tambwe. "Rwanda's success in trade facilitation serves as a model for other African nations striving to enhance their competitiveness in the global market."

The launch of FEDA's permanent offices in Rwanda not only signifies a milestone in the organization's journey but also reaffirms Rwanda's position as a progressive and dynamic player in Africa's economic landscape. As FEDA embarks on its mission to drive investments and promote export-led growth, Rwanda stands ready to leverage this partnership to accelerate its own economic transformation and contribute to the broader development agenda of the continent.













PARLIAMENT TASKS MINUBUMWE WITH ADDRESSING CHALLENGES FACED BY GENOCIDE SURVIVORS.

04:27, 2024-03-21

As Rwanda is set for the 30th Genocide memorial, a significant development aimed at bolstering support for vulnerable survivors of the Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, Parliamentarians have directed the Ministry of National Unity and Civic Engagement (MINUBUMWE) to tackle pressing issues including medical care, education, shelter, and poverty alleviation. The directive comes following the presentation of a comprehensive report by the Commission of Unity of Rwandans, Human Rights, and Combating Genocide. The report, which unveiled its findings on Wednesday, March 20, shed light on the current conditions of vulnerable Genocide survivors across the country. Conducted during a ten-day trip from October 9 to 18, 2023, the assessment aimed to monitor the well-being of survivors and evaluate the adequacy of support services available to them.




MP Veneranda Nyirahirwa, chairperson of the commission, emphasized the significance of the tour, which sought to closely examine the lives of vulnerable survivors and gauge the effectiveness of existing support mechanisms. While acknowledging the strides made in assisting survivors over the past 29 years, Nyirahirwa underscored the urgent need for improvement in critical areas identified by the survivors themselves. Among the challenges highlighted in the report are barriers to accessing essential healthcare services, delays in obtaining identification numbers, mental health concerns, insufficient financial assistance, and shortages of adequate housing. Furthermore, the commission noted deficiencies in preserving evidence and testimonies of the Genocide, as well as in maintaining historical monuments—a crucial aspect of ensuring the accurate recording of Rwanda's history.




In response to these pressing issues, Jean Damascene Bizimana, the Minister of National Unity and Civic Engagement, outlined ongoing efforts to address them. These initiatives include housing projects aimed at providing secure accommodation for survivors, as well as enhancements to history education programs to ensure comprehensive coverage of Rwanda's past, particularly regarding the Genocide against the Tutsi. Despite the existence of unity and reconciliation clubs in secondary schools, Nyirahirwa emphasized the need for further improvements, citing inadequate teaching materials on Rwanda's history. Efforts to bolster these educational resources are crucial in fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of Rwanda's history among the younger generation.




However, challenges persist, including budgetary constraints and coordination issues among various institutions tasked with supporting survivors. Addressing these systemic obstacles will require concerted efforts from all stakeholders to ensure the effective implementation of support programs and initiatives. With the six-month deadline set for implementing measures to address the challenges faced by vulnerable survivors, there is a renewed sense of urgency to prioritize their well-being and ensure that their needs are met adequately. The commitment demonstrated by Parliamentarians and government officials signals a collective determination to uphold the rights and dignity of Genocide survivors, reaffirming Rwanda's ongoing journey towards reconciliation, healing, and unity.

TANZANIA TO CONSTRUCT A 286 BILLION TZ SHILLINGS STADIUM FOR AFCON 2027

15:00, 2024-03-19

Tanzania is gearing up for its role as a co-host of the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) 2027 alongside Kenya and Uganda, with plans underway to build a state-of-the-art stadium in Arusha. The ambitious project, estimated to cost 286 billion TZ shillings, aims to ensure that Tanzania has top-tier infrastructure in place for the prestigious football tournament. According to the Sports Minister, the Tanzanian government is committed to completing the stadium before the scheduled hosting of the 2027 Afcon finals. The facility, set to accommodate 30,000 spectators, will serve as one of the venues for the tournament.




In an exciting development, the stadium is proposed to be named after the sitting President, Samia Suluhu Hassan, contingent upon her acceptance of the proposal. The decision underscores the government's recognition of President Samia's leadership and commitment to sports development in the country.

Mr. Gerson Msigwa, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry for Culture, Arts, and Sports, shared details of the stadium project during a briefing in Dar es Salaam. He emphasized that the stadium's construction aligns with Tanzania's aspirations to host a successful and memorable Afcon tournament.




Furthermore, Mr. Msigwa announced ongoing renovation works at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam, another key venue for the upcoming tournament. The refurbishment, scheduled to be completed by August 24th of this year, includes the replacement of all 60,000 seats inside the stadium with new ones. Mr. Msigwa expressed confidence that the uplift works would significantly enhance the stadium's aesthetics and functionality.

A budget of more than 31 billion TZ shillings has been allocated for the refurbishment of the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium, highlighting the government's commitment to modernizing sports infrastructure across the country. As Tanzania prepares to co-host the Afcon 2027, the ambitious stadium projects underscore the nation's determination to showcase its capabilities on the continental stage and leave a lasting legacy in sports development.

The construction of the Samia Suluhu Hassan Stadium and the renovation of the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium represent significant milestones in Tanzania's journey towards becoming a prominent hub for sports excellence in the region.

OPINION: IS AN 18 YEAR OLD' ENOUGH FOR MARRIAGE, AQUESTION ON TABLE?

14:38, 2024-03-19

A draft law currently under debate in the Rwandan parliament proposes a significant change in the legal age for marriage, potentially allowing individuals as young as 18 years old to marry under certain conditions. This proposed amendment, if enacted, would lower the current legal age for marriage from 21 to 18, marking a pivotal shift in the country's family laws.




At present, the legal age for marriage in Rwanda stands at 21. However, the draft law aims to extend the right to marry to individuals who have reached the age of majority but are not yet 21. Under this proposed legislation, those aged 18 and above could apply for permission to marry from the competent authorities, provided they provide valid reasons for doing so. The rationale behind this proposed change lies in aligning legal provisions with social realities and individual rights. The draft law acknowledges that at the age of 18, individuals have the legal right to engage in sexual relations but are barred from entering into marriage contracts. By lowering the marriageable age to 18, the law seeks to bridge this gap and grant individuals the autonomy to make decisions regarding their personal lives, including marriage, once they reach the age of majority.




Furthermore, the proposed amendment reflects a broader effort to modernize and adapt legal frameworks to evolving societal norms and values. It recognizes the agency and maturity of young adults, acknowledging their capacity to make informed choices about marriage. By providing a legal pathway for individuals aged 18 and above to marry, the draft law promotes inclusivity and respects the rights of young adults to enter into consensual unions.

Critics may argue that lowering the marriageable age could potentially expose young individuals to risks such as early pregnancies, limited educational opportunities, and economic instability. While these concerns are valid, it's essential to emphasize that the draft law includes safeguards to mitigate potential risks. Applicants seeking permission to marry must provide valid reasons for their decision, and competent authorities have the discretion to evaluate each case carefully. Additionally, the legislation could be accompanied by comprehensive awareness campaigns and support services to educate young adults about the responsibilities and implications of marriage.




To most people the proposed change to the marriageable age in Rwanda represents a positive step towards enhancing individual autonomy and aligning legal provisions with social realities. By recognizing the rights of individuals aged 18 and above to marry under certain conditions, however the is need for a clause to protect the continuity of certain aspects such as education, sexual and reproduction support especially if there has been an teenage pregnancy involved prior .The draft law upholds principles of equality, dignity, and personal freedom. As the debate unfolds in parliament, it's imperative to consider the potential benefits and challenges associated with this amendment, with a focus on promoting the well-being and agency of young Rwandans.

AMAD DIALLO'S HEROICS PROPEL MANCHESTER UNITED TO EPIC FA CUP VICTORY OVER LIVERPOLL

05:31, 2024-03-18

In a thrilling FA Cup quarter-final clash, Manchester United orchestrated a remarkable comeback to edge past Liverpool in a pulsating encounter at Old Trafford. Amad Diallo etched his name into United folklore with a stunning 120th-minute winner, denying Jurgen Klopp's side their quadruple aspirations and propelling his team into the semi-finals in dramatic fashion. Diallo's decisive goal, a breakaway effort in the dying moments of the match, sent the home crowd into raptures. However, his jubilant celebration, marked by the removal of his shirt, resulted in a red card, adding an extra layer of drama to an already exhilarating climax.




Liverpool, minutes away from securing a semi-final berth, were left stunned as Marcus Rashford's 112th-minute equalizer in extra time paved the way for Diallo's heroics. The result not only shattered Liverpool's quadruple dreams but also ensured that Klopp's tenure at Anfield would not culminate in FA Cup glory.

Looking ahead, Manchester United will face Coventry City in the semi-finals, setting the stage for another thrilling encounter. Meanwhile, the FA Cup draw handed holders Manchester City a showdown with Chelsea, promising more excitement in the tournament's latter stages.




For United manager Erik ten Hag, the victory carried immense significance, potentially safeguarding his position at the helm. Describing the match as one to salvage United's season, Ten Hag's exuberance was palpable as he celebrated on the touchline, encapsulating the euphoria of the moment.

The magnitude of Diallo's contribution cannot be overstated. Despite his peripheral role in the squad, the Ivorian seized the opportunity to etch his name in United's history books. His lightning-fast counter-attack, culminating in a clinical finish past Liverpool's goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher, epitomized the resilience and spirit of the Red Devils.




While United relish in their triumph over their arch-rivals, the victory transcends mere rivalry, symbolizing the resilience and determination of a team unwilling to concede defeat. In an epic encounter marked by twists and turns, Amad Diallo emerged as the unlikely hero, etching his name in football folklore with a moment of sheer brilliance.

PUTIN SET FOR ANOTHER TERM AMIDST CONTROVERSIAL ELECTION.

05:06, 2024-03-18

On the final day of the election, Russians flocked to polling stations across the nation, responding to an opposition call to voice their discontent with Putin's rule. The scene reflected a nation grappling with its political landscape, where the impending landslide victory for Putin underscored his unyielding grip on power and desire for full control of the country's political sphere, extending his reign for another six years.




Putin, buoyed by early results, interpreted the turnout as a testament to trust and hope in his leadership. However, critics viewed the election outcome as predetermined, highlighting the lack of genuine choice for voters and the absence of independent monitoring.

British Foreign Secretary David Cameron condemned the election process, citing the illegal holding of elections on Ukrainian territory, limited choices for voters, and the absence of independent OSCE monitoring. His remarks echoed growing international concerns over the fairness and transparency of the electoral process. Despite allegations of repression and limited political freedom, Russian embassies worldwide witnessed an unexpected display of support from the Russian diaspora community, praising Putin's leadership. This apparent contradiction further complicates the narrative surrounding the legitimacy of the election.




The environment leading up to the election was marked by stifled dissent and restricted media freedom. Alexei Navalny's untimely death in custody, along with the imprisonment or exile of other critics, underscored the challenges facing those opposing Putin's regime.

In this tightly controlled atmosphere, Navalny's associates called upon dissatisfied citizens to participate in the election, prompting long lines outside polling stations across Russia and its embassies globally. Notable among those joining the queue was Yulia Navalnaya, Navalny's widow, who cast her vote in Berlin, symbolizing a poignant moment of defiance amidst adversity. Navalnaya's message to Putin, delivered with steely resolve, reflected the simmering discontent among opposition circles. Her assertion that negotiations with Putin were futile, labeling him as a "killer" and a "gangster," encapsulated the deep-seated grievances against the Russian leader.




As Putin secures another term in office amidst allegations of electoral irregularities and repression, the future of dissent in Russia remains uncertain. The election serves as a stark reminder of the challenges facing those striving for political change in the face of entrenched power.

NAVIGATING THE GRIDLOCK UNDP'S CALL FOR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN A POLARIZED WORLD

20:58, 2024-03-15

In the wake of global upheavals wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic and mounting conflicts across continents, the world finds itself at a critical juncture. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has sounded the alarm, releasing its 2023/24 Human Development Report (HDR) titled "Breaking the Gridlock: Reimagining cooperation in a polarized world." The report paints a sobering picture of the current state of affairs, highlighting the dangerous gridlock stemming from uneven development progress, intensifying inequality, and escalating political polarization. Against the backdrop of unprecedented global connectivity, the report underscores the urgent need for collective action to tackle these pressing challenges and reconfigure global interdependence.




One of the central questions posed by the report is why the pursuit of ambitious agendas such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement feels like navigating through quicksand. Why does restoring peace, even temporarily, seem so elusive in many parts of the world? And why are we grappling with digital governance while artificial intelligence races ahead in a data gold rush? The HDR underscores that uneven development progress is exacerbating inequality and stoking political polarization on a global scale. While the global Human Development Index (HDI) is projected to reach record highs in 2023 following steep declines during the pandemic years, progress remains partial, incomplete, and unequal. Rich countries are witnessing record-high levels of human development, while many of the world's poorest nations lag behind their pre-crisis levels. Global inequalities are further compounded by significant economic concentration, with a disproportionate share of global trade and market capitalization held by a handful of countries and tech giants. Achim Steiner, head of the UNDP, emphasizes the urgent need to leverage global interdependence and collective capacities to address shared challenges and ensure that people's aspirations are met.

The report highlights an emerging 'democracy paradox,' revealing that while the majority of people worldwide endorse democracy, many also support leaders who may undermine democratic principles. This erosion of trust in institutions and the democratic process poses significant obstacles to advancing international collective action.




As the world grapples with unprecedented challenges, the HDR serves as a clarion call for renewed commitment to multilateralism and cooperation. By breaking the gridlock through collective action, the international community can pave the way for a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable future for all. Political polarization is also a growing concern with global repercussions. Along with a sense of powerlessness, report authors say, it is fueling inward-turning policy approaches – starkly at odds with the global cooperation needed to address urgent issues like the decarbonization of our economies, misuse of digital technologies, and conflict. This is particularly alarming in light of 2023's record-breaking temperatures, which emphasize the immediate need for united action to tackle the climate crisis, or in the advent of artificial intelligence as a new and fast-evolving technological frontier with little or no regulatory guard rails.




The report highlights that deglobalization is neither feasible nor realistic in today’s world and that economic interdependence remains high. It points out that no region is close to self-sufficiency, as all rely on imports from other regions of 25 percent or more of at least one major type of goods and services. "In a world marked by increasing polarization and division, neglecting to invest in each other poses a serious threat to our wellbeing and security. Protectionist approaches cannot address the complex, interconnected challenges we face, including pandemic prevention, climate change, and digital regulation,” Steiner added. “Our problems are intertwined, requiring equally interconnected solutions. By adopting an opportunity-driven agenda that emphasizes the benefits of the energy transition and of artificial intelligence for human development, we have a chance to break through the current deadlock and reignite a commitment to a shared future." The report emphasizes how global interdependence is being reconfigured and calls for a new generation of global public goods. It proposes four areas for immediate action: - planetary public goods, for climate stability, as we confront the unprecedented challenges of the Anthropocene; - digital global public goods, for greater equity in harnessing new technologies for equitable human development; - new and expanded financial mechanisms, including a novel track in international cooperation that complements humanitarian assistance and traditional development aid to low-income countries; and - dialling down political polarization through new governance approaches focused on enhancing people's voices in deliberation and tackling misinformation. In this context, multilateralism plays a fundamental role, the report argues, because bilateral engagements are not able to address the irreducibly planetary nature of the provision of global public goods.

Harry Kane stole the show with a brace, ensuring Bayern's progression to the quarter-finals. Barcelona, led by the prolific Robert Lewandowski, secured their spot with a composed display against Napoli, winning on aggregate with a goal from their former striker in both legs. The storied history of Real Madrid in the Champions League continued as they navigated past Leipzig and Real Madrid, booking their spot in the quarter-finals with a win in Germany and a draw at the Bernabeu. Atletico Madrid exhibited their resilience, bouncing back from a first-leg defeat to eliminate last year's finalists Inter Milan on penalties, while Borussia Dortmund sealed their quarter-final berth with a clinical 2-0 victory over PSV Eindhoven.




The stage is set for an enthralling conclusion to the round of 16, with two more clashes set to determine the final entrants into the quarter-finals. Porto and Arsenal battled to a thrilling 1-1 draw before the Gunners emerged victorious in a tense penalty shootout, while Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid played out a dramatic 2-2 draw before Atletico held their nerve in the shootout to progress.

As the tournament progresses, anticipation builds for the mouthwatering quarter-final matchups, with Europe's elite poised to showcase their talents on the grandest stage of them all.The draw will take place in Nyon, Switzerland on Friday, March 15 at 11am UK time.

MINISTRY OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY CRACKS DOWN ON UNLICENSED MAIZE TRADERS

04:27, 2024-03-15

The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MINICOM) has taken decisive action against unlicensed middlemen in the maize trade, levying fines totaling Rwf43.2 million against 113 offenders. Cassien Karangwa, the Director of Domestic Trade at MINICOM, disclosed this information during a press briefing. The crackdown follows complaints from farmers across Rwanda regarding difficulties in selling their maize harvests despite a bumper crop in the concluded Agricultural Season A 2024. Reports from the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources indicate a significant increase in maize production, with estimates reaching 446,460 metric tonnes compared to 390,879 metric tonnes in the previous season.




Farmers attribute their struggles to a lack of authorized buyers, allowing middlemen to exploit the situation by purchasing maize at prices below those set by MINICOM. Jean Nepo Nsabimana, head of the "Twiteze Imbere Musha" cooperative in Musha Sector, Rwamagana District, explained that while the prices offered by middlemen are lower than official rates, selling to them remains preferable to incurring losses. Karangwa emphasized the necessity for buyers to possess the requisite licenses and certificates registered with the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) to engage in maize trading. He warned of severe penalties for those found in violation of these regulations.




The fines imposed vary according to the extent of the offense. Buyers operating without district permits face fines of Rwf 500,000, while those purchasing small quantities below recommended prices are subject to penalties of Rwf 150,000. Additionally, fines for purchasing maize below the set prices escalate based on the quantity purchased, ranging from Rwf 300,000 for a three-ton truck to Rwf two million for loads exceeding ten tones. In February, MINICOM adjusted maize prices to reflect moisture content, with threshed grains valued at Rwf400 per kilogram for moisture levels between 13.5 and 18 percent, and Rwf350 per kilogram for levels between 19 and 25 percent. Minimum purchase prices for maize cobs vary based on moisture content, ranging from Rwf311 to Rwf260 per kilogram.

The enforcement of stringent regulations by MINICOM aims to protect farmers from exploitation and ensure fair market practices in the maize trade. By holding middlemen accountable and establishing clear price guidelines, the ministry seeks to promote transparency and stability in Rwanda's agricultural sector.

RWANDA NATIONAL POLICE INTRODUCES CUTTING-EDGE DRIVING E-TESTING SYSTEM TO ENHANCE ROAD SAFETY

03:52, 2024-03-15

The Rwanda National Police’s Department of Testing and Licensing unveiled a revolutionary Driving eTesting System on Wednesday, March 13, poised to redefine license service delivery, enhance transparency, and elevate road safety standards across the nation.

Located at the Busanza driving license test center in Busanza, Kicukiro district, this innovative system represents a significant leap forward in driving assessment technology. Seamlessly integrating GPS technology, car motion tracking formulas, and virtual line plotting technology, it aims to automate and enhance the traditional method of assessing driving skills. The GPS system embedded within the eTesting System enables precise real-time tracking of the vehicle's location and movement. This, combined with the Car Motion Tracking Formula, which analyzes driving parameters such as acceleration, braking, and steering dynamics, provides a comprehensive evaluation of a driver's proficiency.




Moreover, the system incorporates Virtual Line Plotting Technology, generating virtual lines and markers on the road to guide examinees during tests. These markers ensure adherence to designated paths and promptly detect any violations, bolstering the accuracy of assessments.




How it Works

Candidates must first register on Irembo to apply for a driving license, ensuring the accuracy of their personal details. Subsequently, they undergo a health evaluation, including a physical examination and fingerprint verification. Finally, they proceed to the driving test conducted at a yard equipped with sensors facilitating communication between the driver and examiner in the control room.

The test yard encompasses three categories: small cars, big cars, and motorbikes, enabling candidates to practice for various driving categories. Each category presents a predefined circuit, including challenges such as slopes, obstacles, roundabouts, parking, and gear shift changing areas. For motorbike tests, drivers navigate through eight design obstacles, zigzag through narrow roads, and execute an emergency stop before reaching the finish line. Clear instructions are provided via a computer interface before the sensors activate automatically to initiate the evaluation process.




Transparency and Efficiency

Addressing the media, Senior Superintendent Gad Ntakirutimana, the Director of Technology in the Testing and Licensing Department, emphasized the system's commitment to high-quality service delivery and transparency. He highlighted the efficiency of the eTesting System, enabling individuals to complete the test within one hour, thereby minimizing disruptions to their daily activities.

Ntakirutimana reassured the public regarding concerns about bribery and corruption, affirming that the automated system significantly reduces opportunities for favoritism or disparities caused by personal gains. Examinees will receive detailed feedback, including marks, failures, and errors leading to mark deductions, without implicating any individuals within the Police force.




"Innovations such as the Driving eTesting System mark a pivotal step towards enhancing road safety and streamlining license service delivery in Rwanda," stated Ntakirutimana.

With its implementation, the Rwanda National Police aims to not only modernize the testing process but also instill confidence in the fairness and integrity of the licensing system, ultimately contributing to safer roads and communities nationwide.

GUNMEN DEMAND 1 BILLION NAIRA FOR THE RELEASE OF KIDNAPPED STUDENTS IN NIGERIA

05:10, 2024-03-14

Gunmen who abducted 286 students and staff from a school in northern Nigeria last week have demanded a staggering sum of 1 billion naira ($620,432) for their release, as confirmed by a spokesman for the families of the hostages and a local councillor, according to Reuters. The abduction took place on March 7 in the town of Kuriga, located in Nigeria's northwestern Kaduna State, marking the first mass kidnapping in the country since 2021. Jubril Aminu, a community leader acting as a spokesman for the families of the hostages, revealed that the kidnappers made the ransom demand during a phone call he received on Tuesday.




"They made a total of a 1 billion (naira) ransom demand for all the pupils, students, and staff of the school," Aminu disclosed. "They gave an ultimatum to pay the ransom within 20 days, effective from the date of the kidnap. They said they will kill all the students and the staff if the ransom demand is not met."




Idris Ibrahim, an elected official from the Kuriga Ward municipal council, corroborated the ransom demand and its amount, highlighting the urgency of the situation. He assured that security forces were taking "adequate measures" to secure the release of the students, though immediate comments from Samuel Aruwan, commissioner of internal security and home affairs in Kaduna State, were unavailable. In response to the crisis, President Bola Tinubu's position, as communicated by Information Minister Mohammed Idris, emphasizes the imperative for security forces to ensure the safe return of the hostages without succumbing to ransom demands.

"The president has directed that security agencies must as a matter of urgency ensure that these children and all those who have been kidnapped are brought back to safety and also in the process ensure that not a dime is paid for ransom," Idris stated.




Tinubu's administration has taken a firm stance against ransom payments, reflecting legislation introduced by the previous administration, which imposes jail time for individuals found paying ransoms. Notably, the ransom demand for the Kuriga students and school staff surpasses $2,000 per hostage, exceeding Nigeria's annual per capita income, according to International Monetary Fund data. Efforts are underway to address the situation, with authorities striving to secure the safe release of the abducted individuals and bring the perpetrators to justice. However, the ordeal underscores the persistent threat of kidnapping in Nigeria and the urgent need for effective measures to safeguard the nation's citizens.

These upcoming encounters promise to deliver another round of exhilarating basketball action as teams vie for supremacy in the league.

THE TIKTOK CONUNDRUM FACING BAN OR SALE AMIDST LEGISLATIVE PRESSURE.

04:26, 2024-03-14

TikTok, the wildly popular social media platform, is once again at the center of a storm as lawmakers in Washington advance a bill that could potentially lead to a nationwide ban on the app. The recent legislation, passed by the House, puts ByteDance, TikTok's China-based owner, in a tight spot, giving it an ultimatum: sell off its stakes in TikTok or face prohibition within six months of the bill’s enactment. This is not rare to social platforms as Swedish Spotify was once brought under check shortly before Mark and the team at Meta to was at the center for a Q&A of accountability and safety.




The House Bill: Options and Implications.




The crux of the legislation presents ByteDance with a binary choice: either relinquish control of TikTok through divestment or risk seeing the platform banned entirely from the United States. Should ByteDance opt for divestment, TikTok could continue its operations stateside under the condition that it is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary, as determined through an inter-agency process led by the President. Additionally, ByteDance would be mandated to forfeit control of TikTok's renowned algorithm, a pivotal component driving user engagement through personalized content delivery.

However, experts foresee substantial challenges for ByteDance in executing a sale within the stipulated timeframe, adding a layer of complexity to the situation.




On the other hand, if ByteDance chooses not to sell, TikTok would face exclusion from major app stores and web-hosting services until a divestment occurs, as outlined in the bill.

Concerns and Allegations

The backdrop of the legislative action is a backdrop of persistent concerns voiced by lawmakers, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies regarding potential data security risks associated with TikTok's Chinese ownership. Skepticism regarding the possibility of Chinese authorities coercing ByteDance into sharing user data of the platform's vast American user base looms large, fueled by China's stringent national security laws. TikTok has vehemently refuted allegations of being a tool for Chinese government surveillance and has consistently denied any data sharing with Chinese authorities. Notably, the lack of concrete evidence provided by the U.S. government to substantiate these claims adds complexity to the debate. Beyond security apprehensions, critics have also raised concerns about potential content censorship favoring Beijing. While TikTok denies such allegations, recent warnings from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence suggest that the platform may have been utilized by the Chinese government for influencing U.S. elections, further intensifying scrutiny.




The Road Ahead

Despite the House's passage of the bill, its fate hinges on the Senate's decision. While President Joe Biden has expressed readiness to sign the bill into law if passed, uncertainties loom over its prospects in the Senate, where similar initiatives have encountered obstacles.

Should the bill progress further, ByteDance would have a 180-day window to find a qualified buyer for TikTok. However, the potential for legal challenges from TikTok, which has previously contested attempts at banning the platform, adds an element of uncertainty to the outcome. The social media finds itself navigating turbulent waters as legislative pressures mount, with its future in the U.S. contingent upon the outcome of political and legal deliberations. The saga underscores the complex intersection of technology, geopolitics, and national security in the digital age, with TikTok serving as a focal point in this evolving landscape.













PRESIDENT PAUL KAGAME ENDORSES RAILA ODINGA FOR AFRRICAN UNION TOP JOB

15:04, 2024-03-13

President Paul Kagame of Rwanda has thrown his support behind Kenyan politician Raila Odinga's bid for the chairmanship of the African Union Commission. Odinga, a prominent figure in Kenyan politics and leader of the opposition coalition Azimio, is one of the two candidates vying for the prestigious position. The endorsement came following a meeting between Kagame and Odinga on March 8th, where they discussed matters of regional and continental importance while Odinga was on his visit in Kigali.

This comes in handy for the long time failing politician as his former opponent and now Kenyan President Ruto accompanied him to rally support from his patron in Uganda, a week before he would fly to Rwanda to gunner yet another East Africa's backing which in the reflection makes him a front runner.




Speaking to Kenyan broadcaster NTV, Kagame expressed his admiration for Odinga, stating, "I respect Raila Odinga; I know his struggles." Kagame highlighted Odinga's previous role as the AU High Representative for Infrastructure Development from 2018 to 2023, praising his performance and depth of understanding in the position.

"He did a good job of that, [and had] full grasp of it. We will give him our support, and wish him well," Kagame affirmed. He further pledged ongoing support for Odinga's endeavors, emphasizing the importance of Africa's success under his leadership.This it's self is visible with the support Odinga has from most if not all former heads of governments like Olusegan Obassanjo of Nigeria, UhuruKenyatta of Kenya and many others.

Odinga, who announced his candidacy for the AU chairmanship in February, has garnered significant backing from various African leaders. Notably, he has secured support from Tanzania's President Samia Suluhu, South Sudan's Salva Kiir, Kenya's William Ruto, and Uganda's Yoweri Museveni. This widespread endorsement underscores the confidence in Odinga's leadership abilities and vision for the African Union.

The African Union Commission, the administrative arm of the AU, plays a crucial role in implementing the organization's agenda and policies. The chairperson of the commission is elected by the general assembly for a four-year term, renewable once. With the upcoming elections in February 2025, Odinga's candidacy represents a pivotal moment for the continent. While Odinga faces competition from Somalia's former foreign minister, Fawzia Yusuf Adam, he stands out as a seasoned politician with extensive experience in Kenyan politics. Son of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, Kenya's first vice president, Raila Odinga has been actively involved in politics since the 1970s. He served as Kenya's prime minister from 2008 to 2013 and has contested the presidency multiple times.




Despite facing electoral setbacks, including a loss in the 2022 presidential race to William Ruto, Odinga remains a formidable figure in African politics. His bid for the AU chairmanship reflects his commitment to advancing continental integration, development, and governance. As the race for the AU Commission chairmanship intensifies, Odinga's candidacy symbolizes a new chapter in Africa's quest for effective leadership and collective progress. With Kagame's endorsement and widespread support from across the continent, Odinga emerges as a frontrunner poised to steer the African Union towards greater cohesion and prosperity.













DIGITAL GOVERNANCE FOR SOCIAL INCLUSION AND SUSTAINABLE DEV'T: INSIGHTS FROM THE AFRICA E-GOVERNANCE CONFERENCE

14:40, 2024-03-13

The Africa e-Governance Conference, held at the Kigali Convention Centre from March 12 to 14, brought together public and private sector leaders across the continent to delve into the critical issues surrounding digital governance. Under the theme "Digital Governance for Social Inclusion and Sustainable Development," the conference served as a pivotal platform for discussions on leveraging digital transformation for the betterment of African societies.




Among the prominent voices at the conference was Paula Ingabire, Rwanda's Minister of ICT and Innovation, who emphasized the importance of robust data protection and privacy measures in digital governance frameworks. Ingabire underscored the need to safeguard individuals' data and rights amidst the rising tide of digital transformation sweeping across Africa.

"It’s essential that the digital governance frameworks include robust data protection and privacy measures to safeguard individuals’ data and rights," remarked Ingabire during her address.

Highlighting the challenges faced by many African countries in aligning digital transformation efforts with national economic objectives, Ingabire called for progressive and agile regulations to facilitate seamless digital governance and inclusion continent-wide. She stressed the significance of enhancing infrastructure readiness and ensuring that citizens possess the requisite digital skills to thrive in the digital economy.




"Alongside the right frameworks, we need multidimensional approaches to ensuring that people have the right digital skills and means to thrive in the digital economy," added Ingabire.

Ingabire outlined Rwanda's commitment to enhancing digital governance as a catalyst for economic growth and poverty reduction. She emphasized how technology not only facilitates efficient business transactions and public service accessibility but also drives innovation that transforms essential public services such as transportation, healthcare, and education, thereby improving citizens' quality of life.




Israel Bimpe, CEO of Irembo, provided insights into Rwanda's digital journey and the challenges encountered in fostering cross-border thinking and enhancing citizen-government interaction.

"If you are doing business, if you are travelling, if you are trading, anything that you are trying to do and where you need an interaction with government, I think the digitisation journey has to lead us to that level," explained Bimpe.

Adeyinka Adeyemi, the convener of Africa e-Governance, expressed gratitude to the Government of Rwanda and the Ministry of ICT for their support in hosting the conference. Adeyemi stressed the importance of deploying technology for inclusive governance that uplifts all citizens, especially those at the bottom of the pyramid, to realize Africa's full potential.




The Africa e-Governance Conference serves as a crucial platform for fostering connection, learning, sharing, and collaboration between governments and the ICT industry in Africa. With a focus on leveraging digital governance for social inclusion and sustainable development, the conference aims to drive positive change across the continent and pave the way for a brighter digital future for all Africans.

10:23, 2024-03-13

In a significant stride toward enhancing the gaming landscape in Sierra Leone, BetPawa, a renowned mobile sports betting brand, declared its arrival in the country on Wednesday, March 6th. The announcement, made at the Lor Restaurant in Freetown, marked the brand's entry into its 12th African nation. Representatives from BetPawa, including Mchezo Managing Director Ntoudi Mouyelo, BetPawa Chief Brand Officer Spencer Okach, and Sierra Leone Franchisee Thomas Nsongka of LionBets & Fastwins Ltd, gathered to greet members of the press and the public.




At the heart of their message was BetPawa's commitment to fostering a friendly and responsible betting environment. Mouyelo expressed the brand's enthusiasm for being part of Sierra Leone's gaming community, highlighting their dedication to building trust among sports enthusiasts and casino players alike, echoing the success they've achieved in other African countries.

Minister of Youth Affairs Mohamed Bangura, representing the government, extended a warm welcome to BetPawa, emphasizing the potential economic benefits and the brand's role in supporting sports development in Sierra Leone. He underscored the alignment between betPawa's presence and the government's initiatives for job creation and youth empowerment, foreseeing a substantial contribution to the nation's economic prosperity.

AMERICA BRACES FOR HISTORIC SEQUEL: BIDEN VS. TRUMP

04:21, 2024-03-13

In a twist of fate reminiscent of past political showdowns, Joe Biden and Donald Trump have emerged as the protagonists in the sequel to the 2020 election saga. With their parties' nominations secured, the stage is set for a rematch that harkens back to a bygone era of American politics. The last time the nation witnessed such a presidential rematch was in 1956, when Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower triumphed once again over Democratic challenger Adlai Stevenson. This historical precedent, set over six decades ago, adds a layer of nostalgia to the impending Biden-Trump showdown.

Drawing parallels to another era, Grover Cleveland holds the unique distinction of serving as both the 22nd and 24th President of the United States. His electoral victories in 1884 and 1892 underscore the enduring nature of political rivalries and the cyclical nature of American democracy.




As the nation braces for the sequel to the 2020 election drama, enthusiasts of both politics and cinema may find themselves drawing comparisons to iconic film sequels. While some hope for an outcome akin to the critically acclaimed "The Godfather II," others fear a fate reminiscent of the less favorably received "The Godfather III."

Nevertheless, the Biden-Trump rematch is poised to join the ranks of historical analogues that have shaped the nation's political landscape since its founding. Sixty-eight years ago, Eisenhower's resounding victory over Stevenson in 1952 set the stage for an even larger landslide in their subsequent rematch, cementing his legacy in American history.




As the curtain rises on this momentous sequel, Americans find themselves once again immersed in a narrative that transcends mere politics, embodying the essence of democracy and the enduring spirit of the nation.

IS IT POLITICS OR FINANCES,:BURUNDI'S DYNAMO PULLS OUT OF BAL.

03:41, 2024-03-13

In an unexpected turn of events, Dynamo Basketball Club (Burundi) has made the difficult decision to forfeit its participation in the 2024 Basketball Africa League (BAL) season. This announcement, made by BAL President Amadou Gallo Fall, comes amidst a series of disputes regarding the club's compliance with league regulations.

The primary issue at hand revolves around Dynamo Basketball Club's refusal to adhere to BAL's rules and requirements concerning jerseys and uniforms, which the Burundian side raised their opposition to cladding on anything branded with one of BAL's partners VISIT RWANDA. As a result, the team forfeited its scheduled game against Petro de Luanda (Angola) and consequently, its entire participation in the current BAL season.




Under FIBA rules, two forfeitures within the same tournament automatically trigger a club's withdrawal, further solidifying Dynamo Basketball Club's exit from the competition. This decision not only impacts the players directly involved but also disappoints fans who were eagerly anticipating the team's performance on the court.

The recent forfeiture isn't an isolated incident. It follows Dynamo Basketball Club's previous refusal to comply with league regulations, resulting in a similar outcome during their game against FUS Rabat Basketball (Morocco) on Sunday, March 10. This pattern of non-compliance underscores broader challenges within the BAL structure.

Interestingly, speculation arises linking this unexpected development to the ongoing tensions between Rwanda and its neighbor, Burundi, particularly concerning the conflict in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). While details remain scarce, some suggest that underlying political tensions may have influenced Dynamo Basketball Club's decision to withdraw from the league.




Despite this setback, the BAL remains committed to the integrity of the competition. All remaining Kalahari Conference games will proceed as scheduled, providing an opportunity for other teams to showcase their talent and compete at the highest level. Additionally, the league aims to engage fans in Pretoria through expanded fan and community events, fostering a sense of unity and excitement surrounding African basketball.

As the BAL navigates through this challenging period, stakeholders remain hopeful that future seasons will see smoother operations and a renewed focus on fair play and sportsmanship.













RAMADHAN: A PILLAR IN ISLAM, A JOURNEY OF SPIRITUAL RENEWAL.

04:44, 2024-03-12

As the crescent moon graces the night sky, millions of Muslims around the globe eagerly anticipate the arrival of Ramadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar. Beyond its symbolic fasting rituals, Ramadhan is a profound journey of self-discovery and spiritual rejuvenation. For Muslims, Ramadan represents more than mere abstinence from food and drink; it's a transformative experience that transcends the physical realm. It's a time to draw closer to Allah, to reflect on one's actions and intentions, and to seek forgiveness for past transgressions.




At the heart of Ramadhan lies the concept of empathy and compassion. Fasting fosters a deep sense of solidarity with the less fortunate, reminding believers of the plight of those who struggle with hunger and deprivation on a daily basis. Through acts of charity and kindness, Muslims strive to embody the values of generosity and benevolence that lie at the core of Islam. Moreover, Ramadan is a period of intense spiritual introspection. The pre-dawn prayers, known as Suhoor, offer a serene opportunity for quiet contemplation and connection with the divine. As the sun sets and the call to Maghrib prayer echoes through the air, Muslims gather with their loved ones to break their fast, sharing in the blessings of communal unity and gratitude.

Throughout the month, Muslims engage in increased acts of worship, including reading the Quran, performing additional prayers, and seeking spiritual guidance through reflection and supplication. It's a time to seek inner peace and enlightenment, to purify the soul, and to strengthen one's relationship with Allah.




As Ramadhan draws to a close, the joyous occasion of Eid al-Fitr awaits, marking the culmination of a month-long journey of devotion and self-discipline. Muslims come together in celebration, offering prayers of thanksgiving and sharing in the blessings of fellowship and goodwill. In essence, Ramadhan is a sacred tapestry woven with threads of faith, humility, and perseverance. It's a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the boundless mercy of the Almighty. As Muslims embark on this spiritual odyssey, they embrace the opportunity for growth, renewal, and divine grace, reaffirming their commitment to the path of righteousness and compassion.

PRESIDENT KAGAME AND LOURENCO MEET TO ADRESS EASTERN DR CONGO CONFLICT

04:15, 2024-03-12

President Paul Kagame of Rwanda and his Angolan counterpart Joao Lourenço convened in Luanda on Monday, March 11, to discuss the security situation in eastern DR Congo, as reported by Village Urugwiro. Kagame's visit to Luanda, part of a one-day working visit, underscored the urgency of addressing the root causes of the conflict in the region. During their bilateral discussions, the two heads of state emphasized the importance of upholding the Luanda and Nairobi processes to achieve lasting peace and stability. Lourenço, serving as the mediator between Rwanda and DR Congo, has played a pivotal role in facilitating diplomatic efforts to address the crisis, particularly in the eastern region where government forces are combating M23 rebels.




The meeting comes amid mounting calls from various governments and international organizations to return to the negotiating table and prevent the conflict from escalating into a regional crisis. Despite calls for a political resolution, the Congolese government has faced criticism for prioritizing military operations over peace processes.

Notably, Lourenço recently hosted Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi for discussions on the eastern DR Congo crisis, underscoring the regional significance of finding a sustainable solution. Tensions between Rwanda and DR Congo have escalated, with Tshisekedi accusing Rwanda of supporting M23 rebels—a charge vehemently denied by Kigali.




In response, Rwanda has raised concerns about the integration of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a UN-sanctioned militia implicated in the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, into the Congolese armed forces. The presence of the FDLR poses a significant security threat to both Rwanda and Congolese Tutsi communities. Efforts to revive the Luanda process, aimed at addressing the underlying causes of the conflict, gained momentum following a meeting chaired by Lourenço in Addis Ababa on February 16. President Kagame stressed the need to address the issue of FDLR integration into the Congolese army as part of a comprehensive solution.




The situation in eastern DR Congo remains precarious, with over 130 armed groups operating in the region despite multiple intervention attempts. As regional leaders continue to engage in diplomatic efforts, the imperative to find a lasting solution to the protracted conflict grows ever more urgent.

U.S. MILTARY FLIEN IN TO REINFORCE SECURITY AT THE EMBASSY IN HAITI AMID RISING GANG VIOLENCE.

03:53, 2024-03-12

Amid escalating gang violence in Haiti, the U.S. military has taken measures to enhance security at the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince and facilitate the departure of nonessential personnel, the U.S. Southern Command announced on Sunday. Aircraft were deployed to the embassy compound to bolster security, with helicopters playing a pivotal role in the operation. Emphasizing the nature of the operation, the Southern Command clarified that "no Haitians were on board the military aircraft," aiming to dispel any speculation regarding the departure of senior government officials amidst the deteriorating security situation.




The embassy, situated in a neighborhood largely controlled by gangs, has become a focal point of concern amid the escalating violence. The decision to reinforce security and facilitate the departure of nonessential personnel aligns with standard practices for embassy security augmentation worldwide, according to the Southern Command statement. While longstanding factors such as poverty, colonial legacies, deforestation, and external interference are often cited as root causes of Haiti's challenges, experts point to a more immediate factor: the increasing reliance of Haitian rulers on street gangs.




Decades without a standing army or a well-equipped national police force, coupled with intermittent international interventions, have left the Haitian state weakened. In the absence of robust political institutions, armed civilians have been co-opted as instruments of power, creating a vacuum that gangs are now exploiting.

Gang leaders have assumed a surreal level of influence, even holding news conferences and positioning themselves as stakeholders in discussions about the country's future. This dynamic underscores the urgent need for effective governance and security reforms to address Haiti's deep-rooted challenges and prevent further escalation of violence.




As Haiti grapples with the complex interplay of internal and external factors shaping its security landscape, the reinforcement of security measures at the U.S. Embassy reflects the gravity of the situation and the importance of safeguarding diplomatic missions amidst the unfolding crisis.




How did Haiti get here?

A 1990s embargo was imposed after the military overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The embargo and the international isolation devastated the country’s small middle class, said Michael Deibert, author of “Notes From the Last Testament: The Struggle for Haiti,” and “Haiti Will Not Perish: A Recent History.”




After a U.S.-backed U.N. force pushed out the coup’s leaders in 1994, a World Bank-sponsored structural adjustment led to the importation of rice from the U.S. and devastated rural agricultural society, Deibert said. Boys without work flooded into Port-au-Prince and joined gangs. Politicians started using them as a cheap armed wing. Aristide, a priest-turned-politician, gained notoriety for using gangsters.

RWANDA'S GDP GROWTH REACHES 8.2% IN 2023, DRIVEN BY SERVICE SECTOR

03:32, 2024-03-12

Rwanda's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) sored by 8.2 per cent to Rwf 16,355 billion in 2023, according to the latest data released by the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) on Monday, March 11. This remarkable growth was largely propelled by the services sector, which expanded by 11 per cent, accounting for 44 per cent of the total GDP.

"The significant growth in the services sector reflects our ongoing efforts to promote innovation and efficiency in key areas such as information and communication activities, air transport, as well as hotels and restaurants," remarked Yusuf Murangwa, Director General of NISR. "We have witnessed increased activity in calling and internet usage, which have been primary drivers behind this exceptional growth."




Meanwhile, the industry and agriculture sectors also posted solid growth rates of 10 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively. The industry sector contributed 22 per cent to the GDP, driven by notable expansions in manufacturing and construction activities, which recorded growth rates of 11 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively.

"Manufacturing has been a key driver of economic growth, with significant improvements seen across various sub-sectors," noted Minister of Finance and Economic Planning Uzziel Ndagijimana. "We are particularly encouraged by the growth in food processing, textiles, clothing, leather goods, chemicals, rubber, plastic products, and wood, paper, and printing."




Addressing reporters, Minister Ndagijimana attributed the poor agricultural performance to adverse climate conditions but expressed optimism about future investments to enhance tea production and ensure competitive prices in the market.

The GDP growth of 8.2 per cent surpassed the government's initial projection of 6.2 per cent for 2023, indicating a stronger-than-expected economic performance. However, Minister Ndagijimana expressed concerns over the growing depreciation of the Rwandan franc against major foreign currencies, citing the country's external trade imbalance as a contributing factor.

"Last week, the Rwandan Franc experienced a marginal depreciation of 0.2 per cent against the US Dollar, with the year-to-date depreciation reaching 1.7 per cent," stated Minister Ndagijimana. "This trend underscores the need for strategic measures to address forex demand and stabilize the currency amidst economic growth."




Overall, Rwanda's impressive GDP growth in 2023 reflects the resilience and dynamism of its economy, despite challenges posed by external factors such as adverse climate conditions and currency depreciation.

RWANDA-UGANDA POWER TRADING PARTNERSHIP REDUCES RELIANCE ON DIESEL PLANTS

05:16, 2024-03-11

As Rwanda continue in the first lane to ensure all household connectivity to electricity, developments continue to emerge the latest being the partnership in power trading between Rwanda and Uganda has led to a notable reduction in Rwanda's reliance on diesel power plants. This shift follows the successful synchronization of the Shango-Mbarara Interconnection, marking a pivotal milestone in regional energy collaboration.

The project facilitating power exchange between the two nations involves the construction of the Shango Substation and the Mirama-Shango 220kV Transmission Line, spanning 93.5 kilometers to link Rwanda with Uganda. Power trading operations commenced in October 2023, prompting Rwanda to decommission all diesel power plants in June 2023.




Minister of Infrastructure, Jimmy Gasore, emphasized the strategic significance of this shift, stating, "We recently began importing power from Uganda as needed. The Rusumo hydropower plant has also contributed significantly. This influx of power has drastically reduced our reliance on diesel-based electricity generation, necessitating the shutdown of diesel power plants."




Facilitated by a 220kV transmission line, power exchange between Rwanda and Uganda is managed by Rwanda Energy Group (REG). A statement from REG revealed that the tie line is bi-directional, allowing both countries to import or export electricity as required. Plans are underway to upgrade its capacity to 250 MVA in 2024.

Moreover, Rwanda's power grid is interconnected with Uganda, Burundi, Eastern DRC, and Tanzania. Additional projects aim to establish interconnections with the DRC and Burundi. The successful synchronization of power grids between Burundi, Rwanda, and Tanzania has already been accomplished, marking significant progress in regional energy integration.




Jacob Manyuon Deng, the regional power program officer for the Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action Programme (NELSAP-CU), highlighted the financial benefits of the collaboration, revealing that Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL) receives an average of $1.5 million monthly from Rwanda.

The overarching goal of power interconnection projects is to enhance electricity access, reduce costs, stabilize networks, promote cross-border trade, foster competition, and support clean energy initiatives. As regional energy collaboration progresses, stakeholders are optimistic about the transformative impact on socio-economic development and environmental sustainability across the region.

Furthermore, the completion of the Rusumo Falls Hydroelectric Project is poised to bolster energy collaboration among Burundi, Rwanda, and Tanzania, facilitating power trade and regional development. The Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed between the Rusumo Project and utilities of the three countries operates on a 'take or pay model,' ensuring sustainable power distribution and economic viability.

WHAT ELSE DON'T WE KNOW ?: UN REPORT HIGHLIGHTS ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE DURING HAMAS-LED ATTACKS ON ISRAEL

04:56, 2024-03-11

As very many allegations and unconfirmed stories linger concerning the Hamas attack on Israel last year, the need for independent investigations was deemed viable to answer some of the unknown atrocity question of ''what else don't we know''

This looks like is turn around with the United Nations' report released on Monday 7 Jan, that shed light on allegations of sexual violence said to have occurred in multiple locations during the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on October 7. The report, authored by the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. Pramila Patten, acknowledged signs of sexual crimes committed by Hamas and other terrorist organizations. It pointed to a pattern of rape, torture, and sexual abuse, marking the first time a UN official has specifically addressed such allegations.

''For the first time, a UN official has specifically acknowledged the sexual crimes committed by Hamas and other terrorist organizations on 7 October. The UN also recognizes that the crimes were committed simultaneously in different locations and point to a pattern of rape, torture and sexual abuse'' Said the Israeli official.




Israel welcomed the UN report's recognition of sexual crimes committed by Hamas. However, it rejected the report's call to investigate Palestinian claims regarding "sexual violence by Israeli elements," viewing it as an attempt to create an unwarranted equivalence between the crimes committed by Hamas and baseless allegations against Israel. The report also acknowledged ongoing sexual crimes against Israeli hostages held by Hamas and called for their immediate release. Israel emphasized its commitment to freeing the hostages and expressed reservations about cooperating with the Commission of Inquiry of the Human Rights Council (COI), citing perceived hostility towards Israel.




In response to the report's findings, Israel called for the immediate convening of the Security Council to designate Hamas as a terrorist organization and impose international sanctions. The report's release coincides with International Women's Day, serving as a reminder of the importance of advocating for women's rights and combatting violence against women worldwide.

The report's revelations highlight the need for continued efforts to address sexual violence in conflict zones and promote a safe and sustainable world for women and humanity at large.

HONORING THE ORIGINS OF INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY: A CELEBRATION OF EMPOWERMENT

05:16, 2024-03-08

International Women's Day (IWD), celebrated annually on March 8th, holds profound significance in commemorating the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women worldwide. As we embrace this momentous occasion, it's crucial to reflect on the origins of this globally recognized event and the remarkable individuals who paved the way for its inception.

The roots of International Women's Day trace back to the early 20th century, amidst a backdrop of burgeoning feminist movements and socio-political unrest. The idea for a day dedicated to women's rights first emerged at the turn of the century, as women across the globe began demanding greater equality and recognition for their contributions to society.




One pivotal moment in the history of International Women's Day occurred in 1908 when 15,000 women marched through the streets of New York City, advocating for shorter working hours, better pay, and voting rights. This landmark event, organized by the Socialist Party of America, laid the groundwork for future advocacy efforts and ignited a spark of activism that reverberated across continents.

The following year, in 1909, the first National Women's Day was observed in the United States on February 28th, inspired by the New York garment workers' strike. The event garnered widespread attention and inspired women in other countries to join the fight for their rights.




The momentum continued to build, and in 1910, during the International Conference of Working Women held in Copenhagen, Denmark, German socialist Clara Zetkin proposed the establishment of an annual International Women's Day. Zetkin's impassioned plea resonated with delegates from over 17 countries, who unanimously agreed to adopt her proposal. Thus, on March 19, 1911, millions of women and men from Austria, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland, among other nations, participated in the inaugural International Women's Day. Their collective efforts aimed to promote women's suffrage, labor rights, and social justice, setting a precedent for future generations of activists. Over the years, International Women's Day has evolved into a global phenomenon, with people from diverse backgrounds coming together to celebrate the achievements of women and advocate for gender equality. Each year, the day is marked by a theme that reflects pressing issues facing women and girls worldwide, from gender-based violence to economic empowerment and political representation.




Today, International Women's Day serves as a poignant reminder of the ongoing struggle for gender equality and a call to action for all individuals to champion women's rights in their communities and beyond. As we honor the legacy of those who fought tirelessly for women's liberation, let us recommit ourselves to the pursuit of a more equitable and inclusive world for future generations. In the words of Clara Zetkin, "The working women and girls have the same right to justice as the working men and boys. And it is not just about 'equality,' but also about our shared humanity and dignity."

Let us celebrate International Women's Day with reverence for its rich history and unwavering dedication to the advancement of women's rights. Together, we can build a brighter, more equitable future for all.

ONGOING GAZA CEASE-FIRE NEGOTIATIONS: CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS

04:08, 2024-03-08

Hamas announced Thursday that its delegation had left Cairo, signaling a temporary halt in talks on a Gaza cease-fire and the release of hostages. This development makes it increasingly unlikely that mediators will broker a deal before the onset of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, expected to begin on Sunday evening.

President Biden had expressed hope for a swift resolution to the Israel-Hamas conflict before Ramadan and urged both parties to reach a deal. However, Egyptian officials reported an impasse in negotiations, primarily due to Hamas' insistence on a phased process leading to the end of the war. Despite this setback, there remains a possibility of a deal being reached before Ramadan, which serves as an informal deadline for mediators.




"Hamas refuses to commit to and give guarantees regarding the cease-fire, the return of the displaced, and withdrawal from the areas of its incursion," said Hamas spokesman Jihad Taha. "But the talks are ongoing and will resume next week."




Efforts by the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar to broker a six-week cease-fire and secure the release of hostages have encountered challenges. A U.S. official revealed the existence of a framework deal, which includes Hamas releasing hostages considered vulnerable. Vice President Kamala Harris underscored the urgency of the situation, labeling it a "humanitarian catastrophe" and calling for an immediate cease-fire.

"The situation in Gaza is dire, and there must be an immediate cease-fire for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table," Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized.

The main terms of a potential agreement have been agreed upon by Hamas as a first stage. However, Hamas seeks commitments that this agreement will lead to a more permanent cease-fire in the future.




"Hamas has agreed on the main terms of such an agreement as a first stage, but it wants commitments that it will lead to an eventual, more permanent cease-fire," noted Egyptian officials.

Israel's stance on Hamas' demands remains firm, with a public rejection of releasing top militants and resuming the offensive after any cease-fire to dismantle Hamas.




"We will not release top militants serving life sentences or halt our operations until Hamas is dismantled," stated Israeli officials.

As tensions persist and negotiations continue, the looming start of Ramadan adds further complexity to the situation. Historically, the holy month often sees heightened Israeli-Palestinian tensions, particularly concerning access to major holy sites in Jerusalem.

Despite the challenges, mediators remain engaged in pressing both parties to soften their positions and seek a mutually acceptable resolution. The outcome of these negotiations will have significant implications for the stability and security of the region in the coming weeks and months.

CHINESE AMBASSADOR TO RWANDA SUPPORTS PEACE EFFORTS IN EASTERN DR CONGO

04:32, 2024-03-07

Wang Xuekun, the Chinese ambassador to Rwanda, has reiterated China's support for the ongoing peace initiatives in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), emphasizing the importance of the Nairobi and Luanda peace processes.

Since May 2022, eastern DR Congo has been plagued by renewed fighting between the Congolese government coalition and the M23 rebel group. In a press conference held in Kigali on Tuesday, February 5, Ambassador Wang discussed the developments in the region, highlighting China's backing for the African Union's (AU) efforts to achieve peace through diplomatic channels.




The resurgence of the M23 rebellion has brought attention to the complex conflict landscape in eastern DR Congo, which is further compounded by the presence of over 200 armed groups, including the genocidal militia group, FDLR (Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda). Founded by former Rwandan government forces and militia involved in the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, FDLR remains a significant destabilizing force in the region.

The Luanda and Nairobi peace processes have been instrumental in bringing together leaders from DR Congo, Rwanda, and other African nations to seek a political resolution to the conflict. However, despite previous meetings and diplomatic efforts, tangible progress has been limited.




The Summit held in Luanda on November 23, 2022, addressed the security crisis in eastern DR Congo and called for the immediate disarmament and unconditional repatriation of FDLR fighters. Although a deadline of November 30, 2022, was set for FDLR's disarmament and repatriation to Rwanda, the group failed to meet the conditions, highlighting the challenges of implementing peace agreements in the region. Ambassador Wang's remarks underscore China's commitment to supporting peace and stability in eastern DR Congo through multilateral initiatives such as the Luanda and Nairobi processes. As the international community continues to seek solutions to the conflict, diplomatic efforts remain crucial in addressing the root causes of instability and promoting lasting peace in the region.













NIKKI HALEY SUSPENDS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, CLEARING PATH FOR TRUMP'S 2024 REPUBLICAN NOMINAATION.

04:19, 2024-03-07

Former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley has announced the suspension of her presidential campaign, effectively clearing the path for Donald Trump to secure the 2024 Republican nomination unopposed. In a statement released Wednesday morning, Haley expressed gratitude for the opportunity to amplify the voices of Americans but emphasized that she had no regrets about her decision to step aside. While congratulating Trump on his likely nomination, Haley stopped short of endorsing him, urging him to earn the support of Republicans and independent voters who previously backed her.




“I have always been a conservative Republican and always supported the Republican nominee,” Haley stated. “But on this question... Margaret Thatcher provided some good advice when she said, ‘Never just follow the crowd. Always make up your own mind.’ It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him, and I hope he does that.”

As the sole woman in the Republican race and Trump's final major GOP rival, Haley campaigned on her foreign policy expertise and general election appeal, positioning herself as a candidate capable of broadening the Republican base. Despite being the first challenger to announce her bid against Trump, Haley faced challenges in appealing to the base that overwhelmingly supports the former president.




Although Haley secured victories in only two nominating contests, notably in D.C. and Vermont, her strength among suburban women and independents remained evident throughout her campaign. Highlighting hypothetical head-to-head polls where she led President Biden by a significant margin, Haley underscored her potential appeal to crucial voting demographics in the general election. Haley's decision to suspend her campaign comes after Super Tuesday, where Trump secured landslide victories in the majority of contests, further solidifying his lead in the race for the Republican nomination.

With Haley's exit, Trump now stands unopposed as the presumptive Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election, signaling a clear path ahead for his campaign.

TAIWAN ISSUES APOLOGY OVER LABOR MINISTER'S CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS ON INDIAN MIGRANT WORKERS

03:29, 2024-03-07

Taiwan's recent foray into potential recruitment from India's northeast region took an unexpected turn when Labor Minister Hsu Ming-chun's remarks ignited controversy. In an interview with Yahoo TV, Minister Hsu's comments suggesting recruitment based on shared traits such as skin color, diet, and religion were met with widespread criticism and accusations of racial insensitivity.

The fallout prompted Taiwan's foreign ministry to issue a formal apology, acknowledging the inappropriate nature of the comments and pledging to undertake corrective measures. The incident has cast a spotlight on the importance of diplomatic communication and cultural sensitivity in international relations, particularly in matters as sensitive as labor mobility and migration.




Against the backdrop of a newly inked labor mobility agreement between Taiwan and India, aimed at addressing Taiwan's labor shortages and enhancing economic cooperation, the incident raises concerns about potential ramifications on bilateral relations. With India being a key player in Taiwan's strategy to diversify economic and political alliances, the fallout from Minister Hsu's comments underscores the need for careful handling of such matters to prevent diplomatic strains. Despite the misstep, the incident presents an opportunity for both nations to reaffirm their commitment to mutual respect and understanding. Taiwan's swift response and apology demonstrate a willingness to address concerns and maintain strong ties with India amidst geopolitical complexities.




Moving forward, Taiwan and India must work to mitigate the impact of the incident on bilateral relations, emphasizing the importance of respectful engagement and cultural sensitivity. As they continue to explore avenues for collaboration, the incident serves as a reminder of the need for clear communication and mutual respect in navigating the intricacies of international diplomacy.

TRUMP LEADS BIDEN NOW, BUT COULD HIS LEGAL ISSUES CHANGE THINGS?

17:19, 2024-03-05

As the nation geared up for Super Tuesday, a critical juncture in the political calendar, the latest News opinion poll provides invaluable insights into the state of the electorate. With Donald Trump maintaining a lead over President Biden nationally, the dynamics among key voting demographics are coming into focus, shaping the trajectory of the upcoming election. Black and Hispanic Voters: Evaluating Support and Skepticism. Among some of the Democratic Party's most crucial constituencies, Black and Hispanic voters, there exists a complex interplay of support and skepticism towards President Biden. While a significant majority of Black voters still intend to cast their ballots for Mr. Biden, there's a noticeable decline in his support compared to the 2020 election. Conversely, President Trump has made inroads among Hispanic voters, narrowing the margin between him and Mr. Biden.

Central to this dynamic is the issue of financial improvement under a Biden presidency. Many within these communities harbor doubts about whether their economic circumstances would see tangible enhancements with another term for Biden. This skepticism may prove influential in shaping their electoral choices come November.




Women Voters: A Crucial Bloc with Nuanced Preferences.

Women voters, long considered a stronghold for the Democratic Party, continue to play a pivotal role in shaping electoral outcomes. While Mr. Biden maintains a lead among women, it's worth noting that his margin of support has diminished since the 2020 election. Issues such as abortion rights and concerns about the state of democracy appear to bolster support for Biden among women voters. The intersection of gender and policy preferences becomes evident in the polling data. Women who prioritize issues such as abortion rights and the protection of democratic institutions overwhelmingly support Mr. Biden. However, those for whom economic concerns take precedence tend to lean towards President Trump, highlighting the multifaceted nature of women's voting behavior.




Young Voters: A Generation with Varied Concerns

As a demographic with significant potential to shape electoral outcomes, young voters remain a focus of political analysis. While a majority continue to express support for Mr. Biden, concerns about his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict have emerged as a prominent issue. Many young voters advocate for a change in approach from the Biden administration, particularly urging him to take a more assertive stance in encouraging Israel to cease its military actions in Gaza.

This nuanced perspective among young voters underscores the diversity of opinions within this demographic. While aligned in their overall preference for Mr. Biden, there exists a diversity of concerns and priorities that could influence their engagement in the electoral process.

Implications for the Future

As the nation hurtles towards the general election, the evolving dynamics among key voting groups will undoubtedly shape the contours of the political landscape. With shifting allegiances and nuanced preferences, candidates will need to navigate a complex terrain to secure electoral success. As Super Tuesday approaches, the nation braces for a pivotal moment in its democratic journey, where the voices of diverse constituencies will converge to determine the path forward.




Evangelical voters: They continue to be some of Trump's strongest supporters (like they often are for Republicans)

The Republican front runner, Trump continues to command a comparable level of support among White evangelical voters as he did during the 2020 election. This demographic, known for its strong religious affiliations, largely views the overturn of Roe v. Wade as a positive development for the nation. While many within this group may not directly attribute the reversal of Roe v. Wade to Trump, they hold a favorable retrospective view of his presidency. Moreover, there is a prevailing sentiment among White evangelicals that Trump possesses a vision for the country that resonates with their own beliefs and values.




White non-college voters: A big majority remember the economy being better under Trump

This particular demographic, comprising White voters without a college degree, has traditionally leaned towards supporting the Republican Party over the years. However, since Trump's presidential campaign in 2016, their allegiance to the GOP has strengthened even further.

An overwhelming majority, seven in ten, of White voters without a college degree perceive the economy as having fared better under Trump's administration. Unsurprisingly, the economy ranks as the top concern for this group.

In addition to economic issues, border security holds significant importance for them. A notable nine in ten individuals within this demographic believe that the implementation of Trump's policies would result in a decrease in the number of migrants attempting to cross into the U.S.




Men and seniors




These groups have voted for the Republican candidate in recent presidential elections. Trump is currently getting their support. Mr. Biden will look to make some inroads here to keep the margins relatively close.

Some swing-y groups

White voters with college degrees have been trending more toward Democrats in recent elections. Mr. Biden narrowly won this group in 2020 and he does have an edge in CBS News polling with this group now. 

The suburbs are key to who wins national elections. Our latest CBS News national poll shows Trump with an advantage over voters who tell us they live in suburbs. The 2020 national exit polls had Mr. Biden narrowly ahead of Trump in places designated as suburbs. Mr. Biden does currently have an edge with suburban women. 

When they look back, more suburban voters remember the economy more fondly during the Trump years than they rate it now.







Independents: What will they do?

In the latest polling data, Trump emerges as the preferred choice among independent voters. A larger portion of independents view Trump's presidency more favorably in retrospect compared to their assessment of Mr. Biden's tenure thus far.

However, when considering Trump's eligibility to serve as president post-conviction, a majority of independents lean towards the opinion that he would not be fit for office, contrasting with those who believe he would be suitable.

Regarding the prospect of a 2020 candidate rematch, independents express lukewarm enthusiasm at best. A greater proportion of independents describe the potential match-up as "negative" or "depressing" compared to both Democrats and Republicans.
















The majority of Trump's current supporters express the belief that the former president remains capable of serving, even in the event of conviction on charges he faces. Conversely, a minority asserts that he would not be fit for office under such circumstances. Notably, approximately three in ten respondents indicate that their assessment of his fitness would hinge on the specific nature of the charges leveled against him.

These individuals primarily align with Trump to oppose President Biden rather than out of genuine affinity for the former president. Consequently, their support for Trump appears somewhat less steadfast compared to other segments of his base.

These insights stem from a recent CBS News/YouGov survey, which drew from a nationally representative sample of 2,159 U.S. adult residents interviewed between February 28 and March 1, 2024. Additionally, the analysis incorporates data borrowed from the 2020 national exit poll conducted by CBS News.













RWANDA, JAPAN FORGE A PATH TOWARDS EDUCATIONAL TRANSFORMATION WITH A FRW 118 BILLION BOOST LOAN.

15:18, 2024-03-05

In a monumental stride towards the advancement of Rwanda's education sector, the Government of Rwanda and Japan have sealed a significant financing agreement. This agreement, aimed at bolstering the educational framework and policy restructuring, was formalized through the exchange of Notes between Dr. Uzziel NDAGIJIMANA, the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning for Rwanda, and His Excellency Fukushima Isao, the Ambassador of Japan.




The exchange of Notes signifies a commitment to a policy loan for the education sector, amounting to 14 billion Japanese Yen, approximately equivalent to FRW 118 billion. This structured concessional loan is poised to revolutionize education by catalyzing digital transformation, improving operational efficiency at primary and secondary education levels, and nurturing conducive teaching environments within technical colleges. The ultimate aim is to ensure equitable access to high-quality education for all Rwandan citizens. Minister NDAGIJIMANA expressed gratitude for Japan's partnership in this endeavor, emphasizing the timeliness of the agreement in advancing Rwanda's educational transformation. "We are more than delighted and grateful that our partners in Japan have decided to join us in this move to enhance the quality of education for all," remarked Dr. NDAGIJIMANA. He highlighted the multifaceted impact of the financing, outlining plans to enhance school infrastructure, elevate teacher training programs, and bolster the school feeding initiative.




Ambassador Fukushima underscored the rigorous evaluation process undertaken before extending this significant loan to Rwanda. "This being the first ever substantial loan we are extending to Rwanda, we can assure you that there was a great deal of assessment before this loan could be released by my Government," affirmed H.E. Fukushima. The meticulous scrutiny reflects Japan's commitment to ensuring the effective utilization of funds for Rwanda's educational advancement.




The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), represented by Ms. Minako SHIOTSUKA, the Chief Representative, has been a steadfast partner in Rwanda's educational journey. JICA's contributions, including the development of training materials, capacity-building for teacher trainers, and organization of study workshops and science fairs, have significantly enhanced the effectiveness of science and mathematics education in Rwanda. Ms. SHIOTSUKA expressed optimism about the loan's potential to address existing deficiencies in both rural and urban schools. "We are hoping this will indeed raise the pedigree of deficiencies that we have often surveyed not only in village schools but also Kigali schools," remarked Ms. SHIOTSUKA.




This financing agreement marks a pivotal moment in Rwanda's pursuit of educational excellence. With unwavering support from Japan, Rwanda is poised to embark on a transformative journey that will empower generations to come with the knowledge and skills needed to thrive in a rapidly evolving world.













GHANA PARLIAMENT PASSES CONTROVERSIAL BILL RESTRICTING LGBTQ RIGHTS

04:55, 2024-03-04

Ghana's parliament has voted to pass a controversial bill aimed at severely restricting LGBTQ rights, sparking condemnation from rights activists and concerns about human rights setbacks.

Sponsored by a coalition of religious and traditional leaders, the legislation garnered favor among most lawmakers and was approved in parliament on Wednesday. The bill targets individuals engaging in LGBTQ sexual acts, as well as those advocating for the rights of gay, lesbian, or other non-conventional sexual or gender identities, threatening them with imprisonment.

"This 'Human Sexual Rights and Family Values' bill represents a significant setback for human rights," expressed activist groups, urging President Nana Akufo-Addo's government to reject the legislation.




Despite opposition from rights advocates, the bill enjoys widespread support in Ghana. President Akufo-Addo has affirmed his stance against gay marriage, declaring it will never be permitted during his tenure.

Dubbed the "anti-gay bill," it found sponsorship from a coalition comprising Christian, Muslim, and traditional Ghanaian leaders, garnering substantial backing among members of Parliament.

While gay sex is already illegal in Ghana, discrimination against LGBTQ individuals persists. Notably, no one has ever been prosecuted under the colonial-era law. However, the new bill proposes stricter penalties, with imprisonment ranging from six months to three years for those involved in LGBTQ sexual acts. Additionally, individuals found promoting, sponsoring, or supporting LGBTQ+ activities could face imprisonment for three to five years under the bill's provisions.

Despite international calls for respect of LGBTQ rights and concerns about human rights violations, the bill's passage highlights the challenges faced by LGBTQ individuals in Ghana and underscores the ongoing struggle for equality and acceptance.




This comes as a strong statement from African nations as they continue to send a clear message for what they believe in as culturally, morally and religious wise.

TANZANIA AND ETHIPIA SIGN BILATERAL AGREEMENTS, STRENGTHENING TIES Across VARIOUS SECTORS

04:18, 2024-03-04

Tanzania and Ethiopia have solidified their bilateral relations through a series of agreements covering agriculture, trade, energy, and air transport, accompanied by exchanges in aviation technology. The signing ceremony, graced by Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Friday, marks a pivotal moment in enhancing cooperation and fostering economic growth between the two nations. In a statement released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, both leaders expressed their commitment to deepening trade and bilateral relations, with a focus on creating new opportunities for commerce between Tanzania, home to over 61 million people, and Ethiopia, boasting a population exceeding 100 million.




Tanzania's Minister for Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, January Makamba, emphasized the significance of the agreements in opening up new markets and spurring investment and trade, particularly in vital sectors like coffee and tea. He remarked, "Ethiopia is globally renowned for coffee and tea production, Tanzania’s tea and coffee are equally popular, therefore, how to access markets together will be an integral part of bilateral agreements during this visit."

Makamba underscored the history of collaboration between Tanzania and Ethiopia in the aviation sector, noting, "Ethiopian Airlines and Air Tanzania have been operating through joint commercial operations." He also highlighted the role of Ethiopia in providing training to Tanzanian pilots and engineers, stating, "A total of 75 pilots and 25 engineers from Tanzania received training at various levels in Ethiopia between 2016 and 2023."




Addressing the cooperation in power generation, Makamba emphasized Tanzania's endeavor to seek expertise from Ethiopia in establishing hydroelectric power stations and implementing irrigation and land use technologies. He stated, "The Tanzanian government has been seeking experts from Ethiopia to advise and help it set up hydroelectric power stations as well as irrigation and land use technology for higher production of electricity, crops and quality livestock products." Furthermore, both countries affirmed their commitment to combatting human trafficking involving Ethiopian nationals. Tanzania, in collaboration with Ethiopia and international immigration bodies, is actively working to dismantle trafficking networks. Makamba added, "Tanzania has been collaborating with Ethiopia and other international immigration bodies to destroy human trafficking networks."




Prime Minister Abiy's visit to Tanzania, which commenced on Thursday, is anticipated to conclude on Saturday, symbolizing the mutual dedication of Tanzania and Ethiopia to fortify their bilateral relations and foster shared prosperity.

RWANAIR TO SUSPENDED MUMBAI FLIGHTS AS PART OF SERVICE IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY

03:37, 2024-03-04

National carrier RwandAir has announced the suspension of all flights to and from Mumbai, effective March 15, as part of its continuous service improvement strategy, according to an official statement.

Andrew Best Owie, RwandAir's acting Chief Commercial Officer (CCO), explained the decision, stating,




"RwandAir started this route seven years ago and has continuously sought new ways to improve its service delivery. Hence, the need to source and deploy the right product to serve our esteemed passengers on the route has necessitated our action for now. Our present constraint to operate a non-stop flight to India is a major challenge which the airline hopes to resolve in the nearest future with the right product in place."




Regarding the potential impact on RwandAir's business and plans to mitigate it, Owie emphasized, "The airline is always assessing its routes to ensure we are optimizing our network in line with customer demand. Therefore, we have the right network optimization strategy in place. Hence, you can be assured that this has no wider effect on our operations." RwandAir currently operates flights to more than 20 cities across Western, Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. In Africa, destinations include Abuja, Accra, Bangui, Brazzaville, Bujumbura, Cape Town, Cotonou, Dar es Salaam, Douala, Entebbe, Harare, Johannesburg, Kilimanjaro, Lagos, Libreville, Lusaka, and Nairobi.




In Europe, the airline serves Brussels, London, and Paris, while its Asian destinations include Dubai, Guangzhou, and Mumbai (which will be suspended from March 15).

RwandAir's decision to suspend Mumbai flights underscores its commitment to enhancing service quality and efficiency in its operations, ensuring a positive experience for passengers across its extensive network. This comes shortly after African carriers’ traffic grew 38.7 percent in 2023, compared with the year before, ahead of Latin and North American and European airlines, The East African reports.

According to the International Air Transport Association (Iata) data, the year was marked by a strong industry-wide recovery, with a rebound of domestic and international travel.




“The full year 2023 capacity was up 38.3 percent and load factor climbed 0.2 percentage points to 71.9 per cent, the lowest among regions,” said Iata.

Traffic from Asia-Pacific airlines maintained the strongest year-over-year rate among the regions.

“Despite political and economic challenges, 2023 saw air cargo markets regain ground lost in 2022 after the extraordinary Covid peak in 2021. Although full-year demand was shy of pre-Covid levels by 3.6 percent, the significant strengthening in the past quarter is a sign that markets are stabilising towards more normal demand patterns,” said Mr Willie Walsh, Iata director-general.

“That puts the industry on a very solid ground for success in 2024. But, with continued —and in some cases intensifying — instability in geopolitics and economic forces, little should be taken for granted in the months ahead.”

FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP SECURES GOP WINS IN IDAHO, MISSOURI, AND MICHIGAN

03:20, 2024-03-04

President Donald Trump continues to solidify his path towards the GOP nomination, securing victories in caucuses held in Idaho and Missouri, along with sweeping the delegate haul at a party convention in Michigan this past Saturday.

Trump's dominance was evident as he amassed every delegate at stake during the weekend contests, bringing his delegate count to 244, compared to 24 for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. With a requirement of 1,215 delegates to clinch the Republican nomination, Trump's current lead places him in a formidable position within the party. Looking ahead on the Republican calendar, the next pivotal event is scheduled for Sunday in the District of Columbia, followed by Super Tuesday, where 16 states are set to hold primaries, marking the largest day of voting outside of the November election. Trump's momentum positions him favorably to secure the nomination shortly thereafter.

However, the challenges facing Haley became evident during the caucus in Columbia, Missouri, where Seth Christensen's attempt to rally support for her was met with skepticism from some attendees. Despite efforts to garner backing for Haley, her performance in Boone County, where she secured only 37 of the 263 Republicans in attendance, underscores the significant obstacles she faces in competing against Trump.

Here's a breakdown of the results from Saturday's contests:




MICHIGAN

Michigan Republicans convened at their convention in Grand Rapids to allocate 39 of the state's 55 GOP presidential delegates. Trump emerged victorious, claiming all 39 allocated delegates.

However, a notable portion of the party's grassroots force abstained from the gathering due to lingering tensions stemming from a dispute over the party's leadership. Trump's resounding victory in Michigan's primary earlier in the week, where he secured 68% of the vote compared to Haley's 27%, further solidified his support within the state.The delegate allocation process in Michigan was complicated by the state government's actions, as Democrats, who control the state, moved Michigan into the early primary states, contravening the rules set by the national Republican Party.




MISSOURI

In Columbia, Missouri, voters eagerly lined up outside a church, the venue for the caucuses. Upon entering, they were met with appeals from supporters of various candidates, highlighting the diverse engagement within the Republican electorate.

With these victories, Trump's position as the frontrunner for the GOP nomination remains unchallenged, signaling a continuation of his dominance within the party's ranks as the primary season unfolds.

"Every 100 days, we're spending $1 trillion, with money going all over the world. Illegals are running across the border," Tom Mendenall, an elector for Trump in 2016 and 2020, said to the crowd. He later added: "You know where Donald Trump stands on a lot of these issues."

Christensen, a 31-year-old from Columbia who came to the caucus with his wife and three children age 7, 5, and 2, then urged Republicans to go in a new direction.

"I don't need to hear about Mr. Trump's dalliances with people of unsavory character, nor do my children," Christensen said to the room. "And if we put that man in the office, that's what we're going to hear about all the time. And I'm through with it."

Supporters quickly moved to one side of the room or the other, depending on whether they favored Trump or Haley. There was little discussion between caucus goers after they chose a side.

This year was the first test of the new system, which is almost entirely run by volunteers on the Republican side.

The caucuses were organized after GOP Gov. Mike Parson signed a 2022 law that, among other things, canceled the planned March 12 presidential primary. Lawmakers failed to reinstate the primary despite calls to do so by both state Republican and Democratic party leaders. Democrats will hold a party-run primary on March 23.

Trump prevailed twice under Missouri's old presidential primary system.




IDAHO

Last year, Idaho lawmakers passed cost-cutting legislation that was intended to move all the state's primaries to the same date in May. But the bill inadvertently eliminated the presidential primaries entirely. The Republican-led Legislature considered holding a special session to reinstate the presidential primaries but failed to agree on a proposal in time, leaving both parties with presidential caucuses as the only option.

"I think there's been a lot of confusion because most people don't realize that our Legislature actually voted in a flawed bill," said Jessie Bryant, who volunteered at a caucus site near downtown Boise. "So the caucus is really just the best-case scenario to actually get an opportunity to vote for a presidential candidate and nominate them for the GOP."

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION CONSIDERS RULE TO PREVENT DOMESTIC ABUSERS FROM TRACKING VICTIMS VIA CONNECTED VEHICHELS.

04:13, 2024-02-29

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is contemplating a new rule that could potentially thwart domestic abusers from tracking their victims through wirelessly connected vehicles. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has initiated the process of drafting regulations aimed at safeguarding survivors of domestic abuse from technological exploitation.




Rosenworcel emphasized the necessity of ensuring that survivors of domestic abuse do not face the harrowing choice between surrendering their vehicles and ensuring their safety. Many modern vehicles come equipped with convenience features that utilize telecommunications to facilitate tasks such as locating cars in parking lots, remotely starting engines, and connecting with emergency responders. However, these same features can be exploited by abusers to monitor the movements of their victims.

The initiative follows the congressional directive for the FCC to implement the "Safe Connections Act," which empowers the agency to assist abused partners. Previous regulations mandated by the agency compelled cell service providers to sever phone lines associated with family plans if an abuser is identified on the account.

Now, the FCC is exploring whether the Safe Connections Act grants it the authority to impose similar measures on automakers. Jonathan Uriarte, a spokesman for Rosenworcel, underscored the commission's commitment to comprehensively assessing existing processes and addressing any gaps in protecting survivors of abuse.




If approved, the proposed rule would undergo a period of public and industry commentary, allowing stakeholders to provide input on connected car services. This move comes in the wake of Rosenworcel's outreach to nine major U.S. automakers, seeking information about their connected car systems and strategies to support individuals who have been victimized by domestic abusers.

The responses received varied, with some automakers offering options for partners to disconnect vehicles from manufacturer or cell phone apps, while others lacked comprehensive solutions. For instance, Toyota and Ford committed to removing access to vehicle location information upon request from an abused partner, with Ford additionally offering in-vehicle touch screen controls to disable location data and connectivity altogether.




However, certain automakers were less explicit about such options, prompting further scrutiny from the agency. Rosenworcel's inquiries were sparked by a report in The New York Times highlighting the weaponization of connected cars in abusive relationships.

As the FCC continues its deliberations, the potential rule holds promise for empowering survivors of domestic abuse and bolstering their ability to reclaim autonomy and safety in their lives.

CLOSURE OF IRMCTT KIGALI OFFICE MARKS END OF ERA, CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT WITH RWANDA

03:35, 2024-02-29

After nearly three decades of operation in Rwanda, the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT) has announced the closure of its Kigali field office, effective August 31. The decision, revealed by the mechanism’s registrar Aboubacar Tambadou during a press conference in Kigali on Thursday, February 15, marks a significant milestone in the country's post-genocide journey.

Tambadou cited the completion of the mechanism’s mandate in handling cases related to the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi as the primary reason for the closure. He emphasized that with the conclusion of the case against Felicien Kabuga last year, the last remaining fugitive on the IRMCT’s wanted list, the need for the Kigali field office had diminished.




"Following the arrest of Kabuga in 2020 and the confirmation of the death of Augustin Bizimana and Protais Mpiranya, the mechanism’s work of tracking and bringing fugitives to justice entered its final phase," Tambadou stated.

However, Kabuga's trial encountered an unexpected setback in 2023 when it was indefinitely suspended due to his deemed inability to stand trial, highlighting the complexities inherent in international justice processes.




Tambadou reassured that while the Kigali office will close, the IRMCT remains committed to its engagement with Rwanda, albeit through its Arusha branch. He underscored the continuation of vital services such as the protection of witnesses, emphasizing the importance of ongoing collaboration between the mechanism and Rwandan authorities. Moreover, discussions and consultations have commenced with Rwandan officials regarding the transition and handover of certain responsibilities from the mechanism to either the government or non-governmental entities. This marks a crucial phase in ensuring the seamless continuation of essential services and the consolidation of gains made in advancing justice and accountability in Rwanda.




The closure of the IRMCT Kigali office represents the culmination of a long and arduous journey in pursuit of justice for the victims of the 1994 genocide. While signaling the end of an era, it also underscores the enduring commitment to fostering reconciliation and healing in Rwanda, as the country continues its path towards peace and stability.

PARIS OLYMPICS ORGANISERS GRAPPLE WITH OPEN WATER SWIMMING CHALLENGES

03:17, 2024-02-29

With the countdown to the Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games underway, organisers are facing a daunting challenge: ensuring the safety and feasibility of open water swimming events in the historic yet often polluted waters of the Seine River. Recent cancellations of test events due to water quality concerns have raised serious doubts about the viability of hosting such competitions in the iconic waterway.




Last August, marathon swimming test events had to be scrapped as a result of dangerously high pollution levels in the Seine, forcing the cancellation of swimming legs in triathlon and para-triathlon tests as well. Despite these setbacks, Paris officials remain steadfast in their commitment to hosting the events in the Seine, with no alternative plans in place. The proposed course for the men's and women's 10-kilometre events offers a picturesque route, starting at the renowned Pont Alexandre-III and winding past Parisian landmarks such as the Musee d'Orsay and the Eiffel Tower. While intended to showcase the city's beauty, the choice of venue also carries significant political symbolism, as Parisian mayors have long pledged to make the Seine suitable for swimming.




However, fulfilling this promise has proven elusive. Despite improvements in water quality, samples collected in 2023 failed to meet European standards for swimming, primarily due to high levels of faecal matter. Heavy rainfall exacerbates the issue, leading to spikes in bacteria levels as untreated wastewater and debris flow into the river from drains and sewers. Efforts to address water quality concerns include significant investments in cleaning projects, yet challenges persist. Valve malfunctions in the sewage system have been cited as a cause of elevated pollution levels during test events, highlighting the complexity of managing environmental risks in urban waterways.




For athletes, navigating the uncertainties surrounding water quality is not unfamiliar, as open-water competitions often entail inherent risks. Despite assurances from organisers and ongoing mitigation efforts, concerns linger over the potential impact of adverse weather conditions on event safety. As preparations for the Paris Olympics continue, the fate of open water swimming events remains uncertain. While organisers remain resolute in their commitment to hosting the competitions in the Seine, the specter of pollution and environmental challenges looms large, underscoring the need for robust contingency plans and proactive measures to safeguard athlete welfare and ensure the success of the games.

FORMER ARMY CHIEF APPOINTED HIGH COMMISSIONER TO TANZANIA IN DIPLOMATIC SHUFFLE

04:54, 2024-02-28

In a strategic move aimed at bolstering diplomatic ties, Rwanda has appointed former Army Chief and Minister of Internal Security, Gen Patrick Nyamvumba, as the High Commissioner to Tanzania, pending official approvals. The decision was made during a recent cabinet meeting held on Tuesday, February 27, where several key diplomatic appointments were announced. Gen Patrick Nyamvumba brings a wealth of experience to his new role, having served in various capacities both within Rwanda and on the international stage. Born on June 11, 1967, Gen Nyamvumba previously held the position of Minister of Internal Security from November 2019 to April 2020. Prior to that, he distinguished himself as the Chief of Defence Staff of the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF).




His extensive career includes notable assignments such as serving as the Force Commander of the AU-UN Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) from 2009 to 2013, where he played a crucial role in peacekeeping efforts in Sudan. A graduate of the Nigerian Defence Academy, Gen Nyamvumba's tenure in the RDF has seen him occupy various leadership roles, including commanding infantry forces, presiding over the Rwanda Military Academy, and holding key positions in logistics and operations planning.

FORMER OPPOSITION LEADER MAMADOU OURY BAH APPOINTED AS PRIME MINISTER OF GUINEA

03:38, 2024-02-28

In a significant development for the political landscape of Guinea, transitional authorities within the junta-led government have announced the appointment of Mamadou Oury Bah, a former opposition leader and economist, as the country's new prime minister. The decree, which was broadcasted on national television on Tuesday, Jan 27, marks a pivotal moment as Guinea navigates through a period of transition and uncertainty.

Mamadou Oury Bah, also known as Bah Oury, is no stranger to the intricacies of Guinean politics, having been a prominent figure since the early nineties. His appointment comes at a critical juncture as the nation grapples with deep economic challenges and widespread discontent, exemplified by the ongoing indefinite general strike launched in protest against the perceived oppressive policies of the military authorities.




The swearing-in ceremony, captured on television, showcased Bah taking the oath of office in the presence of interim President Mamady Doumbouya, the special forces commander who seized power from former President Alpha Conde in a coup in 2021. As Bah assumes his new role, he faces the formidable task of assembling a government capable of addressing the pressing issues confronting the nation.

Bah's political journey has been marked by various roles and challenges, including serving as the minister of reconciliation in a consensus government following a political crisis triggered by violent protests in 2007. However, his tenure has not been without controversy, as he spent four years in exile in France and faced legal proceedings in absentia for an alleged assassination attempt against Conde in 2011.




Despite his return to Guinea in 2016 following a presidential pardon, Bah's relationship with the UFDG party, of which he was a founder and vice president, soured, leading to his eventual departure. In recent years, he has been scrutinized for his alignment with the junta, raising questions about his political affiliations and priorities.

As Mamadou Oury Bah assumes the mantle of prime minister, the eyes of Guinea and the international community will be closely watching his leadership and the trajectory of the country's political and economic future. His ability to navigate the complexities of governance and foster unity amidst challenges will be crucial in shaping Guinea's path forward.

HOUSE SPEAKER'S DECISION HOLDS UKRAINE'S FATE IN BALANCE

03:28, 2024-02-28

In a pivotal moment for democracy and global stability, House Speaker Mike Johnson finds himself at the center of a crucial decision with far-reaching consequences. While the fate of the United States may weather the storm of upcoming elections, the fate of Ukraine hangs precariously in the balance, with Johnson wielding the power to make a decisive impact. The stakes are high as Ukraine continues to grapple with the aftermath of Russian aggression, facing dire shortages in crucial resources like ammunition while teetering on the brink of further escalation in the conflict. With signs pointing to a potential shift in the balance of power, the role of international support in bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities has never been more critical.




Johnson, a Louisiana Republican who assumed leadership amidst a turbulent political landscape, holds the key to alleviating Ukraine's plight and safeguarding its sovereignty. By allowing a vote on a bill encompassing $60 billion in aid deemed essential by the Pentagon for Kyiv's defense efforts, Johnson could provide vital support at a pivotal juncture. Despite the likelihood of bipartisan support for such a measure, Johnson's hesitation reflects broader dynamics within the GOP, including the influence of former President Donald Trump and a shifting ideological landscape.




The reluctance to prioritize global democracy and security underscores the complex interplay of political forces shaping Johnson's decision-making process. However, the consequences of inaction loom large, as Ukraine's struggle for survival as an independent nation hangs in the balance. Johnson's leadership in this critical moment will not only impact the trajectory of the conflict but also serve as a litmus test for America's commitment to upholding democratic values on the global stage.




As the world watches and waits for a resolution, Johnson's decision holds profound implications for Ukraine's future and the broader landscape of international relations. The choice to prioritize democracy and security over political expediency will be a defining moment in Johnson's tenure as House Speaker and a testament to America's enduring commitment to standing with allies in times of need.

IMMINENT FAMINE CRISIS UNFORLDS IN NORTHERN GAZA AMID ONGOING CONFLICT

03:18, 2024-02-28

In a dire warning issued by the World Food Programme on Tuesday, the situation in northern Gaza has been deemed critical, with famine looming as a harsh reality. Since January 23, no humanitarian group has been able to provide aid to this region, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian emergency. The ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas has further complicated efforts to address the unfolding crisis.




According to reports, at least 576,000 people in the Gaza Strip, comprising a quarter of the population, are on the brink of famine, as revealed by a senior UN aid official addressing the Security Council. Without immediate action, the official warned that widespread famine could become "almost inevitable," underscoring the urgent need for intervention. Efforts to broker a cease-fire in Gaza have faced setbacks, with both Israel and Hamas downplaying the likelihood of an imminent breakthrough in talks. US President Joe Biden's announcement that Israel would consider pausing its offensive during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, contingent upon a deal to release hostages, has yet to yield significant progress.

The toll of the conflict is staggering, with the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza reporting at least 29,878 people killed and 70,215 wounded in Israeli strikes, a significant portion of whom are children and women. The recent Hamas-led attacks on October 7 claimed around 1,140 lives, according to Israeli officials, with hundreds more taken hostage.




The dire situation in Gaza extends beyond the immediate impact of the conflict, with UN officials highlighting the widespread food insecurity plaguing the entire population. Aid efforts have been hampered by logistical challenges, with reports of aid trucks being shot at, looted, and overwhelmed by desperate crowds.

UN humanitarian coordinator Ramesh Ramasingham underscored the gravity of the situation, warning of further deterioration if immediate action is not taken. He highlighted the alarming rates of acute malnutrition and wasting among children under the age of two in northern Gaza, painting a grim picture of the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the region.

As the conflict rages on and humanitarian needs escalate, urgent international attention and action are required to address the imminent famine crisis and alleviate the suffering of the people of Gaza.

TRAGEDY STRIKES: NINE KILLED IN SOUTH AFRICAN ROAD CRASH AFTER ANC ELECTION RALLY

03:57, 2024-02-26




A day of political fervor and anticipation turned into tragedy on Sunday as nine people lost their lives in a devastating road crash in South Africa. The incident occurred following an election rally attended by President Cyril Ramaphosa and supporters of the ruling African National Congress (ANC).The fatal crash unfolded as ANC supporters were returning to their home province of Mpumalanga aboard a bus, having participated in Saturday’s rally held in the eastern city of Durban. According to a statement released by the ANC, the bus veered off the road and overturned, claiming the lives of nine individuals.




Police confirmed the grim toll, noting that the accident took place near the small town of Paulpietersburg, approximately 360 kilometers (223 miles) north of Durban. Alongside the fatalities, a further 17 individuals sustained injuries in the crash, as reported by emergency services. Among the injured, several are in critical condition, highlighting the severity of the tragedy. The ANC swiftly mobilized provincial officials to the crash site and hospitals where the injured were receiving treatment, emphasizing the party’s commitment to supporting those affected by the incident.




The road crash cast a somber shadow over the ANC’s vibrant election rally, which saw the official launch of the party’s manifesto at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday. Tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters gathered to witness the event, underscoring the significance of the upcoming May 29 national election.

The looming election poses a critical juncture for the ANC, which has held power in South Africa for three decades since the end of apartheid in 1994. However, opinion polls suggest that the party faces a formidable challenge, with predictions indicating a potential loss of its majority for the first time in its storied history.




As South Africa grapples with the aftermath of this tragic incident, the nation mourns the lives lost and extends its heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims. The road crash serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the need for enhanced safety measures on the country’s roads, especially during times of heightened political activity.

NAMIBIAN PRESIDENT HAGE GEINGOB LAID TO REST WITH DIGINITARIES AND DIGINITY.

03:21, 2024-02-26

Namibia bid farewell to its beloved leader, President Hage Geingob, on Sunday, January 25, as he was laid to rest in the esteemed Heroes’ Acre cemetery following a poignant state funeral. The ceremony, attended by dignitaries from across Africa and beyond, marked the end of an era for the nation. Geingob, a towering figure in Namibian politics, passed away earlier this month at the age of 82, succumbing to cancer while undergoing treatment. His legacy, however, transcends the confines of time, as he leaves behind a profound impact on the trajectory of Namibia since its independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990.




The state funeral, a solemn occasion infused with both reverence and reflection, drew notable figures from around the globe. Among them were the President of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and Princess Anne, sister of Britain’s King Charles III, signifying the international respect accorded to Geingob and his contributions.

Geingob's journey from humble rural beginnings to the presidency resonated throughout the memorial events. His widow, Monica Geingos, delivered a heartfelt tribute during a memorial service held the previous day, celebrating her husband’s remarkable ascent. "You were born a peasant and died a president," she remarked, encapsulating the essence of Geingob’s remarkable life. The funeral procession itself was a poignant display of national pride and reverence. Geingob’s coffin, draped in the Namibian flag, was solemnly carried in a glass case atop a military trailer, symbolizing both his leadership and the unity of the Namibian people in bidding him farewell.




The presence of representatives from 27 countries, including prominent African leaders and global dignitaries, underscored Geingob’s significance on the international stage. Notable attendees included President Steinmeier of Germany, President Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, and heads of state from neighboring countries such as South Africa, Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. President Steinmeier’s address at the memorial service added a poignant note to the proceedings, as he acknowledged Germany's historical responsibility towards Namibia. He expressed the need for Germany to officially apologize for the atrocities committed during the 1904-1908 genocide, wherein tens of thousands of Namibia’s Herero and Nama people were killed by German military forces.




Geingob himself had been a vocal advocate for reparations for the affected communities, emphasizing the importance of acknowledgment and reconciliation. The German government had previously offered Namibia $1.1 billion in development funds as reparations, a proposal that was met with rejection by both the Namibian Parliament and the affected communities, who deemed it inadequate. As Namibia bids farewell to one of its most revered leaders, the legacy of President Hage Geingob lives on, not only in the annals of history but in the hearts and minds of the Namibian people. His unwavering dedication to justice, equality, and progress serves as an enduring beacon for generations to come, guiding the nation towards a brighter future built upon the principles he so fervently upheld.

BEYONCE MAKES IT BIG AS SONG ''TEXAS HOLD EM'' TOPS BILLBOARD HOT COUNTRY CHART.

16:02, 2024-02-23

Beyoncé, often hailed as the queen of the music industry, continues to captivate audiences and break records with her latest single, "Texas Hold Em." Released on February 11, amidst the fervor of the Super Bowl, the song has skyrocketed to the top of the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, marking a historic moment as Beyoncé becomes the first Black woman to achieve this milestone.

With "Texas Hold Em," Beyoncé not only secures her place in country music history but also reaffirms her status as a chart-topping sensation. The track's instant ascent to the top of the Hot Country Songs chart demonstrates Beyoncé's enduring appeal and versatility as an artist.




This achievement adds to Beyoncé's impressive repertoire of accomplishments, as she claims the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the eighth time in her illustrious solo career. Furthermore, her forthcoming album, "16 Carriages," has already made waves in the country music scene, securing the Number 9 spot on the country music chart. "Texas Hold Em" continues to make waves beyond the country music genre, debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, just below Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's latest offering, "Carnival." Beyoncé's influence extends to the broader music landscape, with "16 Carriages" claiming the 38th spot on the Hot 100 chart.

The song serves as the lead single for Beyoncé's upcoming album, a full-fledged country collection slated for release on March 29. Positioned as the 'Act II' of a three-act music project that commenced with the critically acclaimed "Renaissance" album in 2022, "Texas Hold Em" has garnered praise for its homage to the Black roots of country music.




However, amidst the acclaim, "Texas Hold Em" has not been immune to controversy. When the country radio station KYKC rejected a request to play the song, citing its R&B legend status, it sparked a viral sensation with the hashtag #Beyonceiscountry. Station manager Roger Harris's denial of the song's country inclinations fueled debates about genre boundaries in music. Despite the controversy, Beyoncé's impact on music transcends genre labels. She has not only dominated the country charts but also made history as the first woman to lead the R&B/hip-hop charts since their inception in 1958. Additionally, Beyoncé joins the ranks of Taylor Swift as the only second woman to debut at the No. 1 spot on the country song chart.

As Beyoncé continues to push boundaries and redefine musical norms, her influence remains unparalleled, cementing her legacy as a trailblazer and icon in the music industry. With "Texas Hold Em," she not only celebrates country music's rich heritage but also paves the way for future generations of artists to explore new artistic territories.




Though according to Rolling stone one of the most renown country stations published saying, 'the two Beyoncé singles represent the singer’s deepest foray into country music after flirting with the genre for much of her career. “Texas Hold ‘Em” in particular has been a streaming and sales smash, and sits at Number Two on both Spotify and Apple Music’s global and U.S. charts on Thursday. Last week the song garnered about 19 million U.S. streams total. “Texas Hold ‘Em” sold about 39,000 units as well, by far the most traditional sales for any song last week, according to data from Luminate.

“Texas Hold ‘Em” will likely repeat as the top country song on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart next week. It opened at Number Two on the Hot 100 this past week and is a strong contender to dethrone Jack Harlow’s “Lovin on Me” at Number One.

PRESIDENT SALVA KIIR ARRIVES IN RWANDA AMIDST REGIONAL TENSIONS

04:44, 2024-02-23

President Salva Kiir Mayardit, the President of South Sudan and Chairperson of the East African Community (EAC), has embarked on a working visit to Rwanda, arriving in Kigali on Thursday, February 22. Accompanying him is Peter Mathuki, the Secretary-General of the EAC. This visit holds significance against the backdrop of escalating tensions in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), where M23 rebels have engaged in conflict with the Congolese government coalition. The visit of President Kiir to Kigali comes at a time of heightened concern over the situation in eastern DR Congo, particularly as the M23 rebels have made advances towards Goma, the capital of North Kivu Province.




The African Union Commission (AUC) Chairperson, Amb Moussa Faki Mahamat, has expressed deep concern and reiterated calls for a rapid de-escalation of the conflict. Rwanda, in response to allegations by the Congolese government implicating Rwanda in support of the M23 rebels, has urged the United Nations Security Council to exercise caution and not amplify such claims. Kigali has consistently refuted accusations of backing the M23 rebels, emphasizing that the conflict in eastern DR Congo is rooted in internal issues such as governance challenges, ethnic discrimination, and violence within DR Congo itself.




In a statement issued on February 21, the AUC Chairperson emphasized the importance of dialogue among regional leaders, specifically urging the leaders of DR Congo and Rwanda to prioritize dialogue within the frameworks established by President João Lourenço of Angola and Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya. The goal is to reach agreements through collaborative and fraternal means, ensuring the integrity, security, sovereignty, and stability of all states in the region.

Furthermore, the government of Rwanda has expressed concerns about the potential spillover effects of the eastern DR Congo conflict on the Great Lakes Region, particularly as the Congolese government has reportedly abandoned regional peace processes.

The Chairperson of the African Union Commission has also called upon foreign powers to refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of African countries, particularly those in the Great Lakes Region. The statement underscores the necessity of respecting the sovereignty and autonomy of African nations in addressing internal challenges and conflicts.




President Salva Kiir's visit to Rwanda amid these regional tensions highlights the importance of diplomatic engagement and collaborative efforts to address complex issues and promote peace and stability in the African continent. As the Chairperson of the EAC, President Kiir's presence in Rwanda underscores the regional commitment to finding peaceful solutions to conflicts and fostering unity and cooperation among member states.

BOEING OUSTS HEAD OF 737 MAX PROGRAM AMIDST QUALITY CONTROL CONCERNS

03:30, 2024-02-23

In a significant shake-up of its management structure, Boeing Co. has announced the ousting of the head of its 737 Max program, Ed Clark, less than two months after a concerning midair incident that has brought intense scrutiny to the US aircraft manufacturer's manufacturing quality.

Clark, who played a pivotal role in ramping up 737 production following the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, is stepping down immediately after nearly 18 years with Boeing. This announcement, made on Wednesday by the company, marks a swift response to the recent incident and underscores Boeing's commitment to addressing underlying issues.




Stepping into Clark's shoes is Katie Ringgold, who assumes the role of vice president and general manager of the 737 program as well as overseeing Boeing's factory in Renton, Washington. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Lund, the production chief, has been promoted to the newly created position of senior vice president of quality at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Lund will also serve on the executive committee as the chair of the linemaker's quality operations council.




These management changes come in the wake of a crisis triggered by a door plug explosion on a nearly new 737 Max aircraft on Jan. 5. Subsequently, US regulators dispatched inspection teams to Boeing's facilities to assess its quality controls, along with those of the supplier responsible for manufacturing most of the 737 Max's fuselage.

In an unprecedented move, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has imposed restrictions on Boeing, prohibiting the company from increasing production rates for its flagship jet – the 737 Max – until the regulator is satisfied with Boeing's ability to maintain adequate quality control standards across its factories.




The swift action taken by Boeing's management signals a commitment to addressing the underlying concerns regarding manufacturing quality and restoring confidence in the 737 Max program. With new leadership in place, Boeing aims to navigate through this challenging period and regain regulatory approval for increasing production rates, ensuring the safety and reliability of its aircraft remains paramount.

Boeing’s airplane division is working to ensure “that every airplane we deliver meets or exceeds all quality and safety requirements,” Deal said in the memo. “Our customers demand, and deserve, nothing less.”

Lund, a long-time engineering and operations leader, had previously overseen production of all Boeing commercial aircraft. Mike Fleming succeeds her as senior vice president and general manager of airplane programs. He will work closely with Lund to implement quality initiatives and minimize work that has to be redone or performed out of sequence due to late-arriving parts.

Since the blowout, the planemaker and airframe supplier Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. have increased quality checks on the 737, and sought to retool their collaboration to reduce errors.

More changes are in store as FAA readies initial recommendations from an audit of Boeing’s practices that could come as soon as late this month. The agency is also near completion of a report on Boeing’s safety culture that was launched early last year, an outgrowth of the two deadly crashes that led to a global grounding of the 737 Max in 2019. The agency’s findings are expected to inform recommendations for reforms by the company. The regulator also launched an investigation into Boeing after the Alaska accident, and has embedded more staff into Boeing’s factories as part of an enhanced oversight push in the wake of the accident and a string of other quality lapses.




Calhoun is expected to meet with FAA officials in Washington next week, after agency Administrator Mike Whitaker toured Boeing facilities earlier in February. 

Boeing closed 0.9% lower on Wednesday in New York. The shares have tumbled 23% this year, the worst performance among the 30-member Dow Jones Industrial Average.




APR PREPS FOR BASKETBALL AFRICA LEAGUE WITH INTENSIVE FRIENDLY MATCHES IN QATAR

04:38, 2024-02-22

APR Basketball Club is set to kick off its preparations for the upcoming Basketball Africa League (BAL) 2024 with an exciting friendly match against Qatari side Al Wakrah in Doha, Qatar, on Thursday, February 22. The match marks the beginning of a series of intensive training sessions and buildup games aimed at fine-tuning the team's performance ahead of the prestigious tournament.

Under the guidance of head coach Mazen Trakh, APR will engage in a total of five friendly matches during their 10-day training camp in Doha. The lineup includes two games against Al Wakrah, two against Al Rayyan, and a final showdown against Qatar's All Stars Team. These matchups will provide valuable opportunities for the team to test strategies, assess player performance, and build chemistry on the court.




Speaking to Times Sport ahead of the friendly encounters, Coach Trakh emphasized the importance of maximizing player development through increased playing time. "The buildup games will be played in 12-minute quarters, rather than the normal 10-minute quarters," Trakh stated. "This adjustment allows us to get more players involved and develop their skills effectively."

APR's participation in the Sahara Conference of the BAL, scheduled to take place from May 4-12 in Dakar, Senegal, looms large on the horizon. The conference will feature formidable opponents, including Tunisia's US Monastir, AS Douanes of Senegal, and Nigerian Champions Rivers Hoopers. As APR gears up for the competition, these friendly matches serve as crucial opportunities to fine-tune tactics, assess the team's strengths and weaknesses, and build cohesion among players.

The club's management is fully committed to providing the necessary support and resources to ensure the team's success in the upcoming BAL season. With a rigorous training regimen and a series of challenging friendly matches in Qatar, APR aims to make a strong statement in the Sahara Conference and compete at the highest level on the continental stage.




As basketball enthusiasts eagerly await the start of the BAL season, APR's journey in Qatar represents the beginning of an exciting chapter in the club's pursuit of excellence. With determination, skill, and unwavering teamwork, APR looks forward to representing Rwanda with pride and making an impact on the African basketball scene as Champions from Angola, Egypt, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal and Tunisia earned their participation in the 2024 BAL season by winning their respective domestic leagues. Whereas six teams, which come from Burundi, Central African Republic, Libya, Morocco, South Africa and Uganda, secured their tickets through the Road to BAL qualifying tournaments conducted by FIBA Africa across the continent from October to November 2023.

SOUTH AFRICA SET FOR HISTORIC ELECTIONS AS PPRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA ANNOUNCES POLL DATE.

04:14, 2024-02-22

South Africa is gearing up for historic parliamentary elections scheduled for May 29, announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday. The upcoming vote holds significant implications, with opinion polls indicating a potential shift in the country's political landscape, marking a departure from the African National Congress (ANC) party's traditional dominance.




For the first time in South Africa's three decades of democracy, the ANC finds itself polling below 50 percent nationwide. This suggests a potential challenge to the party's longstanding hegemony and raises the prospect of a coalition government if it fails to secure a majority.

The ANC, which has been at the helm of South Africa's government since the country's inaugural free elections in 1994 following the end of apartheid, faces mounting discontent over various issues including escalating violent crime rates, economic stagnation, frequent power outages, and high unemployment levels. President Ramaphosa confronts challenges from both the right and left ends of the political spectrum.




Despite these challenges, the ANC retains a formidable political apparatus, boasting supporters across all tiers of government. Many South Africans still hold the party in high regard for its pivotal role in the anti-apartheid struggle. President Ramaphosa is set to unveil his party's manifesto on Saturday at a grand rally to be held at a soccer stadium in Durban, situated in the critical electoral battleground of KwaZulu-Natal. In anticipation of the forthcoming elections, Ramaphosa emphasized the significance of the democratic process, stating, "Beyond the fulfilment of our constitutional obligation, these upcoming elections are also a celebration of our democratic journey and a determination of the future that we all desire.







"As South Africa prepares to cast its ballots, the electorate faces a pivotal decision that could shape the country's trajectory for years to come. The outcome of the elections will not only determine the composition of the next parliament but also signal a potential shift in the country's political landscape, reflecting the evolving aspirations and priorities of its citizens.

IS THE TRUMP BODER POWER WEIGHING IN ?; WHITE HOUSE CONSIDERS EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TO ADRESS SOUTHERN BORDER CRISIS

03:14, 2024-02-22

The White House is reportedly contemplating utilizing provisions of federal immigration law, previously employed by former President Donald Trump, to implement a comprehensive crackdown at the southern border. According to sources familiar with the deliberations, the Biden administration is exploring options that President Joe Biden could enact unilaterally, in the absence of congressional approval.

Amidst challenges in garnering bipartisan support for border legislation, with Republican lawmakers rejecting a negotiated bill earlier this month, the administration is actively considering executive actions to address the ongoing border crisis. However, the specifics of any potential executive orders remain in the preliminary stages, with uncertainties surrounding their legal viability in the face of inevitable legal challenges.




Speaking on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press, multiple officials and individuals privy to the discussions shed light on the administration's efforts to navigate the complex landscape of immigration policy. The exploration of executive avenues underscores the urgency facing President Biden, particularly in an election year, as immigration and border issues continue to dominate the political agenda. White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández emphasized the administration's commitment to bipartisan solutions, lamenting the refusal of congressional Republicans to engage constructively on border legislation. "No executive action, no matter how aggressive, can deliver the significant policy reforms and additional resources Congress can provide and that Republicans rejected," stated Fernández Hernández.

While arrests for illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border saw a significant decline in January compared to record highs in December, officials remain vigilant amid concerns of a potential resurgence, especially as the November presidential election approaches.




The administration's focus has turned to Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which grants the president broad authority to block entry of certain immigrants deemed detrimental to the national interest of the United States. This authority, previously utilized by Trump, including the controversial travel ban targeting Muslim-majority nations, has emerged as a potential tool for addressing border challenges.

Biden, who rescinded the travel ban through executive order on his first day in office, faces the complex task of balancing national security concerns with humanitarian considerations at the southern border. As deliberations continue within the White House, the administration grapples with the imperative to address immigration challenges while navigating the complexities of executive authority and legal constraint

ARE THEY SAFE ? BURUNDIAN REFUGEES TO RETURN HOME FROM RWANDA AMIDST SOUR RELATIONS.

04:57, 2024-02-21

A group of approximately 100 Burundian refugees is set to depart Rwanda on Wednesday, February 21, signaling a significant milestone in their journey back to their homeland. Many of these refugees fled Burundi in 2015 amidst political turmoil and have now voluntarily expressed their desire to return.

Comprising 78 individuals from Mahama camp in Kirehe district and over 20 others from Kigali, the group will embark on their journey to the Burundian border in Bugesera district. They will be accompanied by officials from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Rwanda, ensuring a safe and supported transition as they re-enter their country.




The decision to return marks a poignant moment for these refugees, reflecting their aspirations for stability and reconciliation in their homeland. The establishment of Mahama refugee camp in 2012 came in response to an influx of Burundian refugees into Rwanda, triggered by political instability following an unsuccessful coup d'état against former President Pierre Nkurunziza.

The return of these refugees underscores the evolving political landscape in Burundi and the gradual transition towards stability and peace. As they prepare to cross the border, they carry with them the hopes of rebuilding their lives and contributing to the rebuilding efforts in their country.




''The voluntary repatriation of Burundian refugees highlights the resilience and determination of individuals seeking to chart their own path towards a brighter future.'' Said the UNHCR, It also serves as a testament to the collaborative efforts of the international community, including UNHCR Rwanda, in facilitating safe and dignified returns for those displaced by conflict and political unrest.

However there are concerns of how they will be safe after they have arrived in Burundi now that there has been tensions between the two countries

RWANDAN GOVERNMENT RESPONDS TO ACCUSATIONS BY FRANCE.

04:27, 2024-02-21

In the wake of accusations by France suggesting Rwanda's support for M23 rebels in eastern DR Congo, the Rwandan government spokesperson, Yolande Makolo, has issued a response, emphasizing the need to address the root causes of the conflict.

In a statement posted on social media platform X on Tuesday, February 20, Makolo highlighted France's unique position in understanding the complexities of the conflict in eastern DR Congo. She stated,

"No one knows more about the root causes and history of the conflict in eastern DRC than France."

The allegations by the Congolese government accusing Rwanda of supporting M23 rebels have been firmly dismissed by Kigali. Rwanda has consistently underscored that the conflict in eastern DR Congo stems from internal issues such as bad governance, ethnic discrimination, and violence within DR Congo itself.




Moreover, Rwanda has accused the Congolese armed forces (FARDC) of integrating the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), an ethnic militia directly linked to the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda. This US-sanctioned terrorist group has perpetrated hate and violence against Congolese Tutsi communities for over two decades. Makolo reiterated Rwanda's stance, stating,




"If the real issues at the origin of the ongoing conflict were addressed, the problem would not exist."




Furthermore, she emphasized the expertise of the current head of UN Peacekeeping Operations in understanding the history and dynamics of the conflict in eastern DR Congo. Makolo urged for clarity, stating, "there should be no confusion" regarding the situation.

The response from the Rwandan government underscores the complexities of the conflict in eastern DR Congo and emphasizes the importance of addressing underlying issues to achieve lasting peace and stability in the region.

The promotional drive will embark on a journey, with its next stop scheduled for March 17, 2023, in Kigali, where a gala featuring legendary figures will further amplify the event's significance. A world tour is slated from March 2023 to January 2024, setting the stage for a global celebration of football excellence.




In February 2024, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, will host the official presentation of the tournament organization team, signaling the tournament's imminent arrival. The Veteran Clubs World Championship (VCWC), conceptualized by Cameroonian Fred Siewe, is scheduled to take place from May 10 to 20, 2024, in Kigali.

The VCWC will bring together eight teams and over 150 football veterans representing more than 40 countries, showcasing a blend of skill, experience, and camaraderie. In conjunction with the tournament, a series of forums will explore critical themes including peace, education, technology, investment, and tourism, underscoring football's role as a catalyst for social change and global collaboration.

HOPE FOR JUSTICE : TWO MEN CHARGED WITH MURDER IN KANSAS CITY CHIEFS' SUPER BOWL PARADE SHOOTING

03:54, 2024-02-21

In a tragic turn of events following the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl parade, two men have been charged with murder after a shooting incident that resulted in one fatality and left roughly two dozen others injured. Court documents released on Tuesday shed light on the chaotic scene, revealing that the suspects were strangers who engaged in a heated argument before pulling out guns and opening fire within seconds.




According to Missouri prosecutors, Lyndell Mays of Raytown, Missouri, and Dominic Miller of Kansas City, Missouri, have been charged with second-degree murder and several weapons counts in connection with the shooting. Both men were also injured during the altercation and have been hospitalized since.

During a news conference, Jackson County prosecutor Jean Peters Baker provided insight into the sequence of events leading up to the shooting. The altercation reportedly began when two groups of people became agitated over perceived staring from the other group. Surveillance footage showed Mays and an associate approaching the other group in an aggressive manner, ultimately leading to gunfire.




Despite the presence of crowds, including children, Mays allegedly initiated the shooting, claiming he felt threatened by someone in the opposing group. Mays admitted to hesitating initially due to the presence of children but ultimately fired shots at a random individual from the other group.

"Lyndell Mays told detectives, 'he hesitated shooting because he knew there were kids there,'" said Jean Peters Baker during the news conference. Similarly, Miller initially claimed that he and his friends were fleeing the scene after hearing gunfire. However, upon being confronted with video evidence showing him chasing someone from Mays' group and firing shots, Miller confessed to his involvement in the shooting.




"When investigators told Miller they had video of him chasing someone in Mays’ group and shooting, Miller admitted to firing four to five shots," said court documents.

The incident serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of gun violence and the tragic toll it can exact on communities. As the investigation continues, authorities are working diligently to bring justice to the victims and their families while emphasizing the importance of peaceful conflict resolution to prevent similar tragedies in the future.













PARIS OLYMPICS 2024: A SPECTACLE OF HIDTORY, SPORT, WITH EACH MEDAL SET TO CONTAIN A METAL FROM THE EIFFEL TOWER.

12:27, 2024-02-19

Amidst the political spotlight, the Paris Olympics 2024 is poised to captivate the world's attention, marking a historic moment after a prolonged hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the games hold significance for various nations, the spotlight shines particularly bright on Rwanda as the country endeavors to secure its first-ever medals on the global stage.

With only one Rwandan female cyclist, Djazilla Mwamikazi, having secured her ticket to participate, the rest of the Rwandan contingent remains in intense national preparations for the qualifying games. As the sole representative, Mwamikazi carries the hopes and aspirations of her nation, symbolizing the resilience and determination of Rwandan athletes.




Against the backdrop of Rwanda's ambitious pursuit of Olympic glory, the innovative and symbolic design of the medals adds a layer of significance to the event. Each medal contains an original piece of the Eiffel Tower, serving as a tangible connection to the history of Paris and the shared heritage of all participating nations.

Crafted under the supervision of French jeweler Chaumet, in collaboration with Games organizers and major sponsor LVMH, the medals represent more than just athletic achievement; they encapsulate the spirit and heritage of the host city. For Rwanda, securing a medal would not only mark a historic milestone but also serve as a source of immense national pride and inspiration for future generations of athletes.




Amidst the grandeur of the opening ceremony, where athletes will arrive by flotilla along the Seine River, Rwanda's presence underscores the Olympic ideals of unity, diversity, and inclusion. While securing a seat for this momentous occasion comes at a premium, with ticket prices reaching €2,700 for front-row seats, the spirit of the People's Games remains rooted in equity and accessibility.

As the world eagerly anticipates the commencement of the Paris Olympics, Rwanda's quest for Olympic success adds a compelling narrative to the global spectacle of athletic excellence. With determination, dedication, and the support of the nation behind them, Rwandan athletes strive to make history and etch their names in Olympic glory for the first time ever.

Arsenal's impressive form shows no signs of slowing down as they secured a resounding 5-0 victory against Burnley, marking their second consecutive game with over 100 goals bagged in just two matches. The Gunners' latest triumph keeps them within striking distance of the title race, trailing behind Liverpool by a mere two points. From the opening whistle, Arsenal displayed their intent to dominate the match, taking the lead just four minutes into the game. The quick start exemplifies the team's current unstoppable momentum, with nine goals scored in their previous two outings leading up to the clash with Burnley.




As the game progressed, Burnley struggled to mount any significant threats, accumulating more yellow cards than clear-cut chances against a relentless Arsenal side. The Gunners doubled their lead through a Bukayo Saka penalty before heading into halftime with minimal defensive duties. The second half saw Arsenal's starboy, Saka, extend the lead with a sublime strike into the top corner just two minutes after the restart. Despite occasional challenges posed by Burnley's Datro Fofana, Arsenal maintained control, adding to their tally with a well-worked goal finished off by Leandro Trossard.

Even after making substitutions, Arsenal continued to dominate proceedings, with Kai Havertz sealing the victory with a fifth goal for Mikel Arteta's men. The comprehensive win further solidifies Arsenal's place as serious contenders in the title race and highlights their formidable attacking prowess under Arteta's guidance.

With their winning streak intact and confidence soaring, Arsenal's fans can eagerly anticipate what lies ahead as they continue their pursuit of silverware this season.

RAILA ODINGA GAINS SUPPORT FOR THE AFRICAN UNION COMMISSION CHAIRMANSHIP BID.

06:14, 2024-02-19

Azimio leader Raila Odinga's aspiration for the African Union Commission chairman post has garnered significant support from various quarters, signaling a growing momentum behind his candidacy. In a recent statement issued by the Amani National Congress Party (ANC), the party expressed its full support for Kenya's diplomatic efforts to have the Eastern African region lead the African Union Commission. Led by Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi, Kenya's endeavors at the ongoing AU Summit in Addis Ababa have received praise from ANC, with the party believing that the time is ripe for the region to take the helm of the AU Commission.




The ANC highlighted Odinga's wealth of experience and dedication to the advancement of the African continent as key qualifications for the AU Commission chairmanship. Notably, the party applauded former Nigerian President Olesegun Obasanjo's endorsement of Odinga for the position, citing Odinga's extensive experience and commitment to the continent's progress. According to the Amani National Congress Party, Odinga's leadership would prioritize the interests of the continent and foster unity and progress among African nations if elected as the next AU Commission chairperson. The party called upon other East African Community Member States to lend their support to Odinga's bid, positioning him as a strong candidate to succeed the current Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat upon his retirement next year.




Government spokesman Isaac Mwaura echoed the sentiments of ANC, emphasizing Odinga's potential to elevate Kenya and the continent to greater heights if appointed to the top African Union Commission job. With endorsements from political parties and government officials alike, Raila Odinga's candidacy for the AU Commission chairmanship gains traction, underscoring the confidence in his leadership abilities and vision for Africa's future. As the AU considers its next leader, Odinga's bid promises to inject fresh energy and commitment into the organization's agenda for continental development and cooperation.

DONALD TRUMP LAUNCHES SNEAKER BRAND AMID LEGAL TROUBLES

06:00, 2024-02-19

Former US President Donald Trump has made headlines once again, this time with the launch of his own sneaker brand, just a day after a New York judge ordered him to pay millions in penalties for financial fraud. Speaking at Sneaker Con in Philadelphia, Trump unveiled what he called the first official Trump footwear, amidst a mixed reaction from attendees. The shoes, described as shiny gold high tops with an American flag detail, are being marketed as "Never Surrender High-Tops" and are priced at $399. Alongside the sneakers, a new website is selling Trump-branded Victory47 cologne and perfume for $99 a bottle, referencing the potential for him to be the 47th president if re-elected.




Despite claims of no connection to Trump's campaign, online posts from Trump campaign officials promoted the Sneaker Con appearance. The event drew a younger and more diverse crowd than Trump's usual rally attendees, according to reports.

Trump's sneaker launch comes on the heels of a legal setback, as Justice Arthur Engoron ordered him, along with his sons and associates, to pay over $354.9 million plus interest for financial fraud. In response, Trump labeled the ruling as an "election interference ploy" during a campaign rally in Michigan, where he accused the judge of being part of a "left-wing conspiracy" to prevent him from being re-elected. Trump reiterated his baseless claims of election fraud in the 2020 election, asserting that the legal actions against him were politically motivated attacks on all Americans.




As Trump navigates legal challenges and maintains a presence in the public eye, his foray into the sneaker industry adds another layer to his post-presidential endeavors, attracting attention and stirring controversy in equal measure.

New York attorney general Letitia James had accused Trump and his family businesses of overstating his net worth by as much $3.6bn a year over a decade to fool bankers into giving him better loan terms.

Trump also faces four state and federal criminal trials, including one scheduled to start in New York on 25 March, over alleged hush money payments to a porn star. That means Trump will become the first former US president to stand trial on criminal charges.

Trump spoke shortly after Nikki Haley, his last remaining rival for the Republican presidential nomination, who held an event in South Carolina.




On Saturday morning, Haley wasted no time in going after Trump after Friday’s ruling.Haley frequently says “chaos” follows Trump, and that he can’t be an effective president or candidate because of his myriad legal problems.

“He’s going to be in court March and April. He’s going to be in court May and June. He said himself that he’s going to be spending more time in a courtroom than he is on the campaign trail,” Haley told Fox News.

Trump is close to clinching the Republican presidential nomination, and the prospect of a likely general election rematch with Biden, after recent nominating contest wins in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.

Haley, who has no clear path to the Republican nomination, has refused to quit. She is making a potential last stand in her home state of South Carolina, which holds its primary on 24 February, where she trails badly in opinion polls behind Trump.




At her rally on Saturday evening, Haley also attacked Trump for his failure to comment on the death of Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader. At his Michigan rally, Trump again failed to mention Navalny. Russia’s prison service said that Navalny, 47, died on Friday at the “Polar Wolf” Arctic penal colony. The west, including Biden, blamed Russian president Vladimir Putin for the death. Western leaders did not cite evidence.

Haley, addressing a crowd in Irmo, South Carolina, accused Trump of cozying up to Putin in the past. She also referred to a speech Trump made on 10 February, when he said he would “encourage” Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any Nato member who didn’t spend enough on defense.

“Trump is siding with a thug who kills his own political opponents,” Haley said.

CHINA ASSURES EUROPEANS PARTNERS OF STABILITY AMIDST GLOBAL UNCERTAINITIES

04:56, 2024-02-19

China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, delivered a reassuring message to his European counterparts during the Munich Security Conference over the weekend, emphasizing China's commitment to consistency and stability regardless of global changes. Wang's remarks come at a critical juncture as European leaders closely monitor the upcoming United States elections, wary of potential disruptions to their transatlantic partnership, particularly in the face of escalating tensions with Russia.

The backdrop for Wang's message is a growing apprehension among European leaders following recent statements by former President Donald Trump regarding NATO defense spending. Trump's assertion that the United States would not defend NATO allies failing to meet defense expenditure targets has rattled nerves in Europe, especially amidst the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.




For Wang, Trump's remarks provided an opportune moment to emphasize China's stance as a reliable partner for stability. His visit to Europe coincides with Beijing's concerted efforts to mend strained relations with the European Union, a task made more urgent by domestic economic challenges and escalating tensions with the United States.

Amidst geopolitical uncertainties, Wang's assertion of China's stability and consistency seeks to reassure European partners of Beijing's steadfast commitment to maintaining peace and stability globally. As China navigates complex international dynamics, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and shifting global alliances, Wang's message underscores China's diplomatic outreach and its aspiration to play a constructive role on the world stage.




While European leaders continue to weigh their options amidst evolving geopolitical landscapes, Wang's assurances serve as a reminder of China's diplomatic priorities and its aspirations for a stable and predictable international order. As dialogue between China and Europe progresses, both sides face the challenge of balancing their respective interests while navigating an increasingly complex global environment.

RWANDA EXPRESSES CONCERN OVER DRC'S MILTARY ACTIONS AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY INDIFFERENCE.

04:46, 2024-02-19

In a recent development, Rwanda has expressed deep concern over the Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC) abandonment of the Luanda and Nairobi Processes, along with the international community's apparent indifference toward DRC's significant military buildup. This sentiment arises amidst DRC's initiation of extensive combat operations in North Kivu, which contravene regional decisions, raising alarms about potential ramifications.

The DRC's recent military maneuvers, particularly in North Kivu, are seen as attempts to forcibly expel M23 rebels and Congolese Tutsi civilians into neighboring countries. These actions are believed to be in collaboration with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), an ethnic militia directly linked to the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda.




Of significant concern is the integration of FDLR into the Congolese Armed Forces (FARDC), raising fears of complicity in ethnic discrimination and targeted violence against Congolese Tutsi. The prevailing political climate in the DRC, marked by hate speech and tribalism, further exacerbates tensions and instability in the region.

Rwanda asserts that the responsibility for protecting the rights and lives of Congolese Tutsi lies with the DRC. However, the persistent failure to do so has perpetuated three decades of conflict and instability in the Great Lakes Region. Despite the gravity of the situation, hundreds of thousands of Congolese Tutsi continue to live as refugees in East Africa, overlooked by the international community.

Furthermore, Rwanda highlights the DRC's explicit declarations of intent to invade Rwanda and effect regime change by force. In response, Rwanda has adjusted its defense posture to safeguard its territorial integrity and security interests. This includes measures to bolster air defense capabilities following DRC's acquisition of advanced military drones and repeated airspace violations.

Rwanda's concerns are compounded by a recent statement from the U.S. Department of State, which Rwanda views as a distortion of realities and contradictory to previous confidence-building initiatives. Rwanda seeks clarification from the U.S. government to understand whether this statement signals a shift in policy or a lack of internal coordination.




Moreover, Rwanda condemns the characterization of FDLR as merely an "armed group," emphasizing its terrorist nature and genocidal history. Rwanda insists on the demobilization and repatriation of FDLR members to safeguard national unity and territorial integrity.

Rwanda acknowledges and supports regional mediation efforts, particularly by President João Lourenço of Angola. The nation remains committed to addressing the root causes of conflict and ensuring security and stability in the region through extraordinary measures.

As tensions escalate and regional dynamics evolve, Rwanda underscores the imperative of international attention and concerted action to avert further escalation and promote lasting peace in the Great Lakes Region.

THE NEED TO RE-ENGAGE, RE-EDUCATE ABOUT THE CONDOM IS NOW!

14:15, 2024-02-14

In an effort to raise awareness and promote the importance of safe sexual practices, the World Health Organization (WHO) joined communities and partners worldwide in celebrating International Condom Day on February 13, 2024. This annual event serves as a reminder of the crucial role condoms play in preventing the transmission of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and unplanned pregnancies.

Condoms have long been hailed as a safe, inexpensive, and highly effective tool for sexual health. Despite advancements in medicine and technology, condoms remain the only method that offers protection against HIV, STIs, and unwanted pregnancies simultaneously.







As the world continues to grapple with the challenges posed by these health concerns, it is imperative to bring visibility back to this essential preventive measure.

On International Condom Day, WHO shines a spotlight on innovative approaches to condom promotion, including the use of artistic expression. One notable example is the work of Brazilian artist Adriana Bertini, who has creatively integrated condom promotion into her art. Bertini's unique approach not only captivates audiences but also sparks conversations about sexual health and responsibility.

In addition to artistic endeavors, WHO has also leveraged digital platforms to reach younger audiences. One such initiative is WHO's condom promotion video tailored for young people. By harnessing the power of multimedia, WHO aims to educate and empower the next generation to make informed choices regarding their sexual health.




Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO, underscored the significance of International Condom Day, stating, "Condoms are a cornerstone of public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread of HIV, STIs, and unplanned pregnancies. On this day, we reaffirm our commitment to promoting access to condoms and ensuring that everyone can make use of this simple yet powerful preventive measure."




As the world continues to navigate the complexities of sexual health and well-being, events like International Condom Day serve as reminders of the importance of prevention and the critical role that condoms play in safeguarding individuals and communities. By advocating for increased access, awareness, and acceptance of condoms, WHO and its partners strive to create a healthier and safer world for all.




This day serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of promoting safe sexual practices and preventing the spread of HIV, STIs, and unplanned pregnancies. Through innovative initiatives and collaborative efforts, WHO and its partners are working tirelessly to ensure that condoms remain accessible and widely utilized, ultimately contributing to better health outcomes and a brighter future for generations to come.

African Fine Coffees Association Urges Focus on Value-Added Exports

13:49, 2024-02-12

As the global demand for specialty coffee from Africa continues to rise, officials of the African Fine Coffees Association (AFCA) are emphasizing the need for African coffee traders to prioritize value-added coffee exports. During the recent 20th African Fine Coffees Conference and Exhibition and the First African Coffee Week held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, key stakeholders convened to advocate for enhanced marketing strategies and value addition in the continent's coffee industry.




Amir Hamza, chairperson of the AFCA, highlighted the imperative for African coffee-exporting nations to concentrate on value addition and implement effective marketing strategies to maximize earnings. Hamza emphasized that Africa possesses some of the finest coffees globally, but inadequate marketing approaches and the export of unprocessed coffee are hindering the continent's potential.




Despite coffee exports from Africa being valued at over 3.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2022, there are challenges to be addressed. Ethiopia emerged as the leading exporter, followed by Uganda, yet there remains room for improvement in product quality and alignment with consumer preferences in major markets such as the EU and the U.S.




Hamza underscored the importance of expanding intra-Africa trade, citing potential opportunities for African coffee-producing countries to enhance their export revenues. AFCA's Executive Director, Gilbert Gatali, emphasized the need for collaboration among traders to establish production chains, adopt modern technology, and shift towards processed coffee exports.




Gatali highlighted various challenges facing coffee growers in Africa, including poor marketing strategies, inadequate knowledge and technology, and climate change impacts. He called for increased support from coffee buyers and governments to empower farmers with necessary skills and ensure fair prices in the international market.




As Africa's coffee industry strives to capitalize on its potential, the AFCA's call for a shift towards value-added exports and improved marketing strategies resonates strongly. With concerted efforts to address industry challenges and embrace innovation, African coffee producers can position themselves for sustained growth and competitiveness in the global market.

PRESIDENT ANDRZEJ DUDA OF POLAND COMMENDS RWANDA'S JOURNEY OF JUSTICE AND FORGIVENESS AT KIGALI GENOCIDE MEMORIAL

14:36, 2024-02-07

President Andrzej Duda of Poland visited the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda on Wednesday, February 7, as part of his state visit to the country. His poignant remarks emphasized the importance of justice and forgiveness in healing communities scarred by tragic events like the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi.

Duda's visit to the memorial, located in the Gisozi Sector of the Gasabo District, offered him insights into Rwanda's history and its remarkable journey of resilience and reconciliation. He laid a wreath in honor of the genocide victims and took time to reflect on the nation's past and its remarkable progress since then.




In a message penned in the memorial's guest book, President Duda expressed profound admiration for Rwanda's efforts to overcome the trauma of the genocide. He described the experience as a "masterclass on justice and forgiveness" that holds valuable lessons for communities worldwide.

"The visit to the Kigali Genocide Memorial is a profound experience," wrote President Duda. "It is a lesson on the catastrophic consequences of divisions fueled by outsiders and a sinister and xenophobic ideology that turns people against people, neighbors against neighbors, and family members against each other."




Duda's words underscored the importance of acknowledging past atrocities and striving for reconciliation as essential steps towards healing and rebuilding societies. His visit also symbolized Poland's solidarity with Rwanda and its commitment to supporting efforts for peace and stability in Africa.

President Duda's state visit to Rwanda is part of a broader international mission that includes engagements with other African nations, including Kenya and Tanzania. His presence in Rwanda highlights the significance of fostering diplomatic ties and promoting mutual understanding among nations.




As Rwanda continues to commemorate the victims of the genocide and work towards a more inclusive and harmonious society, President Duda's visit serves as a reminder of the global community's responsibility to stand against hatred, intolerance, and violence.

The poignant moments shared at the Kigali Genocide Memorial reaffirm the shared values of justice, compassion, and forgiveness that transcend borders and unite humanity in the pursuit of a better world.

''TRUMP IS NOT IMMUNE FROM CRIMINAL PROSECUTION'' SAYS THE APPEALS COURT.

16:00, 2024-02-06

In a unanimous ruling on Tuesday 6 Feb, a federal appeals court asserted that former President Donald Trump is not immune from criminal prosecution for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The three-judge appeals panel firmly rejected Trump’s contention that he could not be charged due to his status as president at the time of the alleged crimes.




“We cannot accept that the office of the Presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter,” the panel stated in the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

“For the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant,” the panel clarified in a 57-page opinion. “But any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer shields him against this prosecution.”




The decision marks another significant legal setback for Trump, who is currently the leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination.

"It's a critical ruling reaffirming the fundamental principle that no one is above the law," said a legal expert familiar with the case. It is anticipated that Trump will swiftly petition the Supreme Court to overturn the ruling or request a rehearing of the case by the full judicial lineup of the appeals court.




"President Trump respectfully disagrees with the DC Circuit’s decision and will appeal it in order to safeguard the Presidency and the Constitution," said Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung.

Trump's immunity claim pertains to the criminal election interference case being prosecuted by Department of Justice special counsel Jack Smith in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. Smith has charged Trump with four counts related to attempts to overturn his electoral defeat by President Joe Biden in 2020, culminating in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot where a mob of Trump supporters disrupted a joint session of Congress.




Trump, who has pleaded not guilty, faces charges tied to his encouragement of the Capitol riot and his efforts to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject Electoral College results.

"We firmly believe that Mr. Trump's actions were within the boundaries of the law and his constitutional authority," said one of Trump's attorneys. Trump's legal team argued three points to the appeals panel in claiming presidential immunity from the charges, all of which were rejected by the panel as inadequate defenses.

The ruling has profound implications for the prosecution of former presidents and underscores the principles of accountability and rule of law in the United States.

A RAY OF HOPE SHINES ; Mutuelle de Santé SET TO COVER CANCER, KIDNEY AND PHYSIO TREATMENTS IN 2025.

15:54, 2024-02-06

In a significant move towards enhancing healthcare accessibility and inclusivity, the Rwandan government has unveiled plans to integrate specialized medical services into its community-based health insurance scheme (CBHI), popularly known as Mutuelle de Santé. This initiative, slated to commence in 2025, aims to address longstanding issues of inadequate access to critical medical services, particularly for vulnerable populations such as people with disabilities and the elderly.




The decision to expand the scope of services covered by Mutuelle de Santé comes in response to concerns raised in the report of the National Commission for Human Rights for the fiscal year 2022/2023. Among the highlighted issues were the insufficient access to specialized medical care and the exclusion of certain treatments from the insurance coverage.

Health Minister Sabin Nsanzimana emphasized the government's commitment to inclusivity in healthcare, stating,

"For us as the Ministry of Health, we wish to include all possible services in the Mutuelle de Santé health package." However, limited resources have historically constrained the breadth of coverage. To address this challenge, a collaborative effort between the Ministry of Health and the Rwanda Social Security Board (RSSB) has been initiated to bolster the capacity of the fund.




One of the key areas earmarked for inclusion in the expanded coverage is specialized medical services such as cancer treatment and kidney transplants. These services, which were previously inaccessible to many due to financial constraints, will now become accessible to a broader segment of the population under the CBHI scheme. Additionally, assistive devices, including prostheses, are slated to be covered, ensuring that individuals requiring such devices can access them without financial burden.

Louise Kanyonga, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of RSSB, underscored the success of the CBHI scheme, noting that it covered over 90% of Rwandans in the previous year. Despite this achievement, sustaining the scheme's financial viability remains a pressing concern. Kanyonga cautioned that without adequate financing mechanisms, the scheme could revert to a deficit state, jeopardizing the gains made in healthcare coverage.




The infusion of additional resources into Mutuelle de Santé has been instrumental in bridging the gap between liabilities and assets, thereby enabling the scheme to operate with a surplus. This surplus has facilitated the expansion of service coverage and the provision of essential health services to members. However, sustaining this positive trajectory necessitates a concerted effort to enhance financing mechanisms and ensure the long-term sustainability of the scheme.

In 2023 alone, Mutuelle de Santé collected Rwf85 billion in contributions, with Rwf75 billion disbursed in benefits to cover healthcare services for scheme members. The tangible impact of these investments is reflected in improved access to healthcare services and better health outcomes for Rwandans across the country.




Looking ahead, the government's commitment to inclusive healthcare through the integration of specialized medical services into the CBHI scheme heralds a new era of healthcare accessibility and equity in Rwanda. By addressing the needs of marginalized populations and bolstering the financial sustainability of the scheme, Rwanda reaffirms its dedication to advancing universal health coverage and ensuring the well-being of all its citizens.

POLISH PRESIDENT H E ANDREZJ DUDA AND FIRST LADY AGATA KORNHASUSER-DUDA EMBARK on STATE VISIT IN RWANDA

15:43, 2024-02-06

In a bid to bolster bilateral cooperation across multiple sectors, Polish President Andrzej Duda, accompanied by his wife Agata Kornhauser-Duda, is set to embark on a state visit to Kigali on February 6. This anticipated visit underscores the commitment of both nations to strengthen ties and explore avenues for collaboration.




The upcoming visit follows significant milestones in the diplomatic relationship between Poland and Rwanda. Just eight months ago, the Foreign Ministers of both countries inked an agreement focused on the training of diplomatic personnel, signaling a mutual commitment to enhancing diplomatic capabilities. Discussions during this period also encompassed strategies to bolster economic exchange, with a particular emphasis on cooperation in agriculture, engineering, and the IT sectors.

President Duda's itinerary in Rwanda forms part of his broader working trip to East African countries, including Kenya and Tanzania. This visit aligns with Poland's international mission initiated in 2017 to foster closer relations with African nations, reflecting a shared commitment to strengthening global partnerships.




During his stay in Kigali, President Duda is scheduled to engage in bilateral talks with Rwandan President Paul Kagame, with a focus on deepening cooperation between the two nations. Additionally, key agenda items include presiding over the signing of cooperation agreements, paying respects at the Kigali Genocide Memorial, visit to our lady of good hope Kibeho prayer site and participating in a Polish business forum aimed at promoting investment opportunities.




Over recent years, Rwanda and Poland have witnessed a steady consolidation of bilateral relations across various domains, including higher education, defense, agriculture, trade, and investment. Notably, Poland has emerged as a preferred destination for Rwandan students pursuing higher education, with over 1,500 Rwandan students currently studying in Polish institutions, marking the largest cohort of international students from a single country.




The establishment of diplomatic missions in each other's capitals further underscores the deepening of bilateral ties. Rwanda inaugurated its embassy in Warsaw in 2021, facilitating closer diplomatic engagement, while Poland reciprocated by establishing its embassy in Kigali in December 2022, reaffirming its commitment to advancing bilateral cooperation.




As President Duda and First Lady Kornhauser-Duda embark on their state visit to Rwanda, both nations are poised to explore new avenues of collaboration, leveraging their shared values and aspirations for mutual prosperity and development. The visit symbolizes a reaffirmation of the enduring friendship between Poland and Rwanda and underscores the potential for further advancements in their bilateral relationship

STILL UNCOVERING THE TRAGEDY: 700 MORE 1994 GENOCIDE REMAINS DISCOVERED IN HUYE.

13:50, 2024-02-05

In a somber turn of events, the search for the remains of victims of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Huye District has intensified, revealing a heart-wrenching total of 714 bodies under houses. Ibuka, the umbrella organization for Genocide survivors, shared this distressing update, shedding light on the ongoing efforts to bring closure to the families affected.




Theodate Siboyintore, Ibuka’s representative in Huye District, provided insights into the escalating numbers during an interview with The New Times. The search, which commenced in October 2023, initially uncovered 313 bodies on the property of Jean Baptiste Hishamunda and Seraphine Dusabemariya, a father and daughter duo. However, as of February 4, the count has surged to a staggering 714. An additional 401 remains were discovered in the neighboring plot owned by Mediatrice Uwimana.




The disturbing revelation has not only brought to light the extent of the tragedy but has also led to legal actions. The Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB) reported the arrest and remand of Uwimana and five others for concealing information about the victims' remains. The individuals currently remanded include 86-year-old Hishamunda, Dusabemariya (61), Petero Habimana (89), Mariani Musasangohe (50), and Marie Josee Uwabega (53), while Sifa Nyirakiromba (68) was granted bail in the same case.




The discovery unfolded in October 2023 when workers, constructing a fence around Hishamunda's compound in Ngoma sector, stumbled upon six bodies. Subsequent exhumation efforts, including the demolition of the main residential house, revealed additional victims. The area, formerly inhabited by soldiers of the genocidal regime, included Hishamunda's son, currently serving a prison sentence for genocide crimes. Despite his guilty plea, crucial information regarding the victims' remains was withheld.




Dusabemariya, who inherited the land from Hishamunda, initiated landscaping work that ultimately led to the discovery of the remains. Notably, Dusabemariya, Musangangohe, and Uwabega are children of Hishamunda, while Habimana and Uwimana are Dusabemariya's neighbors. The unfolding tragedy exposes the deep scars left by the genocide, emphasizing the importance of continued efforts to unveil the truth and seek justice for the victims. It should be remembered that since the wake of the 1994 Genocide against Tutsi to date information on such mass graves was acquired from eyewitnesses and some perpetrators who confessed their wrong doing and indicated their whereabouts. Initially the government of Rwanda had proposed a new technology that would help to discover the remaining mass graves but would still rely on sourced information of which with holding it is a crime punishable by law.

NAMIBIA EMBRACES NEW LEADERSHIHP IN MBUMBA AS THEY STILL MOURN FALLEN GEINGOB.

13:07, 2024-02-05

In a swift and solemn transition, Namibia found itself with a new leader, Nangolo Mbumba, just hours after the passing of its president, Hage Geingob. President Geingob, aged 82, succumbed to his battle with cancer on Sunday while undergoing medical treatment in the capital, Windhoek.

A prominent figure in Namibia's struggle for independence, Geingob had disclosed his cancer diagnosis to the public a month ago. Describing the departed president as a "liberation icon," Vice-President Nangolo Mbumba paid tribute to Geingob's leadership and credited him as the chief architect of the nation's constitution.




Mbumba wasted no time assuming the presidency, taking the oath of office in a hastily arranged ceremony at the state house just 15 hours after Geingob's death. During the ceremony, Mbumba assured the nation, stating, "I am not going to be around for the elections, so don't panic," hinting at the upcoming elections later this year.




Reflecting on Geingob's legacy, Mbumba acknowledged the stability and calmness in the nation, crediting it to the late president's leadership. "I take on this heavy mantle cognizant of the weight of responsibility," Mbumba added.

Geingob's death came after a recent trip to the United States for a "two-day novel treatment for cancerous cells." Although the exact cause of death was not disclosed, his deteriorating health had been a matter of public concern.

Namibian radio has become a platform for people to share fond memories of Geingob, remembering him as a visionary and a jovial personality who could effortlessly share a joke. Leaders worldwide have expressed their condolences, with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa describing Geingob as "a towering veteran of Namibia's liberation from colonialism and apartheid."




Hage Geingob, a long-serving member of the Swapo party, played a crucial role in leading the movement against apartheid South Africa. His towering presence, deep gravelly voice, and commitment to freedom made him a respected figure not only in Namibia but across the globe.

After 27 years in exile, where he lived in Botswana, the US, and the UK, Geingob returned to Namibia in 1989, a year before the country gained independence. As Namibia mourns the loss of its leader, the nation is left with the task of continuing the journey toward building an inclusive society, a goal President Geingob had passionately advocated for throughout his political career.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT FUND RESUMES OPERATIONS IN KIGALI'S MAGERAGERE SECTOR, BRINING A RAY OF HOPE

12:40, 2024-02-05

In a momentous development for the residents of Kigali City's Mageragere sector in the Nyarugenge district, the Business Development Fund (BDF) has resumed operations, bringing renewed hope and opportunities for the community. The announcement came on January 27, 2024, following the completion of the "Umuganda rusange" in Mageragere, where the BDF reopened its offices and extended health insurance (Mutuel de sante) to 947 individuals facing challenges in covering their medical expenses.




Muhayimana Paul, a resident of Mageragere, expressed gratitude to the BDF for providing health insurance to those who were previously unable to afford it. He remarked, "We thank BDF for covering the costs of health insurance for the remaining members of our community who were unable to pay for themselves. We're glad and grateful to the Rwandan government and the BDF for coming back here to aid people."




The absence of the BDF had posed challenges for the region, according to Mukamana, another resident. She mentioned the setbacks faced due to the lack of development support but expressed hope for positive change with the BDF's return, particularly in empowering youth to access financing. She stated, "I'm hoping that the BDF would work with our local leaders to encourage our youth to apply for bank loans. Thus, I believe that youth development is just getting started as long as BDF is back here."

Hategekimana Silas, the executive secretary of the Mageragere sector, highlighted the importance of BDF's presence, especially since 74% of residents are engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. He said, "We are happy to have BDF join us in our mission to support our residents' growth and success. The government's effort to end poverty among its residents is essential to their growth, the provision of services, and their general well-being."




BDF CEO Vincent Munyeshyaka, in his speech, reaffirmed the organization's goals and target audience. He stated, "Our primary goal is to assist those who own small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in obtaining financing." Munyeshyaka expressed appreciation for the collaborative relationships with national banks and Saccos, emphasizing the support BDF provides in obtaining collateral for loans.

The Business Development Fund (BDF) Ltd, established in 2011 by the Government of Rwanda and the Development Bank of Rwanda (BRD), aims to support Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in accessing finance and advisory services. The reopening of BDF's operations in Mageragere signifies a positive step towards economic empowerment, community development, and improved well-being for the residents.

"IN MEMORIAM: HONORING RWANDA'S UNKNOWN SOLDIER – A SYMBOL OF SACRIFICE AND UNITY"

08:32, 2024-02-05

At the heart of the National Heroes’ Mausoleum in Remera, Kigali, stands a towering tribute to the unsung heroes of Rwanda – the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. This solemn memorial represents the thousands of fallen soldiers who gave their all in the fight for freedom and liberation, leaving an indelible mark on the nation's history.

The Unknown Soldier holds a unique place among Rwanda's national heroes, classified into three categories – Imanzi, Imena, and Ingenzi – by the Chancellery for Heroes, National Orders, and Decorations of Honour (CHENO). Maj Gen Fred Rwigema and the Unknown Soldier stand as Imanzi, supreme heroes recognized for their outstanding achievements through supreme sacrifice.




Nicolas Rwaka, the Director of Research at CHENO, explains that the Unknown Soldier embodies the core values of integrity, patriotism, sacrifice, and proven courage or bravery. These values serve as a beacon, preserving the spirit of a nation that emerged from one of its darkest chapters. Preserving the memory of the Unknown Soldier is paramount, according to Rwaka, as it honors the sacrifices made by fallen soldiers. The monument becomes a source of inspiration for future generations, a reminder of the resilience and determination that shaped Rwanda's destiny.

For the youth, the Unknown Soldier holds a profound significance. Galina Isimbi, a university student, sees the monument as a reminder of sacrifice and the ultimate price paid for Rwanda's freedom.

Umugwaneza emphasizes that the Unknown Soldier reminds them of the shared history that unites Rwanda as one nation.




In the face of the Genocide against the Tutsi in 1994, Rwanda has emerged as a nation transformed, guided by the values instilled by heroes like the Unknown Soldier.

ITALIAN PREMIER GIORGIA MELONI LAUNCHES AMBITIOUS PARTNERSHIP WITH AFRICA: AIMING FOR ECONOMIC BOOST, ENERGY HUB,AND IMMIGRATION CONTROL

15:04, 2024-01-31

Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni made headlines on Monday as she unveiled an ambitious plan to strengthen ties with Africa during a one-day summit attended by over two dozen African leaders and European Union officials. The plan, which encompasses economic collaboration, the creation of an energy hub for Europe, and measures to address immigration concerns, reflects Italy's commitment to forging a new chapter in its relationship with the African continent.




Meloni announced a groundbreaking partnership, backed by an initial investment of $5.95 billion, including state guarantees. The financial commitment is a testament to Italy's determination to foster economic growth and development in collaboration with African nations. Critics, however, have raised concerns about Italy's substantial debt, questioning its ability to compete with global players like China, Russia, and Gulf states that are also vying for a stronger presence in Africa.




A focal point of the summit was the emphasis on energy collaboration. Italy envisions creating an energy hub for Europe, and Meloni highlighted the potential for significant cooperation in this sector. As the world transitions towards renewable energy sources, Italy's initiative aims to position the country as a key player in the development of sustainable energy solutions, fostering mutually beneficial relationships with African nations.




While the summit was deemed a success by Meloni, African Union Commission Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat expressed disappointment in not being consulted on priorities beforehand. He stressed the importance of moving from words to actions, emphasizing the need for concrete steps and the fulfillment of commitments. Meloni acknowledged this sentiment during a post-summit news conference, emphasizing the importance of translating promises into tangible on-the-ground projects.




The summit brought together leaders from 45 African states, showcasing a commitment to inclusivity and broad collaboration. Despite the noted discord, Meloni expressed her government's willingness to collaborate with the private sector and international bodies, such as the European Union, to ensure the success of the partnership. This approach acknowledges the complexity of the challenges and the need for a collective effort to address them.




Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's bold initiative signals a renewed commitment to collaboration between Italy and Africa. The plan, named after Enrico Mattei, founder of state oil company Eni, reflects Italy's determination to play a pivotal role in Africa's economic development, energy transition, and immigration control. As the partnership progresses, the international community will be closely watching to see how Italy overcomes challenges and delivers on its promises, navigating a path that aims to benefit both the Italian people and the nations of Africa.

PUTIN'S PROVOCATION: RUSSIA'S RESILIENCE AMIDST INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS

11:09, 2024-01-31

Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to revel in the face of adversity as he proudly boasts about Russia's ability to withstand international sanctions and maintain economic resilience. Despite concerted efforts by the United States and its G7 partners to curb Moscow's oil revenues and limit its access to military technology, Putin remains defiant, scoffing at the economic challenges faced by Europe. However, beneath the surface of this bravado lies a more complex reality.




In a recent event, Putin took the opportunity to gloat about Russia's economic performance, contrasting it with what he perceives as the decline of European economies. Putin boldly stated, "Russia has growth, and they have decline… Though even European countries all have problems through the roof, not even comparable to ours." This declaration comes as the Russian state reaps billions from oil and diamond exports, military factories operate at full capacity, and Russian banks maintain access to the international financial system.




Contrary to expectations, Russia has adeptly navigated the extensive sanctions imposed by Western nations. Instead of succumbing to their weight, the Russian economy has not only weathered the storm but has actually grown by 1.5% since the eve of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The adaptability displayed by Russia on the economic front raises questions about the efficacy of the sanctions strategy employed by the West.




While the immediate economic outlook for Russia seems robust, the longer-term horizon appears clouded with uncertainty. As the second anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine approaches, questions arise about the sustainability of Russia's economic resilience and the potential consequences of prolonged isolation. The reliance on oil and diamond exports, coupled with restricted access to advanced military technology, raises concerns about the long-term viability of Putin's strategy.




Putin's defiance and Russia's economic resilience have global implications. The ability of a nation to withstand international sanctions challenges the conventional wisdom that such measures can swiftly cripple a country's economy. This poses a dilemma for Western powers as they grapple with the effectiveness of their approach and consider the broader geopolitical ramifications of a resilient Russia.




Vladimir Putin's boasting over Russia's resistance to international sanctions presents a complex narrative. While the short-term gains are evident, the long-term outlook remains uncertain. As the world watches the geopolitical chess game unfold, the resilience of the Russian economy raises important questions about the effectiveness of sanctions as a tool of diplomatic leverage and the evolving dynamics of global power.

The initiative is part of a broader Team Europe approach, aligning with the development goals of other EU partners.




While speaking at the event, minister Ndagijimana highlighted the significance of the new program, emphasizing its crucial role in sectors such as agriculture, health, urbanization, and public finance management. He described the agreement as a "crucial stride forward" that reaffirms both nations' dedication to achieving tangible progress across diverse sectors of engagement.

Urbanization (€25.5 million): Supporting the development of sustainable and attractive satellite cities to enhance living conditions, especially for vulnerable populations, contributing to a socio-economic and environmental ecosystem that is inclusive and climate-proof.




The signing of the new bilateral cooperation agreement marks a significant chapter in the enduring partnership between Rwanda and Belgium. With a strategic focus on key sectors, both nations reaffirm their commitment to sustainable development, setting the stage for collaborative efforts that aim to address pressing global challenges and foster socio-economic advancement in Rwanda. This partnership exemplifies the potential of international cooperation in creating positive and lasting impacts on communities worldwide.

" REMEMBERING THE POST, SHAPING THE FUTURE: A REFLECTION ON THE HOLOCAUST REMEBRANCE DAY EVENT IN KIGALI "

08:12, 2024-01-29

January 25, marked a solemn yet significant day at the Kigali Genocide Memorial, where the Jewish community in Rwanda, along with the Israeli Embassy, the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany, and the United Nations Office in Kigali, gathered to commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day. The event not only paid tribute to the 6 million Jews brutally murdered by the National Socialist Party [The Nazis] under Adolf Hitler but also drew poignant parallels to the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda.




In a world still grappling with the shadows of the past, the annual event seeks to rekindle the flame of #NeverAgain, alerting the globe to the persistent specters of anti-Semitism, genocidal denial, and their evolution into modern-day terrorism. Dignitaries from various nations, the United Nations, and the AEGIS Trust Board, along with members of the Jewish community, attended, emphasizing the universal importance of remembering and learning from history.

Israeli Ambassador H.E Einat Weiss, speaking passionately at the event, said, "Full-fledged violence was carried out in front of the international community where some people seemed less important than others, other lives were more valuable than others, acts that should never happen ever again." She echoed the sentiment that such acts must never happen again, urging collective vigilance against discrimination and violence.




The historical significance of the Holocaust, marked by events like Kristallnacht in 1938, propelled actions such as Britain's Kinder transport program, which rescued 10,000 children, mostly Jewish. The invasion of Poland in 1939 and the establishment of ghettos demonstrated the horrifying conditions faced by Jewish communities, foreshadowing the Wannsee Conference's sinister plan for mass deportations and extermination.




Ambassador Heike Uta Dettmann, representing Germany in Rwanda, emphasized the importance of remembrance coupled with drawing lessons from the past. She said, "Remembrance is important. But without drawing lessons learned from our past, remembrance will remain simply that: the past. Germany acknowledges this historical responsibility. 'Never again' must actively be shaped every day."




The event's context intertwined with the ongoing Middle East conflict, particularly the October 7th attack by Hamas militants. The Ambassador of Germany linked these events, highlighting the global importance of actively shaping a future free from violence, discrimination, and genocide.

Also speaking at the event the UN resident Coordinator said that, ''As we reflect on this emotionally charged event, let us heed the lessons of history, working together to build a world where the atrocities of the past remain memories, and the call of #NeverAgain becomes a shared commitment for generations to come.''

RWANDA'S REMARKABLE TOURISM RESURGENCE :DOUBLING RWANDAIR FLEET SPARKS TOURISM BOOM

15:11, 2024-01-23

In a testament to resilience and strategic recovery efforts, Rwanda has not only weathered the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic but has emerged stronger, with a burgeoning tourism sector. Prime Minister Edouard Ngirente, speaking during the National Dialogue-Umushyikirano on January 23, 2024, highlighted the remarkable surge in tourist arrivals, attributing much of the success to the expansion efforts of RwandAir.




Efforts invested in recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic included a significant milestone – the doubling of RwandAir's fleet. Prime Minister Ngirente expressed pride in the strategic decision to expand the national carrier, stating that the move played a pivotal role in revitalizing the tourism sector.




The impact of doubling the RwandAir fleet was immediately evident, with a nearly tripled influx of tourists within a span of just two years. In 2021, the number of tourists to Rwanda stood at 521,000. Fast forward to 2023, and that figure had skyrocketed to an impressive 1.4 million. This surge underscores not only the successful recovery from the challenges posed by the pandemic but also the resilience of Rwanda's tourism industry.




Following the tumultuous period of the COVID-19 pandemic, RwandAir demonstrated agility and strategic foresight. The airline resumed flights and, crucially, expanded its route network to include popular destinations such as Paris, London, Doha, and others. These new routes not only catered to the growing demand for travel but also showcased Rwanda as an attractive and accessible destination.




RwandAir's commitment to recovery wasn't limited to passenger flights. Recognizing the evolving needs of global trade, the airline also launched cargo services. This move played a significant role in the overall tourism resurgence, showcasing Rwanda's versatility and adaptability in responding to dynamic market demands.

“RwandAir resumed flights after Covid-19 pandemic and opened new routes to different destinations including Paris, London, Doha, and others. RwandAir also launched services to transport cargo. This played a big role in increasing visitors coming to Rwanda, after Covid-19 pandemic, from 521,000 in 2021 to 1.4 million tourists as of September last year [2023]. This was a drastic increase within 18 months,” Ngirente said




Prime Minister Ngirente affirmed the government's commitment to further invest in RwandAir, recognizing its pivotal role in boosting tourism and contributing to the national economy. By enhancing the national flag carrier's service provision, the government aims to continue positioning Rwanda as a premier destination for both leisure and business travelers.




“In partnership with the private sector, the government will continue to increase infrastructure to boost tourism and facilitate hosting of Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions (MICE) events in the efficient way you [President Kagame] have requested of us,” he added.

As revealed by Frank Murangwa, Director of Destination Marketing at Rwanda Convention Bureau, in 2023, Rwanda generated a record $91 million from 157 summits and events that attracted over 67,000 delegates.

The impressive feat not only underscores the sector’s post-pandemic recovery but also positions it as a pivotal force propelling Rwanda towards sustained economic development.

PRES KAGAME REAFFIRMS RWANDAN'S OWNERSHIP OF THEIR HOME AND NURTURES A VISION FOR SUSTAINABLE PROGRESS

14:47, 2024-01-23

In a powerful and impassioned address during the 19th Umushykirano meeting, President Paul Kagame reassured Rwandans both at home and abroad that they were not merely renting a country but, unequivocally, residing in their own home. The annual two-day event serves as a platform for addressing developmental progress, highlighting achievements, and acknowledging shortcomings, in line with the principles of accountable leadership.




President Kagame's words resonated with patriotism and a sense of ownership as he addressed the audience at the Umushykirano meeting. "This is your country, this is your home, therefore, nobody should ever make you feel like you are renting a home," Kagame asserted, emphasizing the deep connection that Rwandans have with their homeland. The statement is a powerful reminder that the people of Rwanda are not transient occupants but permanent residents with a shared stake in the nation's destiny.




Addressing the issue of national defense, President Kagame expressed a resolute stance on protecting Rwanda's hard-fought independence. Despite the country's size, Kagame highlighted Rwanda's remarkable recovery from times when it stood alone without external assistance. "When it comes to defending this country that has suffered for so long, yet nobody came to help, I don't need permission from anybody," declared President Kagame. The statement underscores Rwanda's self-reliance and determination to safeguard its sovereignty.




During the Umushykirano meeting, President Kagame reassured statesmen around the world that Rwanda has made significant strides over the past 30 years, positioning itself as a beacon of progress and development. He urged the global audience not to be misled by outdated perceptions, emphasizing that Rwanda had emerged from the shadows of its history to become a nation on the rise.




The annual Umushykirano meeting serves a crucial role in promoting accountability in leadership. It provides a platform for evaluating the progress made in the past year and addressing any shortcomings. This commitment to transparency and self-assessment is a testament to Rwanda's dedication to accountable governance.

Celebrating Achievements and Addressing Challenges:

At the Umushykirano meeting, achievements were not only celebrated but also individuals who have flown the Green Yellow Blue flag high were recognized. President Kagame acknowledged the exemplary efforts of Rwandans who have made significant contributions on both national and international fronts.




In addition to celebrating achievements, the meeting addressed pressing issues that demand urgent attention. One such issue is the alarming rate of food waste in Rwanda, accounting for up to 30% of the annual harvest. Recognizing the importance of addressing this challenge, Rwanda is pioneering climate-friendly post-harvest storage solutions. These initiatives aim to boost food security, reduce waste, and increase incomes for farmers.




President Kagame's reaffirmation of Rwandans' ownership of their home and his unwavering commitment to defending the country underscore the resilience and determination that define Rwanda's journey. The Umushykirano meeting serves as a holistic platform, not only for celebrating achievements but also for addressing challenges and fostering a vision of sustainable progress. As Rwanda continues to build a brighter future, it does so with a united spirit, where every citizen plays a vital role in shaping the destiny of their beloved country.

''RWANDA HAS NO INTERESTS IN CREATING CONFLICTS WITH OUR NEIGHBOURS'' GOV'T RESPONDS TO NDAYISHIMIYE'S STATEMENTS.

14:42, 2024-01-23

Tensions between Rwanda and Burundi have reached a concerning level following recent comments by Burundian President Evariste Ndayishimiye while in Kinshasa, an act that the Rwandan government deemed "inflammatory and un-African." The Burundian President, acting in his capacity as the African Union Champion for Youth, Peace, and Security, according to Rwanda]s spokes person made baseless allegations, further straining relations between the two nations. This comes at a time as the Great Lakes Region grapples with security challenges and it is crucial for leaders to engage in responsible diplomacy rather than resorting to divisive rhetoric.




President Ndayishimiye's remarks, blaming Rwanda for insecurity in the Great Lakes and characterizing Rwandan youth as "prisoners in the region," have been met with stern rebuke from the neighboring government. The accusations, made during an event in DR Congo's capital Kinshasa, are not only unfounded but also risk exacerbating existing tensions in the region.

In a statement released by the Office of Rwandan Government Spokesperson, the allegations were described as "inflammatory" and aimed at "inciting division among Rwandans." Such statements not only undermine the progress made in fostering unity within Rwanda but also pose a threat to the broader peace and security in the Great Lakes Region.




This called for the importance of diplomatic relations between neighboring countries and cannot be overstated, especially in regions where historical tensions persist. Accusations made without concrete evidence not only strain diplomatic ties but can also have far-reaching consequences on the stability of the entire region. It is imperative for leaders to engage in responsible and constructive dialogue, fostering an environment where disputes can be resolved through diplomatic channels rather than escalating through public accusations.




The statement continued, “For anyone to try and undermine this progress by calling on young Rwandans to overthrow their government is troubling. But for a leader of a neighboring country to do so, from an African Union platform, is deeply irresponsible and a flagrant violation of the African Union Charter.”




Ndayishimiye’s comments came weeks after he accused Rwanda of harboring and training members of a Burundian armed group based in DR Congo, which was followed by Burundi’s unilateral closure of the countries’ shared border. Rwanda denied any links with any Burundian armed group and urged Burundian leaders to address issues through diplomatic channels.

In the face of these accusations, the Rwandan government reiterated its commitment to regional stability, stating, “Rwanda has no interest in creating conflict with our neighbors. We will continue to work with partners in the region and beyond to foster stability and continued development.”




Ndayishimiye joined DR Congo’s Tshisekedi in blaming Rwanda for the insecurity in eastern DR Congo. During his election campaign, Tshisekedi said if re-elected, he would declare war on Rwanda. In December 2022, he said Rwandans “needed” his “support to liberate themselves,” comments that analysts called an attack on Rwandan leaders.

As the allegations and accusations continue to circulate, it is essential for leaders in the Great Lakes Region to prioritize responsible diplomacy over divisive rhetoric. The path forward lies in constructive engagement, adherence to diplomatic norms, and a commitment to building a stable and prosperous future for the entire region. The international community will be closely watching how these nations navigate these challenging times and work towards fostering enduring peace and cooperation.
















RWANDA INSPECTORATE CALLS FOR SUSTAINABLE MEAT PACKAGING TO ENHANCE SAFETY AND QUALITY

07:27, 2024-01-23

Amidst a move towards promoting sustainability and ensuring the safety and quality of meat products, the Rwanda Inspectorate, Competition and Consumer Protection Authority (RICA) has issued a directive urging the discontinuation of the use of paper bags and non-biodegradable sacks for packaging meat across the country. This initiative aligns with the 2010 Ministerial Order on the transport and trade of meat, specifically targeting the enhancement of hygiene standards in the meat packaging industry.




The call for a shift in meat packaging practices is grounded in the 2010 Ministerial Order, which sets stringent guidelines for the transport and trade of meat. Article 9 of the order explicitly prohibits the use of dirty or previously used non-washable materials for meat packing, a category that includes paper bags. The directive highlights the importance of maintaining hygiene throughout the entire meat supply chain, from production to consumption.

Gaspard Simbarikure, Veterinary Hygiene and Quarantine Specialist at RICA, emphasized that packaging meat in paper bags is not only environmentally unsustainable but is also illegal as per existing regulations. Simbarikure further stressed the need for consumers to explore alternatives such as reusable materials like dishes and other food containers.




The decision to discourage the use of paper bags and non-biodegradable sacks for meat packaging is rooted in environmental awareness and responsibility. Traditional packaging materials, especially those that are not biodegradable, contribute significantly to environmental degradation. By advocating for sustainable alternatives, RICA aims to reduce the environmental impact associated with the meat industry.




As part of the initiative, RICA is encouraging consumers to play an active role in supporting sustainable packaging practices. Simbarikure suggests opting for reusable materials, such as dishes and other food containers, as an eco-friendly alternative to single-use and non-biodegradable options. This shift in consumer behavior not only aligns with RICA's directive but also contributes to the broader global movement towards reducing plastic waste and promoting environmentally conscious choices.




RICA acknowledges the importance of public awareness and education in ensuring the success of this initiative. By informing consumers about the environmental and legal implications of using non-compliant packaging materials, RICA aims to foster a sense of responsibility among citizens. Educational campaigns will be crucial in dispelling misconceptions and encouraging a more sustainable approach to meat packaging.




As Rwanda takes a bold step towards aligning its meat packaging practices with environmentally friendly and legally compliant standards, it sets a precedent for responsible and sustainable consumption. The collaboration between regulatory authorities, businesses, and consumers is pivotal in creating a positive impact on both the quality of meat products and the overall well-being of the environment. Through these concerted efforts, Rwanda is poised to become a model for sustainable practices in the meat industry, showcasing the benefits of harmonizing economic activities with ecological responsibility.

SCHWARZENEGGER'S AIRPORT DETENTION: LUXURY WATCH AND CHARITABLE INTENTIONS

07:00, 2024-01-23

In a surprising turn of events, legendary actor and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger found himself detained by customs officers at Munich airport. The reason? His failure to declare a luxury watch, a custom piece by Swiss watchmaker Audemars Piguet. The incident unfolded as authorities could not locate any supporting documents for the prized timepiece, leading to a three-hour ordeal for the 76-year-old icon.




Schwarzenegger, known for his larger-than-life persona, was sporting a specially customized Audemars Piguet watch as he traveled. The watch, tailored to his taste, added a touch of sophistication to his ensemble. However, what was meant to be a smooth journey took an unexpected turn at the Munich airport.




Customs officers, upon discovering the unreported luxury watch, detained Schwarzenegger for three hours. The actor had not filled out the necessary declaration form for carrying high-value items, prompting an investigation by the authorities. The absence of proper documentation raised concerns, leading to the initiation of a procedure that would unfold in the following hours.




Upon being questioned about the watch, Schwarzenegger revealed that he was en route to Austria for a noble cause. The 76-year-old icon was heading to Kitzbuhel for a charity auction. The auction aimed to raise funds for The Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative, a foundation supporting climate projects globally.




As the customs officers delved into the matter, Schwarzenegger attempted to pay the necessary taxes for the watch. However, complications arose when the airport's credit card machine malfunctioned, hindering the payment process. In an effort to resolve the issue, the actor was escorted to an ATM, only to find that the withdrawal limit was insufficient.




After several hours of attempts, a functioning credit card machine was finally brought in by the customs officers. The ordeal highlighted the bureaucratic challenges faced by even high-profile individuals in adhering to customs procedures.




The actor clarified that the luxury watch was intended for the charity auction in Austria. Once auctioned, the proceeds would be directed towards The Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative, where he assured that proper documentation and reporting would be undertaken once the watch found its new owner through the auction.




Despite the charitable intentions behind carrying the watch, a shadow of suspicion looms as a criminal procedure investigation for possible tax evasion is underway. The customs spokesperson confirmed that authorities are diligently examining the circumstances surrounding the incident.




Arnold Schwarzenegger's detention at Munich airport sheds light on the complexities and challenges individuals face when transporting valuable items. Despite facing hurdles, the actor's commitment to charitable causes remains evident, as the luxury watch was destined for a noble purpose. As the investigation unfolds, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of adhering to customs procedures, even for those in the spotlight.

TENSIONS ESCALATE: PAKISTAN RECALLS AMBASSADOR FROM IRAN AMID SOARING DISPUTES.

14:45, 2024-01-18

In a dramatic turn of events, Pakistan has announced the recall of its ambassador from Iran, signaling a deepening diplomatic crisis between the two neighboring nations. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry, in a statement released on Wednesday 17 January, condemned what it described as an "unprovoked and blatant breach" of its sovereignty by Iran, declaring the act a violation of international law and the principles outlined in the Charter of the United Nations.




The Ministry further elaborated that the Iranian ambassador to Pakistan, currently in Iran, "may not return for the time being," heightening tensions between the two nations.

The breaking point in relations came after an alleged violation of Pakistan's airspace by Iran, resulting in the tragic loss of two Pakistani children and injuries to three girls. The incident, which occurred on Tuesday 16 January, has intensified the rift between the two nations, prompting Pakistan to take swift diplomatic measures in response.

As a direct consequence of the escalating situation, Pakistan has decided to suspend all ongoing and planned high-level visits between the two countries in the coming days. This move underscores the severity of the diplomatic fallout and reflects Pakistan's commitment to addressing the breach of its sovereignty through diplomatic channels.




Adding to the complexity of the situation, Iran's Tasnim news agency reported that missile and drone strikes targeted two significant bases of the Jaish al-Zulm "terrorist group" in Pakistan on Tuesday. The nature and scope of these strikes have not only intensified the ongoing tensions but have also brought allegations of cross-border military actions into play.

The international community is closely watching the developments between Pakistan and Iran, as both countries have been historically significant players in the region. The recall of ambassadors, suspension of high-level visits, and the reported military actions have raised concerns about the stability of the already delicate geopolitical balance in the area.

As the situation unfolds, there is a growing need for diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions and establish a platform for dialogue between Pakistan and Iran. The coming days will likely determine the trajectory of relations between these two nations, with the potential for broader regional implications.

THE HOUSE OF COMMONS PASSES THE RWANDA -UK ASSAYLUM BILL ; WHAT NEXT ?

14:30, 2024-01-18

In a significant move aimed at reshaping the UK's approach to asylum seekers, the House of Commons approved a new migration bill on Wednesday, January 17, declaring Rwanda as a safe country for those seeking refuge. The bill, presented by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, addresses concerns raised by the UK Supreme Court regarding the potential risk faced by asylum seekers sent to Rwanda.




The impetus for this legislation stems from the UK Supreme Court's ruling, which highlighted the risks associated with sending asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda, potentially leading them to be returned to their countries of origin. Despite facing opposition from some Members of Parliament within Sunak's own Conservative Party, the bill successfully passed the third reading in the Commons, securing a majority of 44 for the government, with 320 votes in favor and 276 against.

The next hurdle for the legislation is the House of Lords, where further debates and discussions will shape the final outcome. Prime Minister Sunak emphasizes that the proposed migration partnership with Rwanda plays a pivotal role in addressing concerns related to illegal migrants arriving in the UK, particularly through the English Channel.




The urgency of this legislative move is underscored by the rising number of individuals crossing the English Channel on small boats. In 2022, this figure exceeded 45,700, with many being lured by criminal gangs with promises of job opportunities, as reported by the UK government.

On December 5, 2023, the UK and Rwandan governments solidified their commitment to this migration partnership by signing a new treaty. The treaty, signed in Kigali by UK Home Secretary James Cleverly and Rwanda's Foreign Minister Vincent Biruta, seeks to reinforce the provisions of the initial partnership established in April 2022. One notable aspect of the treaty is the creation of an appeals tribunal in Rwanda, providing asylum seekers sent from the UK the opportunity to appeal if their asylum claims are rejected.




This move reflects a concerted effort by both nations to establish a fair and secure process for asylum seekers, addressing concerns raised by the judiciary and laying the groundwork for a comprehensive migration partnership that aligns with international standards of human rights and asylum protection. As the bill progresses to the House of Lords, further deliberations will shape the final contours of this groundbreaking legislation.

STRENGTHENING ECONOMIC TIES: ISRAEL-RWANDA ECONOMIC FORUM WEBINAR HIGHLIGHTS POTENTIALS.

12:45, 2024-01-18

In an online event on January 18, the Israel-Rwanda Economic Forum webinar brought together over 180 Israeli companies and businesses eager to explore the economic landscape of Rwanda. Despite challenges, the webinar showcased the resilience of both nations, demonstrating a shared commitment to fostering meaningful collaborations beyond the scope of import and export.




The Rwanda Development Board played a pivotal role in providing a comprehensive business overview of Rwanda, emphasizing opportunities across various sectors. The conversation extended beyond traditional business discussions, emphasizing mutual growth and partnership. Key sectors highlighted during the webinar included agro-business, information and communication technology (ICT), and health.

Israeli Ambassador to Rwanda, Ms Einat Weiss, expressed her satisfaction with the event's success, noting the resilience displayed by both sides amid the challenges, including ongoing conflicts. In an interview with City Radio, Ambassador Weiss stated, "I was happy that this was a success because this shows resilience on both sides, with Israel at war but businesses looking forward to making big moves showing interest in Africa, but also exposing the potential that Rwanda has."




Ambassador Weiss emphasized the importance of the collaboration, citing previous successful partnerships in the security sector. She highlighted Rwanda's favorable position compared to other African countries, praising its governance, investment opportunities, and its role as a key player in East Africa.

"Rwanda is ahead, I would say, compared to most countries on the continent in terms of governance, investment opportunity, but above all, East Africa in general but also Rwanda has amazing employees which is also cheaper than brining in expats," Ambassador Weiss added.

The webinar served as a strategic effort to strengthen ties between Rwanda and Israel, which emerged as a top priority for Ambassador Weiss, despite initial challenges posed by the conflict in Israel. The Israeli business participants expressed hope and eagerness to turn the discussions into tangible collaborations, exploring avenues in research, agriculture, health, and ICT.




The Rwanda Development Board sees this collaboration as a significant advantage, opening up Rwanda as a new potential for business and solidifying the nation's position as Africa's business hub. The forum not only marks a milestone in diplomatic relations but also symbolizes the potential for economic growth and cooperation between two nations committed to fostering innovation and prosperity.

PRESIDENT PAUL KAGAME MEETS US SECRETARY OF STATE ANTHONY BLINKEN TO DISCUSS REGIONAL PEACE AT DAVOS.

13:59, 2024-01-17

On Tuesday, January 16, President Paul Kagame engaged in a crucial discussion with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The meeting aimed at fostering ongoing cooperation between the United States and Rwanda to ensure sustainable peace in the region by addressing the root causes of conflicts. The dialogue reflects the commitment of both nations to finding diplomatic solutions to regional challenges.




The recent meeting follows a visit to Rwanda by Avril Haines, the Director of National Intelligence, in November 2023. During this visit, discussions focused on de-escalating tensions between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) and addressing the underlying issues contributing to the security situation in eastern DR Congo, where the government coalition is combating the M23 rebels.




DR Congo has accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebels in the country's east, an accusation firmly dismissed by Kigali, asserting that the rebellion is an internal Congolese matter. In turn, Rwanda accuses the Congolese army of collaborating with the genocidal Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militia, posing a significant threat to regional security.

The FDLR, formed by remnants of the Interahamwe militia and the former Rwandan army involved in the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, continues to be a source of tension between the two nations.




Incidents along the Rwanda-DR Congo border have escalated, with Congolese warplanes violating Rwandan airspace multiple times between November 2022 and January 2023. These provocations included rocket shells landing on Rwandan territory, resulting in civilian injuries.

The most recent incident occurred on Tuesday, January 16, when three armed Congolese soldiers crossed into Rwanda. Two were apprehended, while one was fatally shot after opening fire on Rwandan soldiers, underscoring the volatility of the situation along the border.




President Kagame's meeting with Secretary Blinken signifies a commitment to diplomatic channels in addressing regional conflicts. The discussions centered on promoting sustainable peace, de-escalating tensions, and finding lasting solutions to the complex issues between Rwanda and DR Congo. As the international community watches closely, it remains hopeful that these diplomatic efforts will pave the way for stability and cooperation in the region.

14:37, 2024-01-16

In a swift turn of events, the Tanzanian Civil Aviation Authority has rescinded its decision to suspend Kenya Airways from its airspace, signaling a diplomatic breakthrough just hours after the suspension was announced as part of a tit-for-tat exchange.

The suspension, initially slated to take effect from January 22, has been withdrawn following Kenya's response to Tanzania's demands. In a statement released by Hamza Johari, the Director General of the Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority, it was revealed that Kenya has granted the Fifth Freedom Traffic Right to Air Tanzania Company Limited for all-cargo services, aligning with the requests of the United Republic of Tanzania. This change is effective from January 16, 2024.




“This is to inform the public that the aeronautical authorities of the Republic of Kenya have granted the Fifth Freedom Traffic Right to Air Tanzania Company Limited for all-cargo service as per the request of the United Republic of Tanzania," the statement reads.

Tanzania had initially blocked Kenya Airways from flying to Dar es Salaam, citing a reciprocity dispute after Kenya declined a request for all-cargo flight operations by Air Tanzania Company Limited.




In response to Kenya's compliance, Mr. Johari stated, "Following this development, the aeronautical authorities of the United Republic of Tanzania hereby withdraw its decision of January 15, 2024, and therefore approval for Kenya Airways to operate Third and Fourth Freedom Traffic Rights between Nairobi and Dar es Salaam is hereby restored with immediate effect.”

The diplomatic tension prompted swift action, with Kenya and Tanzania committing to resolving the dispute. Prime Cabinet Secretary and CS for Foreign Affairs, Musalia Mudavadi, and Tanzania’s Minister for Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, January Makamba, affirmed their commitment to working together to settle the matter amicably within the next three days.




Mudavadi stated, "We have jointly agreed that our respective Civil Aviation Authorities will work together to have the matter resolved amicably within the next three days. There should, therefore, be no cause for alarm."

Makamba echoed the sentiment, saying, “I spoke to my Kenyan colleague Musalia Mudavadi. We agree that restrictions of air travel between our countries and from any of our countries to a third country shouldn’t stand. With relevant authorities, we’ve resolved to settle this issue, per existing agreements, within 3 days.”

This rapid resolution showcases the diplomatic agility of both nations, emphasizing their commitment to maintaining cordial relations and adhering to established agreements.

RWANDA REVENUE AUTHORITY PARTNER WITH UNDP AND GENDER MONITORING OFFICE TO LAUNCH GENDER EQUALITY SEAL: THEY AIM FOR PLATINUM SEAL.

14:43, 2024-01-15

In a significant move towards fostering gender equality in the workplaces, the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA)enrolled in the Gender Equality Seal (GES) programme which was launched on 15 Jan , an initiative established by the United Nations in 2018. This initiative aims to bridge gender gaps in both private and public sectors, with a particular focus on promoting equality in workspaces. Rwanda Revenue's commitment to gender equality in tax administration is underscored by its dedication to extensive research and being the first African country to produce a sex-disaggregated data.




In a conversation with Innocente MURASI, the Commissioner for Strategy and Risk Analysis at RRA, she expressed the organization's ambitious goals. "We are ambitiously working to not just be a world tax administration, which pushes us to set this one straight, despite being a new entrant," she stated. This commitment reflects Rwanda Revenue Authority's determination to be a trailblazer in the global effort towards gender equality.




Commissioner MURASI further highlighted the potential impact of this initiative on achieving tax collection targets in the near future, by actively participating in the GES programme, RRA aims to enhance its effectiveness not only in promoting gender equality but also in meeting its financial objectives.

Technical Assistance from UNDP and Gender Monitoring Office:

The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Gender Monitoring Office will provide technical assistance to RRA through the GES programme. The program was officially launched with the formation of a committee chaired by MUKASE Josiane, who is currently Ag. Director in charge of People Management in the HR department at Rwanda Revenue. This collaboration seeks to mainstream gender equality principles in tax administration, contributing to a more inclusive fiscal sector.




While at the launch, KIRENGA Clement, the National Coordinator for Inclusion at UNDP, emphasized the synergy created by the Gender Equality Seal. ''The program sets a standard recognized by the UNDP world over, awarding private and public sector entities based on their efforts towards gender equality and mainstreaming.'' Clement stated.

This aligns with the broader goal of creating a more inclusive fiscal sector in Rwanda. He added




This should be remembered that Gender Equality Seal (GES), with its varying levels of recognition from bronze to platinum, offers distinct advantages to national authorities like Rwanda Revenue. Berni Smith, the Strategic Advisor to the Commissioner General of Rwanda Revenue and a tax lawyer, highlighted the uniqueness of this commitment. She stated, "The commitment and dedication of the team at Rwanda Revenue Authority, coupled with the partnership with UNDP, make them gender equality leaders among revenue authorities not only on the continent but worldwide."




Rwanda Revenue Authority's enrollment in the Gender Equality Seal programme represents a pivotal step towards fostering an inclusive workplace and bridging gender gaps in the tax administration sector. This commitment not only positions RRA as a leader in the global push for gender equality but also underlines its dedication to achieving excellence in tax collection through an inclusive and diverse workforce.

DEVELOPING ;BURUNDI SHUTS BORDER WITH RWANDA AMIDST ACCUSATIONS OF SUPPORT.

15:37, 2024-01-11

In a significant development, Burundi has officially closed its border with Rwanda, just under two weeks after accusing its neighbor of supporting rebels responsible for attacks on Burundian soil. The closure follows an attack by the RED-Tabara group near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on December 22, resulting in the tragic loss of 20 lives, including women and children.

President Evariste Ndayishimiye has explicitly accused Rwanda of backing the rebels, a claim vehemently denied by the Rwandan government. The tensions have escalated to the point where Burundi's Interior Minister, Martin Niteretse, declared the closure of the border during a press briefing on Thursday 11,January..




"We have closed our borders (with Rwanda), anyone who tries to go there will not get through. The decision has been made," announced Interior Minister Martin Niteretse. He went on to state that the decision was prompted by the perceived support from Rwanda to the RED-Tabara group, accusing Rwanda of harboring criminals that pose a threat to Burundians.




This comes shortly after President Ndayishimiye expressed his disappointment in the relationship with Rwandan President Paul Kagame, stating, "After having noted that we had a bad neighbor, Paul Kagame... we stopped all relations with him until he returns to better feelings." The Burundian government insists that Rwanda shelters criminals responsible for harming Burundians.




For some time now Burundi-Rwanda relations have been historically tumultuous, with occasional periods of improvement. While ties showed signs of betterment after Ndayishimiye assumed power in 2020 and reopening of the borders in 2022, recent events surrounding Burundi's alleged involvement in the DRC have strained relations once again.




Rwanda on the other hand, continues to deny any involvement with the RED-Tabara group. In a rebuttal, Rwandan authorities referenced an incident in 2019 when the Rwandan Defence Forces (RDF) repatriated suspected rebels to Burundi for prosecution.

These latest developments underscore the fragility of diplomatic relations between the two East African nations and raise concerns about the potential impact on regional stability, tras border businesses and the movement of persons. The international community will be closely watching the situation unfold as efforts to de-escalate tensions and seek diplomatic solutions are anticipated.

The year 2024 looms as a crucial juncture for democracy on the global stage, as more than 50 countries, collectively home to half the world's population, prepare for national elections. While the exercise of the right to vote is a fundamental democratic principle, the upcoming elections come with a nuanced backdrop. From Russia to Taiwan, the United Kingdom to India, El Salvador to South Africa, these elections hold immense significance, impacting human rights, economies, international relations, and global peace. However, the challenges faced by democracies worldwide are diverse, testing their resilience and providing fertile ground for leaders with authoritarian inclinations.




In several countries, the promise of free and fair elections is marred by challenges that raise concerns about the integrity of the democratic process. From curbs on opposition candidates to weary electorates, the fate of democracy itself becomes a central theme in these campaigns. The delicate balance between the principles of democracy and the potential for manipulation and disinformation creates a complex landscape for citizens and leaders alike.




Countries such as Russia, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom find themselves at the epicenter of political maelstroms, where the outcomes of both presidential and legislative contests carry far-reaching consequences. The choices made by voters in these nations have the power to shape human rights standards, influence economies, and redefine international relationships in an increasingly volatile world.




As citizens cast their votes, the impact on human rights cannot be overstated. The choices made at the ballot box will shape the policies and approaches taken by future leaders, potentially either advancing or jeopardizing the rights and freedoms of individuals. The struggles for democracy in countries facing challenges to the fairness of their electoral processes become a microcosm of the broader fight for human rights worldwide.




The economic outlook of nations, as well as their standing in the international community, hinges on the outcomes of these elections. Leaders elected in 2024 will be tasked with navigating the complexities of global interdependence and addressing challenges ranging from economic disparities to geopolitical tensions. The choices made by voters will ripple through the global economy and set the tone for diplomatic relations in an ever-changing geopolitical landscape.




In a world marked by volatility, the electoral choices made in 2024 will play a pivotal role in determining prospects for peace. The leaders emerging from these elections will carry the responsibility of fostering stability and dialogue in regions facing geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, or humanitarian crises. The global community watches with bated breath, hoping that the democratic processes in these nations contribute to the pursuit of peace on a worldwide scale.




As more than 50 countries brace for national elections in 2024, the state of democracy is under scrutiny. The challenges faced by democracies, from potential manipulations to the erosion of civic engagement, are evident. The outcomes of these elections will reverberate globally, influencing the course of human rights, shaping economies, steering international relations, and determining prospects for peace. The resilience of democracies will be tested, and the choices made by voters will set the trajectory for the future, defining the state of democracy in the years to come.

"SAFETY CONCERNS FORCE GROUNDING OF BOEING 737 MAX 9 FLEET FOLLOWING FUSELAGE INCIDENT"

09:28, 2024-01-10

In a significant development in the aviation industry, a number of Boeing Co. 737 Max 9 aircraft have been grounded in the United States, affecting a total of 171 similar planes globally. The move comes in the aftermath of an alarming incident where the fuselage section of a brand-new Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet blew out shortly after takeoff, prompting concerns about the safety of these aircraft.




The incident involved an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet, and reports indicate that the fuselage section experienced a catastrophic failure, resulting in a noticeable hole in the aircraft. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that Alaska Airlines, the world's second-largest operator of the 737 Max 9 type, has already taken the proactive step of grounding its entire Max 9 fleet following the incident. The event occurred after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, raising questions about the safety and integrity of these aircraft.




FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker emphasized that safety remains the top priority in the decision-making process. In a statement on X, he mentioned that the FAA will collaborate with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in investigating Alaska Airlines Flight 1282. The forced grounding of the 737 Max 9 fleet is considered one of the most severe responses to an incident since the temporary grounding of the entire Max aircraft fleet in 2019 following two tragic crashes.




It's crucial to remember that the 737 Max is Boeing's flagship aircraft, representing a significant portion of the company's revenue. Following the 2019 incidents, the entire Max aircraft fleet was temporarily taken out of service. The current grounding of the 737 Max 9 fleet brings renewed attention to the safety concerns surrounding Boeing's popular aircraft, posing challenges for the company in maintaining its reputation and ensuring passenger confidence.




The Boeing 737 Max series, including the Max 9, plays a central role in global air travel, particularly on shorter routes. The forced grounding of a significant number of these aircraft will undoubtedly have ripple effects on airline operations, potentially leading to disruptions and increased scrutiny of the safety protocols surrounding the 737 Max models.




As the investigation unfolds and regulatory authorities work to determine the cause of the fuselage incident, the aviation industry faces a critical moment. The grounding of the Boeing 737 Max 9 fleet highlights the paramount importance of safety in air travel and raises questions about the long-term implications for Boeing as it navigates the challenges associated with maintaining the trust of both airlines and passengers alike.

"ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL JUSTICE INVANTION ; RWANDA'S PLEA BARGAINING EMPTIES 5000 CASE BACKLOG''

07:45, 2024-01-10

In a remarkable turn of events, Rwanda has achieved significant success in its justice system with over 5,000 cases closed through plea bargains within just over a year since the introduction of this innovative legal procedure. Judicial data reveals that from August to December 2023 alone, more than 4,000 cases were successfully resolved through plea bargains. This article explores the impact of plea bargaining in Rwanda, its evolution since its introduction in October 2022, and the potential implications for the country's legal landscape.




The Concept of Plea Bargaining:

Plea bargaining, introduced as a new operational procedure in Rwanda in October 2022, involves negotiations between the prosecution and defense. Under this process, the defendant agrees to plead guilty to specific charges in exchange for a more lenient sentence or other possibilities, such as the dismissal of charges. Initially applied in cases of assault and theft, the procedure was designed for a five-year pilot phase in five intermediate courts. However, due to its success, officials at the judiciary decided to implement it nationwide.

Rapid Expansion and Impressive Statistics:

The statistics speak for themselves, showcasing the rapid expansion of plea bargaining in Rwanda. Over 1,500 cases were closed during the earlier stages of the year and the latter part of 2022, and an astonishing 4,000 cases were resolved from August to December 2023. The last quarter of 2023 witnessed a substantial number of cases closed through plea bargains, with October recording 960 cases, November 1,166, and December 795. These numbers underline the efficiency and effectiveness of this new legal procedure.




Optimism for the Future:

Harrison Mutabazi, the judiciary’s spokesperson, expressed optimism about the early performance of the plea bargaining system, foreseeing improved future outcomes. The success of plea bargaining is not just in the sheer number of cases closed but also in its potential to transform the judicial process in Rwanda.

PROS of Plea Bargaining:

Plea bargaining offers several advantages that contribute to its success in Rwanda. Firstly, it facilitates the obtaining of crucial information from suspects, aiding in the fight against organized crime. Moreover, it expedites justice delivery, reducing court backlogs and prison overcrowding by minimizing the number of cases that reach courts or prisons. This streamlined approach not only benefits the legal system but also ensures a more efficient and timely resolution for both victims and defendants.




Rwanda's experience with plea bargaining serves as a testament to the potential benefits of innovative legal procedures in the pursuit of justice. With more cases closed within just over a year, the success of plea bargaining not only highlights its effectiveness in resolving cases but also suggests a positive transformation in the country's legal landscape. As Rwanda continues to refine and expand this approach, it sets a noteworthy example for other jurisdictions considering similar reforms in the justice systems

AU COMMISSION CHAIR URGES CALM AMIDST ETHIOPIA-SOMALILAND PORT ACCESS DEAL

10:53, 2024-01-08

The Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Amb. Moussa Faki Mahamat, has issued a statement calling for calm and mutual respect to ease the escalating tensions between the governments of Ethiopia and Somalia. This follows the recent signing of a port access deal between Ethiopia and the unrecognised state of Somaliland.

Somaliland, situated in the Horn of Africa, is internationally regarded as a de jure part of Somalia despite its lack of official recognition as an independent state. The Chairperson's statement, released yesterday, addresses the need for diplomatic composure in light of the unfolding situation.




The controversial agreement, inked on January 1, involves Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Somaliland leader Muse Bihi Abdi. The deal grants Ethiopia a 20-kilometer radius around the port of Berbera on the Somaliland side, providing crucial access to the Red Sea for both naval and commercial purposes.

In return for this strategic access, Somaliland's President Muse Bihi announced that Ethiopia would officially recognize Somaliland as an independent state. This historic move positions Somaliland as the first country to receive such recognition.




Former Minister of Somalia, Abdi Ynate, shared his perspective on the deal, emphasizing the prevalent negative sentiment surrounding the agreement. Despite the potential ramifications, the Ethiopian political analyst, Gilum Chala, offered a different viewpoint.

In an interview, Chala acknowledged the widespread criticism but highlighted potential positive outcomes for Ethiopia, including expanded naval capabilities and enhanced economic opportunities. This diverse range of opinions underscores the complexity of the situation and the necessity for nuanced consideration.

As the diplomatic landscape continues to evolve, Amb. Moussa Faki Mahamat's call for calm and mutual respect resonates as a crucial reminder of the importance of diplomatic dialogue and constructive engagement.

10:28, 2024-01-08

In a bid to meet the growing water demand projected for 2050, Rwanda is set with the challenge of securing at least $400 million annually, according to the Water and Sanitation Cooperation (WASAC). As of now, up to 82 percent of Rwandan households have access to drinking water, with the government aiming to achieve 100 percent coverage by 2024.

With Rwanda's population expected to surpass 23 million by 2052, the need for water infrastructure development has become paramount. Prof Omar Munyaneza, CEO of WASAC, emphasizes the urgency for the government to plan and execute water-related projects each year to meet the rising demand.




In a positive turn of events, the African Development Bank (AfDB) granted approval for a substantial financial injection on December 1. A total of up to $274 million (over Rwf340 billion) has been allocated for Rwanda's water access and sanitation projects. This significant funding infusion is poised to accelerate the government's efforts in achieving its 2024 target.

Speaking on the development, Prof Munyaneza expressed optimism, stating that the AfDB's financial support would play a crucial role in realizing Rwanda's goals for water accessibility and sanitation. The approved funds will contribute to the implementation of essential projects, addressing the pressing water needs of Rwanda's expanding population.




As the government collaborates with international partners to secure the necessary resources, attention is being drawn to sustainable and efficient water management strategies. The proactive measures undertaken by Rwanda and the support from the AfDB signal a commitment to ensuring that the growing population's water requirements are met in an environmentally conscious and sustainable manner.




The approved funds will not only boost infrastructure development but are also expected to create employment opportunities and stimulate economic growth. The collective efforts between Rwanda and the AfDB underscore the importance of international collaboration in addressing critical issues such as water accessibility and sanitation.

In conclusion, while Rwanda faces the financial challenge of meeting the escalating water demand, the recent support from the AfDB marks a significant step forward. With strategic planning and efficient project execution, Rwanda aims to provide adequate water access for its population and achieve its ambitious targets.

TRAGEDY STRIKES IN KERMAN: TWIN BLASTS NEAR SOLEIMANI'S GRAVE CLAIM 103 LIVES AND INJURE 141

12:49, 2024-01-03

In a horrific turn of events, at least 103 people lost their lives and 141 others were left injured on Wednesday in the Iranian city of Kerman, following twin blasts near the burial site of the late military commander, Qasem Soleimani. Officials are labeling the incident as a terror attack, leaving the nation in shock and mourning.

The first explosion occurred a mere 2,300 feet (700 meters) from Soleimani's grave, while the second blast, striking 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) away, added to the chaos as pilgrims visited the revered site. Soleimani, a prominent Iranian military figure, was taken out by a US airstrike ordered by former President Donald Trump at Baghdad International Airport exactly four years ago on this fateful Wednesday.




As the city grapples with the aftermath, the Iranian state media, IRNA, reported the Deputy Governor for Political and Security expressing uncertainty regarding the cause of the incident, stating, "It's unclear if the incident was caused by a gas explosion or a terrorist attack." No group has claimed responsibility for the devastating twin blasts at this time.

The tragic scenes unfolded as videos circulated on Iranian state media, depicting large crowds frantically running in the area following the explosions. The streets, once filled with pilgrims paying respects to Soleimani, became a scene of chaos and sorrow as emergency services rushed to the site to attend to the wounded and manage the aftermath.




The international community watches with concern as Iran grapples with the aftermath of this apparent act of terror. The incident raises questions about the ongoing geopolitical tensions in the region and the potential for further repercussions. As investigations unfold to determine the perpetrators and motives behind the attack, the people of Kerman and the entire nation mourn the loss of lives in this devastating and heart-wrenching event.

SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS CONTROVERSIAL POWERS FOR RWANDA INVESTIGATION BUREAU IN LANDMARK RULING

12:25, 2024-01-03

In a groundbreaking decision, the Supreme Court of Rwanda has ruled in favor of allowing the Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB) to conduct searches on persons, buildings, and premises without the need for court warrants, provided investigators believe there are reasonable grounds for suspecting criminal activity.

The ruling comes in response to a petition filed by city lawyer Edward Murangwa, who challenged the constitutionality of certain provisions within the 2017 law that established RIB and outlined its mission, powers, organization, and functioning.




Central to Murangwa's argument was his opposition to the 10th article of the law, which grants investigators the authority to "search any person or property, enter premises without a warrant" if there are reasonable grounds to suspect a criminal act is being committed or is about to be committed, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe the premises house a criminal suspect or an object used in committing a crime.

Murangwa contended that such provisions contravene several articles of the constitution, including the 13th one, which emphasizes the sanctity and inviolability of an individual, asserting that the state is obligated to respect, protect, and defend the person.




The Supreme Court's decision marks a significant development in the ongoing debate over the balance between law enforcement powers and individual rights. Proponents argue that granting RIB expanded search powers without warrants is crucial for effective crime prevention and investigation, especially in cases where immediate action is deemed necessary.




On the other hand, critics, including Murangwa, express concerns about potential violations of constitutional rights, raising questions about the delicate balance between ensuring national security and safeguarding individual liberties. The court's ruling, therefore, not only settles a legal dispute but also sets a precedent that will likely shape the landscape of law enforcement practices and civil liberties in Rwanda. The decision is poised to spark further discussions on the fine line between security measures and the protection of individual rights in the pursuit of justice.

UGANDAN GOVERNMENT TAKES KENYA TO COURT OVER DENIAL OF IMPORT LICENSE TO STATE-OWNED OIL COMPANY.

11:39, 2024-01-03

In a fresh legal battle between neighboring countries, the Ugandan Government has taken its Kenyan counterpart to court for allegedly denying an import license to Uganda's state-owned oil import company. The move has intensified tensions between the two nations, as the dispute revolves around Uganda's efforts to gain control over its oil imports.

The Ugandan National Oil Company, empowered by a parliamentary mandate late last year, sought to take charge of importing and distributing oil and oil products within the country. The primary objective was to stabilize markets and control fuel prices at the pumps. However, the Kenyan Government contends that it has not completed a thorough evaluation of the license issuance process.




Uganda alleges that Kenya has backtracked on an earlier commitment, forged in April of the preceding year, to support Kampala's initiative to directly import fuel starting this month. President Museveni, expressing dissatisfaction with Kenya's stance, has accused Kenyan middlemen of influencing the high pump prices in Kampala, even as global commodity prices for oil continue to decline.

The legal dispute raises questions about the bilateral agreements and commitments made between the two nations. Uganda argues that Kenya's failure to honor its pledge has significant implications for Uganda's economic strategy and the stability of its fuel market.




The courtroom battle is expected to shed light on the intricacies of the oil import process and the diplomatic relations between Uganda and Kenya. As the case unfolds, the international community will keenly observe the outcome, considering the potential impact on regional economic dynamics and cooperation between neighboring countries.

OPPOSITION CANDIDATE CONGOLESE POLICE OF EXCESSIVE FORCE DURING AND ELECTION PROTEST

05:36, 2023-12-28

In a tense turn of events, Martin Fayulu, a prominent opposition candidate in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has accused the police of employing live bullets to disperse a protest in the capital city. The demonstration, which took place on Wednesday, saw impassioned supporters demanding a re-run of last week's presidential election.

Fayulu, holding up a bullet during a press conference, asserted that it had landed near him while he was barricaded inside his campaign headquarters during a standoff with the police. However, the authenticity of his claim remains unverified at this time.




The protest unfolded amid escalating tensions following the recent presidential election. Supporters of Martin Fayulu, who allege irregularities and fraud in the election process, took to the streets to voice their demands for a transparent and fair re-do of the polls.

Fayulu's Claims:

During a press briefing, Martin Fayulu spoke out against what he deemed excessive force by the police. Holding a bullet as evidence, he claimed that live ammunition was used against protesters, creating a volatile and dangerous situation. His allegations raise concerns about the potential escalation of violence and the impact on the democratic process in the country.




In contrast to Fayulu's claims, the Congolese police issued a statement denying the use of live bullets, asserting that only tear gas was deployed to restore order. However, on-the-ground reports from journalists present at the scene tell a different story. Eyewitness accounts reveal instances of physical assault by the police against some of the demonstrators.




The conflicting narratives surrounding the events make it challenging to ascertain the accuracy of the claims made by both parties. The situation calls for an independent investigation to determine the facts surrounding the alleged use of live ammunition and the reported police brutality during the protest.




The unfolding events have raised concerns among the international community, with calls for a peaceful resolution to the political crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Various international bodies and diplomatic entities are closely monitoring the situation, emphasizing the importance of upholding democratic principles and ensuring the safety and well-being of the Congolese people. As the situation continues to develop, the world watches closely, hoping for a peaceful and democratic resolution to the ongoing political turmoil in the Democratic Republic of Cong

BRIDGING CREATIVITY AND EMPOWEREMENT: MINISTRY OF YOUTH TAKES THE REINS OF ARTS PORTFOLIO

14:04, 2023-12-21

In a strategic move towards fostering youth economic empowerment, the Ministry of Youth has assumed control of the arts portfolio, previously under the domain of the Ministry of National Unity and Civic Engagement (MINUBUMWE). This significant shift in administrative oversight aims to consolidate efforts and resources directed towards the vibrant and dynamic landscape of the creative industry.




The decision to unite the arts portfolio with the Ministry of Youth is rooted in the recognition that a substantial majority of individuals shaping the creative sphere are young people. Sandrine Umutoni, the Minister of State for Youth and Arts, underscored the logic behind this transformative decision, emphasizing the need to align the portfolios that contribute most to youth economic empowerment.

"With the majority of creative industry professionals being young, it was a natural progression to bring these portfolios together," stated Minister Umutoni. This amalgamation seeks to create a more seamless and efficient management structure for these interdependent sectors, streamlining efforts for a more impactful youth-focused agenda.




Minister Umutoni articulated that this strategic alignment not only acknowledges the significant role of young people in the creative industries but also positions the government to better support and nurture their talents. The move signifies a commitment to recognizing the youth as major contributors to the creative tapestry of the nation.

Under the newly christened Ministry of Youth and Arts, concrete plans are underway to implement tailored initiatives and strategies aimed at empowering young artists and entrepreneurs within the creative sector. A key aspect of this initiative involves the development of a comprehensive strategic plan that takes into account the unique characteristics of each demographic within the youth population.

Minister Umutoni expressed enthusiasm for the future, stating, "By consolidating the creative sector under the same ministry as youth empowerment, we are sending a powerful message. We are investing in the potential of our young people, recognizing their pivotal role in shaping the cultural and economic landscape of our nation."




The newly forged Ministry of Youth and Arts is poised to usher in a new era of collaboration and support for the budding talents within the creative industry.

JUSTICE FINALLY SERVED; THE BUTCHER OF TUMBA, SOSTHENE MUNYEMAN SENT TO PRISON FOR 24 YEARS.

14:59, 2023-12-20

The Cour d’assises de Paris has rendered a historic verdict, sentencing Sosthène Munyemana, infamously known as the 'Butcher of Tumba,' to 24 years in prison for his role in the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi. The ruling marks a significant milestone in the pursuit of justice for the atrocities committed during one of the darkest chapters in human history.

A trained medical doctor, Munyemana was implicated in heinous acts during the genocide while working as a lecturer in the faculty of medicine at the University of Rwanda. Additionally, he served as a gynecologist at the University Hospital in Butare (CHUB). His active involvement in the genocide led to his notorious moniker, the 'Butcher of Tumba.'




The French court's sentencing comes after a protracted legal process. Munyemana, aged 68, has resided in France for over two decades, despite an outstanding indictment for the genocide crimes he was accused of committing. The trial commenced on November 14, spanning over a month of hearings before the court delivered its sentence on Tuesday.

Immediately following the verdict, Munyemana was placed under arrest, despite having a 10-day window to appeal the sentence, as per reports from the European country. The ruling is a testament to the persistence of international efforts to hold individuals accountable for their roles in the genocide.




The trial, which delved into the intricate details of Munyemana's actions during the genocide, brought to light the magnitude of the crimes committed against the Tutsi population. The sentencing reaffirms the international community's commitment to pursuing justice and ensuring that those responsible for genocide are held accountable, regardless of the passage of time.

As Sosthène Munyemana begins his prison term, survivors of the genocide and advocates for justice find solace in the recognition of the atrocities and a step towards closure for the victims and their families. The verdict sends a powerful message that impunity for such heinous crimes will not be tolerated, even after decades have passed.

In a close-of-the-year press conference held at the City Hall offices, the picturesque city of Kigali welcomed its newly appointed mayor, Samuel Dusengiyumva, who succeeds Pudence Rubingisa. The event not only marked the ushering in of new leadership but also addressed key concerns and plans for the Christmas period and beyond.

Mayor Dusengiyumva, in his inaugural press conference, expressed his commitment to continuing the journey of making Kigali the dream city of the world. Working closely with stakeholders, he unveiled ambitious plans that include the implementation of bus dedicated lanes, improvements to sewer systems, and the refurbishing of community facilities. Local road projects, already confirmed in the City master plan, are set to enhance the overall infrastructure.




Amidst the celebrations, city authorities issued important cautions to ensure a safe and peaceful festive season.

Special operations on the roads are planned to enforce safety mechanisms, with a particular focus on issues such as noise pollution, driving under the influence, and bicycle usage past 6:00 pm.

One of the significant points of concern raised during the press conference was the warning against noise pollution. Mayor Dusengiyumva reminded businesses and private homes, including bars, nightclubs, hotels, restaurants, and churches, that while they are allowed to operate all night, they must adhere to laws regarding noise levels. The mayor stated, "In as much as we have allowed these businesses to operate through the night, they ought to know that there are still guiding principles that stand to be followed."




He continued, "This goes beyond clubs, bars, and churches, but also private homes. So, those preparing to celebrate with family and planning to play loud music should know that they will also be held accountable."

SECURITY BREACH SHROUDS INDIA'S PARLIAMENT IN GLOOM: AN UNSETTLING EGHO OF THE PAST.

14:10, 2023-12-14

In a somber turn of events, the hallowed halls of India's parliament were thrust into chaos as two unidentified men stormed the lower house on a day etched with haunting historical significance. The date marked the anniversary of a deadly attack on the complex more than two decades ago, and the echoes of that tragic past reverberated through the corridors of power.

The shocking breach unfolded on Wednesday, capturing the nation's attention as it unfolded live on Sansad TV, the official channel for India's parliament. In a surreal scene that unfolded like a nightmare, a man was seen leaping over tables and charging toward the speaker's chair, sending waves of panic through the assembled lawmakers desperately trying to subdue the intruder.




Simultaneously, another figure stood in the visitor's gallery, shrouded in a haunting yellow smoke that permeated the sacred halls of the parliamentary building. The gravity of the situation forced a temporary adjournment of the parliamentary session, as bewildered lawmakers found themselves evacuated to the outside world, away from the unfolding turmoil within.

On the exterior, two more individuals seized the moment, defiantly chanting slogans that cut through the air as a growing contingent of police personnel encircled them. The symbolism of their words, lost in the disarray, painted a grim picture of dissent against a backdrop of chaos.




As the dust settled, and the shadows of uncertainty lingered, all four individuals were apprehended, their identities remaining elusive. Om Birla, the Speaker of the Parliament's lower house, addressed the shaken assembly, confirming the arrests and revealing that the belongings of the intruders had been confiscated. The breach, a disconcerting reality, left the nation grappling with the vulnerabilities of its security apparatus.

Opposition lawmakers voiced their apprehensions, their words cutting through the air like a mournful lament. Mallikarjun Kharge, the leader of India's main opposition Congress party, expressed the gravity of the situation, stating, "The issue is very serious. This is about how two people were able to come inside despite such elaborate security and cause a security breach." The stark reality of the breach underscored a deep-seated concern about the efficacy of existing security measures.




In the aftermath of this distressing incident, the specter of vulnerability looms large over the sanctity of India's parliamentary institutions. As the nation grapples with the unsettling events, questions linger about the security protocols in place and the ominous parallels drawn with a dark chapter in history. The breach serves as a stark reminder that, even in the corridors of power, the shadows of the past can cast a long and unsettling pall over the present.

NATIONAL ELECTRAL COMMISSION ANNOUCES DATES FOR 2024 PRESIDENTIAL AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.

13:21, 2023-12-13

In a significant development, the National Electoral Commission has officially set the stage for the democratic process by announcing the dates for the highly anticipated 2024 elections. The Presidential Order, issued on December 11, 2023, provides clarity on the timeline for both the election of the President of the Republic of Rwanda and specified Members of Parliament (Deputies).




According to the Presidential Order, the elections for the President of the Republic and the 53 Deputies will take place on July 14 and 15, 2024. This announcement was promptly published in the Official Gazette on the same date, marking a crucial step in the electoral preparations.

This inclusive approach ensures a diverse representation in the parliamentary body, reflecting the pluralistic nature of the democratic process.




A key highlight of this Order is the synchronization of the election dates for both the President and the Deputies. The decision to hold these elections concurrently on July 15, 2024, is aimed at streamlining the electoral process and fostering a unified expression of the public's will.

KENYA'S PIONEERING EFFORT: A STATE-OF-THE-ART DOPING CONTROL LAB TO BE UNVEILED IN ELDORET.

12:28, 2023-12-13

In a resolute move against doping in sports, Kenya is charting a new course with the approval of a 100 million Kenyan shilling budget for the construction of a cutting-edge laboratory. The facility is set to serve as a comprehensive testing hub for all doping agents, analyzing samples such as blood, urine, sweat, and more, obtained from athletes across the nation.




This groundbreaking initiative was announced by Dr. Robert Pukose Satia, Member of Parliament for Endebess, during a recent round table organized by Mchezo Africa to address the sports ecosystem in East Africa.

The decision to allocate substantial funds to combat doping underscores Kenya's commitment to promoting clean and fair competition among its athletes. Dr. Pukose Satia emphasized the need for a state-of-the-art laboratory capable of detecting a wide range of doping substances, aligning with global standards for anti-doping measures.




During the round table discussion convened by Mchezo Africa, Dr. Pukose Satia shed light on the strategic choice of Eldoret as the location for the doping control laboratory. Eldoret, renowned as a prominent hub for athletes in the region, emerges as a central point for this facility. This strategic placement is not only practical but also acknowledges the significance of the Sebei region in Uganda, a neighboring area with a strong athletic presence.




The round table, organized by Mchezo Africa, served as a platform for key stakeholders to discuss the intricacies of the sports ecosystem in East Africa. Dr. Pukose Satia's announcement further emphasized the importance of collaborative efforts in addressing challenges within the sporting realm.

As Kenya takes this progressive step forward, the nation is poised to set new standards in the fight against doping. The construction of a state-of-the-art laboratory signifies a monumental leap in Kenya's commitment to maintaining the integrity of sports and ensuring a level playing field for all athletes.




This initiative, unveiled during the Mchezo Africa-organized round table, reflects a broader conversation on enhancing the sports ecosystem in East Africa. By tackling issues such as doping, Kenya aims to create an environment that fosters fair competition, protects athletes' well-being, and reinforces the region's position on the global sports stage. As the laboratory takes shape in Eldoret, it symbolizes Kenya's proactive stance and dedication to advancing the ideals of clean and ethical sportsmanship.

''AFRICA DOESN'T JUST HAVE POTENTIAL, IT HAS A WEALTH IN SPORTS'' SAYS MCHEZO's NTOUDI

09:59, 2023-12-13

In a groundbreaking initiative to stimulate sports investment across the East African region, Mchezo Africa convened a round table at the Rwanda National Parliament on December 12th. The event brought together prominent figures, including East African Members of Parliament, National Sports Federation leaders, media representatives from Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya, as well as key figures from Mchezo leadership.




Ntoudi Mouyelo, Managing Director of Mchezo Africa, expressed his satisfaction at assembling policymakers from five nations to deliberate on the imperative for governments to prioritize sports investment. The collaboration was well-received by all participants, marking a significant step towards fostering regional sports development.

The discussions delved into various aspects of sports investment, with a focus on corporate sponsorship for non-traditional games like tennis and basketball, where Mchezo Africa highlighted the importance of engaging with stakeholders to create a framework for clear sports funding, addressing concerns raised by different participants.

For instance, the Federation for Uganda Basketball Associations cited the reluctance of corporate sponsors to invest in non-mainstream sports. They emphasized the need for companies to see tangible benefits from their sponsorship, illustrating the challenge of linking their brand with sports like tennis and basketball.

In response, Mchezo Africa expressed its commitment to bridging the gap and facilitating partnerships that benefit both corporate sponsors and sports associations. The round table served as a platform to explore innovative ways to demonstrate the value of investing in various sports, addressing concerns raised by stakeholders.




The discussions also touched upon the financial challenges faced by certain sports, such as tennis in Rwanda. Theonaste Karenzi, the head of Rwanda Tennis, highlighted the need to waive taxes on sports equipment, particularly for tennis. '' I can assure you that the cost of a single tennis racket could equate to an entire set of soccer balls, making it crucial to alleviate financial burdens for sports development if we are to fully explore these talents.''Karenzi said




Karenzi also called for support not only from corporate entities but also from parents, recognizing them as essential stakeholders in the promotion of sports. By waiving taxes on sports equipment, the aim is to make sports more accessible and affordable, encouraging wider participation and nurturing talent at the grassroots level, this was in supplement to Tanzania's Micheal Kadebe who said that some of the parents whose children play these sports were the decision makers in the corporate and government and this would equally be their role




The Mchezo Africa-led round table was a pivotal moment in fostering collaboration among East African nations to advocate for increased sports investment. By addressing challenges and seeking innovative solutions, the participants demonstrated a collective commitment to the growth and development of sports across the region and committed to meeting often and this being 2024 May in Arusha Tanzania.

WHO IS WHO FOR ARSENAL'S NUMBER 1: RAYA OR RAMSADLE?

10:45, 2023-12-06

Coming into the 23/24 season everyone agreed that Arteta's side needed reinforcement in the poles, especially talking about maturity and experience to quench down the previous season's pressure that caused them a loss on the English premier league title. And this saw the Gunners boss dive into the summer market to get David Raya. But lets see how both men found them selves clad in the Arsenal jersey;




Following successive loans to Chesterfield and AFC Wimbledon, Ramsdale played a season with Bournemouth and re-joined Sheffield United in a transfer worth an initial £18 million. In 2021, Ramsdale signed for Arsenal in a club record transfer worth up to £30 million, becoming their most expensive goalkeeper, whereas David Raya came to England at 16 years old when he signed for Blackburn Rovers as an academy player. A short-term loan to Southport in the National League, promotion to the Championship with Rovers and 108 senior appearances later, saw David depart Lancashire for west London in July 2019 where he would attract attention from North London who would later acquire him at the beginning of 23/24 season.




Both men have had their strength but the questions lingering is who will be Arsenals number one based on what has transpired in each game played however it seems the Spaniard with 15 games appeared he maintains number one with 7 clean sheets against Ramsadle's 9games and 3 clean sheets with more goals conceded.

The question however is who is better to use in more pressure games especially now that Arsenal is back in the driving seat but still has many games to play in two major leagues.

RWANDA AND UNITED KINGDOM FORGE AWAY FORWARD ON THE ASYLUM SEEKERS' PARTNERSHIP.

10:02, 2023-12-06

Rwanda and the United Kingdom on Tuesday, December 5, announced a new migration treaty that is set to re-emphasize, in a binding manner, already existing commitments that address concerns previously raised about the protection of asylum seekers.




Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Vincent Biruta alongside visiting UK Home Secretary James Cleverly presided over the signing ceremony in Kigali.




Under the treaty, a new appeals tribunal, is set to be established under Rwandan law and overseen by two co-presidents

One of the presidents is expected to be Rwandan and another is drawn from another Commonwealth country.




Also, to be introduced is a panel of judges from various nationalities, who will hear appeals in the event an applicant’s asylum claim is turned down.

This comes after a contradicting ruling by the British court, that based it on the assumptions of human rights violations and the fear that Rwanda would repatriate asylum seekers to their home countries which would pose threats.

This did not receive a calm reaction from both governments that felt it was all a PR haux and were still forging ways for this partnership to work




“This partnership reflects Rwanda's commitment to protecting vulnerable people and our country's track record in welcoming and hosting refugees and migrants from around the world,” Minister Biruta said at a press conference after signing

Biruta went on to assert that Rwanda and the UK, understand that there is a critical need to find innovative ways to address the suffering of migrants making dangerous, desperate journeys under the exploitation of criminal human smugglers.

There is also a need to tackle the underlying causes driving people from their homelands, he pointed out.

“In other words, the boats will not be completely stopped unless we reverse the lack of opportunity and insecurity in countries around the world.”

The new scheme announced Tuesday, Biruta said, will reinforce the mutually beneficial framework for cooperation between both countries.

ITALY JAMS TO THE GERMAN REQUEST OF RETURNING HITLER'S BOUGHT STATUE.

14:48, 2023-12-05

Italy’s culture minister is refuses a request by the German State Antiquities Collection in Munich to return an ancient Roman statue that embodied Hitler’s Aryan aesthetic, calling it a national treasure.




The Discobolus Palombara is a 2nd-century Roman copy of a long-lost Greek bronze original. Hitler had bought the Roman copy from its private Italian owner in 1938 under pressure from Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and against the wishes of the education minister and cultural officials. The statue, unearthed at a Roman villa in 1781, was returned to Italy in 1948 as part of works illegally obtained by the Nazis.




The dispute arose when the director of the National Roman Museum requested the statue’s 17th-century marble base be returned from the Antikensammlungen state antiquities collection. The German museum instead asked for the return of the Discobolus Palombara, saying it had been illegally transported to Italy in 1948, the Corriere della Sera newspaper reported Friday.

ADRESSING PESTE DES PETITS RUMINANTS (PPR) OUTBREAK: FAO's COLLABORATIVE RESPONSE ACROSS BORDERS.

12:47, 2023-12-05

In a pivotal moment for regional collaboration, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture swiftly responded to the outbreak of Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) reported by the Rwanda Veterinary Services on August 14, 2023 in the parts of Kayonza, Ndego,Ruhuha and Bugesra. This marked the first occurrence of PPR in the region, demanding immediate attention and coordinated efforts. Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a severe viral disease of domestic and wild small ruminants. PPR affects primarily the respiratory and digestive systems, inducing high rates of morbidity and mortality.

Recognizing the urgency of the situation, the FAO forged a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture in Rwanda, as well as authorities in Burundi and Tanzania. This collaboration aimed at pooling resources and expertise to effectively address the outbreak and prevent its further spread across borders particularly in the Eastern parts of the country.  A critical aspect of the collaborative response was a comprehensive risk assessment that painted the region at a heightened risk due to the easy movement of people and animals between the borders of Burundi and Tanzania. Two separate PPR outbreaks, involving a total of 300 animals, originated at the border with Tanzania, underscoring the need for immediate and targeted interventions such as ;




Rapid Response Teams: which FAO, in conjunction with local authorities, promptly established rapid response teams strategically positioned to assess, contain, and mitigate the spread of PPR. These teams played a crucial role in early detection and intervention. Vaccination Campaigns: Recognizing the importance of proactive measures, targeted vaccination campaigns that were implemented. Priority was given to areas close to the borders, aiming to protect vulnerable herds and prevent further transmission of the virus though it is still found deeming enough to do a gel mass vaccination for all small ruminants with in the country

Information Dissemination: This could only be possible working closely with local authorities, that would actively disseminate vital information to farmers and communities about PPR prevention and early detection. This outreach ensured that communities were well-informed and empowered to actively participate in the collective effort to combat the outbreak and also engage the local veterinary officers to continue being alert. Dr. Fabrice Ndayisenga, the Rwandan Country Chief Veterinary Officer, played a key role in the collaborative response, during the 2nd coordination meeting on October 19, 2023, when he provided detailed insights into the current PPR epidemiological situation in Rwanda, outlining specific actions being implemented. His expertise significantly contributed to enhancing the regional response which was the basis of the cooperation which forth triggered comprehensive monitoring efforts that were implemented throughout Rwanda, with a particular focus on areas close to the borders.

RWANDA ANNOUNCES CLIMATE FINANCE PARTNERSHIP MILESTONES AT COP28

10:31, 2023-12-04

The Rwanda Climate Finance Partnership, which was launched at the Paris Summit for a New Global Financing Pact, will further power innovative climate action thanks to additional contributions from the Government of Rwanda. The partnership is supported by Agence Française de Développement (AFD), the European Union and Team Europe, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), German Cooperation via KfW Development Bank, and the Italian Cooperation system with the support of Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP); and it complements existing partnerships, including the Rwandan-German Climate and Development Partnership and ongoing initiatives with the World Bank. The formal announcement was made on the sidelines of the COP28 UN Climate Change Conference in Dubai, UAE on 4 December. 

 

It was made clear that the Rwanda Climate Finance Partnership aims to facilitate public-private partnerships to scale-up climate finance and has been made possible by the country’s Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) arrangement with the International Monetary Fund, which is expected to disburse an additional USD 48.5 million in budget support following the approval of Rwanda’s second review of the RSF arrangement by the IMF Executive Board in mid-December. 

To further demonstrate commitment to its RSF-supported climate agenda, the Government of Rwanda also announced two additional reform measures supported by the RSF, related to:

(i) enhanced risk analysis of State-Owned Enterprises and Public-Private Partnerships that are vulnerable to climate change, and

(ii) adopting a green taxonomy adapted to Rwanda’s NDC climate action plan.

 

Other key partnership milestones were also shared at the COP28 side event and include;

  The Government of Rwanda, through the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, will contribute USD 40 million to support ''IREME'' Invest, the country’s private sector green investment facility complimented by the European Investment Bank and the Development Bank of Rwanda's signed EUR 20 million loan and a technical assistance agreement to support Rwanda’s green transition through ''IREME'' Invest. The loan is the first tranche of an expected EUR 100 million financing package announced at the Paris Summit. The technical assistance will be provided under the EIB Greening Financial Systems programme, supporting the NDC Partnership and backed by the International Climate Initiative Fund and German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action. At COP28 the EIB is also outlining a new EUR 100 million agricultural climate finance partnership with Bank of Kigali to support smallholders and agri-business across Rwanda impacted by climate change.

 

AFD and Rwanda Development Bank have also signed a EUR 20 million credit facility and a EUR 1 million technical assistance grant to scale up ''IREME'' Invest. The first investments under the facility have already been undertaken in several sectors: green buildings and renewable energy. AFD has also signed a budget support of EUR 50 million and EUR 3 million technical assistance grant, announced at the Paris Summit, to advance green public financial management in Rwanda. AFD signed a memorandum of understanding with Bank of Kigali, whereby they agree to strengthen their cooperation in the area of climate finance and working on a climate line of credit of EUR 20 million with a technical assistance grant of EUR 1 million.

The Danish International Development Agency and the Rwanda Green Fund have signed a grant agreement of USD 5.27 million to support the Project Preparation Facility of Ireme Invest, which is powered by the Rwanda Green Fund.

CDP, Italy’s Financial Institution for International Development Cooperation, is advancing its partnership with the Government of Rwanda to provide financial support to green transition in the country, in the context of an overall strategy to scale up financial flows towards sustainable development and to counter climate change in Africa.

 

The Rwanda Climate Finance Partnership is a key pillar of Rwanda’s efforts to fund its ambitious NDC Climate Action Plan, and complements a number of existing public and private sector focused initiatives to enable Rwanda to respond to climate change:

Programmatic approach for Rwanda’s NDC investments: Three programmatic investment plans on: (i) Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA), (ii) Sustainable Urbanization, with lead support of German Technical Cooperation (GIZ), and (iii) Sustainable Landscape Management (SLM), with the support from the World Bank, are currently under preparation. Additionally, the IFC will support the Government of Rwanda through the Rwanda Green Fund, to develop long-term investment plans for climate smart agriculture and sustainable urbanization, specifically focusing on increasing the role of the private sector in greening Rwanda’s economy.




·Green Taxonomy: The Government of Rwanda announced the first phase of its green taxonomy to help catalyze private financing to green projects. Once finalized, the taxonomy will provide clear signals on which projects and activities are aligned with Rwanda’s climate goals. It will help direct private financial flows to the financing of those activities. The initiative is supported by Germany through GIZ, and it is strongly interlinked with Ireme Invest and the Boosting Green Finance, Investment and Trade (GreenFIT) partnership with the World Bank.

·        

Rwanda’s NDC Facility, known as Intego, has developed a rich and promising pipeline of public climate adaptation and mitigation projects since its launch at COP27. The facility was capitalized by Germany through KfW with seed funding of EUR 46 million as part of the EUR 222 million Rwandan-German Climate and Development Partnership. The first call for proposals shows that financing needs and availability of project concepts go far beyond the seed funding and the Government of Rwanda is inviting development partners to join the initiative. Intego shall become a best practice example on how to facilitate access to public finance and to pool funding from various sources for climate projects.

·        

Boosting Green Finance, Investment and Trade (GreenFIT): The World Bank has also partnered with the Government of Rwanda in the design of a new development policy operation (DPO) that encompasses a set of reforms to increase private sector participation in the Rwandan economy and improve resource mobilisation for climate resilience, with a value of USD 250 million over two years. Germany through KfW Development Bank has joined this effort and contributed not only to the provision of hands-on Technical Assistance for the design and implementation of the DPO’s actions, and is considering a financial contribution to the overall funding of the operation for the second year of the DPO.

·        

The EU, as part of the Global Gateway initiative, is also providing budget support for an overall amount of EUR 59 million in grants, including EUR 6.5 million technical assistance, in support of Rwanda’s NDC targets with a specific focus on adaptation in agriculture, in addition to backing the EUR 20 million EIB financing to the Rwanda Development Bank and the Bank of Kigali EIB loan.

·Finally, the Development Bank of Rwanda recently closed a RWF 30 billion (USD 24.8 million) sustainability-linked bond issuance, which was partially credit-enhanced via a World Bank lending operation, representing the first such issuance by a national development bank in the world.

 

The Rwanda Climate Finance Partnership, Rwandan-German Climate and Development Partnership, and ongoing initiatives with the World Bank and other partners, such as the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden, demonstrate the power of collaboration to reshape the global climate finance architecture, including by moving beyond small-scale projects to significant long-term investments that leverage existing mechanisms to facilitate public-private partnerships and attract private sector investments.

KIGALI ECONOMIC FORUM 2023: A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AFRICA'S GLOBAL ECONOMIC STANDING.

14:41, 2023-11-27

In a landmark collaboration between the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning and the esteemed French think-tank, Le Cercle des économistes, the first-ever Kigali Economic Forum that started on November 27 and is set to end on 28, 2023. This significant event marks a crucial turning point for Africa's role and position in the global economy.

The Kigali Economic Forum comes at a time when Africa is increasingly asserting itself on the global economic stage. With a youthful population, abundant natural resources, and a growing middle class, the continent holds immense potential. The forum seeks to explore and capitalize on these strengths to redefine Africa's narrative in the global economic landscape.




''Continuous research shows that other continents population is dwindling by the day, making Africa an epitome to solving labour crises if not even manufacturing and food production.'' Said DR Ache of Africa Leadership University.




A central focus of the forum is addressing the challenges and opportunities surrounding Africa's youth. As a demographic powerhouse, harnessing the potential of the youth is crucial for sustainable development. Discussions will revolve around innovative educational strategies, skill development, and entrepreneurship opportunities to empower the youth and propel the continent towards prosperity.

Panellists explored innovative approaches to education, discussing ways to equip the continent's youth with the skills needed for a rapidly evolving global landscape.




JAPANESE SPACE SCIENTIST KOJI MURATA SET TO LAUNCH IN SPACE THE FIRST EVER WOODEN SATELLITE.

14:23, 2023-11-27

Aluminum rockets and steel skyscrapers; slick high-speed shuttles and glassy facades: that’s how “the future” has been imagined for decades.




But that’s not what Koji Murata imagines. A researcher at Kyoto University in Japan, Murata has been exploring how biological materials could be used in space.




Murata wondered if he “could build a wooden house on the moon or Mars,” and decided to test the theory — by creating a wooden satellite.




This comes after Recent research from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) found that 10% of atmospheric aerosol in the stratosphere contained metallic particles from spacecraft, including satellites. The long-term impact of these metal fragments is unknown, but scientists are concerned it could damage Earth’s fragile ozone layer




Wooden satellites would be better for the plane while still providing the same functionality as their metal counterparts, says Murata




''Wood doesn't burn or rot in the lifeless vacuum of space, but it will incinerate into a fine ash upon reentry into Earth's atmosphere — making it a surprisingly useful, biodegradable material for future satellites. After successfully testing their wood samples aboard the International Space Station (ISS) earlier this year, the scientists believe the test satellite is fit for launch.'' Murata added







THE TANZANIAN SLAG TO PURCHASE SUNFLOWER SEEDS FOR FARMERS COULD LEAD TO A REGIONAL DEFCIT OF EDIBLE OIL.

Tanzania’s drive to industrialise its sunflower sector has hits a backlog for the 2023/2024 planting season on a deal to bulk-source high-yield seeds for the country’s one million sunflower

farmers. The deal, funded by the African Development Bank,(AFDB) was for 700 tonnes of hybrid seeds, to deliver yields and oil up to 65 per cent percent greater than traditional varieties. The government had planned to provide the seeds at subsidised prices for the season that began in October 2023, however, the supply has proved difficult to secure on a change of strategy around which hybrid seeds to settle for.




The government has been investing heavily in sunflower processing to reduce its hefty edible oil

imports, which currently account for between $90m and $250m every year and forth has moved to introduce tariffs on edible oil imports, while removing VAT on sunflower oil processing

equipment coming into the country, to favour local oil producers.




This on the other hand leaves processors limited by the lack of domestic raw materials, and the available ones relatively acquired at a high cost, as a result of farmers’ low yields for over a a decade. However the government and private sector have developed, tested, and launched four hybrid seeds in the market whose uptake has been poor.

The bulk-purchase of subsidised hybrids was designed to catalyse new uptake of the hybrid seeds, which produce far better margins for farmers and can supply an expanded processing sector which holds the potential to create thousands of new jobs.

However, at the point of tender, the Tanzanian government selected a new entrant to the seed

industry to provide 700 tonnes of a new hybrid, currently registered and used in India. The yield

and oil content of the new hybrid are not available. It is one of 18 hybrid sunflower seeds

registered with the Indian Directorate of Oilseeds Development (DOD), but the only one that is

registered without information on its yields and oil content.




It is also not recommended, by the DOD, as ideal or suitable for any area in India. However, it is

currently available in large volumes, and has enjoyed price cutting amid rising stockpiles. This

meant the new seed industry entrant was able to offer a far lower price for the sunflower seeds

than the established suppliers in the country, by sourcing the seeds as an open buyer from

India.




But as a single purchase of stockpiled Indian seed, it remains in negotiation, some months later, and has failed to arrive before the season started. When it does arrive it will also then require the creation of new distribution partnerships and networks to deliver.




For Tanzanian farmers, the seed purchase is now unlikely to be available before planting is

finished in early 2024, and the new supply will require storage until the 2024/2025 season a reason anticipated to cause a regional edible oil deficit. It has also been observed by market specialists that the stockpiles of the new seed in India, which had triggered the price cutting, amount to around 500 tonnes, further slowing the completion of the 700 tonne order.




''IS IT A TERRORIST ATTACK OR JUST A MERE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT?''; NWORK CITZENS ASK.

16:47, 2023-11-23

 A salon car speeding toward a U.S.-Canada bridge from the American side crashed and exploded at a checkpoint in Niagara Falls on Wednesday, killing two people and prompting the closing of multiple border crossings for hours. Authorities weren’t sure what spurred the wreck but said there were no signs it was a terror attack.




The FBI’s Buffalo office said late Wednesday that it had concluded its investigation: “A search of the scene revealed no explosive materials, and no terrorism nexus was identified,” it said in a statement. “The matter has been turned over to the Niagara Falls Police Department as a traffic investigation.”




Much remained unclear about the incident at the Rainbow Bridge, which prompted concerns on both sides of the border as the U.S. headed into the Thanksgiving holiday. Both U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were briefed soon afterward, and Trudeau excused himself from Question Period in the House of Commons to get further information, saying officials were “taking this extraordinarily seriously.”

''WE CAN SOLVE TWO PROBLEMS AT ONCE, E -BUSES FOR THE DEFCICT OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT'' SAYS STAKE HOLDERS

09:38, 2023-11-14

Rwanda, a country known for it's beauty and record to be the first ever country to ban plastic bags continues it's fight against any agents of environmental degradation and climate change an approach they still visualise to tackle the challenge in public transport system. Recognizing this issue, Kampeta Pitchette, the CEO of Rwanda Development Bank, shed light on the deficit and advocated for the implementation of eco-friendly transport means while addressing Rwanda's public transport, the environmental implications, and the innovative solutions for a greener and more sustainable future. This discussion was during a National Stake Holders Engagement meeting organised by UNDP Rwanda and Rwanda Governance Board.







Rwanda, like many developing nations, grapples with a deficiency in its public transport infrastructure. Inefficient and unreliable transportation systems contribute to congestion, longer commute times, and increased pollution especially after the COVID 19 pandemic that stalled most of the operators to pack the buses which could no longer just come of the road except they were fully refurbished to suit the traffic inspection standards.. The reliance on traditional modes of transport, such as buses and shared taxis, has led to challenges in meeting the growing demand for mobility, especially in urban centers.




''The environmental consequences of the current public transport system cannot be ignored. High emissions from fossil fuel-powered vehicles contribute to air pollution, impacting both public health and the environment. Recognizing the urgency to address these issues,'' Kampeta Pitchette emphasized the need for a paradigm shift towards sustainable and eco-friendly alternatives.




Introduction of Electric Vehicles (EVs) which mostly advocates for the integration of electric vehicles into Rwanda's transport system. EVs, with their minimal carbon footprint, can significantly reduce emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. The government can incentivize the adoption of electric vehicles through subsidies and infrastructure development, such as charging stations.




At the same event the country representative of the World Bank Sahr Kpundeh emphasized the importance of investing in green infrastructure, including dedicated lanes for bicycles and pedestrians, as well as the expansion of public transport networks. Such initiatives not only promote eco-friendly modes of transport but also contribute to a more organized and efficient systems that would allow investment in power




Stake holders on the panel proposed a holistic approach to sustainable mobility, encouraging the use of bicycles, incentivise e-scooters, and increase more car free days. ''These modes of transport not only reduce environmental impact but also promote a healthier lifestyle. Implementing bike-sharing programs and pedestrian-friendly zones can transform the urban landscape and enhance the overall quality of life.'' Sahr Kpundeh expressed




''To drive the success of eco-friendly transport initiatives, suggestions for launching public awareness campaigns, availing finances. Educating the population, transport sector players about the environmental benefits of sustainable transport and the long-term impact on their well-being can foster a collective commitment to change.'' Kampeta added




The call for a transition to eco-friendly transport is not just a vision but a necessity for Rwanda's sustainable development. By investing in green infrastructure, promoting electric vehicles, and fostering public awareness, Rwanda can pave the way for a future where public transport is not just efficient but also environmentally responsible. It's time to embark on a journey towards a greener, more sustainable Rwanda.

''REFRAIN FROM PROPAGANDA, WE WERE ATTACKED AND HAVE A RIGHT TO FIGHT BACK'' SAYS AMB EINAT

10:51, 2023-11-09

In the aftermath of the recent ground operations in Gaza following the attacks by Hamas on Israeli territory on October 7, 2023, which tragically claimed the lives of over 1200 civilians, including women, children, and approximately 200 soldiers, a shroud of yet justifiable evidence surrounds the events of atrocity. This evidence could potentially shed light on the justification behind Israel's actions. Despite the government maintaining a stance of non-disclosure, citing the explicit wishes of victim families, questions linger about the nature and extent of the evidence that could offer insights into the decision-making process.

Israel's ground operations have elicited both support and skepticism.




The government's decision to keep crucial evidence undisclosed is grounded in respect for the privacy and wishes of the affected families who are still reeling from the horror events. However, this decision has sparked debates about the delicate balance between transparency and sensitivity in a complex geopolitical landscape. It's noteworthy that, according to Jewish culture, the display of lifeless bodies, particularly of babies and women, some of whom were burnt beyond recognition, is highly uncommon.




Ambassador Einat Weiss addressed this challenging situation during an interview with City Radio, acknowledging the uphill task of conveying the realities of the matter without any tangible evidence to show for it. "Telling the world the truths of the matter, especially since the Government of Israel is committed to the well-being of its citizens and respects their wishes, is a challenge we must navigate," remarked Ms. Einat Weiss.

She went on to explain that evidence has been gathered from various sources, including street cameras in Kibbutz, home CCTVs, car dash cameras, and body cams from apprehended assailants. The footage is unedited, in contrast to the selective and misleading content circulated by Hamas and others on social media.




"The government's commitment to respecting the wishes of victim families adds a layer of complexity to the situation," Ms. Einat Weiss added. As citizens grapple with uncertainty and the desire for transparency, it is crucial to acknowledge the delicate balance between the public's right to information and the sensitivity surrounding the families directly impacted by these attacks.

The unseen evidence behind Israel's ground operations underscores the intricate dance between transparency, national security, and the rights of those directly affected. As the government navigates these challenges, the delicate balance between respecting victim families' wishes and addressing the broader public's need for information remains a focal point. In the pursuit of a comprehensive understanding, it is essential to advocate for a nuanced approach that honors both privacy and the collective right to knowledge, fostering a society built on trust and accountability.




The events of October 7, 2023, in Israel have left an indelible mark on the collective conscience, marked by conflicting narratives and an urgent need for clarity. Reports suggest a significant loss of life, with claims of over 1200 civilians, including women and children, falling victim to violence perpetrated by ISIS-linked Hamas militants.




"As we grapple with the aftermath, it is essential to approach these events with a commitment to truth, acknowledging the gravity of the situation, Israel's sovereignty, the citizens' future, and guaranteed security. The only thing we expect from the world is to understand that we were attacked and have a right to fight back, just as the USA did after 9/11," stated Yossi Gadamo, the deputy ambassador of Israel in Rwanda.




While the duration of these challenging circumstances remains uncertain, Israel has permitted the supply of humanitarian aid. There are concerns that this aid may inadvertently reinforce insurgent activities. Hence, the decision to allow aid only in the North, where civilians can seek refuge as ground operations continue, reflects a strategic approach in dealing with the root cause of the conflict and dismantling Hamas's tunnel cells. It marks a crucial step toward addressing the longstanding issue and establishing lasting peace in the region.

ELECTRIFYING THE FUTURE: THE RISE OF ELECTRIC CARS

12:35, 2023-11-07

The automotive industry is undergoing a revolution, and it's being powered by electricity. Electric cars, also known as electric vehicles (EVs), have gained significant momentum in recent years and particularly in Rwanda as concerns about climate change and the environmental impact of traditional gasoline-powered vehicles have intensified. In this article, we explore the world of electric cars, their benefits, challenges, and the role they play in shaping a more sustainable future.




One of the primary advantages of electric cars is their environmental friendliness. Unlike conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, electric cars produce zero tailpipe emissions. This means they don't release harmful pollutants like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, or particulate matter into the atmosphere. As a result, electric cars significantly reduce air pollution and help combat climate change by lowering greenhouse gas emissions.




Electric cars are highly energy-efficient, making them able to convert a higher percentage of the energy from the grid into motion, typically around 85-90%, whereas ICE vehicles are considerably less efficient, with only about 20-30% of the energy from gasoline being used to move the vehicle. This efficiency results in cost savings for EV owners, who spend less on energy to travel the same distance.




Electric vehicles (EVs) have fewer moving parts compared to traditional vehicles. This means there is less wear and tear, leading to lower maintenance costs. Additionally, the cost of electricity for charging is usually lower than that of gasoline or diesel fuel, resulting in substantial savings over time which also makes them known for their quiet and smooth operation. Without the noise and vibrations associated with internal combustion engines, electric cars provide a more pleasant driving experience for passengers and reduce noise pollution in urban areas.




While electric cars have made significant advancements in range, they still tend to have a lower range compared to gasoline-powered vehicles. Range anxiety, the fear of running out of battery power before reaching a charging station, remains a concern for some potential buyers. However, advancements in battery technology are steadily increasing the range of electric cars.




This has however pauses a challenge for governments to encourage the adoption of electric cars, a robust charging infrastructure is essential. Although charging networks are expanding, there are still areas with limited access to charging stations, which can be a barrier for potential electric car owners. Public and private investments are working to address this issue.




Electric cars tend to have a higher upfront cost compared to traditional vehicles. However, this is gradually changing as economies of scale, technological advancements, and government incentives make electric cars more affordable. In the long run, lower operating costs and potential incentives can offset the higher initial purchase price.

The Road to a Sustainable Future

Electric cars are a vital component of a more sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation system. They offer numerous advantages that address concerns related to air pollution, energy efficiency, and operating costs. However, they also face challenges such as limited range, charging infrastructure, and upfront costs. To overcome these challenges, collaboration between the automotive industry, governments, and consumers is crucial.

As technology continues to advance, the electric car landscape is expected to evolve rapidly. Battery technology is improving, which will lead to greater range and reduced charging times. Charging infrastructure will expand, making it more convenient for people to own and use electric cars. Government policies and incentives will play a significant role in accelerating the transition to electric vehicles.




To sum it up, electric cars are not just a mode of transportation; they represent a commitment to a cleaner and more sustainable future. As more people embrace electric cars, we move closer to reducing our carbon footprint and protecting the planet for future generations. The electrification of the automotive industry is a step in the right direction, one that promises to shape a greener and more environmentally responsible world.

''RWANDA SHOULD CONSIDER DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING OF HIV/AIDS DRUGS'' SAYS UNAIDS RWANDA REPRESENTANTIVE.

14:10, 2023-11-06

As the world draws near to the celebration of world Aids day on the 1 December, Hind Hassan, the UNAIDS Representative to Rwanda, has reminded Rwanda to consider manufacturing ARVs since they are a lifelong treatment for patients, yet there is no guarantee that foreign partners will continue providing them to the country.




Currently Rwanda depends on external resources to treat more than 220,000 people living with HIV in the country. The medication is manufactured in foreign countries and provided to Rwanda via an arrangement that is mainly financed through the Global Fund or the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).




However, as this is ,a recent report released by UNAIDS recognized Rwanda as one of the top four countries that have effectively managed the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The country has achieved significant milestones in terms of treatment, testing, and raising awareness about HIV status among its population with the Government's move to consider acquiring an injectable HIV drug.




Under the pixie name  "Are efforts for HIV prevention wanting?" the report, unveiled on Thursday, July 13, revealed that Rwanda, along with Botswana, Eswatini, and Tanzania, has successfully met the "95-95-95" targets set by UNAIDS.

The "95-95-95" target entails ensuring that 95 percent of individuals living with HIV in a country are aware of their status, 95 percent of those aware of their HIV-positive status are receiving antiretroviral treatment, and 95 percent of people on treatment have achieved viral suppression.

The report further highlights that 16 other countries, including eight in sub-Saharan Africa, a region accounting for 65 percent of all HIV-positive individuals, are also close to achieving these targets.




"The end of AIDS is an opportunity for a uniquely powerful legacy for today's leaders," Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of UNAIDS said. "They could be remembered by future generations as those who put a stop to the world's deadliest pandemic. They could save millions of lives and protect the health of everyone. They could show what leadership can do," she added.

CHINA'S HESITATION TO INVEST IN AFRICAN ENERGY PROJECTS: SHORT TERM IMPACTS

10:56, 2023-11-06

China has long been a key player in financing infrastructure and energy projects across the African continent. The partnership between China and African nations has resulted in significant developments, from roads and railways to energy facilities. However, in recent years, there has been a noticeable shift in China's approach, with increasing hesitation to finance African energy projects with it going down to only USD 1 billion. In this article, we will explore the causes behind this change and the potential consequences for both China and African nations.




The Changing Landscape

China's involvement in Africa's energy sector has been substantial, with investments ranging from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Historically, China has been a reliable source of funding for energy projects in Africa, often providing financial support when other international organizations were reluctant. However, several factors have contributed to China's changing stance:




Economic Challenges: China's economy has faced headwinds, including a slowdown in economic growth and rising debt levels. As a result, the Chinese government has become more cautious in its overseas investments, seeking to prioritize domestic interests.

Debt Concerns: China's extensive financial support for African projects has led to concerns about unsustainable debt levels in African nations. These concerns have prompted China to reconsider the terms and conditions of its investments. Beijing’s shift in its lending policy towards Africa has been bolstered by President Xi Jinping’s determination towards ‘greening’ his massive Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and supporting small scale projects (with values under $50 million) which are economically feasible, with more beneficial social and environmental impacts.




Environmental Considerations: China has made significant strides in environmental sustainability and is increasingly focused on clean energy solutions. This has led to a reassessment of its involvement in projects that rely heavily on fossil fuels, which can have adverse environmental impacts.

Political Instability: Some African nations have faced political instability, corruption, and governance issues, which have made Chinese investors more cautious about the security of their investments.

Consequences of China's Hesitation

The hesitancy of China to finance African energy projects has notable consequences for both China and African nations:

Funding Gap: African nations may find it more challenging to secure financing for critical energy projects, hindering their economic growth and development.

Diversification: African nations may need to diversify their sources of funding, looking to international organizations, Western nations, and private investors, which could lead to greater competition and potentially improved project terms.

Environmental Shift: As China becomes more selective in its investments, African nations may need to explore cleaner and more sustainable energy solutions, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change.

Diplomatic Relations: The evolving dynamics in financing energy projects can influence diplomatic relations between China and African countries. Maintaining a balanced relationship will be crucial for both parties.

Infrastructure Development: The pace of infrastructure development in Africa, especially in the energy sector, may slow down as a result of China's hesitation, affecting job creation and the overall economic growth of African nations.




China's hesitancy to finance African energy projects is a reflection of changing economic, environmental, and political dynamics. While this shift may pose challenges for African nations in the short term, it also offers an opportunity for them to explore diverse sources of funding and cleaner energy solutions. For China, a more cautious approach can help address domestic concerns and align with global environmental goals. As the situation unfolds, it will be essential for China and African nations to find common ground and maintain strong diplomatic relations to ensure sustainable development on the African continent.

MESSI CROWNED G.O.A.T AGAIN

13:00, 2023-10-31

The Ballon d'Or. Love it or loathe it, it's the award every footballer in the world dreams of one day winning. And now, after a memorable and unique 2022-23 campaign, the winner of the 2023 Golden Ball has been announced: Lionel Messi.




The Argentina and Inter Miami forward picked up his eighth Ballon d'Or at a lavish ceremony in Paris on Monday, October 30 after a 2022-23 season that saw him finally get his hands on the trophy that had alluded him throughout his glittering career: The World Cup.

Messi won the Golden Ball at Qatar 2022 as the tournament's best player, and having also helped Paris Saint-Germain win another Ligue 1 title over the course of the campaign, he was able to beat out competition from the likes of Erling Haaland and former team-mate Kylian Mbappe for the award.




That trio were up at the very top of the rankings for 2023, but how did the rest of the 30-man shortlist shake out when all the votes were counted? Check out the official rankings below:




30Ruben Dias (Manchester City)

Man City effectively played with four centre-backs during their 2022-23 treble run, and Dias was the best of them all. His start to this season suggests he has no plans to slow down anytime soon.

29Martin Odegaard (Arsenal)

Saka was very good last year, but Odegaard was better. 15 very important goals and seven assists — all while wearing the armband — made for a standout season. An immense talent is now among the best players in Europe.




28Randal Kolo Muani (PSG)

One of France's brightest talents, Kolo Muani finally realised his potential last season, scoring 14 for a struggling Frankfurt outfit. That, plus a promising World Cup campaign, saw him earn a big-money move to Paris Saint-Germain, where he should flourish alongside France team-mate Kylian Mbappe.




27Nicolo Barella (Inter)

The heart and soul of one of Europe's best midfield trios, Barella was the driving force behind Inter's late-season magic. He's been impressive for a few years now, and has finally gotten some much-deserved recognition for it.




26Jamal Musiala (Bayern Munich)

One of Europe's brightest talents, Musiala continued to develop throughout 2023, bagging 12 goals and adding 10 assists as Bayern Munich made a late push for the Bundesliga title. His winner against Koln on the final day of the season will go down as one of the most important goals in club history.

25Josko Gvardiol (Man City)

A standout for both Croatia and RB Leipzig during the 2022-23 season, Gvardiol did enough to earn a big-money move to Man City. Chances are, he will get even better there.

24Bukayo Saka (Arsenal)

Another youngster always on the up, Saka was part of the reason Arsenal lept from fifth to second in 2023, scoring 14 and adding 11 assists in the Premier League. There will be much more to come from the PFA Young Player of the Year.

23Andre Onana (Manchester United)

Onana turned in countless big performances as Inter made an unexpected run to the Champions League final. And although his side lost to Man City in the showpiece, Onana was one of the best keepers in Europe last year.

22Kim Min-Jae (Bayern Munich)

Perhaps the signing of the season, Kim's defensive performances are a big part of the reason why Napoli achieved elusive Serie A glory. 'The Monster' should only improve under Thomas Tuchel at Bayern.

21Antoine Griezmann (Atletico Madrid)

Vini Jr and Ronald Araujo may have stood out, but many would argue for Griezmann as La Liga's best player last season. With 31 goal contributions in La Liga alone, his proponents might just have a point.

20Lautaro Martinez (Inter)

A World Cup winner's medal alone would be enough to justify his inclusion. Add Martinez's vital run for Inter at the back end of last season, and he can be considered one of the campaign's star performers.

19Harry Kane (Bayern Munich)

The best No.9 in Europe not named Erling Haaland, Kane had arguably his best season for a tumultuous Spurs side, scoring 30 in the Premier League.

18Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid)

It's hard to believe Bellingham just turned 20. The English midfielder was Dortmund's best player last season as they fell just short of the Bundesliga title, and has hit the ground running in Spain, too. He may not have won the award this year, but there seems to be one in his future.

17Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (Napoli)

Kvaratskhelia came out of nowhere in 2022-23, and swiftly announced himself as one of the best left-wingers in Europe. Napoli won their first Scudetto in 33 years last season, and couldn't have done it without their Georgian sensation, who tallied 22 goal contributions in Serie A alone.




16Karim Benzema (Al-Ittihad)

Benzema had an under-par season for Los Blancos and still managed to bag 19 goals in 24 La Liga starts — as well as a hat-trick against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey semi-final. Not bad for a 35-year-old with chronic injury issues.

15Emi Martinez (Aston Villa)

Argentina's World Cup win was all about Messi, but it couldn't have happened without Martinez, who made crucial saves in two penalty shootouts. His one-on-one stop against Kolo Muani late on in the final is worth a nomination alone.

14Ilkay Gundogan (Barcelona)

When Haaland endured a rare cold spell towards the end of last season, Gundogan picked up the slack. He was immense for Guardiola for a few years, and, at 33, is finally getting his plaudits. Barcelona will be delighted to have him.

13Yassine Bounou (Al-Hilal)

Morocco were the surprise side of the 2022 World Cup, and Bounou was a big reason why. His Europa League final heroics also helped Sevilla pick up more European silverware.

12Robert Lewandowski (Barcelona)

What else did you expect? Lewandowski wasn't at his best last year, and still scored 23 league goals to lead Barca to a first La Liga title in three years. He's ageing wonderfully.

10Luka Modric (Real Madrid)

Modric is slowing down slightly, but can still turn in masterful performances on a big stage — something he showed in the Champions League and World Cup. This might be his final nomination, but it is richly deserved.

9Bernardo Silva (Man City)

He was solid in the Premier League, but Silva's season will be best remembered for his showing in the Champions League semi-final, when he tore up Real Madrid to send City on the way to a historic treble. Guardiola must be grateful that one of his most loyal servants has elected to stay at the club.

8Victor Osimhen (Napoli)

He was always going to be good, but Osimhen found another level last year, tearing through Serie A to the tune of 26 goals and four assists. He added five in five starts in the Champions League for good measure, too.

7Julian Alvarez (Man City)

If Messi was the star for Argentina, Alvarez was the cutting edge - a crucial sidekick for a World Cup winning team. His impressive start to the 2023-24 season point towards another big campaign for a side that wants to build on its already historic successes.

6Vinicius Jr (Real Madrid)

Vinicius eclipsed the 20 goal and 20 assist mark for club and country last season, and is now Madrid's bonafide Galactico. Los Blancos will go as far as he can take them this year.

5Rodri (Man City)

A No.6 who can attack like a No.10 and defend like a centre-back, Rodri was arguably the most important player for Man City last year. His winning goal in the Champions League final wasn't bad, either.

4Kevin De Bruyne (Man City)

Haaland grabbed the headlines for City, but once again it was De Bruyne who pulled the strings for Pep Guardiola's side. They have won five of the last six Premier League titles and secured a treble in 2022-23, and De Bruyne is a big reason why.

3Kylian Mbappe (PSG)

World Cup final hat-tricks don't come around very often. Mbappe made his look easy. He wasn't bad at club level either, carrying the Parisians to the title with 29 in Ligue 1. Mbappe has hit the ground running for a revamped PSG to start this campaign, and could be in with a real shout for the award next season.

2Erling Haaland (Man City)

After scoring 52 goals for City last season, Haaland may feel hard done by not bringing home the top prize. He was a transformative talent for a team that somehow got better, and is showing no signs of slowing down.

1Lionel Messi (Inter Miami)

Finally. Messi completed football last season, winning a much-coveted World Cup, and playing a starring role in the process. His electric start to life in Miami has proved that there's still some life in those legs, too. Ballon d'Or No.8, accomplished.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, GOV OF RWANDA REACH AGREEMENT ON IMPLEMENTATION OF ECONOMIC &FINANCIAL POLICIES.

12:29, 2023-10-31

Government of Rwanda officials and the

International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission team have on 31 October, reached a staff-level agreement on successful implementation of the economic and financial policies that were required to complete the second reviews under both the Policy Coordination instrument (PCI) and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF). The mission team and government officials also reached understandings on economic policies that will be supported under a new 14-month Stand-by Credit Facility (SCF) with total access of about US$ 262 million to help mitigate the balance of payment pressures arising from climate-related shocks.







In a statement released on 30 October, the IMF mission team noted that Rwanda coped with

overlapping recent shocks well, but external and domestic imbalances have intensified.

Economic growth remained robust at 6.3 percent in the second quarter of 2023, notwithstanding repeated droughts and the severe floods in May 2023.




Speaking at the conclusion of the Mission, Mr. Ruben Atoyan, the IMF Mission head said:

“Despite the challenging environment, macroeconomic policy performance through end-June 2023 remained broadly in line with program objectives under the PCI.''




''Most quantitative targets were met, and reforms to boost domestic revenue mobilization, advance expenditure rationalization, enhance fiscal transparency, and strengthen foreign exchange market functioning are progressing well.” Reuben added




The mission pointed out that going forward, increasing imbalances require further recalibration of policies to safeguard macroeconomic and external sustainability. Continued fiscal consolidation, proactive and data-driven monetary policy, and further exchange rate adjustment are necessary to rebuild buffers, curb inflation, and improve debt sustainability.

It urged implementation tax reforms to broaden the domestic tax base and improve tax compliance are critical for achieving Rwanda’s revenue objectives. The mission further called

for enhanced efficiency of public investments, better targeting of subsidies and transfers, and

digital delivery of public services.

The team commended strong progress on the climate agenda under the RSF. It noted that

reforms under the RSF will improve transparency and efficiency of allocation of climate-related

public spending and create a conducive environment for attracting climate finance. To further demonstrate the unwavering commitment to the RSF-supported climate agenda and to fully capitalize on the catalytic effect of the RSF, Rwanda is accelerating the implementation of the originally agreed reform measures to enhance the reform agenda by introducing new measures, including the implementation of an internationally recognized green taxonomy,




This agreement, which is subject to approval by the IMF Executive Board in December 2023,

will allow Rwanda to access about US$ 48.5 million under the RSF and US$ 87.5 million

under the SCF as noted by the Minister of finance and Economic planning Dr Uziel NdagijImana

UNDP RWANDA USES SCHOOLS TO SENSTISE COMMUNITIES ON CLEAN COOKING ENERGY.

13:56, 2023-10-30

The United Nations Development Programme Rwanda(UNDP) has embarked on a unique initiative to educate communities about the importance of clean cooking energy. The strategy? Using schools as a platform for outreach and information dissemination since most if not all students come from vast community backgrounds.




Recognizing the influence that educational institutions hold within communities, UNDP and partners Rwanda Environmental Management Authority (REMA) chose to collaborate with over 5 schools in Nyanza district through the famous Green Amayaga to drive their clean energy campaign with the aim to sensitize communities on the benefits of clean cooking energy and promote a shift away from traditional, harmful energy sources that were traditionally used such as firewood that fueled deforestation but also paved way for contamination of food, aiding of respiratory diseases and much more.




According to available research Schools, prisons and Hospitals have been named top consumers of firewood usage than any other sector making schools to serve as the epicenter of communities and play a crucial role in shaping societal norms and values. The initiative leverages this influence, encouraging students to act as ambassadors of change, spreading the word about clean cooking energy within their families and wider communities.




The programme introduced students to the concept of clean cooking energy, highlighting its environmental, health, and economic benefits making them the number one beneficiaries of timely meals served at lunch and dinner breaks yet their schools not mushroomed in smoke like it was in the previous times.

While speaking to the Head teacher of one of the beneficiary schools; Christ Roix High school in Nyanza district, he mentioned that there was a cost cutting on what the school has normally spent on cooking energy by 45%.

''It is expensive to use charcoal or firewood in very many terms, transport, cleaning and renovating the kitchens and utensils themselves yet food takes longer than when we use the Gas facilities that were given to us'' Said HakizaImana Innocent




''Matter of fact if we can get at least 6 more stoves we would totally get rid of the firewood section and fully transform our kitchen into a smart on especially now that we know that our students' meals can be prepared on gas and get ready quickly.'' HakizaImana added




The project has gone ahead to explain how clean energy sources are not just sustainable, but also reduce household air pollution, lower healthcare costs, and contribute to the global fight against climate change.

Additionally, the programme has kept it's focus on the grave health risks associated with traditional cooking methods that rely on biomass fuels like wood and charcoal. By making students aware of these risks, the UNDP hopes to inspire a shift towards clean cooking energy.




''The initiative also includes practical demonstrations of clean cooking technologies, sessions which give students, teaching and non teaching staff a firsthand experience of using clean energy sources, making the concept more tangible and relatable.'' Said Mable Nseng'Imana the district environmental officer.




''We requested UNDP to work with school administrators to adopt clean cooking energy in school cafeterias this move was not only to make schools more eco-friendly but also serve as a practical, everyday demonstration of the benefits of clean energy.'' Mable added




Through this initiative, UNDP aims to create a ripple effect, using the influence of schools to reach out to wider communities. As students take the message of clean cooking energy home, the hope is that families will be encouraged to adopt cleaner, safer, and more sustainable cooking methods.




The strategy is a brilliant example of how institutions can be employed to drive societal change with promises to make significant strides towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 - ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.

As schools become a hub for clean cooking energy awareness, UNDP and partners are not just educating a new generation but also fostering a healthier, more sustainable future.

























PARTNERS IN IMPACT: HOW UNDP AND HVP- GATAGRA ARE CHANGING LIVES IN RWANDA

12:49, 2023-10-30

In a move that promises to significantly advance healthcare access in Rwanda, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has partnered with HVP-Gatagara Orthopedic, Rehabilitation and Physiotherapy Hospital. This alliance aims to offer affordable and quality orthopedic and physiotherapy services to the country's residents, marking a significant stride towards improved healthcare.




The UNDP, through its numerous global initiatives, has always championed accessible and affordable healthcare, recognizing it as a fundamental human right. This partnership with HVP Orthopedic specialised Hospital serves as another testament to UNDP’s commitment to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 3 - ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages.

HVP- Gatagara Orthopedic Hospital, a renowned institution in Rwanda, with its state-of-the-art facilities and a team of highly skilled medical professionals, has been at the forefront of orthopedic care and physiotherapy, however still lacked modern state of the art equipment to manufacture prosthetic limbs and its from this background that UNDP extended a helping hand in acquiring the machines. The hospital's mission aligns seamlessly with UNDP's commitment to fostering equitable access to quality healthcare services particularly those with disabilities.




By joining forces, these two entities aim to break down the barriers to healthcare access by making orthopedic and physiotherapy services more affordable for all residents of Rwanda. This partnership will focus on developing sustainable healthcare models, enhancing the skills of healthcare professionals, and increasing awareness of orthopedic care and physiotherapy among the general population.

Moreover, this collaboration is expected to fast-track the adoption of innovative healthcare solutions, such as telemedicine, to extend quality healthcare services to remote areas of the country. With the UNDP's global expertise and Gatagara Hospital's local knowledge and technical skill, the partnership aims to deliver a revolutionary change in Rwanda's healthcare landscape.

The alliance also underscores the importance of public-private partnerships in advancing healthcare access and quality. It's a model that has the potential to transform healthcare services, not just in Rwanda, but also her neighbours who are considered developing nations as well.




''This partnership between UNDP and HVP-Gatagara is more than just an alliance between two organizations. It's a beacon of hope for countless individuals who, until now, might have found quality healthcare services out of their reach due to financial constraints or geographical limitations. said Brother Kizito Misaga the director general of the hospital.




''As we look forward to the progress this partnership will bring, it's clear that this collaboration is a significant step towards a future where quality healthcare is not a privilege, but a right accessible to all.'' Bro Kizito added




However he continued to highlight challenges facing the hospital in which were understaffing, dilapidated infrastructure, adequate funding which was mainly affecting the low income earners who accessed some of the hospital services via the national insurance [Mutuelle desante] that could not cover some of the treatments if not a few sessions thus hindering treatment pattern.

LEWIS HAMILTON DISQUALIFIED: A TWIST IN THE TAPESTRY OF FORMULA 1

07:35, 2023-10-24

In yet another unexpected turn of the dramatic narrative in Formula One, Lewis Hamilton, the seven-time World Champion, was disqualified from a recent U S A Grand Prix. This news has undoubtedly sent shockwaves through the auto racing world and thrown an unexpected curveball into the ongoing championship as this was the second disqualification in a row.




Ever since his debut in 2007, Hamilton has been a dominating force in the Formula One circuit, with his tenacity and talent earning him a place amongst the sport's legends. But, as any seasoned fan knows, the world of Formula One is as much a test of strategy and adherence to rules as it is a showcase of speed and skill.

Hamilton was just two seconds behind Verstappen at the flag but his car was later declared illegal for excessive wear on the underfloor skid blocks.




Ferrari's Charles Leclerc suffered the same fate after finishing sixth.

Hamilton's disqualification promoted McLaren's Lando Norris to second and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz to third.

Verstappen was measured, slowly picking off the cars in front of him and then holding on for his 50th career win.

Hamilton passed Norris for second in the final laps but ran out of time to catch Verstappen for the lead. Although it's important to note that these rules are in place to ensure fair play and safety, the decision has sparked a flurry of debates among fans and pundits.




Hamilton's disqualification meant it was difficult to draw conclusions from a race after which, before the late technical drama, hindsight had left Hamilton and Mercedes ruing a lost potential victory had they played the strategy differently.

The skid blocks are in place to prevent teams running cars too low, which can be a potential aerodynamic advantage.

The Red Bull did not have the pace off-set it has had so often this year and Norris and Hamilton made Verstappen work for the win.

But Mercedes' inadvertent transgression confuses the picture of a race in which the team seemed to have made a step forward with an upgraded car.

Mercedes tried to make a one-stop strategy work while Verstappen and Norris went for a two, but the decision backfired on them and cost Hamilton more time than the margin by which he eventually lost the race.







RWANDA'S MINISTER OF DEFENCE HIGLIGHTS CHALLENGES FACING PEACE KEEPING MISSIONS AMID HATE SPEECH, PROPAGANDA AND SOCIALMEDIA .

07:08, 2023-10-24

Regardless of the  sophisticated capabilities that may be deployed across the world, and however much strategic communications can be improved, peacekeepers cannot achieve much if they do not have the right mindset to act proactively and decisively in protecting civilians in danger.




These were opening remarks of Rwanda's minister of defence Juvenal Marizamunda, at the fourth and final United Nations preparatory conference for the 2023 peacekeeping ministerial on the protection of civilians and strategic communications taking place in Kigali.

It should be noted that  the meeting comes at a time when peacekeeping missions across the world are facing serious challenges in their deployment.




These challenges, are particularly acute with respect to the core task of protecting civilians in a context where disinformation, misinformation, and hate speech are being propagated faster than ever through social media platforms.

 Marizamunda went ahead to explain how hate speech served as a precursor and enabler of mass killings in the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi.

He further noted that, the Tutsi of Rwanda experienced the devastating effects of disinformation and extremist propaganda mainstreamed by state-owned media in the silent presence of the international community.




“Hate speech is a uniquely dangerous attribute that requires our sustained attention and collective engagement,” Marizamunda said, and added; “It creates a toxic environment that hinders a constructive dialogue.”

“Hate speech reinforces discrimination, undermines social cohesion, and contributes to the marginalization and stigmatization of targeted communities based on ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation, among many others.”




These incidents of  disinformation and hate speech campaign are said to still be spearheaded by the then government officials, whose remnants remain active today, notably under an armed group known as FDLR, and its allies in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

It is believed that (FDLR) genocidal ideology is now directed against Congolese communities of Rwandan expression with the support of the host government and in the presence of the international community that seems not to have learnt from the previous incidents..







SWEEPING CHANGE: RWANDA TO SUBSTITUTE WHEAT FLOUR WITH SWEET POTATO FOUR

12:28, 2023-10-23

As Rwanda moves to celebrate world food day on the 27 October, they take an unprecedented move to substitute wheat flour with sweet potato flour in an attempt to bolster food security, encourage local production, and promote healthier eating habits among its population. This groundbreaking initiative goes hand in hand with the country's commitment to sustainable agriculture and its ongoing efforts to combat the impacts of climate change but also workout a plan on the rising prices of wheat flour that have been hiking over the time.




This comes after Rwanda has started to look for alternative sources of wheat imports following hefty trade sanctions on its major supplier, Russia.

Prior to the sanctions, Rwanda heavily depended on Russia for wheat imports, with at least 64 per cent of the country’s wheat coming from Russia. However, Russia is now facing export and import sanctions as a consequence of its military incursion into Ukraine, which has disrupted this supply.

The data indicate that in 2019, Russia was Rwanda’s top wheat import partner where more than 73,324 tonnes worth $17.5 million (approx. Rwf21 billion) were imported, while in 2020, the United Kingdom came first with 67,145 tonnes of wheat for $16.1 million (approx. Rwf19 billion), followed by Russia with over 60,855 tonnes for $15.2 million (approx. Rwf18 billion).




However this will in turn be of an advantage to the country with the government looking forward to empower population to improve the production from just 8 to 30 tonnes per hectare using six new varieties. 

While speaking to press, Jean Ndirigwe, a sweet potato breeder at Rwanda Agriculture and Animal Resources Board (RAB) said, they have sweet potato varieties that can increase production and these Sweet potatoes can replace wheat in baking factories and cut the wheat imports

THE US HOUSE SPEAKER RACE TURNS LEFT ; REP. LAWMAKERS RECIEVE DEATH THREATS.

10:57, 2023-10-19

In a startling revelation, numerous Republican lawmakers have reported experiencing intimidation tactics, including death threats, allegedly from allies of Jim Jordan. This comes as the Ohio Representative's bid for the U.S. House of Representatives speakership shows signs of faltering.

The lawmakers, who have chosen to remain anonymous due to concerns for their safety, have expressed their dismay and fear over the alarming incidents. They perceive these actions as an attempt to influence their decisions regarding the coveted speakership position.

Jim Jordan, a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, announced his bid for the speakership earlier this year. His campaign, however, has been marked by controversy. Now, with these disturbing allegations of intimidation, his bid appears to be on shaky ground.

The alleged threats, reportedly delivered through anonymous phone calls and messages, have created a tense atmosphere within Republican circles. The accusations suggest a level of desperation from Jordan's camp, as they struggle to garner the necessary support for his speakership bid.




While Jordan's office has categorically denied any involvement in these alleged intimidation tactics, the situation has raised serious concerns within the party. Many are calling for a thorough investigation into the matter to ensure the safety and integrity of the lawmakers involved.

These incidents underscore the high stakes and intense pressure surrounding the race for the speakership. The position, which is third in line for presidential succession, holds significant influence within the House and is a major political stepping stone.

As the news of these intimidation tactics circulates, it adds an unexpected dimension to the speakership race. It remains to be seen how these allegations will impact Jordan's campaign and whether they will sway the decision of his fellow Republicans.




Regardless of the outcome, one thing is clear: The race for the speakership has become a stress test for the unity and values of the Republican Party. The party now faces the critical task of addressing these allegations seriously and ensuring a fair and safe process in the race for the House speakership.

WORLD'S MOBILE PLAYERS MEET IN KIGALI TO DISCUSS TECH ENHANCEMENT.

13:03, 2023-10-17

In an event that has put the Rwandan capital in the global spotlight and officially opened by President Paul Kagame, the Mobile World Congress 2023 started on 17 October in Kigali. The conference, known for being a significant platform for mobile industry leaders, innovators, and enthusiasts from around the globe, aims to explore the future of mobile technology.




In his opening speech, President Kagame emphasized the importance of digital technology and mobile connectivity in transforming societies and economies. He highlighted how Rwanda has embraced digital technology as a key driver of national development, and underscored the nation's commitment to fostering a conducive environment for technological innovation especially now in the post COVI 19 period.




"Mobile technology has the potential to reshape our world, bridging gaps and fostering inclusivity," President Kagame stated. He went on to express his hope that the congress would inspire new collaborations, innovations, and solutions that address both local and global challenges.




“The pandemic has added to accelerating the transition to a new era of the technology-led development. Our young and talented entrepreneurs are driving this change, and we continue to support them.




That means we have to address the gaps in access and connectivity, with a sense of urgency. Too many Africans remain offline. Today, Africa has the fastest-growing mobile penetration rate globally. But we still have a long way to go.




Yet, we already have the means to address the problems we are dealing with today. Regional integration, powered by faster and more reliable broadband, is a big part of it.




We can get more results, faster, by working together.” Kagame added

12:55, 2023-10-17

On Monday, October 16, 2023, Rwandan President Paul Kagame hosted an important meeting with the Transitional President of Gabon, Gen Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, at Village Urugwiro. The meeting, which also included a delegation from Gabon, marked a significant step in the bilateral relations between Rwanda and Gabon.

In a broader context, the meeting reflects Rwanda's and Gabon's commitment to fostering stronger relations among African nations. It sends a strong signal about the importance of dialogue, cooperation, and mutual respect in the pursuit of a prosperous and peaceful Africa.

As the meeting concluded, it left a promise of reinforced friendship, collaborative growth, and a shared vision for a better future. This historic meeting between President Paul Kagame and Gen Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema not only strengthens Rwanda-Gabon relations but also sets a precedent for mutual respect and collaboration among African nations.
















INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY SEES SAD NEWS FOR MARKETS FROM MIDDLE EAST WAR

The Israel-Hamas war is affecting oil markets already stretched by cutbacks in oil production from Saudi Arabia and Russia and expected stronger demand from China, the head of the International Energy Agency said Tuesday 17 October.




“As we see the tensions in the Middle East, the market becomes much more jittery, and it is definitely not good news coming out of this crisis,” Fatih Birol, executive director of the Paris-based IEA, told The Associated Press.




“We may very well see much more volatile prices, and it can push prices higher, which is definitely bad news for inflation,” he added.




Developing countries that import energy would be the most affected by higher prices, Birol said.

International benchmark Brent crude traded close to $90 per barrel on Tuesday, up from $85 on Oct. 6, the day before Hamas attacked Israel. Fluctuations last week pushed prices as high as $96.

THE ESCALATING CRISIS: ISRAEL'S RECENT ATTACKS ON GAZA

13:27, 2023-10-16

The political landscape of the Middle East has once again been shaken by an escalation of hostilities. The focus of the world has turned towards the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza, which has been intensifying since the Israeli attack on October 7, 2023

.

The recent attacks have had devastating consequences. Up until now, it has been reported that at least 2,750 Palestinians have been killed, and around 9,700 wounded as a result of Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip .

As the conflict continues, the crisis in Gaza deepens, with Israel facing accusations of engaging in proxy warfare, allegedly backed by Iran.

Efforts towards achieving a ceasefire and enabling aid to reach the enclave have been stalled. On the contrary, Israel has denied truce to allow aid into Gaza. This has put an enormous strain on the region's humanitarian situation, with many international bodies and diplomatic efforts trying to negotiate peace and enable the provision of aid.




The conflict has also seen involvement from Hezbollah, which has claimed responsibility for some of the attacks. As a retaliation, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) reports carrying out airstrikes against Hezbollah sites.

As of today, October 16, 2023, the situation remains volatile, with both sides showing no signs of backing down. The international community watches anxiously, hoping for a return to diplomacy, and an end to the bloodshed.




These recent events underscore the need for a comprehensive and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The world's attention must remain focused on this region, not only to address the immediate crisis but to work towards a peaceful resolution that respects the rights and aspirations of all parties involved.

RWANDA IS SET TO DEPLOY AI IN THE STUDY OF GENES TO PREVENT CANCER.

08:33, 2023-10-16

In a groundbreaking move, Rwanda is set to implement a project that uses Artificial Intelligence to detect genetic risk factors for cancer. The country's Health Minister, Dr. Sabin Nsanzimana, has recently announced that this innovative initiative is currently underway.




The project aims to identify genes within communities that are likely to develop certain types of cancer in the future. This is achieved through the integration of AI with genetics and diagnostics, a combination that could potentially revolutionize early cancer detection and prevention strategies.




''The application of AI in healthcare is not new, but the use of this technology for genetic testing at a national level is a significant step forward. By identifying individuals at risk, Rwanda can proactively address potential health issues before they become critical.'' Said Dr Sabin




This could mean earlier interventions, personalized treatment plans, and ultimately, better health outcomes.

While the project is still in its infancy, the implications are far-reaching. If successful, this could set a precedent for other nations to follow suit, using technology and genetics to predict and prevent disease. It's a clear testament to Rwanda's commitment to leveraging advanced technology in improving the health of its citizens.




This project shows promise in tackling health issues at their root, potentially saving lives, and reducing the burden of disease on the healthcare system. It's a thrilling development, and we'll be watching closely as Rwanda continues to innovate in the healthcare sector.

HONELESSNESS IN CANADA BEATS ODDS AS RENT PRICES SOAR HIGH.

07:58, 2023-10-05

As rent prices continue to skyrocket across Canada, the issue of homelessness becomes the most pressing issue for Justin Trudeau's government. This article explores the challenges faced by those experiencing homelessness in Canada and delves into the factors contributing to this crisis. Despite the odds stacked against them, individuals without stable housing in Canada display resilience and determination in their daily lives.




Rent prices in Canada have seen an alarming surge in recent years, making it increasingly difficult for many individuals to secure stable housing. The perplexing reality is that while the cost of renting has soared, wages have not kept pace with this rapid increase. This leaves a significant portion of the population struggling to afford suitable accommodation.




The burstiness of the housing market further compounds the issue of homelessness. Rapid fluctuations in rental availability and affordability create an unpredictable environment, leaving individuals vulnerable to sudden changes in their housing situation. The lack of stability in the housing market adds to the complexity of addressing homelessness in Canada.




This crisis takes a profound toll on individuals and communities alike. Without a stable place to call home, individuals face numerous challenges, including limited access to basic amenities and increased vulnerability to physical and mental health issues. The human toll of homelessness is a pressing concern that must be urgently addressed.

Despite the difficult circumstances they face, those experiencing homelessness in Canada often display remarkable perseverance. They demonstrate resilience and resourcefulness in navigating the challenges of everyday life without a permanent home. By highlighting their stories, we shed light on the strength and determination of individuals facing homelessness.




However addressing homelessness requires a collaborative effort from all levels of society. Governments, non-profit organizations, and individuals must work hand-in-hand to develop sustainable solutions. This includes implementing affordable housing initiatives, providing adequate support services, and increasing access to mental health care to address the underlying factors contributing to homelessness in Canada. It is crucial to approach the issue of homelessness with empathy and support rather than judgment. By understanding the complex factors that lead to homelessness, we can begin to challenge misconceptions and break down the barriers that prevent individuals from accessing the support they need. Treating those experiencing homelessness with compassion and dignity is essential to creating lasting change.




As rent prices soar in Canada, the issue of homelessness becomes increasingly challenging to address. However, by government recognizing the perplexity and burstiness of the housing market, understanding the toll it takes on individuals, and working together to develop collaborative solutions, we can strive to make a difference. Let us not forget the resilience and determination displayed by those experiencing homelessness in Canada as we work towards a future where everyone has a place to call home.

WHAT KIND OF DRUG IS THE NEWLY APPROVED R21/Matrix-M?

07:39, 2023-10-05

According to Sir Brian Greenwood professor of clinical tropical medicine at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the R21/Matrix-M™ vaccine was along outstanding project of research developed by researchers at the University of Oxford and the Serum Institute of India.

The R21 as code named is the second malaria vaccine to be recommended for global use, following in the footsteps of the RTS,S vaccine evaluated by researchers at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and manufactured by GSK. 

Both the RTS,S and R21 vaccines induce an immune response to the same circumsporozoite protein antigen found on the surface of the Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite, the stage of the parasite injected by a mosquito. 




Sir Brian Greenwood, Professor of Clinical Tropical Medicine at LSHTM, who has paved the way in malaria research with his contributions to the development of the RTS,S vaccine, said: 

“The wait for an effective malaria vaccine has been a long one and it was only in October 2021 that World Health Organisation(WHO) recommended deployment of the world’s first malaria vaccine RTS,S. Now, two years later, a second malaria vaccine, R21, has also been approved by WHO. 

“No direct comparison of the two vaccines has been done, but it is likely that the level and duration of protection that each provides are similar, as they both induce a comparable immune response to their target antigen on the surface of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite.




“The manufacture and deployment of two similar malaria vaccines is not redundant. Restriction of vaccine production at a single site, or by a single company, carries a risk of interrupted supply should there be an unanticipated external event and further research will still be needed to study the long-term safety of R21. Production of the R21 vaccine is likely to be cheaper then RTS,S, which will help improve the reach of vaccination.'' Sir Greenwood said

Governments world over upon receiving this news, went on in high gear to prepare to rollout the vaccinations particularly to be deployed to areas prone to the disease considered to kill more people in the world than any other







POPE FRANCIS SENDS A LOUD WARNING MESSAGE OVER THE WEST'S MODEL TOWARDS CLIMATE CHANGE APPROACH.

15:51, 2023-10-04

Pope Francis shamed and challenged world leaders on Wednesday September 4 to commit to binding targets to slow climate change before it’s too late, warning that God’s increasingly warming creation is fast reaching a “point of no return.”

In an update to his landmark 2015 encyclical on the environment, the Pontiff heightened the alarm about the “irreversible” harm to people and planet already under way and lamented that once again, the world’s poor and most vulnerable are paying the highest price.




“We are now unable to halt the enormous damage we have caused. We barely have time to prevent even more tragic damage,” Francis warned.




The pope took square aim at the United States, noting that per-capita emissions in the U.S. are twice as high as China and seven times greater than the average in poor countries. While individual, household efforts are helping, “we can state that a broad change in the irresponsible lifestyle connected with the Western model would have a significant long-term impact,” he said.

DR. PAUL FARMER'S VISION CONTINUES TO THRIVE.

11:16, 2023-10-04




The front face of the newly opened, modern state of the art building at Butaro that was financed by Partners in Health and built by the chinese company ECCE in Burera district is clad with a tree illustration to symbolise the vision of what is visible in 2nd phase now with more to go..




During the opening ceremony the minister of health Dr.Sabin Nsanzimana, Governor Northern Province, PIH executive director Dr. Joel Mubiligi, Director general of the hospital Lt. Gen Emanuel Kayitare, took a tour around the building and took some one on one time with the staff and patients that were already enjoying the comforts of this building.




The newly installed imagery machinery will aid doctors in early detection, diagnosis and treatment which is believed to reduce mortality rate of mothers to around 80%, extend cancer care to around 30% and thus easing the work of the already stretched personnel.




This facility doesn't come with any extra costing unto the patients for the services are still going to be under the Mutuelle system and to even ensure quick recovery, PIH continues to lay effort for everyone on the wards , be it doctor, nurse, patient, house keeper or security is well fed.

PARTNERS IN HEALTH -RWANDA INAUGURATE THE STATE OF THE ART FULLY FURNISHED BUILDING AT BUTARO HOSPITAL.

09:41, 2023-10-04

Partners in Health (PIH) and the Ministry of Health conjoined forces to inaugurate the impressive three-floor expansion of the Butaro Level 2 Teaching Hospital(BL2TH) on September 3. This development marked a significant milestone in providing much-needed healthcare services to the local community and the region in general. With increased capacity of beds from 150 to 237 and improved facilities, the Butaro Hospital expansion aims to enhance healthcare delivery and improve the overall well-being of the region as thought by the founder late Dr. Paul Farmer.

Expanding to Meet Growing Needs

The country executive director PIH Dr. Mubiligi Jpel noted that the Butaro Level 2 Teaching Hospital(BL2TH) expansion project demonstrates a proactive approach towards meeting the growing healthcare needs of the community.

'' By providing additional floors, the hospital can accommodate more patients and offer a wider range of medical services. This expansion is a testament to the commitment of PIH and the Ministry of Health to ensure accessible and quality healthcare for all.'' Dr Mubiligi added




The new three-floor building includes state-of-the-art pediatric and mature oncology wards, imagery equipment, creating an environment conducive to comprehensive healthcare delivery. With increased capacity for specialised departments, such as surgery, pediatrics, and internal medicine, the hospital is better equipped to handle a variety of medical conditions and provide specialized care to patients.

Advancing Healthcare Services
Strengthening Collaboration

The minister of healthy Dr.Sabin Nsanzimana applauded the partnership between PIH and the Ministry of Health over the years and said, ''it has been instrumental in bringing about positive changes in the local healthcare landscape.''




''By pooling their resources, expertise, and knowledge, we are steadily becoming successful in addressing the challenges faced by the Butaro Hospital and improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare services not only in cities but everywhere in Rwanda.'' added Dr Sabin




This Hospital's expansion project not only benefits patients but also empowers local communities in away of nearing urbanisation to the remote Burera district. This is so with the upgrade from just being just a district hospital to being accredited as a level 2 teaching hospital that will avail opportunity to medical students from across the region to come to the hospital for their ward rotations and clinical studies, increased capacity and improved facilities which will attract skilled healthcare professionals, creating job opportunities and boosting the local economy. Additionally, the expansion helps to alleviate the burden on patients and their families, who no longer need to travel long distances to seek medical care.




However at the same event the director general of the hospital, Lt.Gen. Emanuel Kayitare mentioned that there were still challenges facing the institution, that ranged from clean piped water, adequate power to run equipment, access roads and more funding to easily maintain doctors and nurses that leave the facility.




''The inauguration of the Hospital expanded building is milestone in the provision of healthcare services.'' said the Governor of Northern Province who also acknowledged the increased capacity that allows more comprehensive and accessible care for the local community.

This partnership exemplifies the commitment to address the healthcare challenges faced by underserved regions and improve the overall well-being of the population. The Butaro Hospital expansion stands as a testament to the transformative power of collaboration in advancing healthcare services.

GABON'S TRANSITION LEADER IN A MOVE TO REPAIR THE LONG LOST TUMOIL RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOR CONGO BRAZAVILLE.

11:38, 2023-10-02

Gabon’s transitional president, who ousted the leader of the central African country at the end of August, received a show of support from the neighboring Republic of Congo after he met his counterpart on Sunday, aiming to improve relations and ease Gabon’s isolation.




General Brice Oligui Nguema overthrew Ali Bongo Ondimba, 64, who had ruled Gabon since 2009, moments after he was proclaimed the winner in a presidential election in late August. The election result was branded a fraud by the opposition and the military coup leaders, who had also accused his regime of widespread corruption and bad governance.




Under the presidency of Ali Bongo, relations between Gabon and neighboring Congo were notoriously tense. Oligui said his visit was aimed at improving the ties and easing Gabon’s international isolation following the coup.

“I have come to consult, to discuss, to exchange with (the president), who for us is a key in the region, who can relay to global authorities what we have done,” Oligui said after holding talks with Congo President Denis Sassou Nguesso

“It is also to ease the sanctions… we hope to once again take our place among the nations,” Oligui said.

Gabon was suspended from the African Union and the Economic Community of Central Africa States (ECCAS) after the change of government. ECCAS has also ordered the immediate transfer of its headquarters from Gabon’s Libreville to the Equatorial Guinea capital Malabo.

THE CITY OF MANCHESTER IN TOTAL DISBELIEF OVER WEEKEND'S RESULTS.

09:45, 2023-10-02

In a weekend filled with unexpected outcomes, the city of Manchester found itself in a state of despair as both Manchester United and Manchester City suffered surprising defeats. The Red Devils were defeated by Crystal Palace, while Pep Guardiola's men succumbed to a loss against Wolves. These results have left football fans in shock and disappointment, raising questions about the state of both teams and their prospects for the season ahead. Let's delve into the details and analyze the impact of these losses.

Manchester United's Defeat to Crystal Palace

In a highly anticipated match, Manchester United faced off against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford. The Red Devils, boasting an impressive start to the season, were considered strong favorites to secure a victory. However, to the astonishment of fans and pundits alike, Crystal Palace emerged victorious with a stunning 0-1 win.

Despite dominating possession and creating several opportunities, Manchester United failed to convert their chances into goals. Their defense was also caught off guard, allowing Crystal Palace to capitalize on their limited attacking opportunities. The defeat raises concerns about United's ability to maintain consistent form and challenges Ten Hag to identify areas for improvement.

Manchester City's Unexpected Loss to Wolves

Simultaneously, Manchester City, the reigning Premier League champions, faced Wolves in an intense battle. The match witnessed an unexpected turn of events as Wolves secured a surprising 2-1 victory, leaving City supporters in disbelief.

Manchester City's usually formidable attack seemed unusually subdued, stifled by Wolves' resolute defense. The defeat not only exposed City's vulnerability to well-organized opposition but also served as a reminder that no team is invincible. Pep Guardiola who wasn't on the touchline due to disciplinary issue, faces the task of rallying his squad and reigniting their winning mentality as the season progresses.




The losses suffered by both Manchester United and Manchester City have ignited discussions about the overall strength of the teams and their title prospects. While it's important not to overreact to single defeats, these results have undoubtedly dampened the spirits of fans and raised concerns within the respective club setups.

For Manchester United, this loss highlights the need for greater attacking efficiency and defensive solidity. It puts pressure on TenHag to fine-tune his tactics and motivate his players to bounce back stronger in upcoming matches.

Manchester City, on the other hand, must use this defeat as a wake-up call to ensure they maintain a consistent level of performance. Guardiola's tactical prowess will be tested as he seeks to rectify the flaws exposed by Wolves.




In an unexpected turn of events, Manchester United and Manchester City faced shocking defeats against Crystal Palace and Wolves, respectively. These outcomes have left football enthusiasts in awe and raised questions about the teams' capabilities. As the season progresses, the pressure mounts on both Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Pep Guardiola to address the weaknesses exposed by these losses and guide their teams back to winning ways. The city of Manchester remains hopeful that its beloved clubs will quickly recover and restore the city's footballing pride.

WHAT'S IN FOR RWANDA AFTER NEIGHBOURS WIN BID TO HOST AFCON 2027.

09:23, 2023-10-02

Finally the biggest football event makes its triumph entry to East Africa after Kenya,Uganda,Tanzania lodged in what they called the ''pamoja Bid'' and came victorious with Morocco who won by default after Algeria, Zambia and a joint bid from Benin and Nigeria all withdrew before the vote of the Confederation of African Football's executive committee in Cairo on Wednesday 27 September.

The north African country was a runaway favourite and will see the decision as a boost to their hopes of co-hosting the 2030 World Cup with Portugal and Spain.




It is only the second time that Morocco will host Africa's most popular sporting event, almost four decades after the previous time in 1988.

The joint East African bid for 2027 returns the finals to the region for the first time since 1976.For Rwanda, the joint hosting of the AFCON by three countries in the region – two of them, Uganda and Tanzania, share a border with Rwanda – is a good incentive for Amavubi to participate.




The hosting of the competition will bring the development of football infrastructure and others to the sub-region as countries in CECAFA seek to catch up with others on the continent.

The President of Rwanda Football Federation, Alphonse Munyantwali, said they are thrilled that the competition is coming to the region.

"We’re of course happy to see AFCON coming closer to Rwanda as neighboring countries are going to host it jointly. The hosting countries are going to develop more football infrastructure that will be used not only by the three countries but also by the players in the region in various competitions," Munyantwali told Times Sport.

The FERWAFA boss said that many Rwandans will travel to the neighboring countries to have a real AFCON experience; watching games live at the various stadiums.




"AFCON being closer means that Rwandans would be able to easily go to the neighboring countries to watch matches. It also shows that in the near future countries in our region will be able to host AFCON and other competitions."

With the competition coming closer, Munyantwali believes that players on Rwanda’s national team, Amavubi, will be motivated to go all out and secure qualification since they know the East African terrain well and this could work in their favor during the tournament.

09:03, 2023-10-02

Two scientists won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday 2 October for discoveries that enabled the development of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19.

The award was given to Katalin Karikó, a professor at Sagan’s University in Hungary and an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and Drew Weissman, who performed his prizewinning research together with Karikó at the University of Pennsylvania.

“Through their groundbreaking findings, which have fundamentally changed our understanding of how mRNA interacts with our immune system, the laureates contributed to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development during one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times,” the panel that awarded the prize said.




Thomas Perlmann, secretary of the Nobel Assembly, announced the prize and said both scientists were “overwhelmed” by news of the prize when he contacted them shortly before the announcement

The Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine was won last year by Swedish scientist Svante Paabo for discoveries in human evolution that unlocked secrets of Neanderthal DNA which provided key insights into our immune system, including our vulnerability to severe COVID-19.

The award was the second in the family. Paabo’s father, Sune Bergstrom, won the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1982.

Nobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday3 October, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 9.







AFRICAN MINISTERS MEET IN KIGALI TO DISCUSS AGENDA 2063

08:32, 2023-10-02

The African Union (AU) Executive Council kicked off a three-day retreat, in Kigali, to discuss the second decade of Agenda 2063 among other things.

This is in pursuance of the continent's vision to have an equal say in global decision-making, it is also time to ensure that no African citizens are left behind in developmental endeavors, be it at the local, government, national, or continental levels, officials have said.

Hosted under the theme “Accelerating the Implementation of Agenda 2063”, the high-level meeting brought together ministers in charge of Foreign Affairs; ministers in charge of Finance and Development Planning; Ambassadors, AUC leadership; and Heads of AU organs, among others.

In her remarks, Monique Nsanzabaganwa, the Deputy Chairperson of the African Union Commission, commended AUC member states, other AU organs, the regional economic communities, and regional mechanisms, partners such as the UNDP, the UNICEF, the UNECA, the African Development Bank, the African Bank, for their respective contribution.

According to Nsanzabaganwa, Agenda 2063 seeks to deliver on a set of Seven Aspirations each with its own set of goals, which if achieved is expected to move Africa closer to achieving its vision.

The Seven Aspirations, she said, reflect Africa’s desire for shared prosperity and well-being, for unity and integration, for a continent of free citizens and expanded horizons, where the full potential of women and youth are realised, and with freedom from fear, disease, and want.

“Around them, we are collectively undertaking to make sure that every nation by the end of the next 10 years will be in the middle-income category. But of course, some are already there and we want them to be even higher. We want also to achieve more integration and connection in our continent. We are also undertaking to ensure our public institutions at all levels are more responsive to citizens' needs.”

She added, “We also want to commit to making it a reality that Africa is resolving conflicts amicably. Africa has to remain a strong and influential global player.”




GOVERNMENT STICKS TO THE COMMITIMENT OF HAVING EVERYONE ACCESS CLEAN WATER BY 2024.

12:36, 2023-09-27

As the Government continues to stick to its promise to have more piped water and perhaps have every family access clean water by the end of year 2024, more strategies , financing and investment in infrastructure continues to be visible with the latest effort being a $52 million (approx. Rwf62.8 billion) funding is expected to add 36,000 cubic meters of water to the daily production capacity of Karenge water treatment plant which is currently estimated at 12,000, according to the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, Uzziel Ndagijimana.




This will be done through upgrading the plant, bringing its supply to a total capacity to 48,000 cubic meters a day, he indicated.

The plant is located on the shores of Lake Mugesera in Rwamagana District, Eastern Province. It will contribute to water supply in Rwamagana and in different parts of the City of Kigali, including Kanombe, Ndera and Rusororo.

On September 26, the lower chamber of Parliament adopted a law on the ratification of the $52 million loan agreement between the Government of Rwanda and the Hungarian Export-Import Bank, which is meant to increase the capacity of Karenge water treatment plant.

The agreement was signed between the Government and the bank representatives on July 16, 2023, in Kigali.




Ndagijimana explained to the lawmakers that the loan will be paid in 24 years, at a zero per cent interest rate – meaning it is an interest-free loan, this indicated that a large amount of water will be provided to Rwamagana district in order to contribute to water supply to Rwamagana industrial park being developed in the district, to facilitate factory operations.

Some parliamentarians expressed concern that residents in areas that do not have factories or are not in their vicinities might not get access to water in this project.

MP Christine Muhongayire expounded that increasing the plant’s water processing capacity from 12,000 cubic meters a day to 48,000 cubic meters represents a significant development in terms of water availability. She wanted to know how water access would be improved as a result of the project.

CHINA AND IRAN JOIN THE SPACE RACE AS THEY TOO LAUNCH SATELITES IN SPACE.

11:42, 2023-09-27

China on Wednesday 37September sent its latest remote sensing satellite into space from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China.

The satellite, Yaogan-33 04, was launched on a Long March-4C carrier rocket at 4:15 a.m. (Beijing Time), and has entered its planned orbit successfully.

It will be used for scientific experiments, land resource surveys, crop yield estimates, and disaster prevention and relief work.

The launch was the 489th flight mission of the Long March carrier rocket series, Qhereas in TEHRAN, — Iran said Thursday 21 September it launched a rocket with a satellite carrier bearing three research devices into space, though it’s unclear if any of the objects entered orbit around the Earth.

The state TV report, as well as others by semiofficial news agencies, did not say when the launch was conducted nor what devices the carrier brought with it. However, the launch comes amid ongoing negotiations in Vienna over Iran’s tattered nuclear deal. Previous launches have drawn rebukes from the United States.

Ahmad Hosseini, an Iranian Defense Ministry spokesman, identified the rocket used as a Simorgh, or “Phoenix,” rocket. He said the three devices were sent up 470 kilometers (290 miles).

It should be remembered that these series launches comes shortly after the US and India have had successful space missions with in the same space period that being the launch of the Chadraya1 and NASA's capsule return with space rock samples.

11:01, 2023-09-27

Mali’s military government on Monday 25 September said it would postpone February elections for technical reasons, further pushing back a timeline for a return to democratic rule after two coups.

Mali had been expected to hold the first round of the vote on Feb. 4, 2024, and a second round two weeks later, which was already a two-year delay to a timetable originally agreed by the West African country’s interim authorities.

The junta’s statement said the delay would be small and was due to several factors including a dispute with a French firm over a civil registry database. It said it would give a new timeline at a later date. This comes with accusations pointing to a French-based international tech company IDEMIA, which provided a civil identification system known as RAVEC to the former government, of holding its database “hostage” since March due to unpaid bills.

The situation makes it impossible to register newly eligible voters and update the voter registry, and is slowing down the roll out of a new biometric identity card, making it hard to go on with the organisation of the elections.

A spokesperson for IDEMIA however said that the company has no contract with Mali’s interim authorities and confirmed that its service had been shut down because of outstanding invoices.

10:46, 2023-09-27

The Mandela family has yet lost another strong pillar after they confirmed the passing of Zoleka Mandela, the granddaughter of struggle stalwarts Nelson and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, at the age of 43.

US RUN AWAY SOLDIER TO BE EXPELED BY NORTH KOREA.

10:23, 2023-09-27

After a record of more than fives years not heard of an arrest or closure crossing of a US soldier into North Korea, Private Travis King made it to the headlines on July 18 after he had served in South Korea, sprinted into North Korea while on a civilian tour of a border village, becoming the first American confirmed to be detained in the North.




North Korea said Wednesday 27 September that it will expel a U.S. this soldier who crossed into the country through the heavily armed border between the Koreas in July.

The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said that authorities have finished their questioning of Pvt. Travis King. It did not say when officials plan to expel him or to where.

At the time he crossed the border, King was supposed to be heading to Fort Bliss, Texas, following his release from prison in South Korea on an assault conviction.

It should be remembered that King was received as an asylum seeker who continued to allege that he was running away from the continuous mistreatment and racism that was introspected in the US milTtary.




TRUMP JUDGED FOR FRAUD OVER THE YEARS.

10:02, 2023-09-27

A US judge ruled that Donald Trump committed fraud for years while building the real estate empire that catapulted him to fame and the White House, and he ordered some of the former president’s companies removed from his control and dissolved.

Judge Arthur Engoron, ruling in a civil lawsuit brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James on 27 September, found that Trump and his company deceived banks, insurers and others by massively overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on paperwork used in making deals and securing loans.

Engoron ordered that some of Trump’s business licenses be rescinded as punishment, making it difficult or impossible for them to do business in New York, and said he would continue to have an independent monitor oversee Trump Organization operations.

Trump, in a series of statements, railed against the decision, calling it “un-American” and part of an ongoing plot to damage his campaign to return to the White House.




“My Civil rights have been violated, and some Appellate Court, whether federal or state, must reverse this horrible, un-American decision,” he wrote on his Truth Social site. He insisted his company had “done a magnificent job for New York State” and “done business perfectly,” calling it “A very sad Day for the New York State System of Justice!”

Trump’s lawyer, Christopher Kise, said they would appeal, calling the decision “completely disconnected from the facts and governing law.”










KENYA LOOSES ANOTHER BREED OF YOUNG AIRFORCE SOLIDIERS IN PLANE CRASH.

12:37, 2023-09-20

Another tragic incident hits the Kenya Defense Forces as a group of young and vibrant air force soldiers met their sudden death while on an night operation in the border region of Lamu on Monday night 18 September.

This comes after the crash of a military helicopter in Kenya, near the border with Somalia, killed at least eight people, officials said .

The cause of the accident in Lamu County, on the Kenyan coast, was not immediately clear. Kenyan defense forces operate in the region to help deter al-Qaeda- linked extremists from the Al-Shahab group, based across the border in Somalia.

The Defense Ministry said the Air Force helicopter crashed during a night patrol. A commission of inquiry was sent to the scene. A defense official and a police official said all military personnel and crew members aboard the helicopter had died on spot.




Kenyan troops are also present in Somalia as part of the African Union Transitional Mission in Somalia to help fight Al-Shabab. Kenyan forces deployed to Somalia in 2011, but there are now plans to withdraw multinational forces as Somali troops take over their country's security.

Al-Shabab has increased attacks in Kenya in recent months, killing dozens of people in the border region, as the extremists feel pressure from a Somali military offensive launched last year.

The president and commander in chief of the armed forces issued a statement of condolence to the families of the fallen soldiers saying that , as a nation they were grateful for the committed and dedicated service show cased by these young Kenyans who put their life on line to protect their county's sovereignty.

EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS CONTINUE TO HIT CHINA.

12:15, 2023-09-20

Extreme weather continues to claim lives and destroying property in the worlds second biggest economy , this is after ten people have been confirmed dead as two tornadoes ripped through two cities in China’s eastern Jiangsu province.

It’s the latest deadly extreme weather event to hit the country, which over the last few months has been grappling with severe floods as well as extreme heat waves.

Five people were killed and four were severely injured from a strong tornado that struck Suqian city in Jiangsu province on Tuesday18 September, according to state broadcaster CCTV. The province lies on China’s eastern coast.

More than 400 people have been relocated and more than 130 houses were destroyed in the city, CCTV reported.




Separately, an even stronger tornado left five people dead and four with minor injuries Tuesday night in Yancheng – which lies southeast of Suqian city and north of China’s biggest city, Shanghai – CCTV said, adding that 129 people have been relocated.

PRESIDENT MNANGAGWA UNDER CRITICISM FOR APPOINTING SON AND NEPHEW IN CABINET.

10:06, 2023-09-19

One of the president's politically vibrant sons, David Mnangagwa, 34, will now serve as the deputy to Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, while the president's nephew, Tongai Mafidhi Mnangagwa, also got on the table as deputy minister of tourism and hospitality. This decision is part of the newly constituted cabinet consisting of 26 ministries, local media reported.




Fadzayi Mahere, a lawmaker from the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), criticized President Mnangagwa's cabinet, describing it as "indefensible." She highlighted concerns about legitimacy, corruption, violence, nepotism, incompetence, and ethical issues within the government.

In another move that raised eyebrows, President Mnangagwa appointed a husband and wife team, Christopher and Monica Mutsvangwa, as ministers. Christopher Mutsvangwa will lead the new ministry of Veterans of Liberation, while Monica Mutsvangwa is the new minister of Women's Affairs and SMEs.




David Mnangagwa, who recently graduated with a law degree from the University of Zimbabwe, entered parliament through the youth quota system on the Zanu PF party list from Midlands province. He is one of President Mnangagwa's reported nearly two dozen children.

Tongai Mnangagwa is the Zanu PF Member of Parliament for Hunyani constituency. His late father, David Mnangagwa, was President Mnangagwa's younger brother.




Reports suggest that President Mnangagwa is also considering an official role in his office for another of his sons, Emmerson Junior. Sources indicate that Emmerson Junior has already participated in the president's meetings with foreign investors, and there are plans to formalize his role, possibly as an adviser or director.

This controversy comes on the heels of President Mnangagwa's re-election amid opposition claims of electoral irregularities. Critics argue that his actions are contributing to a perception of dynastic politics in Africa, following the footsteps of other leaders who have appointed family members to key government positions.

GOVERNMENT TO RENT HOMES FOR 200 FAMILIES IN DISASTER PRONE AREAS.

10:01, 2023-09-19

Government is slated to evacuate over 200 families in Rubavu after another scare of mudslides that could destroy homes in the same area.

The district leaders confirmed that these families would be rented homes for like the previously relocated ones as homes slated to be their next are being prepared.

It should be noted that some of the families had been relocated to the newly furnished modern village in Rugerero earlier in july and there is hope that these other ones would too be shifted in the yet to be completed projects

While speaking to press  Nyirasafari Monique the spokes person of Nyundo said they had finished with the scouting process of the homes and the next move was to relocate all the evacuees.




It should be remembered that heavy rainfall, battered Rwanda causing landslides and deadly floods on May 2-3, the government initiated an emergency response, including evacuations and temporary relocations to camps for affected residents.

The region's mountainous terrain makes it more prone to floods and landslides compared to other parts of the country and has caused disastrous incidences in the past. Residents relocated to resettlement shelters and model villages express how their lives have improved, emphasizing the need for a mindset shift among citizens reluctant to move from high-risk zones to safer locations.

"Even though some were hesitant to move to these homes, it is important to note that on this day, our lives are not at risk anymore," resident Mukangira Maria insists.




"If you look at all the lives that were lost in the floods and the distraction that was caused, We are grateful for the resettlement program we have received from our leaders."

The Government of Rwanda is still in the process of identifying new non –high risk zone areas where they can resettle the displaced families that were affected by the floods and landslides.




For years, the Virunga Mountains region has grappled with the devastating consequences of heavy rainfall, resulting in damage to schools, health facilities, homes, crops, and even lives in volcanic regions. However, in 2019, the Rwandan government launched a series of interventions aimed at mitigating the impact of these floods.

ARE MUSIC BATTLES HEALTHY FOR THE INDUSTRY?

11:56, 2023-09-18

Once in a while we understand there is always bigger, or even better in personality, ability to execute or even talent, i mean we all know that not all fingers can be equal not even twins can score the same marks in class regardless of how identical they are.

Well when it comes to aspects of life, it's paramount for all of us to know that what you are good at, there is always some one better at it fact of life right! Though there are some people that don't tend to agree to this aspect and it's from this background that we have seen the rise of conversations of ''who is who'' In soccer it has always been Messi vs Ronaldo and many but lately even in the Rwandan music industry had risen dust of team B {Bruce Melody} up against team B{The Ben} which is still unresolved like the one in the neighborhood Kampala - Uganda.




Team Sheeba Karungi AKA queen Karma went up against Team Cinderella Sanyu AKA King Herself who they referred to as an old guard dog that was in no position to lead nothing in the music industry, in retaliation Cindy reverbed to the attackers as lucky untalented people who just didn't have confidence to do what she has done.

Battle began ravaging to who has a house and more songs to who has a husband and more responsibility until the uniting factor showed up.

Both female artists were contracted to be influencers of Victoria University a famous celebrity university in Kampala. This University's administration found it wise to solve this beef with to them a publicity stunt, to the artists a battle for talents and to the fans a show.




The dates were set and a few other pre events like a nationally televised intellectual debate, which had a few rounds and as per majority the old guard dog won this one and revelers waited for Friday 15 September where flairs went blazing with artistic and thought through entries with each side having hype emcees before Queen Karma had her majesty entrance on a throne with bedazzling color costumes and dancers to perform for her 20 minutes first round shortly after Cindy would enter as the King herself in a fireworks , national anthem {signifying the other was curtain raising}stunt.




By the end of the 4 hour show the queen had dropped the microphone for the outstanding Cindy Sanyu whose quiet at first audience had crammed up to even shower her with cash gifs on stage. In as much as there was no official announcement to who won the battle, the acts on stage and online voters signify that the King herself with the catalogue of only 54 songs grabbed the queen karma by the horns of 157 songs and took her to rest in peace.

20 MINNERS DIE IN A ROAD TRAGEDY IN SOUTH AFRICA.

08:57, 2023-09-18

At least 20 employees of mining giant De Beers have been killed in a road accident in South Africa, local officials said September 17.

The bus involved was ferrying staff from the Venetia mine, one of the biggest diamond mines in the country, said a transport official in Limpopo province, in the north of the country.

"The bus came into collision with a lorry," said Vongani Chauke.




Chauke told AFP the accident happened at around 1600 GMT, some 25 kilometres (15 miles) from the mine, at the village of Musian on the border with Zimbabwe.

The cause of the accident has not been established. South Africa has one of the most developed road networks on the continent, but also has one of the worst road safety records.




The Venetia mine, which lies near the borders with Botswana and Zimbabwe, has been run by the De Beers group for more than 30 years.

It accounts for more thatn 40 percent of the country's annual diamond production, employing more than 4,300 staff including many local people. It was once the country's largest open-cast mine, before De Beers invested $2 billion in a major underground project to access the less easily available diamonds . The group aims to produce four million carats a year.

In July, De Beers announced the start of underground diamond production from the new seams opened underneath the open-cast mine.

07:31, 2023-09-18

Tanzanian football club commonly known as ''YANGA'' to stand for Young Africans sports club visited Rwandan capital Kigali on Friday, September 15 in their bid to strengthen ties with the Football fraternity in Rwanda but also play their game against AL Mereikh extending their wings to build a solid fan base in Rwanda.

The team of up to 100 people comprised of the club officials led by president Hersi Said, vice president Arfat Hajji, head coach Miguel Gamondi and his technical staff and players among others.




''There are some Rwandans who wer4e formerly in Tanzania following the 1994 Genocide against the Tusti here, and when they were in Tanzania they built relations including being fans of soccer, so we would like to propel from that'' Said Hersi affirmed




The team management went ahead to donate up to 200 sacks of cement and 200 iron sheets to the families affected by the floods in Western and Northern provinces of Rwanda as away to extend regional corporate Social Responsibility.

''WE PLEDGE OUR FULL SUPPORT TO RUSSIA AS THEY STAND AGAINST HEGEMONISTS'' SAYS KIM JUNG UN

15:11, 2023-09-13

North Korea’s Kim Jong Un vowed “full and unconditional support” for Russia’s Vladimir Putin on Wednesday 13 as the two leaders isolated by the West held a summit that the U.S. warned could lead to a deal to supply ammunition for Moscow’s war in Ukraine.

''We pledge full support to the Russian government, because their war is just and we regard it sacred especially standing against hegemonism of imperialism'' Kim said




The meeting, which lasted over four hours at Russia’s spaceport in the Far East, underscores how the two countries’ interests are aligning: Putin is believed to be seeking one of the few things impoverished North Korea has in abundance -– stockpiles of aging ammunition and rockets for Soviet-era weapons.

Such a request would mark a role reversal from the 1950-53 Korean War, when Moscow gave weapons to support Pyongyang’s invasion of South Korea, and in the decades of Soviet sponsorship of the North that followed.

IS IT A BUSINESS PROPAGANDA OR TRUTH- FRENCH REGULATORS HAULT IPHONE 12.

15:04, 2023-09-13

French regulators ordered Apple to stop selling the iPhone 12, saying it emits electromagnetic radiation levels that are above European Union standards for exposure. The company disputed the findings and said the device complies with regulations.

The French government agency that manages wireless communications frequencies issued the order after the iPhone 12 recently failed one of two types of tests for electromagnetic waves capable of being absorbed by the body.

It’s unclear why the phone, which was released in late 2020, didn’t pass the agency’s latest round of tests and why it was only that particular model.




However a contradiction kicks in with France’s digital minister said the iPhone 12’s radiation levels are still much lower than levels that scientific studies consider could harm users, and the agency itself acknowledges that its tests don’t reflect typical phone use.










RWANDA -SOUTH KOREA TO AVOID DOUBLE TAXATION

14:51, 2023-09-13

In bid to continue strengthening ties between the African business hub hopeful Rwanda, with the Republic of Korea on Wednesday, September 13, signed a double taxation avoidance agreement (DTAA), on the side-lines of the ongoing 7th edition of Korea-Africa Economic Cooperation (KOAFEC) Ministerial Conference, in Busan province, South Korea.

The agreement will in addition to attracting Korean investors to Rwanda, play an invaluable role in encouraging the outflow of investment by ensuring protection from discriminatory tax measures, providing an attractive withholding tax rate and a robust framework for dispute resolution.




The DTAA is in alignment with Rwanda’s medium-to-long-term objective of positioning Rwanda as a thriving financial hub. It underscores the importance of establishing a comprehensive treaty network, which is essential for future growth and prosperity.




This comes as good news to manufacturers, service providers, exporter and importers on both sides who will now do business unhindered yet the consumers will get their favorite products at affordable fares.

FLOODS ALOOW CROCODILES TO ROAM FREE IN CHINA

12:08, 2023-09-12










Authorities in a southern Chinese city have launched an operation to recapture more than 70 crocodiles that escaped from a commercial farm after intense flooding swept through the region, multiple state media outlets have reported, with some residents warned to stay indoors.

The toothy reptiles were originally kept at a crocodile farm in Maoming, in the southern province of Guangdong. But a recent deluge caused a local lake to overflow, allowing the animals to escape.

At least 69 adult crocodiles and six juveniles were on the prowl at one point near the village of Peng Cun, Shandong-based outlet Hai Bao News reported. The outlet said it contacted local authorities who had warned residents not to venture out




An emergency force was deployed to round up the missing crocs using sonar detection equipment, according to The Beijing News.

But the depth of the floodwater posed an immense challenge to the operation, it added, prompting authorities to appeal to residents not to leave their homes.

A member of the emergency squad told Nanfeng Plus that they may have to euthanize the crocodiles rather than capture them.




"Chinese crocs hibernate in the winter. We usually move them out of houses in March when the temperature is above 16 Celsius degrees," said workers at Anhui Yangtze Alligator Reserve in Xuancheng city.

Wild Chinese crocodiles often go through the hibernation in a cave in winter, while alligators bred in captivity spend the period indoors.

Each one needs to do physical examination and only healthy and strong ones are allowed to get outside, the reserve said.




"They are still in the semi-dormancy period and can not eat or drink right after they were move out. They live on their saved energy," said workers at the reserve. "They will not start to eat until April when the temperature rises above 25 Celsius degrees. We will feed them some mussels and snails to practice their hunting skills."

Members of an emergency force search for escaped crocodiles on boats in Maoming.

KIM JUNG UN ARRIVES IN FAR EAST RUSSIA AHEAD OF PUTIN MEETING.

06:51, 2023-09-12

 North Korea’s Kim Jong Un arrived in Russia on Tuesday 12 September for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin where they are expected to offer each other increased support in their escalating standoffs with the West.

Kim is expected to seek Russian economic aid and military technology in exchange for munitions to be used in Russia’s war in Ukraine.

North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said Kim boarded his personal train bound for Russia on Sunday afternoon, accompanied by members of the ruling party, government and military.




The train was traveling north through Primorsky Krai in the Far East region of the country, Russian state news agency RIA reported Tuesday. South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it believed the North Korean leader entered Russia early Tuesday morning local time.




The North Korean leader briefly left his train to meet local officials at the Russian border station of Khasan before resuming his travels, Reuters reported, citing a source with knowledge of the matter. CNN cannot independently confirm that Kim left the train. It has since crossed a railway bridge over the Razdolnaya River in the Primorsky Territory and is moving north, according to RIA.

A one to one between Kim and Putin, expected to take place in Russia’s far east, would be a significant development, analysts say, bringing together two leaders who are increasingly isolated on the world stage.




Russia desperately requires fresh supplies of ammunition and shells after more than 18 months of war in Ukraine has left its military battered, while North Korea, which has faced years of international sanctions over its nuclear weapons program, is short of everything from hard cash and food to missile technology.

The meeting could lead to Pyongyang getting its hands on the sort of weapons two decades’ worth of United Nations’ sanctions have barred it from accessing, especially for its nuclear-capable ballistic missile program.

WORLD JOINS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO CELEBRATE THE LIVES LOST IN 9/11 INCIDENT.

06:30, 2023-09-12

The world joined Americans to look back on Monday 9/11 with moments of silence, tearful words and appeals to teach younger generations about the terror attacks 22 years ago.

“For those of us who lost people on that day, that day is still happening. Everybody else moves on. And you find a way to go forward, but that day is always happening for you,” Edward Edelman said as he arrived at New York’s World Trade Center to

honor his slain brother-in-law, Daniel McGinley.




President Joe Biden, speaking at a military base in Anchorage, Alaska, urged Americans to rally around protecting democracy. His visit, en route to Washington from a trip to India and Vietnam, is a reminder that the impact of 9/11 was felt in

every corner of the nation, however remote




September 11 attacks, also called 9/11 attacks, series of airline hijackings and suicide attacks committed in 2001 by 19 militants associated with the Islamic extremist group al-Qaeda against targets in the United States, the deadliest terrorist attacks on American soil in U.S. history.

The attacks against New York City and Washington, D.C., caused extensive death and destruction and triggered an enormous U.S. effort to combat terrorism. Some 2,750 people were killed in New York, 184 at the Pentagon, and 40 in Pennsylvania where one of the hijacked planes crashed into the ground after the passengers attempted to retake the plane); all 19 terrorists died (see Researcher’s Note: September 11 attacks). Police and fire departments in New York were especially hard-hit: hundreds rushed to the scene of the attacks, and more than 400 police officers and firefighters were killed..

RWANDA - UK PARTNERSHIP ESTBLISHES A TAX EVASION, AVOIDANCE INFORORMATION EXCHANGE FACILITY.

12:28, 2023-09-07

Rwanda moves ahead of tax defaulters international and local scenes by opening up a specialty office to handle such issues with partners out of Rwanda. This comes after  Revenue Authority (RRA) has taken a step to curb tax evasion and avoidance by inaugurating an information exchange office dedicated to enhancing collaboration with tax authorities in other nations. This initiative seeks to fortify efforts against illicit financial flows while promoting transparency in taxation.




The Rwanda Revenue Authority officials anticipate that the newly established office will augment the institution's capabilities in exchanging tax-related information, reinforcing Rwanda's commitment to fostering transparency and responsible financial practices.

Richard Tusabe, the Minister of State in charge of the National Treasury, emphasized the pivotal role of this office in combating illicit financial flows.




The facility, established in partnership with the United Kingdom (UK), represents the latest in a series of collaborative initiatives between the UK and Rwanda aimed at strengthening their cooperation in tax matters.

Rwanda has committed to adhering to both the Exchange of Information upon Request (EOIR) and the Automated Exchange of Information on Financial Accounts (AEOI) standards under this partnership. Tusabe affirmed Rwanda's dedication to adopting international AEOI standards by 2024 as part of their unwavering commitment to promoting tax transparency.

INDIA TO CHANGE COLONIAL NAME TO REPUBLIC OF BHARAT.

12:08, 2023-09-07

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has set stage to replace the name India with a Sanskrit word in dinner invitations sent to guests attending this week’s Group of 20 summit, in a move that reflects his Hindu nationalist party’s efforts to eliminate what it sees as colonial-era names.

Indian President Droupadi Murmu is referred to as “President of Bharat” instead of “President of India” as formerly known, in the invitation sent to G20 attendees. The nation of more than 1.4 billion people is officially known by two names, India and Bharat, but the former is most commonly used, both domestically and internationally.

Bharat is an ancient Sanskrit word which many historians believe dates back to early Hindu texts. The word also means India in Hindi.




The change in nomenclature is backed by officials of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. They argue that the name India was introduced by British colonial masters and is a “symbolises slavery.” The British imposed their rule unto India for about 200 years until the country gained independence in 1947.

Modi’s party has long tried to erase names related to India’s Mughal and colonial past.

In 2015, New Delhi’s famous Aurangzeb Road, named after a Mughal king, was changed to Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Road after protests from Modi’s party leaders. Last year, the government also renamed a colonial-era avenue in the heart of New Delhi that is used for ceremonial military parades.

Modi’s government says the name changes are an effort to reclaim India’s Hindu past.




“Another blow to slavery mentality,” the top elected official of Uttarakhand state, Pushkar Singh Dhami, said on X, formerly known as Twitter. Dhami, who is a leader of Modi’s governing party, shared the dinner invitation sent to G20 guests in his post.










''OUSTED ALI BONGO FINALLY FREE TO TRAVEL FOR TREATMENT.'' JUNTA LEADERS SAY

11:54, 2023-09-07

The military leaders who staged a coup in Gabon have freed ousted president Ali Bongo Ondimba and he is now allowed to travel abroad, a junta spokesperson said Wednesday 6 September.

Bongo has reportedly been held in house arrest since the coup in the Central African nation in late August.

“Given his state of health, the former President of the Republic Ali Bongo Ondimba is free to move about. He may, if he wishes, travel abroad to receive medical check-ups,” junta spokesperson Col. Ulrich Manfoumbi said on state television, reading a statement from transitional leader Gen. Brice Oligui Nguema.




The ousted president’s health was not immediately clear. He had suffered a stroke in late 2018 that kept him from his duties for months. Local television Gabon24 broadcast a meeting late Wednesday between Ondimba and Abdou Barry, head of the UN Office for Central Africa.

The 64-year-old was on Aug. 30 toppled from power amid a resurgence of coups in parts of Africa and shortly after he was declared the winner of a disputed election that would have extended his family’s 55-year reign. He succeeded his father in 2009.




Meanwhile, the newly sworn-in military leader in Gabon, Gen. Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, met with regional and local authorities this week, promising better infrastructure and a peaceful transition to citizens in the oil-rich Central African nation.

In the capital, Libreville, he met with the Central African Republic’s President Faustin Archange Touadera, who was appointed an envoy of the regional Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), and with Barry, head of the UN Office for Central Africa.

“Our discussions focused on the current situation of our nation as well as the promising prospects of the transition,” Gen. Nguema wrote of his meeting with Barry on X, formerly known as Twitter.










PSCHO OR MUDERER? KAZUNGU IS BEHIND BARS FOR THE DISAPPERING OF WOMEN INTO HIS HOUSE.

13:58, 2023-09-06

The country's top most investigative boday Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB), has revealed more information regarding Denis Kazungu, an alleged serial killer who was arrested on Tuesday, September 5 in Kicukiro district, Gashikiri village, in the City of Kigali.This comes after a collaborative operation with local law enforcement and security organs, they managed to arrest Denis Kazungu, who is suspected of killing and burying people within his rented residence located in Kicukiro District, Kanombe Sector, Busanza Cell and awas later detained at RIB Kicukiro station.




The 34-year-old man, is suspected of killing and burying people in his rented residence. RIB has said they are yet to establish the number of the victims, but reports indicate they are more than ten.

Speaking to press on Wednesday, September 6, RIB spokesperson Thierry Murangira said Kazungu had been arrested earlier on in July on other charges that included theft, rape, robbery and use of threats but was granted bail because there wasn’t enough evidence.

“However investigations regarding his case never stopped until he was rearrested and his home was searched. The investigators found a pit he had dug in his kitchen, where he used to bury those he killed,” Murangira said.




Murangira continued to say that RIB has deployed forensic investigation experts to the crime scene to find out the number of the victims and their identity, before Kazungu’s file is processed and submitted to the prosecutors.

It is suspected that Kazungu targeted young women from bars and night clubs, who he would persuade to come with him to his house and would later, rape, rob, kill and bury in his kitchen

The suspect is currently being held at Kicukiro RIB station.

''DONALD TRUMP TOO SHOULDN'T BE SPARED'' SAYS VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS

13:36, 2023-09-06

Vice President Kamala Harris said Wednesday that those responsible for the effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and the ensuing violence at the U.S Capitol must be held accountable — even if that means Donald Trump.

“Let the evidence, the facts, take it where it may,” Harris said in an interview with The Associated Press in Jakarta, Indonesia, where she was attending a regional summit.

Federal prosecutors have indicted Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, for his efforts to cling to power in 2020. The former president also has been charged in Georgia in a scheme to subvert the will of voters who elected Democrat Joe Biden instead of giving Trump a second term.




“I spent the majority of my career as a prosecutor,” said Harris, who served as California’s attorney general before moving to Washington as a U.S. senator. “I believe that people should be held accountable under the law. And when they break the law, there should be accountability.”




The White House has been circumspect in addressing the issue of criminal charges against Trump, who has pleaded not guilty, to avoid any whiff of political meddling in the work of prosecutors, particularly as Biden seeks a second term in 2024. But both Biden and Harris have been outspoken about what they view as the very real danger to American democracy the aftermath of the 2020 election.




“Democracies are very fragile,” the vice president said in the AP interview. “They will only be as strong as our willingness to fight for it.” The president’s absence disappointed some, but the White House emphasized that it remained committed to the region, which Harris reiterated in her interview.




“We as Americans, I believe, have a very significant interest, both in terms of our security but also our prosperity, today and in the future, in developing and strengthening these relationships,” she said.

Southeast Asia is a critical arena for the rivalry between the U.S. and China, particularly when it comes to the South China Sea. One-third of global shipping traverses its waters.




ONE OF SUDAN'S WARING GENERALS STARTS TO SEAL HIS EXTERNAL INFLUENCE WITH INTERNATIONAL VISITS.

13:57, 2023-09-04

Sudan’s top military general held talks in Juba, shortly after his return from Egypt on Monday 4 September with South Sudan’s president on his second trip abroad since the war in his country started earlier this year .

Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, chairman of the ruling Sovereign Council, arrived in the South Sudanese capital, Juba, Monday morning and was received by President Salva Kiir. Both leaders inspected an honor guard and then headed for talks that focused on regional efforts to find a settlement to the conflict in Sudan, according to the Sovereign Council.




In April, simmering tensions between the military, led by Burhan, and the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, commanded by Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, exploded into open fighting in the capital and elsewhere.

The fighting has reduced Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, to an urban battlefield, with neither side managing to gain control of the city. The military headquarters, where Burhan has purportedly been stationed since the conflict began, has been one of the epicenters of the conflict which has had very much life threatening impacts like more than

 500 children who have died from hunger in Sudan since fighting erupted in April,millions that have lost their parents and fled the country as refugees




''THE DEAD ARE NOT RESTED UNTILL GIVEN A BEFITTING BURIAL'' NEW BODIES DISCOVERED AT AMAHORO STADIUM SITE.

13:50, 2023-08-30

Horrors still rising from under the ground in Rwanda from 3 decades ago, this comes after remains of 32 suspected victims of the April 4,1994 massacre have been exhumed from the construction site at Amahoro National Stadium over the past two weeks, local authorities have confirmed.




Although the remains are suspected to be of victims of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, a process is underway to gather more information about their identity and the circumstances of their death.

Remera Sector’s Social Affairs team leader, Pauline Rutazana, confirmed the development in an interview with press.

Pauline also said they were working with Ibuka (Genocide survivors' umbrella) and village and cell administrations so that we can find people who can identify the victims,” 

A meeting is due Thursday, August 31, involving authorities and people who survived the Genocide from Amahoro stadium, in an effort to identify the exhumed.




Those involved will scrutinise the clothes that were unearthed from the site as well as try to recall how the events unfolded during the Genocide nearly 30 years ago.

It should be remembered that Amahoro stadium hosted refugees from across the city as killings started in April 1994. The Interahamwe militia and the genocidal military and genderme units attacked the building from time to time before Rwanda Patriotic Army liberators rescued them and helped them flee to the RPA-controlled zones north of Kigali.

FROM STREET THUG, CHEF, TO RUSSIA'S PAID MERCENARY - PRIGOZHIN'S LIFE JOURNEY ENDS.

12:38, 2023-08-30

 A private burial was held for Yevgeny Prigozhin, ending a tumultuous journey from St. Petersburg street thug to Kremlin-financed mercenary leader, following a suspicious plane crash two months after his brief mutiny that challenged the authority of President Vladimir Putin.

His spokespeople said Tuesday a service took place behind closed doors, and directed “those who wish to bid their farewell” to the 62-year-old head of the Wagner private military contractor to go to the Porokhovskoye cemetery in his hometown. Their statement ended media speculation on where and when Prigozhin would be laid to rest, with his funeral shrouded in secrecy.




A wooden cross towered over his flower-covered grave. Nearby stood a Russian tricolor and a black Wagner flag. Russian media cited unidentified sources as saying Prigozhin was laid to rest Tuesday without any publicity, per his family’s wishes.

Members of the Russian National Guard were stationed along the fence at the cemetery, steering visitors away after it closed for the day.

RWANDA'S BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT FUND PARTNERS WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO LAUNCH PARTIAL CREDIT GUARANTEES.

15:34, 2023-08-29

The Business Development Fund (BDF) on Monday 28 August announced and signed MOUs with partners to fully rollout the new product that is meant to even further more availability of funding for all Rwandans.

This collaboration with prominent financial institutions will see the introduction of what is known as the Partial Credit Guarantee.




The official signing event took place on Monday, August 28 at the BDF head office in Kigali.

This groundbreaking initiative is designed to foster a supportive environment for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Rwanda, by addressing barriers to accessing finance and facilitating the growth of the MSME ecosystem.




The Partial Credit Guarantee of BDF aims to provide a comprehensive solution for MSMEs

seeking financial support. Through this program, BDF is committed to removing obstacles

that often hinder MSMEs from accessing the necessary capital for growth and development. The program&#39;s vision is to create a thriving environment that enables MSMEs to flourish and contribute significantly to Rwanda&#39;s economic landscape.




Key Objectives of the Partial Credit Guarantee:

Accessibility: The program aims to enhance accessibility to finance for MSMEs, ensuring

that deserving businesses have the financial resources they need to thrive.

Demand-Driven Solutions: BDF is dedicated to providing solutions that are tailored to the

specific needs of MSMEs, promoting sustainable growth and success.




Sector Expertise: The program leverages sector expertise to guide and support MSMEs

through their financial journey, enabling them to make informed decisions.

Targeted beneficiaries of the Partial Credit Guarantee.







At this event was the CEO of the Development Bank Of Rwanda {BRD} Ms Kampeta Sayinzoga, who signed on behalf of BDF but also said as BRD they were excited to these possibilities that are happening to avail financing for all Rwandan businesses regardless of the size.




''Our role as a bank is to ensure the growth and development of all Rwandans through availing financing and favorable financial solutions to them as individuals or even as cooperatives, which we believe with this initiative that will be achieved.'' Kampeta added




Business Development Fund (BDF)CEO Vicent Munyeshaka said that they were looking forward to increase their financing to up to Rwf 14 billion in this financial year. He said it's from the confidence they have had the past successful financial years where they have usedRwf6 billion and achieved quite tangible and visible results.




''We work with very many financial insitutions in the country to get our different products to the grass root, we are not limited to only SACCOS.

Because the origin of this was to be able to avail financial services to all Rwandans regardless of where they are.'' Munyeshaka added.




The Partial Credit Guarantee program encompasses a range of benefits for MSMEs,

including preferential access to finance and affiliated services. The program&#39;s scope

extends to special groups such as people living with disabilities, vulnerable genocide

survivors, and veterans.




WORLD'S BIGGEST AUTO MAKER RECOVERS FROM SYSTEM MALFUNCTION.

11:58, 2023-08-29




World's biggest auto make Toyota will resume operations at its Japanese assembly plants Wednesday 30 August after a 24-hour stoppage caused by disruption to its finely-tuned supply chain.

This big name automaker by sales said that its 14 vehicle factories in the country had paused activity because a system malfunction that began on Monday 28 August was preventing it from processing orders for automotive components.




Production is expected to be back to normal at all 14 plants in Japan from the start of the second shift on Wednesday30 August, the company said in a statement.

“It is our understanding that the malfunction of the system was not caused by a cyber attack. However, we will continue to investigate the cause,” Toyota (TM) said. “We would like to apologize once again to our customers, suppliers, and related parties for any inconvenience caused by the suspension of operations.”

Toyota was a pioneer of “just-in-time” production, which is based on the delivery of component parts to assembly plants in the right quantities just before they are required. The system saves warehouse space and money but is vulnerable to disruption if any link in the chain is broken.

Analysts said Toyota could be tested in making up for output lost during the outage, such as by running extra shifts.

"Output was running at full capacity so there's little additional room for production," said Seiji Sugiura, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.




Toyota is a pioneer of just-in-time inventory management, which keeps down costs but means supply chain snarls put production at risk.

While the cause of the latest malfunction was unclear, corporate Japan has been on alert in recent days as businesses and government offices reported harassing phone calls.

The government said the calls were likely from China and related to Japan's release of treated radioactive water from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean.

Toyota's share price closed down 0.21% at 2,431.5 yen after spending much of the morning deeper in negative territory.

''AFRICA TO BE INVITED TO THE G 20 SUMMIT'' INDIA PM MODI SAID

11:30, 2023-08-29

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the country’s role as the G20 host this year would focus on highlighting the concerns of the developing world, and has proposed the African Union to become permanent members of the forum.

“We have a vision of inclusiveness and with that vision, we have invited the African Union to become permanent members of the G20,” Modi said on Sunday as he addressed the Business 20 Summit in New Delhi.

The B20 is an industry event and part of the summit of the 20 leading rich and developing nations, which will be hosted in the Indian capital next month.




Over three days, industry and policy leaders from around the world have discussed themes like building resilient supply chains, digital transformation, debt distress facing developing countries and how to advance on climate change goals. Their recommendations will be shared with the G20 governments, organizers said.

As host of the G20 this year, India has struggled to bridge the differences among member countries over the war in Ukraine. None of the several meetings held in the country has succeeded in producing a communique, sparking questions over whether the leaders meeting next month will break the deadlock.

Instead, India has consistently appealed for the fractured grouping to reach consensus on issues that disproportionately affect developing countries, or the so-called Global South. They include unsustainable debt levels, inflation and the threat of climate change, even if the broader East-West split over Ukraine can’t be resolved.

A key part of that strategy is bringing the African Union into the G20 fold, analysts say.

“When India assumed the G20 presidency last December, we were acutely conscious that most of the Global South would not be at the table when we meet,” said External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. “This mattered very much because the really urgent problems are those faced by them. ... And India, itself so much a part of the Global South, could not stand by and let that happen.”

THE ELECTRICITY BOYS TAKE ON POPULAR APPR BASKETBALL CLUB IN THE FINALS OF THE BETPAWAPLAYOFFS.

09:39, 2023-08-28

The BetPawa playoffs have began and are coming close to an end with more voltage than has ever been for the teams both with anticipation to walk into the dressing room with some more MoMo balance as Betpawa and Mchezo Africa are determined to make the game so competitive.




It's without a doubt that most of the games have been one sided with dominance being visible from a mile away, as the balled out teams seemed as thought weren't prepared.

The Rwanda Energy Group's basketball club steered through as though there was no opposition at ESPOIR side which saw captain Shyaka Olivier coming on hard to score 14 pts,7rebs,14 assists to put his team in front in game 1 with 85:79, 93:53 game 2 as Adonis was also added to the probable playoff MVP list with 10 pts,4reb,10assists.




In other plays famous APR basketball club went heads on with once reigning Patriots in a hotly contested series that went in uniforms of 10 point differences all through, making 60:50 game 1, to the final game that was 62:52 making Ntore APR's top flier with 17 pts 6reband 2steals.

While speaking to the APR coach Maz Trakh, he said he was confident his team would fair on well based on the kind of players they were who never let go of the game until the final whistle.




''They are a group so disciplined that they went behind towards half time but came from behind and took on the lead against a team that has big heart and willing to leave their legs on court. i trust them and am proud of them'' Maz added.




Whereas Patriots are now trailing and seem to be less prepared in preseason its no all lost fro they continued to show agility, game of speed which ahs always characterised their game but ahve lacked conversion and timely game reading that cost them a playoff.

While speaking to one of the players Sunny Munyandamusta, after game 3 he explained how they were not appeased by getting out of the frame this way but acknowledged that they put in all their best regardless the uncalculated move of falling in trouble early.

'' In as much as we made many mistakes but in this final game the referees were quite unfair, where by they gave out penalties to the opponent yet whenever it was our turn they would wink as though nothing happened yet we had they brought internationals who you would think don't have any favoritism. so we feel cheated.''




As the games continue on the other hand of the women it's likely to be a double battle of the titans of APR and still dominant REG who have displayed skill and class in their late games which were delayed by student majority made IPRC that could not play their fixtures on time since they had exams.

NEW TRANSPORTATION LAW TO SHIFT TENDERING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES.

07:22, 2023-08-28

Rwanda's utility governing authority commonly know as RURA,will no longer be responsible for issuing tenders to public transport operators in the country.

The newly established law governing land and waterways transport. explains that;

 Local government authorities, such as city administrations, will assume the role of issuing tenders. However, RURA will maintain its oversight function in regulating private transport companies, ensuring they meet all necessary requirements before applying for tenders.




This comes as a move to decentralize the power and management system of the transport sector in the country which has been facing criticism from the citizens who are the main consumers and being named as inefficient, yet this blame would be transferred unto the regulators by the operators.

Patricie Uwase, the Minister of Infrastructure, explained that the institution responsible for both issuing tenders (RURA) and regulating public transport operators created an operational overlap, leaving room for inefficiencies.




"In cities like Kigali where public transport is essential, tenders will now be directly negotiated between private investors and city administrations, rather than through RURA. Nevertheless, RURA will continue to play a pivotal role in ensuring that investors fulfill the prerequisite criteria before submitting their bids," she added.




The new law stipulates that  investors will first need to approach RURA to obtain a license before participating in public transport tender processes facilitated by city authorities. To streamline the process and reduce bureaucracy, all licensing and tender application services will be consolidated into a one-stop center known as the Mobility Department.




This comes as a way to encourage other investors in the sector which was also followed by the a promising partnership between the government and Vivo Energy is set to bring 205 electric buses to the country next year. To accommodate these electric buses, Rwanda is actively working on establishing the necessary infrastructure, including charging stations.

Vivo Energy Rwanda will spearhead the procurement of electric buses and the establishment of a dedicated charging and maintenance depot.




This collaboration stems from a comprehensive feasibility study conducted by Vivo Energy in conjunction with the Ministry of Infrastructure and the City of Kigali, with a specific focus on electrifying Kigali's public bus fleet.










THE BET PAWA PLAYOFFS RETURN THIS WEEKEND AS SETS SEEK TO REDEEM THEMSELVES.

13:18, 2023-08-25

The betpawa playoffs are the main highlight this weekend as Rwanda's basketball league is yet to resume. Its simply a spec of four male best teams triggering each other to display their best side from even better effort from last season as it is not any different fro last season's best lady teams of which most of them are clad with gladness from the previously finished Afro women basketball even that happened in Kigali.




This season's playoffs are even more salty with lots of some pocket handouts from the latest joint partner Mchezo Africa that's with a wide name Betpawa who have invested heavily to see the development of sport on the African continent, with this comes up to Rwf 50,000 for every player whose team is made it to the semis.




Well this weekend we have many big league names looking to redeem themselves after they lost their first play off games this including the Famous REG BBC 72-57 Espoir BBCQ1: 27-11,Q2: 19-22,Q3: 26-24

THE MOST FAMOUS MUG SHOT IN THE HISTORY OF USA-'' WAS TRUMP GENUINELY ANGRY OR IT'S ANOTHER FAME STUNT?''

06:12, 2023-08-25

The modern day photography gadget known as a camera clicks, in just a blink of an eye also referred to as a fraction of a second, the shutter opens and then closes, freezing forever the image in front of it.

When the camera shutter blinked inside a jail in downtown Atlanta on Thursday August 24, it both created and documented a tiny inflection point in American life. Captured for posterity, there was a former president of the United States, for the first time in history, under arrest and captured in the sort of frame more commonly associated with drug dealers or drunken drivers.




The trappings of power gone, for that split second.Left behind: an enduring image that will appear in history books long after Donald Trump is gone.

In the photo, Trump confronts the camera in front of a bland gray backdrop, his eyes meeting the lens in an intense glare. He’s wearing a blue suit, white shirt and red tie, his shoulders squared, his head tilted slightly toward the camera.

The sheriff’s logo has been digitally added above his right shoulder.




Some of the 18 others charged with him in Georgia smiled in their booking photos like they were posing for a yearbook. Not Trump.

His defiance is palpable, as if he’s staring down a nemesis through the lens.




Trump is unlikely to treat the mug shot as a moment of shame as he seeks a second term in the White House while fighting criminal charges in four jurisdictions. His campaign has reported a spike in contributions each time he’s been indicted.

And the imagery itself? Trump hasn’t shied away from it. In fact, his campaign concocted one long before it became real.

Months before he was photographed in Georgia on Thursday evening, his campaign used the prospect of a mug shot as a fundraising opportunity. For $36, anyone can buy a T-shirt with a fake booking photo of Trump and the words “not guilty.” Dozens of similar designs are available to purchase online, including many that appeal to Trump’s critics.

Now they have a real one to work with. Within minutes of the mug shot’s release, Trump’s campaign used it in a fundraising appeal on its website. “BREAKING NEWS: THE MUGSHOT IS HERE,” reads the subject line of the campaign’s latest fundraising email, which advertises a new T-shirt with the image. And this quote: “This mugshot will forever go down in history as a symbol of America’s defiance of tyranny.”




RWANDA TO INTRODUCE GREEN SKILLS RELATED COURSES IN TERTIALLY INSTITUTIONS.

06:01, 2023-08-25

President Paul Kagame agreed with the youth on the introduction of courses regarding green skills in universities, tertiary institutions and many other institutions of learning in the bid for Rwanda to tackle climate change issues.

This was during the 10th anniversary celebrations of Youth Connekt an initiative in the ministry of Youth that took place at the Intare arena on August 23.




While meeting with the youth in the question and answer session one of the participants in this event asked if there was a plan by the Rwandan Government to introduce these courses in order fro the Rwandans to create jobs relevant to this world over concern.

In his response president Paul Kagame said that, there are several factors that have led the world to reach this attention seeking topic, but also science has already proven that there are ways to tackle them.




''We have been told that this climate change issue is mainly cause by green house gas emissions from cars which use petro and other fossil fuels, factories and bi products of manufacturing and very many there is. but also the point of human activities such as poor waste management, tree cutting and so much more.'' President kagame said.




''However technology has also showed us that there are substitute fuels such as renewable energies such as solar, wind, hydrogen , nuclear and very many others which definitely to use them efficiently, it needs knowledge and this knowledge can only be gotten with when people have gone to school and learned'' He added




It should be noted that Rwanda is been among the countries notably at the fore front of enhancing green cities and enabling easy investment in the green housing and infrastructure development country wide.

At this same event there was a further caution on how tree cutting was among the human activities at the forefront of destroying the environment and therefor the youth ere encouraged to be heads and hands on towards enlightening their societal origins on these impacts but also engage in tree planting as their contribution to the world.

CANADA CONSIDERING A 10 POINT RECOMMENDATION APPROACH TO SOLVE HOUSING CRISIS.

13:21, 2023-08-23

The federal government is examining its approach to immigration as part of a wider look at what is driving Canada's housing crunch and what it can do about it.The Liberal government set new immigration targets last fall that would see Canada welcome 500,000 newcomers in 2025. That compares with 341,000 immigrants arriving in 2019, and a record high of 431,645 in 2022




Immigration Minister Marc Miller said Tuesday that at present he has no intention of adjusting that target, but that population growth fuelled by new arrivals cannot be ignored as the federal Liberal cabinet considers what is behind a worsening affordability crisis for buying or renting a home.







"I don't see a world in which (changing the target) happens, but again, I'm going to be looking at the facts and I'm not a dogmatic person," he said in Charlottetown, where federal ministers are holding a three-day retreat.

"We have to look at what that impact is, and what the impact of immigrants actually is on the housing supply."

Multiple ministers, including Miller, stressed that immigrants are not to blame for Canada's housing challenges, but he said the volume of immigration, including international students, does impact the availability of housing.

"You'll find a wide divergence of views of what that impact is, of immigration on housing," he said.

"Volume is volume, and it does have an impact. There's no denying that. But the specific role that immigration plays in certain areas is something we have to kind of break down a little more."

The housing crisis is a chief topic of conversation at the retreat, which comes as the federal Liberals prepare their agenda for the fall sitting of Parliament.

The Liberals introduced a national housing strategy in 2017, promising to spend billions over a decade to restore Ottawa's involvement in building social housing. In 2019, legislation was passed designating housing as a human right.

But little progress has been made to improve the situation, and the post-pandemic cost-of-living crisis, rising interest rates and rapid population growth are exacerbating the problem.

The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. estimates Canada needs about 5.8 million new homes by 2030 to restore housing affordability.







In Charlottetown, ministers received a briefing on Tuesday afternoon from two national housing and homelessness experts who last week published a report identifying 10 ways the federal government could improve the situation.

That included a national housing accord between the federal government, provinces, municipalities, housing builders and not-for-profit agencies. The report pointed to a lack of co-ordination between those responsible for housing as one thing getting in the way.

On Monday August 21, Housing Minister Sean Fraser said it was too early to commit to all 10 recommendations in the report, but that the government would be examining them and deciding what the next steps will be.




"So there's a number of different elements to what we want to do next," he said.

"How we precisely frame it, and whether that is a revisitation of the national housing strategy, is something that I'm sure we're going to get into really interesting discussions on over the course of the next couple of days here in Charlottetown," he said.

ZIMBABWE GOES TO SECOND POLL AFTER THE OUSTING OF MUGABE.

12:48, 2023-08-23

Delays marked voting in Zimbabwe on Wednesday as President Emmerson Mnangagwa seeks a second and final term in a country with a history of violent and disputed elections.

This is the second general election since the ouster of longtime ruler Robert Mugabe in a coup in 2017.




Twelve presidential candidates are on the ballot, but the main contest is expected to be between 80-year-old Mnangagwa, known as “the crocodile,” and 45-year-old opposition leader Nelson Chamisa. Mnangagwa narrowly beat Chamisa in a disputed election in 2018.

Chamisa hopes to break the ruling ZANU-PF party’s 43-year hold on power. Zimbabwe has had only two leaders since gaining independence from white minority rule in 1980.A runoff election will be held Oct. 2 if no candidate wins a clear majority in the first round. The election will also determine the makeup of the 350-seat parliament and nearly 2,000 local council positions.




“It’s becoming tougher to survive in this country,” said Basil Chendambuya, an early voter in a working-class township in Harare. “I am hoping for change. This is my third time to vote and I am praying hard that this time my vote counts. I am getting desperate, so God has to intervene this time round.”

The father of three said his two adult children are working menial jobs and surviving “hand to mouth.”




The southern African nation of 15 million people has vast mineral resources, including Africa’s largest reserves of lithium, a key component in making electric car batteries. But watchdogs have long alleged that widespread corruption and mismanagement have gutted much of the country’s potential.

YOUTH CONNEKT CELEBRATE 10 YEARS- PRESIDENT PAUL KAGAME BRACES THE EVENT.

''Dear youth, today we celebrate your successes, achievements and creativity especially here in Africa, Murashoboye,'' She added




While at the same event President Paul Kagame called out the youth not to be fire fans of misbehaviors such as corruption and mismanagement of publics funds that are trusted with them. In this aspect he called out the mishandling of sports funds by some officials in the ministry of sports and sports federations who he said he had heard an abominable report on the way they tend to treat teams that represent the country on national stages.




''I have heard scenarios where officials put teams on buses without even a travel allowance to international events yet for them carry their entire families in first class, how do you expect these teams to reach the destinations hungry, tired, unmotivated to compete and give you results?'' President Kagame asked.

''Then even you when you have returned you just keep quiet instead of reporting of what really happened, come on let's not all be part of this vice,'' He added




As the globe continues to face literally same challenges facing the youth, in terms of welfare, jobs, health and every many others, Rwanda and its development partners continue to be at the forefront of creating a decisive and conducive atmosphere for the youth from all over the globe, the recent act being the allowance of medical students from Sudan to come and complete their education tenures here in the country after their semesters were interrupted by the war back at home.

LOVE TRIANGLE COST RWANDAN KONG DISTANCE ATHLETE LIFE IN KENYA

15:01, 2023-08-22

Kenyan police in the town of Iten, which over time has held the name for being one of the world’s favourite training destinations for Kenyans and foreigner athletes, on Sunday20August reported that a Rwandan athlete identified as Rubayita Sirag, 34, died of injuries he sustained during a fight with his Kenyan counterpart. Sirag specialised in 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres and had taken part in numerous international events, including the Kigali Peace Marathon, the Regional 10000m Championships in Campo Atletica in Italy, the Ugandan Championships in Kampala, the Gensan Giulietta and Romeo Half Marathon in Verona, Italy, and others.




According to the report, two athletes, a Rwandan and a Kenyan, are reported to have fought on Thursday16 August last week, leading to the death of the Rwandan track runner on Friday17 August evening.




Authorities in Keiyo North are still investigating the circumstances under which the two athletes fought, and the exact cause of the death.

Police has confirmed that the preliminary investigations point to a love triangle but noted that a probe into the matter was not conclusive.

Police further reported that the suspect and the woman suspected to be the cause of the fight are being held at Iten Police Station for interrogation.




Reports further confirm that that the deceased had been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after the attack.

The matter is said to have been reported to the police by a coach in one of the training camps in Iten, who told authorities that the two athletes fought.

According to the coach who has known the two athletes for months, the two athletes fought over a woman, the Kenyan athlete had told us that he had married and that the Rwandan national was his wife’s ex-boyfriend. That is the information we have. We hope the police will do a thorough investigation,”

According to a recorded conversation between the suspect and another Iten-based coach, Khamala said he had lived with the woman for two months.







OVER 7,361 FAMILIES ARE TO BE EVACUTED FROM HIGH RISK ZONES, SAYS THE CITY OF KIGALI.

13:52, 2023-08-22

Rwanda's capital of Kigali authority has overtime identified certain high-risk areas where residents need to be hurriedly evacuated before the rainy season begins.

These areas identified are mostly in Gasabo District and include Gisozi around Dove Hotel, Gatsata in an area called “Mu Kiderenka” and Nyabisindu in an area called “Mu Isibo ya Cyenda” of Remera sector, Mpano village in Kivugiza and Gasharu cells of Nyamirambo sector, Nyamweru cell in Kinyinya sector and Kagasa in Gahanga sector in Kicukiro District, without ne well as different drainages that can endanger people’s lives.




Those who are expected to vacate the demarcated places include individuals residing on a slope of 50 per cent, as well as those living on slopes between 30 and 50 per cent. These areas have houses that do not meet the necessary standards and guidelines to withstand disasters, making it essential for residents to relocate.




While speaking to press, Pudence Rubingisa, Mayor of the City of Kigali, said 7,361 families were identified in high risk zones.

“So far, 4,230 families were relocated during the previous rainy season and we have to urgently evict 3,131 families ahead of the forth-coming rainy season,” he said.

He said 2,400 families out of those remaining in dangerous high-risk zones are renting.

“We want to visit these families door-to-door in collaboration with grassroots leaders so that they go to rent houses in safe zones,” he said.




The settlements in the identified zones, Rubingisa said, have to be immediately removed after relocation.

“Gatsata sector tops areas with many families in high risk zones living at a 50 per cent slope.

The sectors of Kanyinya, Kimisagara, Kigali and others have also a big number of high risk zones requiring urgent eviction,” he said.

The mad rush to relocate people from high-risk zones follows the recent devastating floods and landslides that left 20,000 people homeless in Western, Northern and Southern provinces.

City of Kigali’s recent assessment found 24,404 plots with about 27,000 houses in high-risk zones despite living in residential areas in 35 sectors of the capital.




UN REPORT SHOWS EXTRA JUDICIAL KILLINGS INCREASE IN AFGHANISTAN.

13:39, 2023-08-22

More than 200 extrajudicial killings of former Afghan government officials and security forces have taken place since the Taliban took over the country two years ago, according to a U.N. report released Tuesday 22 August. The groups most targeted by the Taliban have been former army, police and intelligence forces, according to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.




UN Mission In Afghanistan documented at least 800 human rights violations against former Afghan government officials and security forces between Aug. 15, 2021, when the Taliban seized power, and the end of June 2023.







The Taliban swept across Afghanistan as U.S. and NATO troops were in the final weeks of their withdrawal from the country after two decades of war. The U.S.-trained and backed Afghan forces crumbled in the face of the Taliban advance and former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.




"Individuals were detained by the de facto (Taliban) security forces, often briefly, before being killed. Some were taken to detention facilities and killed while in custody, others were taken to unknown locations and killed, their bodies either dumped or handed over to family members," the report said.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in a press release issued alongside the report that it "presents a sobering picture of the treatment of individuals affiliated with the former government and security forces."

"Even more so, given they were assured that they would be not targeted, it is a betrayal of the people's trust," Turk said. He urged Afghanistan's Taliban rulers -- the country's "de facto authorities" -- to uphold their "obligations under international human rights law by preventing further violations and holding perpetrators to account."

Since their takeover, the Taliban have faced no significant opposition and have avoided internal divisions.

The Taliban-led Afghan foreign ministry dismissed the report, saying it was unaware of any cases of human rights violations committed by Taliban officials or employees.

"Murder without trial, arbitrary arrest, detention, torture, and other acts against human rights by the employees of the security institutions of the Islamic Emirate against the employees and security forces of the previous government have not been reported," it said in a statement.

The report said former Afghan soldiers were at greatest risk of experiencing human rights violations, followed by police and intelligence officials. Violations were recorded across all 34 provinces, with the greatest number recorded in Kabul, Kandahar and Balkh provinces.

The majority of violations took place in the four months following the Taliban takeover, with UNAMA recording almost half of all extrajudicial killings of former government officials and Afghan security forces during this period. But rights violations continued even after that, with 70 extrajudicial killings recorded in 2022, the report added.







The report documented at least 33 human rights violations against former police officers in southern Kandahar province, accounting for over a quarter of all human rights violations against former police members nationwide.

UNAMA documented at least 14 instances of forced disappearance of former government officials and Afghan security force members.

On Oct. 2, 2021, Alia Azizi, the former head of a women's prison in western Herat province, did not return home from work and her whereabouts remain unknown. Despite reportedly initiating an investigation into her disappearance, the Taliban have not released any information about her whereabouts, the report said.

The U.N. documented more than 424 arbitrary arrests and detentions of former government officials and members of the Afghan security forces while more than 144 instances of torture and ill-treatment were documented in the report, including beatings with pipes, cables, verbal threats and other abuse.

The Taliban initially promised a general amnesty for those linked to the former government and international forces, but those pledges were not upheld.

The failure of the Taliban authorities "to fully uphold their publicly stated commitment and to hold perpetrators of human rights violations to account may have serious implications for the future stability of Afghanistan," the report said.

While the Taliban announcement of a general amnesty in August 2021 "was a welcome step, it continues to not be fully upheld, with impunity for human rights violations prevailing," said Roza Otunbayeva, the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan.

She urged the Taliban to show ""a genuine commitment to the general amnesty. This is a crucial step in ensuring real prospects for justice, reconciliation and lasting peace in Afghanistan."

Jeremy Laurence, spokesman for the U.N. human rights office, told reporters that the Taliban said the matter of violations were most likely individual cases, such as personal revenge killings, and were not conducted by or on behalf of the authorities.

"The de facto authorities have often responded that while a killing may have occurred, it was a personal enmity or revenge case, and not carried out in an official capacity," he told reporters in Geneva.

 

UKRANIAN PRESIDENT MEETS BALKAN LEADERS IN GREECE- THEY WILL TRAIN FIGHTER PILOTS.

12:56, 2023-08-22

Ukraine's President Volodomyr Zelenskyy met with leaders of Balkan nations and the head of the European Commission on the sidelines of a meeting between European and Balkan leaders in the Greek capital Tuesday 22 August. The leaders included Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, whose country has refused to join the international sanctions imposed on its traditional ally Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.







"An open, honest, and fruitful meeting with the President of Serbia," Zelenskyy posted on the X social media platform formerly known as Twitter. "Good conversation on respect for the UN Charter and the inviolability of borders. On our nations' shared future in the common European home. On developing our relations, that is in our mutual interest." It was the first time Zelenskyy, who arrived in Athens on Monday afternoon, met with Vucic since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.




Speaking to reporters, Vucic described the meeting as "good and open."

"I repeated that Serbia respects the territorial integrity of Ukraine, unlike some who respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine, but not Serbia," Vucic said, referring to Serbia's former province of Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008 and is recognized by most European Union states, but not by Russia and China.

Ukraine also does not recognize Kosovo's independence, but there were signs recently that it might because of Belgrade's pro-Moscow narrative over the war.

Vucic said after the meeting with Zelenskyy that he was "almost certain" Ukraine will not recognize Kosovo.

The Serbian president, whose country seeks EU membership, said he "managed to ensure" that a formal declaration issued after Monday's meeting in Athens of the Balkan leaders does not include a text on sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

"There are things for which we are not ready at this moment," Vucic said. "As much as we could, we protected our interests."

Zelenskyy also met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, whom he said he thanked "for her efforts to normalize Ukraine's agricultural exports and transit."

Von der Leyen said the two discussed "Ukraine's progress on the EU path as well as our continued support in the face of Russia's aggression."







"We'll continue working together to bring Ukraine's grain to world markets and to provide economic assistance," she tweeted.

Ukraine's economy relies heavily on farming, and its grain is crucial for world supplies of wheat, barley and sunflower oil.

Last month, Russia broke off a key wartime shipping agreement that allowed safe passage of grain exports through the Black Sea.

The suspension marked the end of an accord the United Nations and Turkey brokered last year to allow shipments of food from the Black Sea region after Russia's invasion of its neighbor worsened a global food crisis. The initiative was credited with helping reduce soaring prices of wheat, vegetable oil and other global food commodities.

While in Athens, Zelenskyy also met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolai Denkov, the president of North Macedonia Dimitar Kovachevski and the prime minister of Croatia, Andrej Plenkovic.

XI JIPING,MODI,DA SILVA, TO GRACE THE BRICS SUMMIT IN SANDTON.

15:30, 2023-08-21

Russia and China will look to gain more political and economic ground in the developing world at a summit in South Africa this week, when an expected joint dose of anti-West grumbling from them may take on a sharper edge with a formal move to bring Saudi Arabia closer.




Leaders from the BRICS economic bloc of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa will hold three days of meetings in Johannesburg’s financial district of Sandton, with Chinese premier Xi Jinping’s attendance underlining the diplomatic capital his country has invested in the bloc over the last decade-and-a-bit as an avenue for its ambitions.




Russian President Vladimir Putin will appear on a video link after his travel to South Africa was complicated by an International Criminal Court arrest warrant against him over the war in Ukraine. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will be at the summit alongside Xi.




The main summit on Wednesday -- and sideline meetings Tuesday and Thursday -- are expected to produce general calls for more cooperation among countries in the Global South amid their rising discontent over perceived Western dominance of global institutions.

That's a sentiment that Russia and China are more than happy to lean into. Leaders or representatives of dozens more developing countries are set to attend the sideline meetings in Africa's wealthiest city to give Xi and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who will represent Putin in South Africa, a sizeable audience.

One specific policy point with more direct implications will be discussed and possibly decided on - the proposed expansion of the BRICS bloc, which was formed in 2009 by the emerging market countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China, and added South Africa the following year.




Saudi Arabia is one of more than 20 countries to have formally applied to join BRICS in another possible expansion, South African officials say. Any move toward the inclusion of the world's second-biggest oil producer in an economic bloc with Russia and China would clearly draw attention from the United States and its allies in an extra-frosty geopolitical climate, and amid a recent move by Beijing to exert some influence in the Persian Gulf.




"If Saudi Arabia were to enter BRICS, it will bring extraordinary importance to this grouping," said Talmiz Ahmad, India's former ambassador to Saudi Arabia.

Even an agreement on the principle of expanding BRICS, which already consists of a large chunk of the developing world's biggest economies, is a moral victory for the Russian and Chinese vision for the bloc as a counterbalance to the G-7, analysts say.




Both favour adding more countries to bolster a kind of coalition -- even if it's only symbolic -- amid China's economic friction with the U.S. and Russia's Cold War-like standoff with the West because of the war in Ukraine.

Nations ranging from Argentina to Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Indonesia and United Arab Emirates have all formally applied to join alongside the Saudis, and are also possible new members.

If a number of them are brought in, "then you end up with a bigger economic bloc, and from that a sense of power," said Prof. Alexis Habiyaremye of the College of Business and Economics at the University of Johannesburg.

DONALD TRUMP TO SKIP GOP DEBATE.

15:16, 2023-08-21

 Former President Donald Trump confirmed Sunday that he will be skipping Wednesday’s first Republican presidential primary debate — and others as well.

Trump wrote on his social media site. that the public knows who he is and what a successful Presidency he had,and therefore will not be doing the debates!”

 His spokesman did not immediately clarify whether he plans to boycott every primary debate or just those that have currently been scheduled.

The former president and early GOP frontrunner had said for months that he saw little upside in joining his GOP rivals on stage when they gather for the first time in Milwaukee Wednesday, given his commanding lead in the race. And he had made clear to those he had spoken to in recent days that his opinion had not changed.




As both Fox News personalities acknowledge, former President Donald Trump has not yet committed to attending the debate. That the 77-year-old Trump is currently the front-runner in the race — and the subject of numerous investigations, which will likely be topics of discussion among the candidates — is unusual.

"You have to plan for him to show up at the last minute," says MacCallum of Trump. "He usually enjoys being in on the action and we certainly hope he will do that."




Whether he attends or not, Trump's presence will no doubt be felt. He's currently well ahead of his Republican rivals in the most recent polls and a recent slew of indictments against him ensure that his rivals will have no choice to speak about the former president.




"He’s the front-runner, and he’s facing six or seven really big trial-related dates in the middle of a campaign season, when he’s expected to campaign in New Hampshire and Iowa," MacCallum notes. "This is absolutely unprecedented to see the lead candidate facing these sorts of charges [and] no one has ever covered an election cycle like this. Obviously what the other candidates think about that ... that’s really important."

BRITISH NEONATAL NURSE SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON FOR MURDER OF 7 BABIES.

13:48, 2023-08-21

A former neonatal nurse convicted of murdering seven babies in her care and trying to kill six others at a hospital in northern England was sentenced August 21 to life in prison with no chance of release by a judge who highlighted




“The cruelty and calculation” of her actions.

Lucy Letby, who refused to appear in court to face her sentencing or to hear grieving parents share their anger and anguish, was given the most severe punishment possible under British law, which does not allow the death penalty.




Justice James Goss said the number of killings and attempts and the nature of the murders by a nurse entrusted with caring for the most fragile infants provided the “exceptional circumstances” required to impose a rare “whole-life order.”




Letby, 33, killed five infant boys and two infant girls at Countess of Chester Hospital in 2015 and 2016. In addition to her murder convictions, she was also convicted of attempting to murder six other babies. The 11-person jury was undecided on the attempted murder of a further four babies.

According to Local news, prosecutor Nick Johnson said during closing arguments in June that Letby used lethal air injection on at least 12 of her alleged victims. Johnson claimed air injection was "one of her favorite ways of killing or trying to kill children in this case," according to the outlet.




TOUGH MUSEVENI WRITES A LETTER OF NO BURGING TO WORLD BANK LOAN HAULT.

13:58, 2023-08-17

Un happy President Museveni has downplayed the role of World Bank’s loans and aid packages in the development of the African countries, noting that they can easily do away with them and nothing happens.

“On the contrary, those loans and aid packages, can be a source of distortion and stunted growth as you can see across Africa. Many of the loans and aid packages, are either of no value addition to the country or are even anti-growth, all together,” Museveni said.




The remarks in a jot to the Bazukulu released on August 17 about the suspension of extending loans to Uganda by the World Bank .

This comes shortly after World Bank announced that it had suspended lending to Uganda over the passing of the Anti-Homosexuality law which they said is against their principles.

It said that Uganda’s Anti-Homosexuality Act “fundamentally contradicts” the institution’s values and that no new public financing would be presented to its board of directors for approval for the time being.




Museveni explained that on many occasions, money extended to African countries in form of loans or aid has not served its purpose and therefore losing the same cant cost African countries.

“If foreign aid and loans, are a source of social- economic transformation, why the present growing crisis of even security and stability in Africa? Look at Guinnea-Conakry, Mali, Burkina-Faso, Niger, Central African Republic, DRC, Boko Haram in Nigeria, Somalia, Mozambique, etc. Most of these countries, have been getting those grants and loans.”




He added, “In the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, for instance, we discovered that a total of $800million had been borrowed over a period of ten years, but that ministry did not have zonal diagnostic labs and research centres, did not repair the mechanization centres and did not buy the mechanization equipment like combine harvesters or even tractors, no irrigation equipment for farmers, no value addition equipment, etc. Much of that money was spent on seminars etc, yet, those are the basic requirements of that ministry, if it is to assist in the struggle for social- economic transformation.”




The president insisted that most of the borrowing, has been having no value addition to Uganda’s transformation journey but rather increasing the pool for public and political leaders to steal from..










WORKS ON RUBAVU PORT MOVING ON PROGRESSIVELY.

12:56, 2023-08-17

As Rwanda moves steadily towards achieving all the set targets for vision 2050, improvements are being made in the infrastructure sector to enable reality flow of business, the latest being the up shooting of the Rubavu port on the shores of Lake Kivu.




Construction of the Rubavu port, which is anticipated to enhance tourism and facilitate cross-border trade between Rwanda and DR Congo, is making progress. With works underway, the port, covering two hectares, is located in Rubavu District’s Nyamyumba Sector.




The innovative facility currently under construction, will be completed in two phases. This facility is set to host two main sections: a cargo terminal and a passenger terminal.

The cargo section meant for trade purposes has accommodation building for staff, a petrol station, waste water treatment plant, store and quay; whereas the passenger terminal has maintenance, an electrical substation, workshop, a-two-level building for a restaurant and the main offices of the port and security check.




While speaking to the Senior Engineer at Railway and Cable Car Transport at Rwanda Transport Development Agency (RTDA), Jean Népo Ndayambaje, he said “It will increase connectivity between districts along the Lake Kivu shores as well as boost cross-border trade between Rwanda and DR Congo. It is anticipated that the port will reduce costs of existing trade flow along Lake Kivu,” 




This project is currently being bought to reality by a Tunisie company known as Société centrale pour l'équipement du Territoire (SCET-Tunisie) and is set to be ready by end of this year as it was previously set to reach completion by July 9, 2021. However, due to the unexpected challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and the need for port redesign, the construction progress was disrupted, leading to significant delays.




﻿The project is being developed by the Government of Rwanda through Rwanda Transport Development Agency (RTDA) with the support of TradeMark Africa and Invest International, and has the capability to handle 1.4 million passengers annually and can simultaneously accommodate two cargo vessels. Each vessel has a length of 60 metres and a capacity of 500 DWT.




ANOTHER MIGRANT CATASTROPHE HITS, IOM SAYS

12:37, 2023-08-17

More than 60 people are feared dead after a boat carrying mostly Senegalese migrants capsized off the coast of Cape Verde in the Atlantic Ocean.

The boat left Senegal on July 10 with 101 passengers on board, and 38 people were rescued on Tuesday, Senegal’s foreign ministry said in a statement late on Tuesday.

It was not immediately clear when the incident occurred.

The survivors were on the Cape Verde island of Sal, where Senegal is liaising with authorities for their repatriation, the ministry said. One of the survivors was from Guinea-Bissau.

The Atlantic migration route from the coast of West Africa to the Canary Islands, typically used by African migrants trying to reach Spain, is one of the world’s deadliest. Summer is its busiest period.

“Safe and regular pathways to migration are sorely lacking, which is what gives room to smugglers and traffickers to put people on these deadly journeys,” said IOM spokeswoman Safa Msehli.

IOM is collecting information and did not yet have details about the latest incident, she added.

At least 559 people died attempting to reach the Canary Islands in 2022, while 126 people died or went missing on the same route in the first six months of this year with 15 shipwrecks recorded, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM)




At least 15 people drowned when a boat carrying migrants capsized off the coast of Senegal’s capital Dakar in late July as confirmed by Reuters










A NEW SECURITY CHALLENGE ARISES AGAINST THE JUNTA GOVERNMENT -JIHADISTS STRIKE AGAIN.

12:27, 2023-08-17

As the coup government was still preparing against the ECOWAS bloc likely attack to restore ousted president Mouhamad Bazoum, the Junta government security was exposed with a weak chain link and were attacked by the long known insurgent jihadists in the region on August 15 .




 Insurgents killed 17 soldiers and wounded nearly 24 in the first major attack in half a year against the army in Niger, where Western powers fear a coup by the elite presidential guard last month is weakening a rare ally against jihadi violence in West Africa’s Sahel region.




Niger was one of the last democratic countries in the region south of the Sahara and France and the U.S. have about 2,500 military personnel there who were training Niger’s forces. France also conducted joint operations with its former colony, but since the coup Paris and Washington have suspended military operations, giving the jihadis more breathing room.




A military detachment was attacked Tuesday afternoon as it moved between the villages of Boni and Torodi in the Tillaberi region, the Ministry of Defense said on state television Tuesday. The wounded were evacuated to the capital, Niamey.

READY FOR ACTION VOLUNTEERS RECRUITED IN NIGER.

16:18, 2023-08-16

Nigeriens are preparing for a possible invasion by countries in the region, three weeks after mutinous soldiers ousted the nation’s democratically elected president.




Residents in the capital, Niamey, are calling for the mass recruitment of volunteers to assist the army in the face of a growing threat by the West African regional bloc, ECOWAS, which says it will use military force if the junta doesn’t reinstate deposed President Mohamed Bazoum.




ECOWAS has activated a “standby force” to restore order in Niger after the junta ignored a deadline to release and reinstate Bazoum.

The initiative, spearhead by a group of locals in Niamey, aims to recruit tens of thousands of volunteers from across the country to register for the Volunteers for the Defense of Niger.




The group would fight, assist with medical care, and provide technical and engineering logistics among other functions, in case the junta needs help, Amsarou Bako, one of the founders, told The Associated Press on Tuesday.




“It’s an eventuality. We need to be ready whenever it happens,” he said. The recruitment drive will launch Saturday in Niamey as well as in cities where invasion forces might enter, such as near the borders with Nigeria and Benin, two countries that have said they would participate in an intervention. Anyone over 18 years old can register and the list will be given to the junta to call upon people if needed, said Bako. The junta is not involved but is aware of the initiative, he said.

SOCCER SEASONS RESUME WITH MUCH TALKING POINTS ON THE PREMIER LEAGUE.

07:11, 2023-08-14

Chelsea’s wing-backs do wonders for Pochettino

In the last two seasons, Chelsea’s talismanic wing-backs Ben Chilwell and Reece James have started only 11 out of 76 Premier League games, mainly because of injury. The Liverpool game was a reminder that they are arguably Chelsea’s most important players. Whatever the formation – Mauricio Pochettino said it was a back four, the average positions suggested 3-1-5-1 – Chilwell and James are a constant threat in attack. Chilwell had a goal disallowed, missed a great chance and created Axel Disasi’s equaliser. James put in a series of superb crosses, the best of which was swept over the bar by the otherwise impressive Nicolas Jackson. When they play together, Chelsea look like a serious team.

Eddie Nketiah will not be kept down. He was stung by Kai Havertz’s selection at centre-forward in Arsenal’s Community Shield win but, rather than sulking, opted to make himself a nailed-on choice next time out. Mikel Arteta was thrilled with his attitude in training last week, rewarded him with a start against Nottingham Forest and promptly saw Nketiah open their league account for the season. Nketiah is a curious case. He is now 24 and no longer green around the gills; he has never quite presented a case to be Arteta’s first-choice centre-forward but has a habit of delivering whenever there is a danger he might drift from view. It is hard to know exactly what his level is: plenty of top-flight clubs below the Champions League contenders would happily help him find out but he has shown enough to suggest he can still help Arsenal’s title bid. Arteta said he expects to vary his starting XI frequently this season and a regular place in the rotation would probably be enough to keep Nketiah happy.




Tonali makes instant impact on dream debut for Newcastle

Sandro Tonali – “He drinks Moretti, eats spaghetti and hates Sunderland” – has not taken long to become the subject of a Newcastle fans’ anthem but the Italy midfielder’s outstanding performance in Saturday’s 5-1 dismantling of Aston Villa explains why. From the moment he volleyed Newcastle’s opener Tonali was superb, making it easy to understand why Newcastle paid £55m for him. “I fell in love watching Sandro play for Milan last season,” said Eddie Howe. “And I think he looks good in a Newcastle shirt.” Although Villa’s own debutant Moussa Diaby equalised, further goals from Alexander Isak (twice), Callum Wilson and Harvey Barnes allied to some fine wing-play on Anthony Gordon’s part left Unai Emery downcast. Villa had some decent moments in the first hour but departed saddened by the serious-looking knee injury which seems likely to deprive them of Tyrone Mings for some time







''CO-PARENTING IS NECESSARY FOR FULL CHILD DEVELOPMENT'' SAYS FIRST LADY JEANATTE KAGAME.

06:58, 2023-08-14

Just as the process of conceiving a child take two people, the same is needed to raise a healthy and fully functional child as it is showed by studies about growth and development of a child.

This comes as a notice of concern as the trends in the world are dynamically changing with most parents choosing their careers and forsaking their children to be parented by stranger maids or even television and other electronically powered assistants, which prompted this year's theme for the Young Leaders Prayer Breakfast,  to be ''Young Leaders and Parenting Today”.




This event that was organised by Rwanda Leaders Fellowship (RLF), took place on August 13 aiming to at instilling good values in leadership, bringing together leaders from different spheres of the country which included young leaders in government, the private sector, and civil society to discuss how to navigate parenting amidst other responsibilities.




While speaking at this event , the first lady encouraged men and women to demonstrate equal responsibilities in parenting, and not push their children down the path they think they should pursue, but rather pull them by being exemplary in their households.




“I suspect that you never really know the strength that gets you through juggling all that is required of you; you just do, because you must,” the First Lady explained to participants, adding that they might even question their choices on the outcomes if things were done differently.

“We draw strength from each other’s candid, honest and brave sharing of our own experiences navigating through parenting, without a ‘mode d’emploi’ [a guiding book].”




The First Lady also reminded parents to not to shovel their ideals down onto their children, pushing them down the path they believe they should pursue, rather, be a pulling force into the fate they desire for them, by achieving this fate themselves.




''KEEP YOUR HEADLIGHTS ON ALL THE TIME'' RWANDAN NATIONAL POLICE WARNS TAXI - MOTO OPERATORS

06:38, 2023-08-14

In bid to reduce road accidents and enhance more safe road usage, the Rwanda National Police issued another sound warning to the taxi moto operators particularly those in busy urban centers to keep their headlights on in dim mode in order to enhance the safety of other road users.

This directive was to be take with immediate effect beginning August 10 2023.




While speaking to some motorists, City radio learnt that this was not a bad directive except that it was costly in terms of maintenance of the entire lighting and electrical wiring of the bikes




“This is not the first time they ask us to keep our lights on all day. But we don’t like to have the lights on for so long because bulbs burn out so easily due to high temperature that you may end up having to repair them three times in one month,” said Jean Bosco NtakirutaImana a motorist in Kigali city.




He added that this does not affect the bulbs alone but also raises fuel consumption of the bikes than if the lights were switched on only at night.

While speaking to press Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) René Irere, said the order to have lights on has been in place for more than 20 years, only that the motorbike operators had not conformed to it.




Citing the 2002 presidential decree regulating the traffic police and road traffic that says “dim lights of motorbikes and mopeds which move on the public way must be used every time and in all circumstances''.




“There is nothing new about the obligation to have lights all the time the motorbikes and moped bikes are on the road. Motorcyclists know it very well and they learnt about it even when they took tests for the driving licence,” Irere added.




Irere said that due to the size and swiftness of motorcycles, riders should always keep the dim lights on to make sure that other road users notice them easily, which prevents accidents.

He added that the reason behind the renewed call is an increasing number of electric motorcycles that are silent, making it hard for other road users to notice them.




A fine of RWF 10,000 was set to be paid by any motorist who will be found riding at any time of the day while their dim lights are off this comes as a resound warning to those riders that won't adhere to this order.







ECUADOR'S HOPE BEARER AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDINDATE VILLAVICENCIO SLAIN AT A RALLY.

11:11, 2023-08-10

An Ecuadorian presidential candidate known for speaking up against cartels and corruption was shot and killed Wednesday at a political rally in the capital, amid a startling wave of gang-driven violence in the South American country.

President Guillermo Lasso confirmed the assassination of Fernando Villavicencio and suggested organized crime was behind his slaying, less than two weeks before the Aug. 20 presidential election.




However during this scuffle arrests were made amidst a fire fight between authorities and law enforcement shortly before Ecuador’s attorney general’s office said that one suspect died in custody from wounds sustained in a firefight after the killing, and police detained six suspects following raids in Quito.







“I assure you that this crime will not go unpunished,” Lasso said in a statement. “Organized crime has gone too far, but they will feel the full weight of the law.” said president Guillermo Lasso




Hope bearer Villavicencio had promised a roaring crowd that he would root out corruption and lock up the country’s “thieves.”




Prior to the shooting, Villavicencio said he had received multiple death threats, including from affiliates of Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel, one of a slew of international organized crime groups that now operate in Ecuador. He said his campaign represented a threat to such groups.

“Here I am showing my face. I’m not scared of them,” Villavicencio said in a statement, naming detained crime boss José Adolfo Macías by his alias “Fito.”




Villavicencio was one of eight candidates, though not the front-runner. The politician, 59, was the candidate for the Build Ecuador Movement.




''WAGNER GROUP TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SAHEL REGION COUPS'' - BLINKEN SAYS

14:23, 2023-08-08

Russia's Wagner mercenary group is "taking is believed to be strengthening themselves and taking advantage" of instability in Niger, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has told the press.




The country has been ruled by a junta following the ousting of President Mohamed Bazoum nearly two weeks ago.

There have been suggestions the coup leaders have asked for help from Wagner, which is known to be present in neighbouring Mali..

Mr Blinken said he did not think Russia or Wagner instigated Niger's coup.

However the US was worried about the group "possibly manifesting itself" in parts of the Sahel region.




Meanwhile this comes after the Junta appointed the new prime minister to take the interim government to stability as they brace themselves for any action that comes out of the ECOWAS heads of state meeting on 13 August in Abuja




THE INTEREHAMWE MONEY BAGS TO BE SET FREE BY UN COURT.

13:54, 2023-08-08

Survivors of Rwanda’s 1994 genocide criticized Tuesday a call by appeals judges at a United Nations court to indefinitely halt the trial of an alleged financer and supporter of the massacre due to the suspect’s ill health.




The ruling made at the beginning of the week sends the matter back to the court’s trial chamber with instructions to impose a stay on proceedings. That likely means that Félicien Kabuga, who is nearly 90, will never be prosecuted. His trial, which started last year at the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals in The Hague, was halted in June because his dementia left him unable to participate in proceedings.




Appeals judges at the court also rejected a proposal to set up an alternative procedure that would have allowed evidence to be heard but without the possibility of a verdict. in what was referred to as  "trial of facts," this being a a procedure that allows the presentation of evidence and findings but excludes the possibility of conviction.




This 90s tycoon is believed to have been  providing uniforms, weapons and vehicles to Interahamwe militia, in addition to using Radio RTLM, a media house he owned, to propagate anti-Tutsi propaganda and fuel hatred and killings against them.




ONCE UGANDA'S STRONGEST BUT NOW MOST DISFUNCTIONAL OPPOSITION PARTY.

13:25, 2023-08-08

The Forum For Democratic Change Party (FDC) is in total chaos as hidden secrets start to emerge exposing the top officials ands some thraetend to loose their positions in the party.

This was fanned after the Four-Time Presidential Aspirant and the founding father of the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), Col, Dr.Kizza Besigye has accused current party Secretary General, Nandala Mafabi of telling lies in regards the shs300 million that he(Nandala) claimed was for polling agents during the 2021 general elections.




“Hon Nathan Nandala Mafabi told a lie when he said that he had given me Shs300 million for polling agents. He told me the money was his and he wanted to hide it from URA since he had debts with them, and that they (URA) would confiscate it,” Besigye told journalists on Monday.







The four-time presidential candidate was responding to the report by the FDC Elders Committee report in which Nandala Mafabi said he had given Besigye shs300 million for polling agents.




In his testimony to the committee tasked to iron differences within the once strongest opposition political party in the country, Mafabi insisted that he embarked on a mobilization drive that enabled him get some money for the party’s activities.

Specifically, on the issue of “dirty money” he contended that he had mobilized some money for agents but that URA had always garnished his accounts during the period for elections, so he requested Dr. Besigye to keep for him shs 300 million which the latter willingly accepted. He showed the Committee evidence of the bank statement indicating the money that he withdrew from his account in Stanbic Kyambogo bank which was to a tune of shs 500 million,” the committee wrote in its report.




Infuriated with what he termed as lies, Besigye got emotional as he talked about the “dirty money” insisting that whereas he received the shs300 million from Nandala, he was told it was for hiding away from URA and not for polling agents as alleged.

The money arrived at about 10pm and he rang me saying “the other thing I talked about is about to arrive” and I said but Nathan, where is it passing this is curfew time and people not allowed to move. Those allowed to move would risk carrying such money. He said don’t worry and before long somebody was hooting at my gate with the money,” Besigye said.




The former FDC president however blasted the elders committee for its recommendations that he said have rendered the party dysfunctional.

Neither in their findings or recommendations did they seek to deal with the dirty money save for recording what each one told them and recording it in a biased way.”




He asked members to fulfill their duty to liberate their own party.

As this still finding level on the ground, FDCs chief critic from the inside Hon Semujju Nganda has been replaced with Mawokota MP Yusuf Nsibambi.




MUSEVENI CONDEMNS POLITICS OF IDENTINTY AND SAYS IT'S THE CAUSE OF WESTAFRICA'S TURMOIL.

12:40, 2023-08-08

President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda on August 8 condemned what is happening to Africa especially in west Africa where he said this was the continuous misnomer of the political class that didn't know what to do but instead based everything on identity, a thing he said had brought once trouble in east Africa particularly in Uganda and Rwanda in the early 90s.




This was during a session with the commanding staff of the Uganda police criminal investigation directorate (CID).




Museveni while delivering his address he said that everyone in civil service ought to be an African cadre in order to empower the African continent in where he said these were at the forefront of fighting vices that continue to deter the continent from development.

''If an old woman died of poverty in the village or of hunger, it should be blamed on the police too, because partly they did not do their job in either making sure this woman's land, goats, chicken is not stolen.'' Museveni explained.




The Ugandan president continued to condemn politics of identity regardless of the need for culture which was basically to pass on customs on ways of marriage, work balance and other aspects but not in service delivery or even in the leadership tunnels. 

NIGER CRISIS DEEPEND AS THEY MOVE ARMY TO CITY NAMEY.

13:57, 2023-08-07

Hours after the deadline is past and closure of airspace, the Niger Junta have been seen preparing themselves for counter insurgence in case of any external invasion as promised by ECOWAS.




 

Niger’s armed forces have been bringing in reinforcements to the capital to prepare for a potential military intervention, a military source told CNN, just hours after the military junta running the country refused to abide by an influential regional bloc’s deadline to cede power.




A convoy of about 40 pick-up trucks arrived at nightfall on Sunday evening, bringing troops from other parts of the country to both reassure a nervous public and prepare for potential battle.




Niger has been engulfed in political chaos since late last month, when President Mohamed Bazoum was ousted in a coup d’etat by the presidential guard. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) responded days later by enacting sanctions and issuing an ultimatum to the ruling military junta: stand down within a week or face a potential military intervention.




That deadline came and went Sunday without any change in the political situation. Bazoum remains deposed and his whereabouts are still unknown to the public. The National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland, the junta’s formal name, is still effectively in charge of Niger. A junta leader said Sunday that Niger’s armed forces would be closing the country’s airspace due to the threat of military intervention.




What comes next is unclear. ECOWAS leaders say their preference is find a diplomatic solution to the crisis but have maintained they willing to resort to the use of force as a last resort to return Niger’s democratically elected government to power. The bloc is set to hold another meeting on the situation on Thursday.

SUDANESE STUDENTS SET TO COMPLETE ACADEMIC JOURNEY FROM RWANDA.

13:52, 2023-08-07

More than 300 medical students from sudan are set to continue studying and complete their academic journey in Rwanda.

This comes after tensions in Sudan continue between the warring generals and without an expected date of end. 




 The students will be enrolled at the University of Rwanda (UR) - School of Medicine and Health Sciences. They are from the University of Medical Sciences and Technology of Khartoum, Sudan.

The group has been stranded and unable to complete their studies owing to the current security crisis in the country.

The development was confirmed on Tuesday 1, by the UR Vice Chancellor Didace Kayihura Muganga, while appearing before the national broadcaster.




Out of the number, 133 of them are Sudanese, while the rest are from Nigeria, France, Canada, USA, India, Jordan and Ireland.

The students had been stranded and unable to continue studying owing to the current security standoff between government forces and Rapid Security Forces(RSF) in the country.




Rwanda has designated to receive firstly the final year students, particularly those from general medicine and dentistry and facilitate them in the final studies and practical trainings.

“We agreed to have those who are doing general medicine, especially in their clinical trainings, and part of them into the dentistry department. For those in general medicine, they will be doing clinical rotation while those in dentistry we be doing their clinical trainings,” said the Chancellor.




Rwanda has pledged to extend the help until the instability and crisis will be resolved, and looks at sustainable collaboration with Sudan.

It should be remembered that in August 2021, Rwanda also received a group of Afghani girls from the School of Leadership of Afghanistan (SOLA), a single all-girls boarding school in Kabul who were fleeing the country when the Taliban took control of Afghanistan.




These upon arrival were excited of the opportunity given to them but also thanked president Paul Kagame who had showed mercy unto them but also continued to be a beacon of light unto the world through supporting young people world wide.



















KIGALI'S NIGHT LIFE SENT TO SHAMBLES AGAIN AMID UNCERTERNITY OF WHO IS LEGITMATE TO OPERATE BEYOND 1AM.

13:39, 2023-08-07

The Rwanda Development Board (RDB), boss Clare Akamanzi stated that the decision by Cabinet on Tuesday, August 1 to set a closing time for night-time activities was meant to make sure Rwandans have “a good quality of life.”




The Cabinet resolved that effective September 1, all non-essential services will close at 1 a.m. on working days and at 2 a.m. during weekends (Friday and Saturday).

The decision gives a balance on the priorities that the government has, such as making Rwanda and Rwandan cities livable, Akamanzi told the press.

“But at the same time,” she said, “another priority is making sure that Rwandan businesses are profitable and that are providing convenient and efficient services.”




The cabinet said however that RDB will develop detailed guidelines that will decide which services may be exempted from the closing time.

“We do know that there's some businesses that will need to operate beyond 1 a.m. and by their very nature there are some businesses that can be accessed beyond 1 a.m. So, the Cabinet was very cognizant of that fact.” Clare added




This tourism destination isn’t big on parading itself as the central party goers of her neighbours' partly because of the conservative nature of the people. That is why you will often meet familiar faces in various joints of mostly the well-travelled folks. Those bred and born here love to imbibe in the comfort of a local pubs as they watch a match or catch up on the local grapevine one of the reasons that noise pollution has been risen as the central point of regulation.




As this is still seen as for good intentions urban party dwellers and business owners lay in balance as they await RDB's list of commandments.




“As far as I can remember we have club-hopped with my friends in a few places. Ever since I came to the country two years ago I have had my fair share of partying although not as much as I used to back in Kampala or Nairobi,” said Timothy Mirembe a party goer who starts his partying on Fridays.







With such uncertainty, most party goers, organisers and night life business owners are wondering what is next for them as they had started reaping big from the Visit Rwanda campaign as they recovered from the long stretch of COVID pandemic










WEST CHINA HOLDING EXPANDS INTO RWANDA WITH INVESTMENT IN BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION.

13:07, 2023-08-07

Another cement and prefabricated building material company was opened August 3 by His excellency the president of Rwanda Paul Kagame.

US SET TO TRY A FORMER PRESIDENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY OF THE NATION.

13:10, 2023-08-02

The United states through its justice department is set to take the 45th president to trial due to his alleged mis direction of the democratic ideals. “The United States of America v. Donald J. Trump” instantly became one of the most consequential documents in American history.

Tuesday’s 45-page indictment took the country to an unprecedented, profound and even tragic place.

For the first time, America is set to put on trial a former president for trying to destroy its democratic system because, as the indictment put it, “he was determined to remain in power” despite having lost an election. And he’s not just any former president – Trump’s the front-runner for the GOP nomination, whom polling shows is closely matched with President Joe Biden in a hypothetical rematch.

The indictment details a clear and chilling alleged plot to subvert the will of voters in 2020 and to sever the chain of voluntary transfers of power between presidents inaugurated by George Washington leaving his nation to “command its own fortunes” when he declined a new term in 1796.




However as this was going on, Donald Trump was addressing a rally in Pennsylvania wher he was busy exposing the current president Joe Biden and his family for being corrupt and hating America.




'' These men are on the agenda to make our country fail, loose credibility and loss of trust from all our allies and they are doing it from with in. you know it.'' Said Donald Trump







They are indicting me with all these cases but thank God you all know the truth and the truth will win, the truth is that i can never allow men to continue competing in women sports or even allow public schools to continue sexualising our children, not on my watch. Trump added




Trump reacted by resorting to the same inflammatory language and anti-democratic rhetoric that is detailed through the indictment and that led the country to the brink of a coup after the last presidential election.

His campaign issued a statement claiming Smith’s indictment as an example of “election interference” – throwing the broader transgression of which he was effectively accused back at the Biden administration Justice Department, which had tapped the independent special prosecutor to probe the matter.










RWANDANS IN THE MIDDLE EAST CONVERGE IN ABU DHABI TO CELEBRATE THE 29TH KWIBOHORA.

12:06, 2023-08-02

Rwandans founded the new nation on grounds of hope, unity, accountability, and thinking big to transform the country from rubbles into a thriving nation in the new post-liberation era, the acting Chargé d’Affaires at the Embassy of Rwanda in the United Arab Emirates, Ines Mutoni, has said.

NIGER CRISIS WORSENS AS EUROPE SEEKS TO EVEACUATE CITZENS.

14:07, 2023-08-01

 France, Italy and Spain announced evacuations from Niger for their citizens and other European nationals Tuesday, concerned that they risked becoming trapped by a military coup that won backing from three other West African nations also ruled by mutinous soldiers.




France’s Foreign Ministry cited recent violence that targeted its embassy in Niamey, the capital, as one of the reasons for its decision to offer evacuation flights to several hundred of its citizens and other Europeans. It said the closure of Niger’s airspace “leaves our compatriots unable to leave the country by their own means.”

Spain’s Defense Ministry announced preparations to evacuate more than 70 nationals and Italy also said it was arranging a flight. The foreign office in Germany recommended that its citizens accept France’s offer to fly them out.




The evacuations come during a deepening crisis sparked by the coup last week against Niger’s democratically elected president, Mohamed Bazoum. His apparent overthrow is a blow for Western nations that were working with Niger against West African extremists.

RWANDA VOTED TO BE PART OF THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OF THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD TOURISM ORGANISATION.

13:35, 2023-08-01

As Rwanda is slated to host the biggest world tourism event this year, known as the World Travel and Tourism Council Summit, the nation of thousand hills has been elected as a member of the Executive Council of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation during the 66th meeting of the Regional Commission for Africa at an event held in Pointe aux Piments, Mauritius/




 

The United Nations World Tourism Organisation is an agency responsible for the promotion of responsible, sustainable and universally accessible tourism.

The Executive Council acts as the governing board of the organisation and takes all necessary measures and decisions linked to global tourism development.

At the meeting held recently, Rwanda was voted yea by 14 members out of a possible 20, joining Ghana, Nigeria Namibia, Tanzania, and DR Congo for the Executive Council’s 2023-2027 term.

In addition, Rwanda is now part of the working group for the setup of the Tourism PanAfrican Fund together with Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, and Zambia. It works directly with the Secretary General and the Council members meet at least twice a year during their four-year tenure.




Rugwizangoga Michaella , Chief Tourism Officer at the Rwanda Development Board, said: “We’re very pleased to join the Executive Council. Rwanda’s mandate will focus on African integration by promoting intra-African travel, sports tourism, sustainability and nature-positive tourism.”




Rwanda has in recent years been actively investing in the MICE sector with hope it could generate economic value for the country as well as raise its profile as a destination for business.

In 2022, tourism revenues rose to $445 million (about Rwf496 billion) a 171.3 percent increase from $164 million in 2021. The sector remains Rwanda’s leading forex earner.

AFRICAN LEADERS TELL PUTIN, WAR MUST END.

11:37, 2023-07-31

African leaders have left two days of meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin with little to show for their requests to resume a deal that kept grain flowing from Ukraine and to find a path to end the war there.




Putin in a press conference late Saturday following the Russia-Africa summit said Russia’s termination of the grain deal earlier this month caused a rise in grain prices that benefits Russian companies. He added that Moscow would share some of those revenues with the “poorest nations.”




That commitment, with no details, follows Putin’s promise to start shipping 25,000 to 50,000 tons of grain for free to each of six African nations in the next three to four months — an amount dwarfed by the 725,000 tons shipped by the U.N. World Food Program to several hungry countries, African and otherwise, under the grain deal. Russia plans to send the free grain to Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, Mali, Somalia, Eritrea and Central African Republic.







Fewer African heads of state or government attended the Russia summit reflecting concerns over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine even as Moscow seeks more allies on the African continent of 1.3 billion people. Putin praised Africa as a rising center of power in the world, while the Kremlin blamed “outrageous” Western pressure for discouraging some African countries from showing up




It is from this background that discussions foud their foundations to discuss investment in oil, nuclear energy, Agriculture and education enhancement between Russia and Africa.

FOR THE FIRST TIME IPHONE CRAWLS FROM BEHIND - FLIP PHONE TIME

10:24, 2023-07-31

As the iPhone Flip is yet to hit the runway, plenty of other brands are causing the competition for the best foldable phones to heat up. There's the new One Plus Open, the Google Pixel Fold, Motorola Razr+ and upcoming Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 and  Galaxy Z Fold 5




So where does this leave Apple?

Although things are quiet on the iPhone Flip front, that doesn't mean there isn't movement happening in the background. While the focus this year appears to be on the iPhone 15 launch in the fall, it's widely believed that Apple's going to get into foldables eventually. Apple foldable phone patents, along with concept drawings from independent designers, suggest that Apple can really make its mark with the iPhone Flip (or IPhone Fold, if Apple opts for that name).




We've compiled the rumors so far and the concepts in this iPhone Flip guide. Over time, we hope to gain a clearer picture of what is sure to be the most revolutionary iPhone yet when it finally does see the light of day.




With much anticipation building up, the launch date of the iPhone Flip is open to speculation, but the latest rumors are pointing toward a 2024 launch.

Display analyst Ross Young, who has a track record for being accurate with such tips, has suggested Apple could introduce a foldable iPhone in 2023. That said, even Young believes that 2024 is probably the more likely launch year for such a device.

However, a report from Ming-Chi Kuo states that a foldable iPhone may not arrive until 2025. Another analyst, Ben Wood, believes we will at least get a foldable iPad before then.

Suffice to say, no one knows if or when an iPhone Flip will show up. Skepticism here is the healthiest outlook.

So now the question stands , are you keeping the Iphone goal with the flip, or it's time to switch up a little bit?

RWANDA - BELGIUM RELATIONS BECOME SOUR OVER REJECTION OF AMB VICENT KAREGA.

13:31, 2023-07-26

Rwanda's newly appointed ambassador to Belgium rejected The decision by the Belgian government to reject the appointment of Vincent Karega as ambassador designate to the Kingdom is unfortunate and doesn't come well for bilateral relations between both Rwanda and Belgium,.

The unfortunate incident by the Belgian government seems to have been capitalized to pressure from the DRC government as well as propaganda from negationist organisations and activists, through who they decided to leak the decision, 

According to government spokesperson Yolande Makolo Belgium's assertive support for the DR Congo played a significant role in rejecting Amb. Karega's accreditation.

In light of persistent tensions between Kinshasa and Kigali, Belgium has been keen on strengthening its ties with the DR Congo.




It should be noted that Belgium was Rwanda's colonial master prior their un precedence departure that groomed the 1994 Genocide against the Tusti.

The seemed to be growing ties now lay in balance as Kigali looks at this as a sign of illegitimate treatment amid the history that both countries hold.

''POLIO VIRUS IS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD.'' SYAS MINISTRY OF HEALTH

12:10, 2023-07-26

The government on Monday, July 24, launched a comprehensive vaccination campaign against Polio 2, following reported cases of the disease in neighboring African countries, including Burundi.




Type 2 poliovirus had been declared eradicated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in September 2015, leading to the removal of its vaccine from international vaccination programs in 2016.

Previously, the last reported case of the virus dated back to 1999 in India. However, in 2022, Malawi reported a resurgence, and in 2023, Burundi also witnessed some cases.




In response, Rwanda's Ministry of Health, in collaboration with UNICEF and Wotld Health Organisation, has launched a 5-day vaccination campaign targeting children below the age of 7 years, as they were born after the Polio 2 vaccine had been removed from the regular vaccination schedule.




Polio (poliomyelitis) mainly affects children under 5 years of age.

One in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis. Among those paralysed, 5–10% die when their breathing muscles become immobilized.

Cases due to wild poliovirus have decreased by over 99% since 1988, from an estimated 350 000 cases then, to 6 reported cases in 2021.

As long as a single child remains infected, children in all countries are at risk of contracting polio. Failure to eradicate polio from these last remaining strongholds could result in a global resurgence of the disease.

In most countries, the global effort has expanded capacities to tackle other infectious diseases by building effective surveillance and immunization systems.




It's from this background that government and partners are putting out relevant measures to keep Rwandan children safe with this immunization exercise.




RWANDA'S YOUTH ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE COUNTRY'S CONTINUITY OF DEV'T

11:54, 2023-07-26

 Rwanda's youth stand as a driving force for unity and sustainable development in the country, thanks to visionary leadership and empowerment through continuous extension pf knowledge and skills.




This assertion was put forth by the Rwanda Defence Forces Deputy Spokesperson Lt. Col. Simon Kabera on Sunday, July 23, during the 'Youth for Rwanda' (YFR) event.

The gathering, which took place at Hilltop Hotel, brought together students from various universities with the aim of empowering and inspiring the next generation of leaders.




The event was held under the theme 'Building a sustainable and inclusive future'. Kabera took the audience on a journey through Rwanda's history, highlighting how the nation had emerged from the devastation of the Genocide against the Tutsi in 1994 to become a beacon of hope and progress.




Currently Rwanda's majority population are considered youth and fall in the media age range of 22.7 years according to the National Institute Of statics, which makes Rwanda's population so productive.




Lt Col. Kabeera also continued to emphasise discipline and the fear of God unto the youth for they are the only virtues that would see them rise in ranks of service but above all keep the country the call home peaceful.

THE RENOWN CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTER QIN GANG OUSTED AD WANG YI STEPS UP IN RANK.

11:40, 2023-07-26

China has removed Qin Gang as foreign minister less than seven months after he was appointed to the post.

Mr Qin had been seen as a close associate of President Xi Jinping. The role will be taken up by Communist Party foreign affairs chief Wang Yi.

Mr Qin's prolonged disappearance from public view - and official silence over it - had fuelled furious speculation.




The 57-year-old's last known public engagements were on 25 June. No reason was given for his removal.

He had been appointed by China's leader to his post last December. His departure ends weeks of confusion, but leaves many questions unanswered.




"China's top legislature voted to appoint Wang Yi as foreign minister," state news agency Xinhua said.




The report said President Xi had signed the decree authorising the move.

Under the Chinese Communist Party system, foreign policy is formulated by a high-level official, who then directs the foreign minister to implement it.

Qin Gang was sacked on Tuesday, in a rare political scandal engulfing a loyalist to President Xi Jinping.

Qin had been missing from public view for more than three weeks, fueling speculation about his future. The new foreign minister who will be Qin’s predecessor, Wang Yi, according to state media will resume his duties as soon as possible since China has a lot of pending foreign assignments especially with the upcoming already controversial BRICS summit in South Africa.




The media report didn’t give a reason for the abrupt removal of Qin, who only took charge of the foreign ministry in December.

RUSSIA HAS "ALMOST ABANDONED" THE IDEA OF WINNING THE WAR IN UKRAINE MILTARILY

12:19, 2023-07-25

Russian forces started a new phase in Russia’s illegitimate war against Ukraine. To the surprise of many, Ukrainian forces, under inspiring political leadership, managed to withstand the initial Russian offensive. With large-scale Western support, they even managed to take over the initiative and liberate half of the territory Russia had occupied. Russian forces suffered massive losses without achieving the (presumed) initial political-strategic objectives of subjugating the Ukrainian state, replacing its leadership and annexing (at least) parts of it.

The combination of Russia’s tactical, military-operational, and political-strategic failures and Ukraine’s effective defense and counteroffensives led many to euphoria. Politicians, policymakers, and pundits argue that Ukraine should be supported until all its territory is liberated, including Crimea and the initial separatist regions in the Donbas. Following this is the expectation that a diplomatically isolated and sanctions-hit Russia can no longer achieve a victory against an internationally backed Ukraine, however experts have started to believe that Russia could be devising other means that are less militaristic to still win the war in Ukraine.

While appearing on Sky News yesterday, former British intelligence officer with the MI5 and now head of Orbis business intelligence Christofer Steele said that both sides were running vulnerable but were still egocentric because of their allies.




'' See all these drone attacks both in Ukraine and the recent ones being in Crimea, Moscow and other parts. This is a sign of both of them being agitated but can't stop because each one has a different reason , but i would say Russia has lost it's motive for this war and is choosing the best way to win it less militarily''. said Steel

It should be remembered that Russia pulled out of the Black sea grain deal and shortly then after started to bombard the grain port of Odessa which was a hub for mainly wheat and other grains that were shipped to both Africa and China

KENYAN POLICE INSTRUCTED NOT TO REPRT DEATHS DURING RIOTS.

20:53, 2023-07-22

Nairobi ; A Kenyan police official told the Associated Press on Thursday that police received a warning against reporting deaths that have occurred as a result of this week’s opposition protests over the country’s high cost of living. Although it was unclear who issued the direct order, it came after opposition leader Raila Odinga called for three days of protests.

The protests come as a result of the increased cost of living under the government of Kenyan President William Ruto. Since his election last year, Kenya has witnessed tax increases and a rise in petrol prices. Raila continues to accuse President Ruto of deceiving Kenyans and failing to fulfill his promises to the Nation.

While the protests were supposed to be peaceful, they became violent, and Kenyan police have been accused of using excessive force and dubious methods in response. The Associated Press reported that 6 people were killed this week and 27 others in the last weeks. Additionally, the Media Council of Kenya decried a police decision to have an officer pose as a journalist in a riot because it could compromise the safety of journalists while on duty.

Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki said that 312 people were arrested during Wednesday’s protests, including a Member of Parliament who was not named.




Human rights organisations have strongly criticised the police for what they call their excessive use of force last Wednesday. More than 50 children were admitted to hospital after tear gas was fired into their classroom in Nairobi.

The opposition called for a series of protests after tax hikes were introduced last month by the government of President William The police chief has said the protests are a threat to national security and has deployed riot officers across the country.

In some towns, including Nairobi and Nakuru in the Rift Valley, protesters barricaded roads and were hurling stones at police.

RWANDA PREMIER LEAGUE CHAMPIONS OPT FOR FRENCH TACTICIAN

11:44, 2023-07-20

The military side APR continue to strengthen themselves ahead of the new season where they are set to embark on the winning raw again as they are up against an uphill task to defend the league title but also go for the continent's champions league.




In bid to make all this possible APR have hired French soccer veteran and former TP Mazembe and Togolese National team coach Thierry Froger to lead the black and white stars to their untouchable spree.




Thierry Froger has touched down in the country to start his job as new head coach of Rwanda Premier League champions APR FC.

The 60 year old, joins the military side after reaching an agreement to coach the club on a two-years deal. He will be assisted his French counterpart Kouda Karim




BRIEF BACKGORUND




He started his football career, as a player, in 1971 and retired in 1991. He was at the time plying his trade with French Ligue 1 side Le Mans.

Three years later, he ventured into a coaching career at Le Mans in 1994. He also coached Lille, Châteauroux, Guegnon, Reims, Nîmes, Vannes, and Créteil in France before shifting to Africa.

The veteran coach is familiar with African football, having previously coached TP Mazembe, USM Alger, Togo National Team, and Arta/Solar7 which he coached until he joined APR.




As part of his contract Froger is expected  to guide the military to bolt out of the group stages of the CAF Champions League and one of either the league title or Peace Cup in domestic football.

Aimé Desiré ‘Ndanda’ Ndizeye, Alex Mugabo and Albert NGABO will also be part of Froger’s back room serving as goalkeepers’ coach, team manager and fourth assistant coach respectively.

Under Froger, a new-look APR will be looking to conquer African club football again after a decade-long run of continental failures since adopting the ‘home grown players only’ policy which the club hierarchy backtracked when they signed foreign players during the current transfer window.

US president Joe Biden who is been attending the NATO 2023 summit in Lithuania,  hailed the “unbroken” people of Ukraine and the “incredible dignity” with which they’ve acted to repel Russia’s invading forces as he pledged on behalf of the Western world to maintain support for Kyiv’s defence for as long as necessary.




Mr Biden delivered his remarks to a boisterous crowd who’d gathered hours ahead of time to hear him speak in the Great Court at Vilnius University, following the conclusion of this year’s Nato leaders’ summit, at which leaders of the 31-member defence alliance agreed to expedite Ukraine’s bid for membership in the bloc once the war with Russia has been brought to a close.




The president, who was also met with one person in the crowd who held a sign marking him as a supporter of his predecessor, Donald Trump, noted the history of the place where he was speaking, and recalled how the Lithuanian yellow, green and red tricolour flag remained aloft outside the country’s diplomatic mission to Washington, even throughout the Soviet occupation of Lithuania.




Mr Biden said some of the older attendees in the crowd would “know better than anyone how precious the right to determine your own future is,” and praised Lithuania and the other Baltic states — Estonia and Latvia — for their strenuous advocacy for Ukraine’s defence and for Kyiv’s bid for membership in Nato.




He said that all parties involved “want this war to end,” but only on terms that will “uphold the basic principles” of the UN charter concerning national sovereignty and territorial integrity, calling those concepts “two pillars of peaceful relations among nations”.







THE SHE AMAVUBI UP AGAINST THE SHE CRANES IN BID FOR THE 2024 PARIS GAMES.

12:48, 2023-07-12

The clash of the East African women in bid for the 2024 Paris olympic games will happen at the Kigali Pele Stadium Nyamirambo as the she Amavubi are looking forward to their first ever win against the she cranes.




Rwanda women skipper Sifa Gloria Nibagwire has said that she and her teammates are well poised to beat Uganda ahead of Wednesday's first leg clash of the Paris 2024 Games qualifiers at Kigali Pele Stadium.

The Crested Cranes have not lost a single game against Rwanda, a record that Nibagwire believes her team wants to end in style when the pair face off as they both eye a ticket to the Olympic Games that will take place in Paris from July 26 to August 11.

"The last time we met Uganda, they beat us but that was in the past. We can beat them and we ask our fans to attend this game. Even though technically Uganda is the home team, it is our home soil and we promise not to disappoint them," she said.

This comes after Uganda has more than three of their stadiums under renovation and are not marching the stadium standards required to host this event which poses as an advantage to the she Amavubi who go into this first leg game at home.




The winner on aggregate will advance to the next round and face Cameroon, which received a bye in the first round. It is worth noting that this is not the first time a Ugandan national team has hosted home games outside their home soil.

ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION WORRIES RWANDA. MINISTRY OF HEALTH LAUNCHES TUNYWE LESS.

12:02, 2023-07-12

Following a recent survey that showed an increase in alcohol consumption in the country, the Ministry of Health has launched a new campaign aimed at fighting the behaviour among people, especially the youth.




Dubbed "TunyweLess," the campaign is aimed at reaching out to people through various means including both social and conventional media, asking them to either stop drinking or drink less.

The campaign's first promotional video shared on the ministry's Twitter page features the health minister Dr. Sabin Nsanzimana in a bar, talking to people about the dangers of alcohol.




"Alcohol damages life; alcohol leads to various diseases like cancer, diabetes, and heart diseases. Do you think you can drink all these bottles and your health does not get affected?" he asked, before he proposed that they stop drinking or at least drink less.

Late June, the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC) released results of a new survey that showed that alcohol consumption in the country has increased from 41 percent in 2013 to 48 percent in 2022.




According to Alcohol Research: Current Reviews Editorial Staff, the number of drinks a person consumes and the rate at which he or she consumes them influence how much alcohol enters the brain and how impaired that person becomes. Many people are surprised to learn what counts as a drink. The amount of liquid in one’s glass, can, or bottle does not necessarily match up to how much alcohol is in the drink.




To facilitate research and clinical care and to help individuals make informed choices about how much alcohol they are consuming, public health agencies in the world have established a definition of a standard drink, as well as definitions of various alcohol consumption patterns. These definitions facilitate objective assessments of how much a person is drinking, enable comparisons of alcohol consumption within and across studies, and help consumers follow low-risk drinking guidelines.

Heavy episodic drinking is defined as the proportion of adults (15+ years) who have consumed at least 60 grams or more of pure alcohol on at least one occasion in the past 30 days.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), consuming 60 grams of pure alcohol is approximately equivalent to consuming six standard alcoholic drinks.

The WHO says there is no safe amount of alcohol that does not affect health. It adds that alcohol consumption is linked to various types of cancer, including common forms such as bowel cancer and female breast cancer.

Among the provinces, the Western province had the highest rate of heavy alcohol drinking at 19.1 percent, followed by the Northern province with 15.8 percent, the Southern province with 15.1 percent, the Eastern province with 13.8 percent, and Kigali with the lowest rate at 10.5 percent.

In a televised interview that President Kagame did on Liberation Day, July 4, he talked about the significance of avoiding excessive alcohol consumption and making thoughtful dietary decisions.










TURKISH PRESIDENT MANTAINS HIS STAND OF EU MEMEBERSHIP FOR SWEDEN'S NATO MEMEBERSHIP.

11:20, 2023-07-12

Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has set aside his veto against Sweden’s application to join the NATO.




After months of delays and difficult talks, he said he will recommend to his parliament that Stockholm's bid to join the military alliance goes ahead.

Speaking ahead of the NATO summit in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, the alliance’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, said Erdogan has agreed to work closely with the Grand National Assembly (Turkey's parliament) to ensure ratification.










Describing the move as an "historic step", Stoltenberg said the move will make NATO allies stronger and safer.

"This is good for Sweden, Sweden will become a full member of the alliance. It's good for Turkey because Turkey is NATO ally that will benefit from a stronger NATO.

Both Sweden and Finland applied for NATO membership last year, abandoning their decades-long policies of military non-alignment, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Erdogan had stalled Sweden’s NATO accession, saying Stockholm was failing to crack down on Kurdish militants, which Ankara considers "terrorists", and a threat to its national security.




Ahead of the NATO summit, the Turkish president had said his country would support Sweden's bid to join NATO if the European Union opened membership talks for Turkey. 

Brussels quickly reiterated that joining NATO and joining the EU are two very different procedures. But EU Council president, Charles Michel, later tweeted that the Union's relations with Turkey have been “re-energised".




US PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN BREACHES PROTOCOL WITH KING CHARLES III.

12:08, 2023-07-11

On Monday 10 July, King Charles welcomed the president at Windsor Castle for their first formal meeting since the British ruler’s coronation in May.




The reunion saw Charles greet Biden at his car outside, with the pair shaking hands before making their way up to a platform to watch a band play each country’s national anthem. At one point during the meeting, Biden could be seen placing his hand on the ruler’s back.




The gesture prompted speculation that the US president had broken royal protocol, as protocol experts have previously warned against initiating “personal physical contact with a member of the royal family” unless they do so first.




“Best not to initiate personal physical contact with a member of the royal family. Again, it may be that they offered to give you a hug or to put their arm around you, but usually wait and see what’s expected or what’s appropriate for the event,” Lucy Hume, the associate director at Debrett’s, a professional coaching company founded in 1769, previously told.




However King Charles III reportedly did not mind that President Joe Biden “broke royal protocol” when he patted the monarch on the back during their meeting at Windsor Castle but instead took it as a warm gesture from the fellow elder.




ECOWAS CHOOSE TINUBU FOR THEIR NEXT CHAIR.

11:20, 2023-07-11

West African regional bloc ECOWAS has chosen Nigerian President Bola Tinubu as its new chairman at a time of deepening insecurity, including military coups and terrorism, in the region.




Tinubu said he would focus on fighting growing insecurity and terrorism in West Africa and promoting democracy among member states after a series of military coups.

The ECOWAS heads of state meeting held in Guinea-Bissau was Bola Tinubu's first engagement with counterparts in the region since he became Nigeria's president in May.

West African leaders chose Tinubu as the regional bloc's chair for the next year, taking over from Guinea-Bissau's Umaro Sissoco Embalo.

Senator Iroegbu, the founder of security magazine, The Global Sentinel, said Tinubu's selection was not a surprise.







However, Iroegbu said Tinubu's appointment as ECOWAS chief may be poorly timed, as the new president’s political opponents in Nigeria are still challenging his election victory in court.

"People had expected they should wait for the conclusion of the electoral petition tribunal,” Iroegbu said. “By law he's the president, he has been sworn in, but the legitimacy of the victory is still being challenged. These are the kinds of things that give room to instability because of disaffection, we know what happened in Guinea."

The Guinean military overthrew President Alpha Conde in September 2021, a year after opponents rejected his reelection.

Mali and Burkina Faso have also seen military coups in the last three years. In his remarks Sunday, Tinubu pledged to prioritize democratic stability, saying "we will not accept coup after coup in West Africa again."

Tinubu said the threat to peace and security in the region has reached an alarming level and called for joint regional counterterrorism measures.




OUT OF 3000 PEOPLE 1 IS THE ONLY PROFFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANT IN RWNDA - ICPAR

11:01, 2023-07-11

In instance where Rwanda is positioning herself to be Africa's regional business and investment hub, there has been a discovery that there's a deficit in professional accountants in the country.

Research showed that out of 3000 people 1 is the only professional accountant.




It's from this background that the Institute of certified public accountants of Rwanda (ICPAR) organised a three day seminar to bring together all public accountants in the District of Rubavu.

This was mainly to bring together accountants, private sector players, public servants and all contributors to the business growth in Rwanda.




The Vice Chancellor of the University Rwanda in charge of administration Prof. Raymond Ndikumana, was among the participants that acknowledged that these kinds of engagements would contribute to the development of the nation according to the development goals by 2050.




He continued to say that," for Rwanda to be the investment and business hub we envision about, accountability has to be prioritized but at the moment we are still very few professionals compared to countries like Singapore, Mauritius where you find in every 525 citizens 1 is a professional accountant.

We are still lagging behind by a margin where in every 3000 citizens only 1 person is professional yet we are supposed to compete with." 




Prof Ndikumana also said that in away to create solutions the University of Rwanda has began extra programs to the courses so as the students would graduate as professionals who could work easily with ICPAR and other sector players enhancing professionalism.

Rwanda Finance Limited's Hortense Mudenge said that in the way Rwanda has put together favorable conditions that attract investors, 

"we have seen the need for more trained accountants and auditors in Rwanda as compared to else where."




To add to the voices was Amin Miramago who is the team head at ICPAR that said in order to attain a fully fledged investment and business hub in Rwanda, ICPAR as an organization have introduced professional courses such as CPA and others as away to avail them to those that want to study in the easiest way possible, they also increased the turns of attempt from two to three, they also introduced a hybrid way of attending and doing these course based on their favorable schedule using the online ways.




The ICPAR head also encouraged the organisations and government to help out their employees to study these courses in instances where they feel it's too expensive for some individuals through ways of bursaries in partnership with BRD.

GITICYINYONI–NZOVE–RULI–GAKENKE ROAD CLOSED TO PAVE WAY FOR THE NYABARONGO DAM COMPLETION.

11:59, 2023-07-10

As the Nyabarongo ii Hydro power project continues to take shape, the Ministry of infrastructure took a position to close off the Giticyinyoni, Nzove, Ruli and Gakenke road to ensure safety of the road users but also the dam contractors which is visible as away to speedup the finishing of the project.




This road that connects Kigali to Gakenke district through Musagara cell of Ruli sector and Bwenda cell of Muhondo sector in Gakenke District, will be closed as it will be flooded to pave way for the dam expansion.




This however has led to the establishment of two alternative roads to be used that include Kigali-Shyorongi-Kirenge-Muhondo centre-Rushashi-Ruli as well as Kigali-Giticyinyoni-Nzove-Muhondo centre-Rushashi-Ruli, the announcement reads.

While addressing parliament recently, Uzziel Ndagijimana, the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning said that Rwf10.1 billion, alone, had been allocated to the construction of the Nyabarongo II Hydropower Plant in the 2023/24 fiscal year. ﻿﻿The power plant is being constructed with the support of the Chinese government, he said.

11:02, 2023-07-10

The ninth edition of the Fifa Women's World Cup kicks off this month as 32 teams descend on Australia and New Zealand for the biggest tournament in female football history.




This time round the one month long tournament will be co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand. It is the first time the Women's World Cup has had more than one host nation. It is also the first time any World Cup, female or male, has been co-hosted by two nations from different federations. Australia is part of the Asian Football Federation, while New Zealand is in the Oceania Football Confederation.

Women's World Cup 2023 will begin on July 20 with the opening match between hosts New Zealand and Norway at Eden Park, Auckland. The final will take place on August 20 and will be held at Stadium Australia in Sydney Olympic Park.




Unlike the previous world cups, the 2023 edition will feature 32 teams, making it the largest tournament in women's football history, having expanded from 24 teams.




Given the expansion of the tournament to 32 teams, the format will be the same as the men's 32-team World Cups (until that changes in 2026 with its latest expansion). There will be eight groups comprising four teams each, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout rounds, starting with the Round of 16. In all there will be 64 matches played at the 2023 tournament.










US-UK RELATIONSHIP STILL ROCK SOLID SAYS JOE BIDEN.

10:45, 2023-07-10

The UK-US relationship is “rock solid”, Joe Biden said at his Downing Street meeting with Rishi Sunak.

Mr Biden who arrived by car at 10.35am, waved at the press and walked up the pavement to greet a waiting Sunak, before the pair smiled and shook hands outside No 10.




It was the American leader’s fifth meeting with Mr Sunak in as many months and sixth overall.

The pair shook hands and exchanged smiles as they posed for photographers on the steps of Mr Sunak's residence.

A discussion was then held in the garden of Downing Street and lasted just over 40 minutes.




Mr Biden will also join Charles III at Windsor Castle where the 80-year-old president and the 74-year-old king will discuss how to help boost private investment to combat climate change, a threat both leaders say is existential.




“The president has huge respect for the king’s commitment on the climate issue in particular. He has been a clarion voice on this issue,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.




Mr Biden’s visit to the UK is part of a three-nation trip that will feature a Nato summit in Lithuania aimed at showing solidarity with Ukraine in its fight against Russia while not yet accepting Kyiv as a member of the defense alliance.

WHAT'S THE TRUTH, WHERE IS WAGNER GROUP'S PRIGOZHIN?

12:51, 2023-07-06

Questions arise as Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko told press that Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Russia's Wagner paramilitary group, is in the Russian city of St. Petersburg and perhaps planning to travel to Moscow— not Belarus as originally agreed. 

Lukashenko who put a gulf of distance between himself and Prigozhin the Wagner boss when he said that neither Prigozhin nor his mercenaries were in Belarus, and it was unclear if they would ever move here.

“He is currently in St Petersburg. Or maybe this morning he would travel to Moscow or elsewhere,” Lukashenko said in response to a question from CNN. “But he is not on the territory of Belarus now.”




The comments which raise new questions about the purported deal brokered by Lukashenko last month that ended the group’s short-lived armed rebellion. Prigozhin was meant to be exiled to Belarus after abandoning the revolt and he hasn’t been seen in public since June 24, when he left southern Russia.




Also on Thursday 6th July, Russian state media released footage which allegedly shows a police raid on Prigozhin’s office and residence in St. Petersburg.

Whereas In Ukraine, a strike on a residential building in the western city of Lviv left at least five dead and dozens injured, officials said. President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed there would be a "tangible" response.

RUBAVU CELEBRATE LIBERATION DAY WITH NEW AND MODERN HOUSING.

06:41, 2023-07-05

Celebrating 29th liberation day in Rubavu district was more than just another tent and speech day where by there was a launch of a modern apartment demo project meant to house 102 families in Muhira .




The project comprising of a four-storied model village located in Rugerero Sector, Rubavu District has modern sports facilities for young people, kindergarten schools for children, livestock, animal-rearing sheds, agricultural fields, and commercial structures for business and vocational training schools. This was launched in the village of Muhiira where fully furnished two bedroomed houses were handed over to the beneficiaries by the Prime minister Dr Edouard Ngirente.




These families were also given a poultry scheme, vegetable and food garden's, a fully capacitated dispensary, modern piped water sources.

While speaking at the event, Dr Edouard emphasized the need to maintain the property, just as it was handed over to them because it was theirs to rehabilitate their way of living.




The beneficiaries happiness was complimented each with a smart phone which most of them agreed that this will help them to access information and stay connected to the world.

In the view of beneficiaries who we talked to, the village is a wonder.

Landrada Mujawingoma from Kabiza cell is now living in the new village with her grandchildren after their former house was destroyed by the recent natural disasters in Rubavu district that claimed 135 people and destroyed properties.

Mujawangoma says that she never dreamed of having a decent home in her lifetime.




“This new house is a gift from President Kagame Paul. i can only wish Long life to him who has settled me in a paradise on earth,” Mujawangoma said.

The beneficiaries in this village will be provided with foodstuffs to enable them start new life pending their business projects for their livelihood







JAPAN IS SET TO RELEASE THE FUKUSHIMA RADIOACTIVE WATER INTO THE PACIFIC.

06:06, 2023-07-05

Japan announced it will release 1.25 million tons of treated wastewater contaminated by the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean. The government said it is the best way to deal with tritium and trace amounts of other radionuclides in the water.

"Releasing the treated water into the sea is a realistic solution," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said at a Cabinet meeting endorsing the plan. "We will do our utmost to keep the water far above safety standards." A Japanese government official later clarified that details of the release need to be worked out and approved. Gradual, trial releases could start in 2 years and might take 40 years to complete.




Industry groups and nuclear scientists say other nuclear plants have disposed of wastewater this way with minimal impacts. But environmental groups, fisheries organizations, and neighboring countries immediately condemned the decision, citing the vast amounts involved. Marine scientists rose with concerns about the possible impact of the discharge on marine life and on fisheries.




The announcement was long awaited. Three nuclear reactors at the Fukushima plant suffered meltdowns in the wake of an earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011. Molten fuel debris burned through steel containment vessels and into the concrete bases of the reactor buildings. Ever since, workers have pumped water through the ruins to prevent the debris from overheating and causing further damage. They have also collected all the contaminated water: It now fills more than 1000 steel tanks crammed onto the Fukushima campus.

The only practical options for disposing of the water "are discharge into the sea and vapor release, both of which have preceding practices," concluded a governmental advisory committee made up of academics and citizen group representatives in February 2020. Nuclear power plants the world over regularly release water containing trace amounts of tritium into the environment under monitored and controlled conditions. And vaporization ultimately took care of about 9000 tons of contaminated water resulting from the accident at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in March 1979. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) "considers the disposal options as technically feasible and in line with international practice," IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said during a February 2020 visit to Fukushima.

Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) runs the water through a complex chain of filters it calls the Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS). The treatment captures 62 kinds of radionuclides, but not tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen with a 12.3-year half-life that occurs naturally in trace amounts in seawater and the atmosphere. It is extremely difficult to remove as it replaces hydrogen atoms in water molecules. Because tritium emits only low-energy beta particles, it poses a modest health risk. And the plan is to dilute the water until the tritium concentration is one-fortieth of what Japan allows in drinking water.










RWANDA SEYCHELLES TRAVELS ARE TO BE VISA FREE.

09:29, 2023-06-29

Seychelles and Rwanda signed five memoranda of understandings (MOUs) and an agreement on the first day of the state visit of Rwandan President Paul Kagame to the island nation on Wednesday.




At the invitation of Seychelles' President Wavel Ramkalwan, Kagame, accompanied by First Lady Jeannette Kagame, is on a state visit from June 28 to July 3, and will be the guest of honour at the National Day celebrations on Thursday, June 29.




The Rwandan President had a tete-a-tete with President Ramkalawan at State House. The two presidents then held a bilateral meeting followed by the signing of the MOUs and an agreement by Seychelles' foreign affairs minister, Sylvestre Radegonde, and Rwanda's Minister of Trade and Industry, Jean-Chrysostome Ngabitsinze.

The MOUs are for cooperation in the field of defence and security, law enforcement, agriculture, health, and tourism. The two countries also signed a visa waiver agreement which will allow Seychellois citizens to travel to Rwanda visa-free. Travel for Rwandans to Seychelles is already visa-free.




In his press statement, Ramkalawan outlined that within law enforcement, Rwanda has one of the best police academies.

"We have agreed that our police force will be able to use the facilities of your academies at all levels. In the same way for defence and security, Rwanda continues to play a leading role," he said.

"We realise that in the field of agriculture, Rwanda is again showing leadership on the African continent and small Seychelles would like to tap into the experience.

The MOU signed will give our agricultural field a greater hope for improvements. In the field of health, tourism, and other areas, I think what we signed today marks the confirmation of the solid relationships that we want to further," he added.




On his side, Kagame said that discussions held at State House with his Seychellois counterpart were productive as Seychelles and Rwanda are driven by common aspirations to improve the life of their citizens, working hand in hand with partners in the region and beyond.




Building on our strong bilateral ties, we intend to deepen our cooperation across strategic areas of mutual benefits. For Seychelles and Rwanda, tourism is a key driver of economic growth. Collectively, there is a lot we can do to make the sector more sustainable and resilient. Tourism creates enormous opportunities for air connectivity and commercial links bringing businesses from Seychelles and Rwanda closer together," said Kagame.

Diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in October 2010. Over the years, Seychelles and Rwanda have had engagements and exchanges as members of the United Nations (UN), African Union (AU), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Commonwealth, and La Francophonie.




In August 2013, Seychelles and Rwanda signed a general cooperation agreement which makes provision for the establishment of a Joint Commission to pave the way for more effective collaboration between the two countries, especially in the fields of health, tourism, culture, education, agriculture, trade and investment promotion, air services, information, communication, and technology.

MUSLIMS IN RWANDA GATHERED AT MOSQUES TO CELEBRATE EID AL ADHA.

15:29, 2023-06-28

Muslims in Rwanda joined the rest of the world to celebrate Eid Al Adha an event celebrated annually in the Islamic calendar to remember the act of faith by prophet Ibrahim who was willing to sacrifice his only son Ismael.




This is normally done with the act of slaughtering a healthy animal of which the meat is shard in the community. The act is regarded as sacrifice in appreciation of what God has blessed them with.

While at the national celebration led by the Rwandan mufti Sheikh Salim Hitimana, he encouraged Muslims to remember the poor, disadvantaged and elderly on such a day and extend help in whatever way they can.

While explaining that this is the time for celebration by offering sacrifices like camels, cows, goats and sheep in order to commemorate the mercy of Allah, who spared Prophet Ibrahim from having to kill his son Ishmael, he stressed that acts of kindness assist Muslims to grow spiritually as they share happiness and strengthen the bond with their families, friends and neighbors, even non-Muslims.

“As we are still in the period of 100 days of commemorating the Genocide against the Tutsis, this day of Eid al-Adha, we are reminding Muslims to keep in mind that it’s our responsibility to be with Genocide survivors and comfort them,” Mufti Hitimana said.




He highlighted that no matter how hard it may seem, it is possible to let go of grudges and move on—forgetting the bad, despite still feeling the hurt and pain.

During this same event the Rwanda Muslim supreme council and its partners were expecting to slaughter 1,320 cows and 1,200 goats.

Which they would distribute to the needy, orphaned and other people regarded as special interest groups by the Quran.










WAGNER GROUP LINKED GOLD TRADING COMPANIES TO FACE US SANCTIONS.

11:57, 2023-06-28

The United States on Tuesday 27 accused companies in the United Arab Emirates, the Central African Republic and Russia of engaging in illicit gold deals to help fund the mercenary fighters of Russia’s Wagner Group.




The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement that it had sanctioned four companies linked to Wagner and its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, that it alleged were used to help pay the paramilitary’s forces fighting in Ukraine and undertaking operations to support Russian interests in Africa.




"The Wagner Group funds its brutal operations in part by exploiting natural resources in countries like the Central African Republic and Mali.DR Congo, The United States will continue to target the Wagner Group’s revenue streams to degrade its expansion and violence in Africa, Ukraine, and anywhere else," Brian Nelson, treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in the statement.




The State Department said the sanctions were unrelated to Wagner’s short-lived mutiny last weekend against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Moscow’s defense leadership for its handling of Russia’s war against Ukraine. The sanctions block any assets the companies hold in the U.S. and prohibit them from engaging in new deals in the U.S.




Wagner has fought in Libya, Syria, the Central African Republic, Mali and other countries, and has fought some of the bloodiest battles of the 16-month war in Ukraine, including at Bakhmut. Wagner was founded in 2014 after Russia illegally annexed Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula and started supporting pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.




The sanctions were imposed on Central African Republic-based Midas Resources SARLU and Diamville SAU; UAE-based Industrial Resources General Trading; and Russia-based DM, a limited liability company.

Russia's embassy in Washington and Industrial Resources did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Press could not immediately reach a spokesperson for Midas Ressources, Diamville or Limited Liability Company DM.

Andrey Nikolayevich Ivanov, a Russian national, was also sanctioned. The Treasury Department accused him of being an executive in the Wagner Group and said he worked closely with senior Malian officials on weapons deals, mining concerns and other Wagner activities in the country.

''TAKE ADAY OFF FTER THIS LONG WEEKEND'', SAID THE GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA TO JOURNALISTS

12:27, 2023-06-26

Exhausted! after covering a stunning march on Moscow by a small army of mercenaries? Take a day off after a "tense" weekend, Russian authorities told journalists Sunday25 June.




An armed rebellion by mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who had vowed Friday23 June to topple the Russian military leadership and began a march on Moscow, sparked the country's largest political crisis in decades and prompted many newsrooms to work around the clock.




Moscow authorities introduced "anti-terror" measures and said residents will have a day off Monday, even though Wagner chief Prigozhin suddenly aborted his revolt Saturday evening.

On Sunday, the Russian ministry of digital development also pitched in with recommendations, saying journalists and IT workers should take a day to rest.




"Saturday was a very emotional and tense day," the ministry of digital development, communications and mass media said in a statement on social media.

"We recommend giving employees of IT and telecom companies and media a day off."

The ministry singled out employees of companies working round-the-clock and media workers, who operated in regions "at the epicenter of the events," saying they needed an opportunity to rest.




"Many employees of the digital development ministry spent the weekend at their workplace," the statement said, "so we also made this decision for our employees."

Wagner's aborted revolt has left many in Russia and abroad stunned, with even seasoned political analysts confused about Prigozhin's purposes.




Prigozhin's announcement of the sudden climb-down sparked ridicule in Russia, and the latest audio message on his Telegram channel announcing he was turning around his forces has racked up nearly 400,000 "clown face" emojis mocking him to be a coward who they had hoped change would come from.

MALI VOTES IN FAVOR OF CONSITUTION CHANGE.

10:25, 2023-06-26

Malians overwhelming approved changes in the constitution on the 18 June, a referendum that saw 97% of the citizens vote ye as confirmed by West African country’s electoral commission.

The country’s military rulers and regional powers said the vote will lead to elections in February next year and then the return to civilian rule.




Turnout among the 8.4 million registered voters was just under 40%, Moustapha Cisse, the head of the electoral commission, declared.

The country has seen two military coups since August 2020, when President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta was overthrown.

Interim President Assimi Goïta said in an address that he was “convinced that this referendum paves the way for a new, strong, efficient and emerging Mali, but above all a Mali at the service of the wellbeing of the people”.




Ahead of the referendum there were concerns that the new constitution would give sole powers to the president, who will now have the right to hire and fire the prime minister and cabinet members.

Under the changes, a second parliamentary chamber is set to be created to enhance wider political representation. The constitutional changes also designate Mali as a secular state, a move opposed by some Islamic clerics.




Mariam Diop, 30, accompanied by her husband, took the opposite side: "I came to vote as a good citizen, but I am against the project. The concerns of the Muslim religion are not taken into account at all, it that's why I voted no". whereas this seemed so most Malians Like, Boulan Barro voted yes.

"Today is a historic day. This vote will change many things in the institutional architecture, social and economic life. It's a good text, that's why I voted yes, for a Mali refounded", explained Boulan Barro, civil servant.




Some of the components of this constitution are not only limited to making Mali a secular stat but also propose to give pride of place to the armed forces. It distinguishes itself above all by strengthening the powers of the president. It provides for amnesty for the perpetrators of coups d'etat prior to its promulgation, and fuels persistent speculation about a possible presidential candidacy of Colonel Goïta.

EXPEDITION TO FIND HIDDEN HISTORY GOES MISSING - TITANIC EXPLORERES' SUBMARINE DISAPEARS.

14:29, 2023-06-20

A pipe-laying vessel is at the scene where a tourist submersible went missing with five onboard while diving to the wreck of the Titanic

The ship has two remote-control underwater vessels capable of searching for the OceanGate Titan.




British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman are two of the five on board as another of those believed to be in the craft is British businessman and explorer Hamish Harding, Paul-Henry Nargeolet, a former French Navy diver who has explored the Titanic before, is also on the vessel.




This French explorer and researcher, who is also manager for RMS Titanic Inc.is the first to ever dive down to the Titanic in 1987, and is the first, in 1993, to bring to the surface 800 objects from the liner.

In an interview to Harper Collins 

published last year, Nargeolet gave details about his previous visits to the wreck:




"We go down there in a small submarine, we stay at the bottom between five, six, seven or eight hours. You don't really want to go come back up, so you use up as much of the batteries as you can, sometimes even a little more. I got yelled at several times because of that, by the way. And then, the ascent lasts about as long, so a dive can last between 10 and 12 hours."




Nargeolet recalls how shocked they were when reached for the first time the 'most beautiful part of the wreck' which is the foredeck: "You can see the anchor chains, the winches which are still polished by the water and the sediments that the water contains. For 10 minutes, there was not a sound in the submarine."

Contact with the small sub was lost about an hour and 45 minutes into its dive to the wreck site off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, on Sunday




It is thought the crew members have 52 hours of oxygen left at most, with experts warning rescuers are short of time

Stockton Rush, chief executive of OceanGate - the firm behind the dive - is also being widely reported to be on the vessel.

According to some of the experts like Simon Platts, who directed a BBC documentary episode about the Titan sub (missing vessel) last year, said.'' if the vessel was on the water surface it would be really hard to spot, for normally the sub comes to the surface and gets in touch with the mother vessel, before they both travel towards each other.''




It is a "very small thing in a big ocean" because only the top of the sub floats above the sea level, he added




The director of the BBC's Travel Show said he couldn't even spot the sub when they were right next to it and somebody had to point it out.

Speaking to the BBC's Newscast podcast, Platts also explained some of the fail safes within the sub.

He said if the weights on the sub cannot be released, they should dissolve after a certain amount of time so they should always be able to get to the surface.




Currently search and rescue operations have been launched by US coast gaurd who have enlisted their challenges as said by Rear Admiral John Mauger.

FROM TRIBULATIONS, TRAIL TO TROPHIES, REFUFUGEE ATHLETES DOMINATE IN THE SPORTING WORLD.

11:42, 2023-06-20

They say sport has the power to change lives.

What might sound like a cliche to many, holds immense truth for people like Marzieh Hamidi and Ahmad Badreddin Wais.

It was the sport that gave Hamidi and Wais a refuge from the tribulations of a life defined by war and conflict, factors completely out of their control.

However, what did give them a semblance of control over their destiny was a sport, combined with sheer hard work, grit, and a passion for their discipline of choice.

Both Hamidi and Wais are refugees, among the tens of millions around the world driven out of their homes and homelands by the evils of men or the forces of nature.

On World Refugee Day, marked globally on June 20, they shared their inspirational stories with A a jounalist at Anadolu – stories that may have played out thousands of miles apart but are equally powerful testaments to the resilience of the human spirit.




Ahmad Badreddin Wais kept alive only to Live the Olympic dream’

Unlike Hamidi, Wais, 32, is a professional road cyclist who was born in Aleppo, back when the northwestern Syrian city knew peace.

He was a university student when the civil war, which has claimed countless lives and left the country in ruins, erupted in 2011.




Three years later, Wais had no other option but to leave Syria, like all the dreamful youth taking the perilous sea route to Greece.

He was eventually granted refugee status in Switzerland, where he has been living for eight years.

He competed in the World Championship four times and acquired an IOC Refugee Athlete Scholarship, before being selected for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

Whereas Marzieh Hamidi: ‘Born a refugee’ rising to glory.

Hamidi was born into an Afghan refugee family in Iran 21 years ago.

It was in Iran that she first took up taekwondo, a sport in which she is now widely considered a rising star.

Hamidi and her family returned to Afghanistan in 2019 with high hopes, but fate had other plans in store.

“I was born in Iran as a refugee. When I moved to my country, I moved with a lot of hope. I said to myself: ‘I’m going to my country. I will be in the national team of my country’,” Marzieh told Anadolu.

In August 2021, two years after her return, the Taliban retook power in Afghanistan.

She was living in the capital Kabul, but soon made the difficult choice of leaving her homeland.

“I left Afghanistan because of the Taliban. They said that women are not allowed to study, to do sport, or to do whatever they want. They said that women should stay at home … everything was punished,” she said.

Hamidi’s coach soon told her that girls could no longer continue with their training. She saw women being barred from sports in the country and how her fellow athletes were forced to abandon all that they loved.

“When I went outside in the street and I saw the Taliban, it was more painful for me because, every day, I could see what’s happening in my country to my people,” she said.

Hamidi was evacuated to France a couple of months later and now lives in Paris.

She holds an International Olympic Committee (IOC) Refugee Athlete Scholarship and is aiming to join the Refugee Olympic Team for the 2024 Paris Games.

Her journey in taekwondo began with some encouragement from a friend at her school in Iran.

“When I started taekwondo, it felt like something that was more than just fun for me. I felt like something was going out of my body, like the stress and pain,” she said.

“I won a silver medal in my first fight. My coach told me if you continue like this, you can have a good future in taekwondo. That’s when I chose to be a professional taekwondo athlete, and I’ve given all my life to taekwondo.”

''I DIDN'T LIKE IT SEEING MANCITY CELEBRATE ATREBLE'' RASHFORD ADMITS.

12:06, 2023-06-15

Manchester United star Marcus Rashford admitted that he switched off his television after Manchester City won the UEFA Champions League.




This comes after Pep Guardiola's side displayed exceptional form this season and managed to accomplish a historic treble, a feature that has only been achieved by Manchester United in the English top tier under legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson.

While it was a moment of tremendous joy for Manchester City fans, the other side of the ''Noisy Neighbors'' was not quite happy, a feeling shared by skipper Rashford.




The English star player has revealed that while he enjoys watching football, he could not help but turn his head away when the Cityzens achieved European glory. Rashford disclosed while speaking to Manchester evening news.




"It's exactly the same. I like watching football, I like watching the best games so that's what I did. But after they win the game, I don't need to watch them celebrating and all that stuff, so yes, TV off!" said Marcus.




The Man United forward however acknowledged that he was inspired to work harder , because every team that shows consistence and discipline in the game will surely go ahead to win trophies which was the case for the neighbors at City.

Rashford  who put on a stellar performance for Manchester United this season, scored an impressive 17 goals and provided five assists in 35 Premier League appearances for the Red Devils this term.

Across all competitions, he shelved up 30 goals and 11 assists in 56 appearances during the 2022/23 campaign.




The number 10 has affirmed that he is completely committed to The Three Lions after an impressive campaign in the 2022/23 Premier League season.

While admitting that he needs a short recovery period, the English forward remains confident about the upcoming England fixtures, apart from potential injury risks.

While speaking to BBC Sport, the Manchester United forward dismissed criticism over his trip to the United States and said :




"I need time to switch off and recover. I took a short trip, four days, then went back to do rehab and just try and get ready as soon as possible. With injuries, you can't predict when they're going to happen. Occasionally you do get impact injuries." He said.




"I know that I'm committed to it [England] 100%. People are going to say what they're going to say. It doesn't really bother me."

11:03, 2023-06-15

Mchezo Limited - a Rwanda-based company announced on Tuesday 15th JUNE, the launch of its global headquarters in Kigali to turbocharge its business growth plans for Africa.

The company, which owns the most known gaming brand betPawa in Africa, says the move is geared at better positioning it to pursue and consolidate partnerships in sports, technology,

financial inclusion and community empowerment of the continent.

The move which drew it's foundation from the successes achieved so far by betPawa through its sponsorships and projects, that include being the official headline sponsor of Ghana’s

betPawa Premier League and the community-based Dream Maker campaign in Zambia,

Tanzania, Ghana and Kenya among others.




Mchezo Managing Director for Africa, Ntoudi Mouyelo said the launch of the Rwanda

headquarters shows the company’s confidence in the country and potential of the continent.

This is in line with the company’s efforts to create opportunities and a long-lasting positive

impact by playing its part in supporting a vibrant sports ecosystem, technology advancement in

financial inclusion, innovations and investing in communities.




Mchezo looks forward to capitalising on the fast-rising adoption of technology and financial services in Africa to promote and expand the sports sector.

policies that power the Africa-rising concept. We are here to amplify potential in sports investment, talent development, responsible gaming, and technological innovation for

Africa, Mouyelo added.




The region has been often spotted to have a lot of investment potential to spur job creation, innovation and technological advancement which if harnessed can support sustainable economic growth, without erasing the fact that sport can be a key driver to achieving this.

Following the launch of the Kigali headquarters, Mchezo will also launch initiatives in financial

literacy, sport, technology, skills and talent development as well as inclusion.

Mouyelo also hinted that the company will soon unveil two major sport partnerships to kick

RWANDA ON SET TO TRY HIV VACCINE- INTERNATIONAL AIDS VACCINE INNITIATIVE SAYS.

11:23, 2023-06-14

The trial process that began in 2021 involving Rwanda and South Africa has been reported to be attaining incredible progress as results continue to exhibit arrow head hope.




This trial process of an mRNA vaccine for HIV in Rwanda is known to be sponsored by a global non profit organisation called the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), which has had a couple of parteners on deck to make this process swift and yet result oriented. Moderna's mRNA HIV vaccine being tried in the two countries is believed to have an  effectiveness of eOD-GT8 60mer, an HIV immunogen developed by scientific teams at IAVI and Scripps Research via the Modern’s mRNA platform.




The project code named  IAVI G003 was given to a trial in Rwanda and South Africa and is meant to build upon earlier advancements in HIV vaccine research that were documented from findings in the IAVI G001, a previous trial conducted in the USA which  demonstrated that vaccination with the immunogen safely induced the desired immune responses in 97 percent of healthy adult recipients all over the US.




This trial IAVI G003 seeks to test the hypothesis that vaccination with eOD-GT8 60mer can elicit similar immune responses in African populations as observed in USA’s IAVI G001.Progress insights on the first phase of the trials had triggered optimism about their trajectory as expressed by Karie Youngdahl, the Executive Director of Communications at IAVI.




"We are confident that the IAVI G003 Phase I trial is on a promising track. Earlier this year, we presented interim analysis from a related US-based trial called IAVI G002 at scientific meetings and a Moderna forum. The preliminary results from mRNA delivery of the same vaccine candidate used in IAVI G003 suggest that the vaccine candidate, when delivered via mRNA, induces immunological responses that are equally or more robust than when delivered via protein in a previous US trial known as IAVI G001," Karie said




 ‘’ In as much as all vaccinations have been administered in this phase of trial, volunteer follow-up and data analysis is ongoing, given the complex nature of the vaccination approach pursued by IAVI and partners. We anticipate conducting more Phase I trials as we refine aspects of what is believed will be a sequential vaccine regimen," she added.




There is an aim to enroll a total of 18 healthy, HIV-negative adult volunteers across multiple trial sites and these participants will receive two doses of eOD-GT8 60mer, which contains a portion of the viral sequence that cannot cause HIV infection.

Participants are monitored for safety for six months after receiving the final dose, and their immune responses are extensively analyzed to evaluate the achievement of targeted responses.




Dr. Gallican Rwibasira, the manager of the HIV Division at Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC), emphasized the significance of such vaccine trials as an opportunity for Rwanda, a country guided by scientific evidence.




"Clinical trials provide the best evidence for strategies and interventions," he said, adding that Rwanda's well-established HIV program can attract further trials and clinical investigations to support continued control of the epidemic




It should be noted that in South Africa the same trials are being spearheaded by the Desmond Tutu.

Desmond Tutu Foundation was founded by the famous South African cleric to carry out HIV research and find treatments, including a vaccine. The foundation also studies other diseases such as tuberculosis, which is often comorbid with HIV, as well as COVID-19.

Researchers at the foundation hope messenger RNA technology may provide a breakthrough in their search for a vaccine but warn that HIV is a more complex virus.







UGANDA STUCK WITH 23M LITTERS OF MILK, AS KENYAN LOCAL TRADERS DECRY DAIRY BOARD'S BLOCKADE ON MILK IMPORTS

10:36, 2023-06-13

Traders in the Central Rift and parts of western Kenya have decried the Kenya Dairy Board's blockade of milk imports from neighboring Uganda.




The local merchandisers who have been stocking mostly long life milk imported from Uganda, continue to say that the limitations over movement of the dairy products from Kampala had affected their operating margins as customers continue to demand when the milk from the neighborhood country would be in supply again.

" Dairy products from Kampala are relatively cheaper compared to those of local brands due to a lower cost of production in Uganda, consumers continue to ask why we nolonger have these products, but we aren't receiving any supply" said Edwin Ngala a wholesale stockiest in Nakuru City




Kenya was currently the leading buyer of Uganda's milk with imports valued at USD 138.3 million equating to (shs)19.2 billion.




It's said that this is action from the Kenyan industry and political wings as they continued to call on government to ban Uganda's milk and other dairy products which to them were cheap compared to Kenyan products on the market.

This move has however prompted Uganda to search for wider markets particularly in Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Zambia and the latest being Algeria.




According to Samson Akankiza the Executive Director of Diary Development Authority (DDA), processed milk stands at 35% of the country's marketed milk 




According to Uganda's media reports milk processors who include Brookside whose parent company is Kenya's Brookside dairy, said the impasse had impacted farm gate prices of milk on the back of current heavy rains in the country that had led to rise in milk volumes.




Mr Benson Mwangi who is the General manager at Fresh daily and Brookside Uganda was last week quoted by a Ugandan Newspaper saying that they had not exported a litter of milk ever since KDB started to withhold their export permits







''45 PEOPLE KILLED IN AN IDP CAMP AND THOUSANDS FLEE IN CONGO.'' SAYS THE UN.

09:26, 2023-06-13

More than 45 people have been killed in an attack on a camp for internally displaced persons (IDP) in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), according to the United Nations peacekeeping mission there.




The attack, which occurred Sunday June 11 evening into Monday June 12 morning, is believed to have been perpetrated by fighters belonging to a coalition of militia groups called the Cooperative for the Development of the Congo (CODECO). The fighters massacred vulnerable displaced people at the Lala displacement site in Djugu territor.




Local officials said that the militias are from the Lendu farming community who descended on the camps in the wee hours of the night, shooting, hacking people before setting their huts ablaze.

''some of the people were burnt inside their houses'' noted one local person.

This latest attack from the group that claims to be the guardians of the Lendu farmers, has seen tens of thousand of people flee from the underlying villages to seek shelter near the town center of Bule where the United Nations peacekeepers are currently stationed.




WORLD LEADERS, SPORTS ICONS PAY TRIBUTR TO FORMER ITALIAN PREMIER SILVIO BERLSCONI.

08:37, 2023-06-13

Italian Politicians, sports icons and world leaders are paying tribute to the flamboyant figure who transformed Italian politics and amid his widely financial and sex sagas.

The controversial self made billionaire and media magnet came to breathe his last on Monday June 12 after a long spell of sicknesses that included COVID, bone issues but succumbed to leukemia that had seen him hospitalised for most part of this year.




On hearing upon the news of his sudden demise, world leaders ,sports icons and Italian politician took to their social media handles to mourn the fallen leader. These include Vladimir Putin who closely related to Silvio in and out of politics.




“For me, Silvio was a dear person, a true friend. I have always sincerely admired his wisdom, his ability to make balanced, far-sighted decisions even in the most difficult situations,” seemingly sad Putin said.




In addition was populist primeminister of Hungary Viktor Orban who took to his twitter saying; “Gone is the great fighter.”

Whereas current Italy premier Georgia Melloni described the late Silivio as a man the wasn't afraid of anything as long as he knew whatever he was doing was right for his nation and his people.

“He was a man who was not afraid to defend his convictions, and it was precisely that courage and determination that made him one of the most influential men in Italy’s history,” Meloni said.




Joining the mourners was former Ac Milan manager, Carol Ancelotti who worked closely with Silvio as his boss that saw him to the days of Glory when he won the 2002-03 champions league, Copa Italia with the club.

“Today’s sadness doesn’t erase the happy moments spent together. There remains infinite gratitude to the president, but above all to an ironic, loyal, intelligent, sincere man, fundamental in my adventure as a football player first, and then as a coach.” Ancelotti added.




‘Obviously tremendously significant’: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken

Speaking during a news conference with Italian foreign minister Antonio Tajani, US top diplomat Blinken said Berlusconi was “obviously tremendously significant figure in the life of Italy in the political life and the public life of the country”.

He added: “I simply want to extend my condolences to his family…but also to the Italian people for their loss.”




The list goes on and on to include; Italian Dedputy premier Matteo Salvini who noted that,''a GREAT ITALIAN bids farewell to us.'' also joining in was Ex premier Matteo Renzi, fefence minister Guido Crosetto, European parliamnet president Roberta Metsola and many more others.




Silivio Berlusconi forever holds the hearts of many Italian people who he served or served him in different capacities.




IRAN UNVEILS THEIR NEWEST MARC-15 FATTAH MISSILE.

12:16, 2023-06-12

The new weapon unveiled by the government in Tehran on Tuesday is said to travel at 15 times the speed of sound; it appears to have a movable nozzle, which could allow it to evade air defences. The code named Marc - 15 missile was unveiled in a tightly choreographed segment on state TV, and no footage was released of it successfully launching and striking a target.




The new missile – called Fattah, or “Conqueror” in Farsi – was unveiled even as Iran announced it would reopen its diplomatic posts in Saudi Arabia after reaching a detente with Riyadh following years of conflict.

The tightly choreographed segment on Iranian state television apparently sought to show that Tehran’s hard-line government can still deploy arms against its enemies across much of the Middle East.




While speaking at the launching event,Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi said, they felt that the deterrent power had been formed.




“This power is an anchor of lasting security and peace for the regional countries.”Ebrahim added




General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard’s aerospace programme, unveiled what appeared to be a model of the missile. Hajizadeh asserted that the missile had a range of up to 1,400km (870 miles).




This comes as the by far greatest modern war weapon yet show cased by the Iranian government to the world as a way of no amount of intimidation would let them backoff from their extensive military hardware development.



















That is about mid-range for Iran’s expansive ballistic missile arsenal, which the Guard has built up over the years as Western sanctions largely prevent it from accessing advanced weaponry.

“There exists no system that can rival or counter this missile,” Hajizadeh claimed.

That claim, however, depends on how manoeuvrable the missile is. Ballistic missiles fly on a trajectory in which anti-missile systems like the Patriot can anticipate their path and intercept them.




RSSB STAFF EQUIPPED TO ENHANCE MORE SOCIAL SECURITY COVERAGE

10:53, 2023-06-12

workers in the informal economy should expect extended social security coverage,and a whole way improved welfare following knowledge and skills that the Rwanda Social Security Board (RSSB) staff got from the International Labour Organization (ILO).




The five day training for RSSB staff on social security administration and governance, ran from June 5 to June 9 and mainly focused on strengthening administration of the six schemes managed by the Security Board  and their sustainability. The schemes are pension; occupational hazards; medical scheme (consisting of medical insurance for formal employees of public and private sectors); maternity leave, community-based health insurance scheme (CBHI); and the long-term savings scheme (EjoHeza) which is mainly meant for retirement benefits for informal sector workers.




''The training of the personnel is a key ingredient to deliver the RSSB strategic plan 2025 to make RSSB a Member First, Data Driven, High Performing modern organization.'' Said Regis Rugemanshuro CEO RSSB




He also pointed out that this particular training by ILO, among many others, equipped RSSB personnel, especially managers with the required up-to-date knowledge and skills for efficient social security administration.




Participants in the training highlighted that it was fruitful as it equipped staff with knowledge of governance structure and mechanisms that support and promote good governance practice in key areas of social security administration and governance.




one of the RSSB staff in attendance, James Nkurunziza, said “we are going to do whatever possible to implement what we have learnt from the training, more especially in extension of coverage [particularly to the informal sector].”




In conclusion, Rugemanshuro said that the real value of the above-mentioned training would only be determined by the benefits that RSSB members will attain through the improved performance of its personnel and RSSB as an organization.







ISTANBUL COLORED BLUE FOR TH WEEKEND.

12:17, 2023-06-11

A weekend like no other for Manchester the city, that went to Turkey to mean business after an interesting but rather timid first half that saw both great European City clubs (city of England vs city of Italy) tussle it out at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium.

But later we would confirm that Manchester City deserved to be Champions, a glory that would also be added to their name as a second-half Rodri strike gave the favourites a 1-0 victory over Inter Milan in a tense final, allowing Pep Guardiola's side to complete a remarkable treble.

Rodri fired in from a Bernardo Silva cutback midway through the second half at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium to decide a game in which City were knocked out of their usual rhythm and lost Kevin De Bruyne to injury.

Erling Haaland, scorer of 52 goals this season, went a fifth straight match without finding the net, but City still had enough to edge out opponents who had never been expected to get this far in the first place




''It's a Champions League final, it was clear it was going to be difficult, for both teams," Gundogan told BT Sport. "We weren't at our best in the first half, we were a little hesitant even though we had a couple of good chances.

"We knew we had to do better in the second. I think that's what we did but it was probably a 50/50 game and just today one goal made the difference as probably many times in finals and we feel very fortunate that it was for us. The City captain added.




When asked about his deal with the club next season, IIkay Gundogan said, ''I have not made a final decision on my future yet,"




IIkay who is sought after by Barcelona, PSG, Arsenal and Brussia Dortmund is yet to know which colors he will be donned in next season in case he chooses to leave ManCity at the end of summer.

TRUMP IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW AGAIN, HIS LAWYERS RESIGN.

16:45, 2023-06-09

A federal grand jury has indicted Donald Trump again on seven charges, including conspiracy to obstruct, in special counsel Jack Smith's classified documents investigation. The former president broke the news of his indictment on his Truth Social platform tonight. He says he has been summoned to appear in Miami federal court on Tuesday 13 June.

Trump is now the first U.S president, sitting or former, to face federal charges whose root charge sheet is under the Espionage Act, his attorney Jim Trusty told the news on Thursday 8 June, as well as charges of obstruction of justice, destruction or falsification of records, conspiracy and false statements.




The prosecution side is said to have been investigating Trump’s handling of classified documents that were brought to his Mar-a-Lago Florida resort after he left the White House in 2021, as well as possible obstruction of the investigation and government efforts to retrieve the material.




The former president who wrote on his Truth Social platform that he had been informed  by the Justice Department  to appear in a Miami court on Tuesday 13 June.




“The corrupt Biden Administration has informed my attorneys that I have been Indicted, seemingly over the Boxes of Hoax,” Trump posted




This federal indictment is the second time that Trump has been charged criminally this year. In April, the Manhattan district attorney charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business.

But the indictment from the special counsel marks a new and more perilous legal phase for a former president, who is running for president again in 2024 while facing criminal charges in two jurisdictions – and with two additional investigations into his conduct still underway.




Meanwhile Two lawyers who represented Donald Trump in the months before the former president was indicted on federal charges over his handling of classified documents quit working for him. The attorneys, Jim Trusty and John Rowley, did not explain in detail why they had resigned, other than to say that “this is a logical moment” to do so given his indictment Thursday in U.S. District Court in Miami.

Trump said he would now be represented by Todd Blanche, a New York lawyer who is representing him in another criminal case in Manhattan related to a 2016 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.

IS TAIWAN SAFE; CHINESE FIGHTER JETS ARE SEEN ON THE RADARS.

12:30, 2023-06-08

Taiwan activated its defence systems on Thursday 8 after reporting a 37 Chinese military aircraft swarm into the island's air defence zone, some of which then flew into the western Pacific, in Beijing's latest mass air incursion.




Democratically governed island of Taiwan has been viewed by the worlds emerging super power as one of their territories and so has often times flown it's air force crafts over the Taiwan air space.

ANOTHER TRAGIC ACCIDENT CLAIMS ONE LIFE IN KIMIRONKO.

12:09, 2023-06-06

On Tuesday6 June, the people of kimironko witnessed a tragic accident that involved a caterpillar bulldozer registration number RAF 514A that was sloping at a steep slope towards Kigali parents school and lost control before it ramed into the near by roadside trench killing one person and injuring the operator.




''It was sloping gently until it lost control and the operator fought with it in the zigzag form until he realised a near by trench which seemed like a safer option, but then there were people on the side and it killed one lady who couldn't run.'' said the onlookers




It has been said that on realising the machine had claimed a life, the driver swiftly ran away shortly before the police could arrive.

The Rwanda national police traffic unit arrived to asses the situation and shortly swung in action with their heavy duty break downs to retrieve the wreckage and the body was taken to the morgue.

While speaking to the police spokes person CPJB Kabera, he said that the accident was very unfortunate, and that is why they continue to encourage the public to be careful while using the roads especially in such places that are considered blind spots.

''Every accident is unfortunate , because 80% of the accidents are avoidable according to all available reports, so road users should know, understand this and if they drive carefully, then we will be able to eradicate all these accidents.

People must understand that though some places are blind spots or whatever we can call them, they should be able to follow the existing laws.'' Kabera added




This comes after more than four accidents involving motor vehicles, motorists and pedestrians have occurred on the same road and the Rwanda National police continues to sensitise the masses on road safety in a campaign dubbed '' Gerayo amahoro.''

TREY SONGZ IN ANOTHER S*XUAL ASSAULT SCANDLE AND SUED FOR 10MILLION USD

15:56, 2023-06-04

R&B star Trey Songz is being sued for $10 million by a woman claiming the “Bottoms Up” singer exposed her breast at a pool party at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut.

The alleged victim said in a court filing obtained by TMZ she was humiliated and left traumatized at the “Liquid Sundays” event, hosted by the 38-year-old performer.

This comes after a series of other accusations that included a rape case of a former Las vegas University basket ball player Dylan Gonzalez and others like In 2012, he was arrested for allegedly assaulting a former Staten Island nurse at a club in Queens. The case was settled out of court.

Then, in 2018, a woman claiming Songz choked and punched her at an L.A. party won a domestic violence restraining order against him. She said the pair were “occasional romantic partners” and asked for friends and employees of the Grammy-nominated singer to come forward. However, she withdrew her lawsuit against him in 2019.

In 2021, Songz became the subject of yet another sexual assault investigation, this time in Las Vegas. Although that case was dropped in April of last year, lawyers for the most recent alleged victim say it triggered their client to seek her own justice.




The woman going by the anonymous name Jane Doe has reportedly sued Trey Songz for s*xual assault for exposing her br*asts out of her bikini top without her consent, per TMZ. He allegedly did it at the party of Foxwoods Liquid Sundays with Trey Songz event, and there’s also a video of the same to prove her stand. He did it while chanting the phrase, “T*tty in the open”. As per TMZ, the documents state that “multiple defendants should have known about his ‘s*xual proclivities and are therefore responsible for failing to keep Trey under control during the event,” which apparently took place in 2013.

﻿Songz has denied all allegations made against him.

Türkiye's new cabinet Named.

22:28, 2023-06-03

The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, announced his new cabinet after a lavish inauguration ceremony this Saturday, marking the beginning of his other five years in office with appointments intended to hint at a move towards orthodox economic policy and muscular diplomacy.

At a swearing in where he attempted to strike a unifying tone in contrast with much of his campaign, Erdoğan said: “We will embrace all 85 million people of Turkey, regardless of their political view, roots, creed or sect.”




A cabinet reshuffle as well as the return of widely respected economist Mehmet Şimşek provided signs of a potential new direction for Erdoğan’s rule, after his previous five-year term was marked by an increasingly unorthodox economic policy.

The choice to appoint Hakan Fidan, the longtime head of Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization (MIT), as foreign minister to replace tenured diplomat Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu suggests a future potential shift in Turkey’s style of foreign relations.

Fidan headed MIT for 13 years, and has had recent meetings in Moscow with his Russian, Iranian and Syrian counterparts concerning the conflict in Syria. The newly birthed AK party leader has hed all Turkish people in owe as he released his new government arm to help in transitioning all gone wrong to spear head the development of the recently calamity host country.

Here is the full list of the new cabinet ;

Vice President: Cevdet Yilmaz
Foreign Minister: Hakan Fidan
Treasury and Finance Minister: Mehmet Simsek
Defence Minister: Yasar Guler
Interior Minister: Ali Yerlikaya
Education Minister: Yusuf Tekin
Justice Minister: Yilmaz Tunc
Family and Social Services Minister: Mahinur Ozdemir Goktas
Labour and Social Security Minister: Vedat Isikhan
Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change Minister: Mehmet Ozhaseki
Energy and Natural Resources Minister: Alparslan Bayraktar
Youth and Sports Minister: Osman Askin Bak
Culture and Tourism Minister: Mehmet Nuri Ersoy
Health Minister: Fahrettin Koca
Industry and Technology Minister: Mehmet Fatih Kacir

21:56, 2023-06-03

3rd in the national league Rayon sports picked themselves up from the ashes and took on the league winners in the Men's peace cup 2023. Ready Rayon sports  has edged out arch rival’s APR FC to win the Peace Cup title following a 1-0 win in the final game.

The only winner that was netted by Eric Ngendahimana sent thousands of blues fans in a packed Huye international Stadium into jubilation in the 40th minute. This was a second attempt from Eric Ngehimana shortly after his first attempt goal was denied by linesman referee who said that it was a clear offside, a few minutes later he changed the tactics and scored the only goal for ''Gikundiro'' that was brought about by APR FC's goalie Ishimwe Jean Pirre failing to hold a sharp shot from Congolese Héritier Luvumbu Nzinga.




The win earned Rayon Sports their 11th peace Cup title in the club's history, and they will now represent Rwanda in the CAF Confederation Cup next season.

A game that was watched by thousands of fans from all over and out of Rwanda truly show cased the tittle's name.

PRESIDENT PAUL KAGAME ATTENDS THE RECEP TAYYIP INAUGURATION.

20:34, 2023-06-03

The fountain of honor joined the rest of the world's top leaders seated in the great Antuip hall in Ankara to witness the ushering in of a new refined fifth term of office of Turkey's recently elected incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

This comes as another expression of the Rwandan government moving towards cementing further relation with the new formed government of Turkey.

Turkey’s longest serving leader, Erdoğan won 52.2% support in a 28 May runoff vote. His election victory upended the predictions of most opinion polls and came despite a cost of living crisis that was seen to have dampened his prospects.

His new mandate will allow Erdoğan to pursue what have been increasingly authoritarian policies that have polarised the country, a Nato member, and strengthened its position as a regional military power.

The inauguration was followed by a ceremony at the presidential palace attended by other high-level officials from 78 countries and international organisations, including the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán and the Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency.

GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN, RWANDA CELEBRATES THE LIFE OF FOREIGN SENEGALESE PEACEKEEPER DIAGNE.

14:03, 2023-06-02

As Rwanda celebrates the life of a foreign hero from Senegal that went face to face with armed men, stood in between civilians and armed militias yet never lost his smile, most people in the world asked themselves who is Capt. Mbaye Diagne?

 Mbaye Diagne was born on 18 March 1958, was a Senegalese military officer who served in Rwanda as a United Nations military observer from 1993 to 1994. During the Rwandan genocide against the tutsi he undertook many missions on his own initiative to save the lives of civilians.

Diagne was born in Senegal, ahortly after graduating from the University of Dakar he enrolled in the Senegalese Army's École Nationale des Officiers d'Active where he completed his schooling.

 The following year, he  attained the rank of captain and was given command of the 3rd Company of the 6th Infantry Battalion where he fought in the Casamance conflict from 1989 to 1993.

That year Diagne was sent to Rwanda as part of an Organisation of African Unity(OAU) military observer team tasked with monitoring the Rwandan Civil War, a conflict fought between the Hutu-dominated government and the Tutsi-led Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF). Later he was assigned to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), a UN peacekeeping force meant to oversee the implementation of the Arusha Accords—a peace agreement designed to end the war. In April 1994 the President of Rwanda was killed. Hutu extremists initiated the Rwandan genocide, targeting members of the Tutsi ethnic minority. They murdered moderate Hutu Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and Diagne rescued her children and secured them safe passage out of the country. He then undertook numerous missions on his own around Kigali in violation of the UN's rules of engagement, hiding Tutsis in his car and evacuating them to UN installations. He also protected some Hutus and worked to safeguard the Senegalese expatriate community. Various estimates exist for the number of lives Diagne saved, ranging as high as over 1,000 according to his then confidant, BBC journalist Mark  Doyle.

Mbaye who is believed to have been on his last trip of the day from the hotel back to the Un headquarters carrying a certain message to his then commander, was stopped at a blocked bridge shortly before a mortar was launched on the location and a fragment through his rear windscreen struck his head and he died instantly. Instead of returning home in 12 weeks like earlier anticipate, Mbaye was retrieved later in a body bag home where he was accorded an full military burial.

Ever since then a couple of medals have been posthumously awarded to the foreign soldier, among them are rank of Knight in Senegal's National Order of the Lion, the UN Security Council’s Captain Mbaye Diagne Medal for Exceptional Courage, Rwanda’s Umurinzi honor, USA’s Persons Of Courage certificate, and an Italian veteran of UNAMIR created an association to "promote Diagne’s memory and support his family’s development, finally On 31 May 2019 the Senegalese Army renamed its training centre in Thiès after Diagne.

Like the Rwandan people say, ‘‘the brave never die, they rest’’, he shall forever live and be remembered by those whose life he saved and still testify for his good deeds.




ANOTHER WIN FOR THE BIDEN ADMINSTRATION: US PASSES DEBT CEILING BILL.

00:22, 2023-06-01

 A divided U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to suspend the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling on Wednesday 31st may,, with majority support from both Democrats and Republicans to overcome opposition led by hardline conservatives and avoid a catastrophic default.




The Republican-controlled House voted 314-117 to send the legislation to the Senate, which must enact the measure and get it to President Joe Biden's desk before a Monday deadline, when the federal government is expected to run out of money to pay its bills.




The U.S. is one of only two industrialized nations that separate the government’s ability to spend from its ability to borrow (the other is Denmark). In 1917, Congress instituted a maximum debt limit—often referred to as the debt ceiling—to protect the government and its citizens against a blank-check mentality that could lead to unbridled spending.

While the debt ceiling worked well as a fiscal balancing tool for nearly 100 years, it has recently become a point of contention.

What is clear is that the U.S. government has experienced unsustainable debt growth, accumulating debt far greater than what it earns in any given year. And, while most people agree that the government needs to bring its budget deficit under control, building consensus behind the best approach seems full of political potholes.




Could this be another heavy thrill sent to the Biden opposition a head of next year's run for the White House?, we keep our fingers crossed

KIGALI WATER SHORTAGE TO FINALLY BE SORTED BY 600 KM SUPPLY PROJECT.

23:41, 2023-05-31

As Rwanda is still on its way to make sure all people have safe and piped water by the Year 2024 

The Kigali Water Network Project has begun bearing fruits in addressing water shortage in the City and other peri-urban areas.




A project undertaken by WASAC in 2019 consists of constructing rehabilitating, upgrading, and extension of over 600km water supply network. 




It was implemented by WASAC since 2019 with Rwf62 billion loan from African Development Bank (AFDB).




With the project's success, places that would have lost water for four consecutive days now have water regularly according to Xavier Rwibasira the project coordinator.




Only 16 km out of more than 600 km water supply system have not yet been completed and the works will be complete at the end of June this year," he said.

To improve the network efficiency, the project interventions include the replacement of old pipes to reduce non-revenue water, replacement of small distribution pipes, increase of storage capacity and construction of pressure break tanks, and extension of the network in new development areas.

In 2021, the beneficiaries who used to face regular water shortages began to have access to clean water after two years of the project, Rwibasira and.

Approximately 398,300 people will have access to clean water in Nyarugenge, Gasabo, Kicukiro districts of Kigali City, Runda and Rugalika areas of Kamonyi District in Southern province, Bugesera District in Eastern Province, Muyumbu and Nyakariro of Rwamagana District in Eastern Province and, Shyorongi of Rulindo District in Northern Province.







CHINA BREAKS SILENCE OVER US AIR CONFRONTATION.

22:14, 2023-05-31

In this, China has blamed a US “provocation” for an incident in which a Chinese plane crossed in front of an American surveillance aircraft over the south China sea.




Mao Ning, the Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said that United States’ long-term and frequent sending of ships and planes to conduct close surveillance on China seriously harms China’s national sovereignty and security.

However their statement, the US military said on Tuesday a Chinese fighter pilot performed an “unnecessarily aggressive maneuver” near an American aircraft that was simply operating on a surveillance mission over the South China Sea.







“The RC-135 was conducting only a safe and routine operation over the South China Sea in international airspace, in accordance with international law,” it added.

The incident comes at a time of tried ties between Washington and Beijing over issues including Taiwan, which China regards as its territory, and the controversial shooting down of an alleged Chinese spy balloon that flew over the US this year.







Video footage released by the US military shows a Chinese fighter jet crossing in front of the American aircraft, which can be seen shaking from the resulting turbulence.

The Chinese plane “flew directly in front of and within 400 feet [122 metres] of the nose of the RC-135, forcing the US aircraft to fly through its wake turbulence” on Friday, the Indo-Pacific Command added in a statement.

This leaves the un apologetic China playing innocent at the base of protecting their sovereignty and defending their air and sea space

EXPERTS WARN -ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COULD RISK HUMAN EXTINCTION AS PANDEMICS AND NUCLEAR WAR

21:56, 2023-05-30

The statement that reads: "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war."

Realisation comes after most AI godfathers discovered that what seemed as the world's greatest solution holder poses threats to the human race and the threats exceeded chatGPT, chatBOts and others kinds of AIs that people saw as solution givers.




The Center for AI Safety, which published the statement, said it hoped to open up the discussion as "it can be difficult to voice concerns about some of advanced AI's most severe risks".

While speaking to Sky news today, Dan Hendrycks, the director of the Center for AI Safety said, "Humans have been the dominant species on Earth because of our intelligence. But now, as AI is becoming more powerful and more intelligent, we won't occupy that same position in the future.

Adding to the names of this warning is British computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, considered by many to be the "godfathers" of AI.

As AI is rapidly growing capabilities, similar concern from other high-profile figures in recent months have been prompted including Elon Musk who Elon Musk joined a group of experts in March to call for a six-month pause in the training of large language AI models - the type used by ChatGPT and similar chatbots.

UK GOVERNMENT- CIVIL SERVANTS CLASH OVER RWANDA DEPORTATION POLICY.

21:30, 2023-05-30

Home Office civil servants are threatening potential strike action over the Government’s Rwanda deportation policy and small boats legislation says the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union,




The union which represents over 16,000 staff in the Home Office and Border Force, said it was “going to have to consider” industrial action if members were forced to implement measures that they believed were contrary to what was unlawful.

This would be the latest in a string of strikes by civil servants, with 130,000 people walking out of 132 government departments last month over pay and conditions.




Home Office workers have already voiced their opposition to Suella Braverman’s aim of detaining and deporting anyone arriving in a dinghy, regardless of the merits of their claims, in a series of staff meetings and posts on internal message boards. Paul O’Connor, the PCS Head of Bargaining, said the union had already joined legal action against the Rwanda deal and was “ruling absolutely nothing out in terms of responses to look after the welfare of our members”.




This comes after the union has been apart of other activities that included the legal action that has delayed the introduction of the Government’s efforts to remove migrants to Rwanda to claim asylum there.

IS RUSSIA TASTING IT'S OWN WAR WORKINGS? ; DONES STRIKE MOSCOW

21:00, 2023-05-30

What is believed to be Ukrainian used American UAV beaver drones were yesterday launched onto Russia's top notch city of Moscow where officials said minor damage was caused to several buildings and two people were injured in the incident.




Russia's defence ministry said eight drones were involved in the "terrorist" action and that all were shot down - with three diverted due to "electronic warfare".

While speaking on TV, president Putin claimed the attack was aimed at "civilian targets" and promised to improve air defences, which he said had worked regularly. However prosecutors said drones were shot down over the Odintsovsky district - where Putin's Novo-Ogaryovo state residence is located.




The district also includes the Rublyovka suburb and its elite gated communities, home to much of Russia's political and business elite.

"Of course we were pleased to watch and predict an increase in the number of attacks," said Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.

"But of course we have nothing directly to do with this," he added.

The incident comes a few weeks after Russia blamed Ukraine and the US for a drone attack on the Kremlin - portrayed as an attempt on President Vladimir Putin's life.

Ukraine denied involvement as president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's evening address to the world makes no mention of the drone strike that damaged buildings in Russia's capital city yesterday.

He earlier denied Kyiv had direct involvement in the attack, after Vladimir Putin called the assault a "terrorist attack" by Ukraine.

The Ukrainian president touched on the latest barrage of strikes on his country, thanking air defence forces for repelling another night-time raid by Russian drones and offering condolences to those killed in the attacks..

KAYISHEMA'S EXTRADITION PROCESS EXPLAINED.

11:46, 2023-05-30

Fulgence Kayishema to be extradited to Rwanda after facing off with the Arusha based United Nations International residual mechanism for Criminal tribunal Says the NPPA

BRAZIL CORN OUT COMPETES US CORN ON CHINA MARKET.

11:29, 2023-05-30

Over 400 Brazilian companies are set to start exporting corn to China.

This comes in bid to strengthen the BRICS alliance which saw more Chinese companies set their arrows for Brazilian corn as compared to US expensive options.

China currently is world's top corn consumer and a member of the BRICS alliance.




According to market estimates, Brazil may export around 5 million tones of corn to China this year which is 10% of total global corn exports and 94% more than Brazilian corn exports to China as compare to 2022.




In December alone, just after China and Brazil concluded a corn trade deal, Brazil exported 1.1 million tones of corn to China. In January, almost 1 million tones were exported. “Since May 2022, Brazilian corn prices became cheaper than the US corn by US$ 0.05 per kg on average”, says Sandra Steinbach Director of the Center for Agricultural Policy and Trade Studies of North Dakota State University in an interview with Czapp.




China is ramping up corn imports from Brazil: one of the main reasons is the loss of competitiveness of the US corn? Is it cheaper now to buy Brazilian corn than the US corn?

A trend of increasing price difference between the two countries can be observed since May 2022, with Brazil’s average corn export price being lower.

Moreover, it is noted that since 2019 an additional tariff of 10% was imposed on corn imported from US by China as a measure of trade retaliation.

It is possible that the combination of higher corn export price and the additional retaliatory tariffs has made it difficult for corn importing companies in China to continue sourcing from the United States. As a result, these companies may have turned to alternative suppliers with lower prices.







THE INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS RWANDA (ICPAR), ORGANISES THE 2ND PUBLIC SECTOR ACCOUNTABILITY TRAINING FORUM.

12:03, 2023-05-29

The 3 day event that took place in Rutsizi district, organized by ICPAR and the Ministry of Finance attracted many public accountants from different and various places from all over Rwanda.




while speaking at the event, the auditor genral Mr Kamuhire Alexis, continued to request accountants to be vigilant with the way government funds are used, because it was them at the fore front of this role.




Still at the event Mr Kamuhire gave an example of how government was incurring losses in court cases due to lack of vigilance by public accountants, he gave an example of RAB, in the districts of Nyanza and Gisagara where the government had lost a case in the courts of law due to a mis-guided procedure of tailored by accountants in those places.It's from this scenario that he guided all participants to always be keen on all the prerequisites of tenders or awarding contracts.




When asked what they had learned in the training different accountants had said they were glad to have participated in the forum and had acquired new tactics to manage work easily and efficiently.

"From the auditor general's report we got to understand that government resources are issued so as to provide the citizens with proper service, and if we mismanage them, it means some institutions will incur losses and thus not avili9ng proper service delivery"

Ndamukunda Eddy Grace said




This training forum was happening for the second time, with ICPAR'S intention to fully enhance the the quality of work delivered by some of their members and reduction of losses incurred by the public sector.

06:31, 2023-05-29

The tactical Al Ahly waited for the dying minutes of the 3rd and 4th quarter to go all out to kill the game against AS Douanes after they had gone to the locker room first with 17-10 on the score board and later with a slim 38-33 lead, Corey Webster and Ehab Amin converting two three-points for a 57-44 lead in the third quarter, where AS Douanes couldn’t respond.

"He's a player that out plays you 30 plus minutes per game.. he scores over 20 points…and is by far, if not, the best player in the tournament. We knew the key was to stop and attack him,”Ehab Amin said. 

Nuni Omot led the way for Al Ahly, finishing with a game-high of 22 points and Corey Webster added 13 points off the bench. 




At the center stage of more than 7000+ fans, Al Ahly concluded their 2023 BAL campaign with an overall record of 7-1, and the final win earning them a right to represent Africa at the next edition of

''TURKEY HAS WON'' SAYS RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN.

05:51, 2023-05-29

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of the AK party has won another five years in power in Turkey's run off election,

The supreme election council by today morning confirmed that the Edogan had  won by 52% of the votes, with his secular rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu garnering a stunning 48% trial , however he says the election was the most unfair in the history of turkey.




Erdogan who became Turkish prime minister in 2003, has been president since 2014.

In his victory speech to thousands of supporters in Ankara and Istanbul , he said "Turkey has won".




He went ahead to thank the voters that turned out in big numbers to cast their vote, as he said this was a big milestone for Turkey's democracy but also a population's trust in the AK party's ability to stabilize the economy amid the shooting inflation and also handling better the Syrian refugee crisis that is been a rising issue over the years.

Edorgan is now set to lead for other more five years to prove himself as the right choice Turkey made.




ONCE MOST WANTED, FINALLY CAPTURED; Fulgence Kayishema

12:08, 2023-05-25

 Fulgence Kayishema is alleged to have orchestrated the brutal killing of 2,000 women, men and children at a catholic Nyange church in Kivumu, Kibuye prefecture, on 15 April during the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in the East African nation. The suspect and his colleagues are said to have attempted to burn the church down as a fast way to kill all those that had sought refuge in the church but failed and later would opt for the choice of bulldozing it down




He was indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in 2001 and had been on the run ever since, using various aliases and disguises, ever since.

The Nyange church attack is remembered as one of the most brutal acts during the 100 days of the Rwandan genocide against the Tutsi.




The Tanzania-based ICTR sentenced more than 60 ringleaders of the genocide, including three over the Notre Dame de la Visitation church massacre including the church's priest, Athanase Seromba, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2008, before the ICTR closed down in 2015, with the remaining cases being taken over by the MICT.










ONCE ALLY NOW OPPONENT, RON DeSANTIS SET TO RUN AGAINST TRUMP IN BID FOR THE REPUBLICAN FLAG.

11:34, 2023-05-25

A former ally of president Trump, Ron DeSantis announces his bid for president on twitter amid a glitch session that was hosted by the Twitter boss himself Elon Musk.

What had been as an awaited announcement turned out to be a momentum of his ridicule by his radicle opponents' (Trump) supporters, with some of them going heads on with tweets.




“Ron DeSantis’ botched campaign announcement is another example of why he is just not ready for the job. The stakes are too high, and the fight to save America is too critical to gamble on a first-timer who is clearly not ready for prime time,” said Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Make America Great Again Inc., Trump’s super PAC.




However the unbothered DeSantis, in his opening address to listeners, painted a dark picture of a country he said is going in the wrong direction under Biden and urged Republicans to get behind him.

“My pledge to you is this: If you nominate me you can set your clock to January 20, 2025, at high noon because on the west side of the US Capitol, I will be taking the oath of office as the 47th president of the United States,” DeSantis said. “No excuses, I will get the job done.”




This sets a fertile play area in the Republican camp as the former president has treated DeSantis, whom he once endorsed for Florida governor, as his top foe for months, assailing him regularly on social media and in interviews. A super PAC aligned with Trump has spent millions attacking DeSantis on national television, setting expectations for a bruising primary between the two former allies.




ANOTHER COMPLAINT TO ICC AGAINST RWANDA ARMY, M23 REBELS IS FILED BY DRC.

12:01, 2023-05-24

With a series of failure to provide circumstantial evidence, the Democratic Republic of the Congo yesterday made another formal referral to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to ensure the court will focus on the alleged systematic pillaging of its natural resources in the country’s east by the Rwanda Defense Force (RDF) and the M23 rebel group.




“The government of the DRC remains deeply concerned about the suffering of the populations in the part of its territory affected by the acts referred to in this case,” the Congolese Justice Ministry claimed in a statement.

The goal of this referral is to investigate and prosecute any person involved in human rights violations between 2022 and 2023, it added.




Kinshasa continues to accuse neighbouring Rwanda of backing the M23, however there is continuing ICC investigation into eastern DRC – since 2004 – and it is unclear if the new referral would shift the court’s focus.

To date, the ICC has convicted three different Congolese militia leaders – one for war crimes and the others for war crimes and crimes against humanity – for their roles in atrocities committed in the eastern DRC.

ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan is expected to visit Kinshasa and Congolese provinces affected by rebel groups from May 28 to May 31, in away to understand the case at hand.

While at this event, Ambassador Kamanzi conveyed a message from President Paul Kagame to President Aleksandar Vučić and the people of Serbia which in the same spirit the Serbian president extended his warm greetings to President Kagame and the people of Rwanda.




This came as a golden seal unto the long awaited relations between both countries that had earlier seen, Rwanda and Serbia reaching an agreement to enhance trade relations, allowing Rwanda to import wheat and maize from Serbia while exporting coffee and tea to the Balkan state.

LOONKIITU KILLED.

08:34, 2023-05-22

Conservationists in East Africa are worried with the rate at which lions in the biggest populous Kenya are being killed. This comes after the biggest number of lions killed was registered last Saturday alone.

The Kenya wildlife services confirmed to have lost over ten lions in just the previous week including the oldest of Africa Loonkiitu, who had wondered off to un protected part of the park where he faced the wrath of the livestock keepers according to conservation organization Lion Guardians.




The organization said that the end of a drought is commonly marked by an increase in human-lion conflict, since wild prey becomes harder to hunt and livestock owners are “particularly vigilant” after losing so many animals. Kenya has been experiencing its worst drought in 40 years.

The six lions that died on Saturday had killed 11 goats and one dog, the KWS said in a press release yesterday.

GREECE: FROM MONEY LENDER'S INFLUENCE TO DEMOCRACY.

06:35, 2023-05-22

Greece’s ruling New Democracy party scored a crushing victory in parliamentary elections Sunday but fell short of winning an outright majority in a vote dominated by the cost-of-living crisis, a wiretapping scandal and anger over the country’s deadliest-ever train crash.

With more than 99% of votes counted, ruling center-right party of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, surpassed all expectations garnering more than 40% of the vote in a result he described as a “political earthquake.”

His main opposition, Alexis Tsipras’s centre-left Syriza party, suffered major losses, coming in second with just over 20% of the vote.




However, Mitsotakis did not win enough votes to secure a single-party government. The vote was held under a new proportional representation system that requires a threshold of around 45%.

Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou will now give the top three parties up to three days to form a coalition, though Mitsotakis has already indicated he’s not interested in sharing power.

“Without a doubt, the political earthquake that occurred today calls on us all to speed up the process for a definitive government solution so our country can have an experienced hand at its helm as soon as possible,” Mitsotakis told jubilant New Democracy supporters massed outside party headquarters in Athens.
