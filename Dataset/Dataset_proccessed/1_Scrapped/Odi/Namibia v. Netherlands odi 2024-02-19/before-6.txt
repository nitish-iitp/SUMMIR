In my search for a durable charging handle I figured the DS arms steel charging handle would be a good fit. I soon came to the conclusion they werent so easy to obtain.

I began searching for a durable aluminum charging handle that might as well have gas divergence built in to the design.

My toss up at the moment is:

The pri gasbuster m84 (non Ambi) has a great reputation.

Original BCM gunfighter mod 4 made now by Vltor.

I do like how the LWRC CH has its oversized steel rivets and steel latching mechanism.

The raptor has dominated the markets lately but I would like to get members take on their current goto.

I have stuck with Radian CH's for my builds and CH replacements. They just work, quality is good and I have never had a problem. A bit pricier than other CH options. Bought an Aero Precision CH for my AR10 but wasn't thrilled with how it felt in the upper, so I bought a Radian and am happy.

Might be worth a look


SilencerCo Gas Defeating Charging Handle (GDCH)
The GDCH has a proprietary design that incorporates an O-ring seal to prevent gas from escaping from the most prominent point of egress.

I’m mostly running radians, but I have a Geiselle too. Can’t go wrong with either, but I prefer the radian. I’ll probably try out the new bcm on my next build.

Mostly converted to Radian now but I really like my Badger G3 charge handles but they seem harder to come by. The Geissele Airborne is not bad either.

If I had to choose an item to wear out, I’d choose the charging handle over the upper receiver. As such I’d prefer the charging handle NOT be made of a material that is harder than the receiver.

Stick with a known player (bcm, radian, pri, even aero) and you will be fine. This isn’t the place to get tied up with analysis paralysis.

I have used and own a lot of different CHs. I keep going back to BCM Mod3/4 handles as my favorites (I like the old Vltor ones better than the current, but have plenty of both). The dual hinging CHs seem cool, and feel good, but have more moving parts - therefore more points of failure.

I have had only one CH fail, and it was the detent for the release. Ordered a new one (and some spares), and I was back in action.

I really like the Radian. The functionality really fits me. I am converting to the SD model and like the reduced gas design. I have toyed with the idea adding a bead of rtv to the back of the handle to further reduce gas but haven’t done that yet.

I just keep buying Radians. Big Bendy G's always seemed overpriced. Aero's new handle was ok when I tried it but for not much more you can just get a Raptor.

Raptor LT isn't bad if you can get over the fact it's polymer on top of metal.


None of the gas buster charging handles make a huge difference on gas to the face. A lot of your face gas comes off the port.

I’ve used so many of the different after-market charge handles dating back to the steel DPMS, PRI M84, then the wave that hit with BCM and after. I mostly have BCM Gunfighters, but every time I use the M84 Gas Buster, it just feels so much better than anything else to me.

I like the rounded PRI GB latch that doesn’t hang up on your gear like the sharper and longer latches do. The PRI just feels right, like how it should have been from the start. Radian Raptor is built very well with a nice fit/feel/finish.

Yeah I believe I'll be getting a m84 gasbuster to test against this raptor sd-sl I've obtained. Ill do want to try the bcm/vltor first Gen mod 4 eventually. It keeps whistling at me.

Yeah the raptor SD SL retail is high priced at $124-$144 plus shipping. I assume it's due to it being Suppressor optimized and the slimLine.

Typically I avoid paying full retail for Raptors. Hunt around for the best price as you should do for everything.

They (Raptors) rarely come up for sale used because they are too good to get rid of. I still have 2-3 in my parts bin just waiting for new rifles/future builds.

I hate and love these GDCH's.

Love them because they work the best when they actually work.

Hate them because the O-ring gasket falls out all the time. All 3 of my GDCH's has been replaced to the next generation due to the roll pins falling out. Even lost 1 of the latches because it fell out during a 3 gun event and couldn't find it.

IF you don't want to worry about the O-ring, the next best option for a right handed shooter is Griffin's SNACH. It works really well too. I use a SNACH in my suppressed 6 ARC and she is very gassy.

I used these and really like them. They help with suppressed rounds like 6 ARC that seem pretty gassy to begin with despite +1 rifle length tube.

For dollar value the bcm, I have them on more than a few rifles and they can really take a beating and still perform. On the 308’s the Aero ambidextrous is the best I’ve found, I’m guessing its probably the best for ar15’s as well but they cost 3 times as much as bcm, and personally I don’t care if the right lever actuates.

I did notice forward control designs modified the bcm mod 4 (now vltor) design and used steel solid roll pins on one of their models along with tapered pin holes so they couldn't just fall out. I thought that was great.

Do some of these charging handles use an aluminum handle catch or are they all steel handles that grab the aluminum upper reciever?

There are far more designs out there I've never seen than those I've used.

The Gas Buster is best I've tried at keeping gas out of the shooter's face. The 1/4" diameter round latch is easy on the fingers and minimizes snagging on gear, as previously pointed out. Plus, it is a part of AR' history, having been selected for the SPR program a quarter century ago. I've known the folks at PRI who build them for almost that long. It's a great family business that has worked closely with our warfighters for many decades.

The BCM charging handles are well designed and come to hand nicely. Great outfit with the best R&D guy I know on the staff.

I use Geissele SCH and ACH in the majority of my custom builds. Folks do seem to want ambi stuff these days. Well made, smooth designs. Bill Geissele is a first class gentleman, too

I've recently been using several Radian charging handles, as well. Another well executed ambi design.

I luckily had a backup AR with the same SiCo handle when I lost the rollpin and it's latch. For the interim I put blue loctite on the rollpins (which I don't recommend because it binds them). The 2nd gen's rollpins are so far so good but damn O-ring keeps coming loose.

Bummer. What if you coated the o-ring with a thick grease; unless you already have. It would prevent the o-ring from rolling out of its groove on dry contact. Since we are talking about the congestion of the rifle gasses too bad you can't get maximum effectiveness from "Vicks vapor rub". It's a Vaseline type grease 

Get potent whiffs of Vicks with each trigger pull

Well, the alternative is pronouncing it like an adjective that might be used to describe a similarity to a used condom. “Her face took on a jizzly countenance…”

I have a few of the POF charging handles, one Radian and a few of the PRI gas buster ambidextrous charging handles. Overall I prefer the PRI to the others. The handle's curve just works for me and they're on the larger size if you like that. I think the Radians are overhyped but an improvement over something like the charging handles Sig uses on their LT's.

The first time I lost the O-ring. Luckily SiCo gives you an extra O-ring in the package so I added blue grease (marine grade grease? that I had laying around). Worked better, than it after few hundred suppressed rounds it started coming loose again. So now I just check it all the time.
