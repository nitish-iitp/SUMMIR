ICC Cricket World Cup 2023: India vs England

India are on an unbeatable journey in the ongoing ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 and will be clashing with Sri Lanka on Thursday at Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. India have won six out of six games played so far and are full of confidence for the upcoming matches. Sri Lanka, after a crushing defeat in the last match against Afghanistan, are almost out of the race for the semifinal stage of the tournament. (Scorecard | Match Blog | Preview | Full Coverage)

India are occupying the top position in the points table and will be locking horns against Sri Lanka, aiming to maintain the streak. They have a positive net run rate and will be looking to end the knockout stage sans loss. Sri Lanka are struggling to climb up in the table and are currently holding the seventh spot at the time of writing; the hope for Sri Lanka to qualify for the semifinals is almost negligible. To qualify they need to win all their remaining matches against India, Bangladesh, and New Zealand.

Moreover, winning their remaining matches will not be enough to take Sri Lanka to the next stage of the tournament; rather a lot is dependent on their run rate and the performance of the teams above them in the table. Even if they don’t qualify, Sri Lanka will aim to finish the tournament on a high note. India on the other hand just need two more points to qualify for the semifinals - a win would ensure that. However, India will try their best to win all three remaining matches to maintain their momentum.

Head-to-head

India and Sri Lanka have played 167 ODI matches against each other, the former emerging victorious in 98 matches while the latter in 57 matches. However, in the ODI World Cup, they clashed in 9 matches, winning four each with one match remaining inconclusive.
