Australia has made a top start to the ODI series against West Indies, defeating the tourists by eight wickets at the MCG.

Debutant Xavier Bartlett led the way with 4-17 as the home side dismissed West Indies for 231, a total well below par on an excellent batting wicket.

The Australians then had no trouble knocking off the required runs, completing the chase in the 38th over — including a quickfire 65 from Josh Inglis — to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.  

Bartlett, who was picked for the series off a brilliant season for Big Bash League champions Brisbane Heat, made a perfect start to his international career, crashing the ball into off-stump with his third delivery to get rid of Justin Greaves (1).

He then had Alick Athanaze caught behind for 5 in the fourth over, as the West Indies struggled early. Bartlett made it three when he dismissed skipper Shai Hope (12), before Cameron Green dismissed Kavem Hodge (11) to make it 4-59 in the 16th over.

Keacy Carty and Roston Chase added 110 for the fifth wicket, getting the West Indies back in the game after a string of early wickets.

Adam Zampa beat Chase's defences, bowling him around his legs for 59 to make it 5-169 in the 37th over.

The tourists were reliant on the big-hitting Carty to set a challenging total for Australia, but his stay at the crease ended prematurely four overs later.

Hayden Walsh had been becalmed by the Australian bowling, making just nine runs from 20 balls when he pushed the ball straight to extra cover and set off for a run — Carty was sent to the danger end and he gave up, metres from safety as Sean Abbott's throw crashed into the stumps.

Carty finished with 88 off 108 balls after a solid innings with a string of boundaries in the arc from long-on to long-off, and a couple of big sixes on the leg-side.

The West Indies struggled to make big runs late on after Carty's departure.

Bartlett returned in the final overs and cramped up Gudakesh Motie at the start of his ninth over, as the ball skied up for an easy catch by Marnus Labuschagne.

The West Indies went after the other bowling debutant, Lance Morris, taking 59 off his 10 overs, including five fours and two sixes.

The chase started poorly for Australia, when Travis Head (4) flashed at a ball wide of off-stump, and got a decent nick to keeper Shai Hope.

Josh Inglis began in expansive mood, hitting fours - but he nearly came undone in the fifth over when his flail at a wide ball outside off flew just over point.

The new opener then took to Oshane Thomas in the sixth over, hitting back-to-back fours and then a crushing pull shot deep over the long boundary at the MCG, with 17 coming off the over.

The Australians were going well over the asking rate, as Inglis continued to hit boundaries.

He made his 50 off 28 balls, and then went on with it, as Cameron Green played an anchor role.

Australia reached 1-79 off 10 overs before slowing down.

Eventually Inglis fell to Gudakesh Motie for 65 off 43 balls (10 fours, one six). The West Indies successfully reviewed for a catch after Inglis missed with a reverse sweep, the ball hitting his gloves before looping to Alick Athanaze.

Green was joined by Steve Smith, and the pair took the game further out of West Indies' hands, cruising to victory. They put together a century partnership in 105 balls.

Green hit a couple of sixes on the way to his 50, while Smith reached his 33rd ODI half-century with a boundary.

The pair cruised in the late stages to finish with an unbeaten partnership of 149. The end came with a four from Smith, who guided Walsh wide of slip down to the boundary with 11.3 overs remaining.Green finished on 77, Smith on 79. 

The second game is on Sunday at the SCG, while the series finale is at Manuka Oval in Canberra next Tuesday.
