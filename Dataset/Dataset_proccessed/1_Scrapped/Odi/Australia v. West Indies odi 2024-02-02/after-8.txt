Bartlett ‘amazed’ at debut wickets
By
Roy Ward

Australian seamer Xavier Bartlett is stunned at his man of the match ODI performance on debut which saw him take 4-17 from nine overs.

He told Fox Cricket he was amazed at how well things went for him including taking a wicket with his third ball.

“Amazing way to start. To contribute to a win was amazing,” Bartlett told Fox Cricket post match.

That first ball seamed the opposite direction and cannoned into the off-stump and was the product of years of training.

“I couldn’t ask for much more. I was lucky it hit the stumps,” Bartlett said.

“I’ve been working on it for a few years and built up enough courage to use it tonight and, luckily, it came off.”

Bartlett also said he was still adjusting to playing with the players he had watched on TV for years including skipper Steve Smith.

“It’s incredible. I’ve spent the last 10 years watching him on TV, to be out there and captained by him - it’s surreal,” Bartlett exclaimed.

Final crowd of 16,342

One-day international cricket isn’t the drawcard it once was as 16,342 fans attended today’s match.

But those who did come along have had a fun time and I’ve certainly enjoyed the chance to sit and watch the match.

This is ending quickly

Green and Smith have both hit 70 after some attacking shots in the last couple of overs.

Australia have just 15 more runs to get.

It could be over in the next over or two.

AUS are 2-215 chasing 232.

Green makes 50

Cameron Green has his 50 adding to his return of 2-40 with the ball.

He got a rich reception from the crowd who are having a boisterous time in the bay 13 area.

Oshane Thomas has been called back into the attack, the West Indies may as well go for more wickets now as Smith and Green will only lift the run-scoring tempo from here.

AUS 2-165 from 26 overs.
