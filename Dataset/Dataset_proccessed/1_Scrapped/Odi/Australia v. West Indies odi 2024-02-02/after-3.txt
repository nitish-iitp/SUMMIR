AUSTRALIA takes on the West Indies in a three-match ODI series, starting in Melbourne on Friday afternoon. The reigning 50-over world champions meet a rebuilding side which failed to qualify for the same World Cup, but will be buoyed by an extraordinary Test win at the Gabba last week.

Both squads feature a raft of fresh faces, and Australia is poised to call upon two debutants in quicks Lance Morris and Xavier Bartlett. Allrounders Aaron Hardie and Matt Short are also set to play their maiden ODIs on home shores as part of a revamped lower order and bowling attack.

Without the retired David Warner and six recent World Cup victors, the hosts will have to find their feet quickly. Can the West Indies pull off another upset and hold their own with the white ball? We preview the series with all you need to know about either side.

SERIES SCHEDULE

All matches scheduled to begin at 2:30pm AEDT

1st ODI: Friday February 2 @ MCG
2nd ODI: Sunday February 4 @ SCG
3rd ODI: Tuesday February 6 @ Manuka Oval

SQUADS

AUSTRALIA: Steve Smith (c), Travis Head (vc), Sean Abbott, Xavier Bartlett, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Cameron Green, Aaron Hardie, Josh Inglis, Marnus Labuschagne, Lance Morris, Matt Short, Will Sutherland, Adam Zampa

WEST INDIES: Shai Hope (c), Alzarri Joseph, Alick Athanaze, Teddy Bishop, Keacy Carty, Roston Chase, Matthew Forde, Justin Greaves, Kavem Hodge, Tevin Imlach, Gudakesh Motie, Kjorn Ottley, Romario Shepherd, Oshane Thomas, Hayden Walsh Jr.

TEAM NEWS

Australia will blood a fresh top order, with gloveman Josh Inglis in line for a promotion to opener alongside Travis Head. New Test number four Cameron Green looks like being first drop, leaving captain Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne to feature at four and five.

Having debuted at number eight and opened in his second ODI outing, Short takes up the number six role as somewhat of a Marcus Stoinis replacement. Hardie then slots in alongside bowling allrounder Sean Abbott, who is the third seamer in a relatively raw but exciting attack.

Speedster Morris and recent BBL champion Bartlett come in to claim their first ODI caps, with massive shoes to fill in the absence of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood. Leg-spinner Adam Zampa is the mainstay of the bowling lineup, sure to play a role in familiar conditions.

Squad inclusions and Melbourne Renegades teammates Jake Fraser-McGurk and Will Sutherland are most likely to run the drinks in their home state, but may well earn opportunities in the subsequent two games. Both would add to the list of Australian debutants.

Also among the notable absentees for Australia, along with Warner and the three quicks, are Mitch Marsh and Glenn Maxwell. Marsh took out the Allan Border Medal on Wednesday night but is being rested alongside his enigmatic teammate, who has also made headlines of late.

The West Indies will again bring a relatively inexperienced squad as they continue their recuperation after missing the last World Cup. One eye is fixed firmly on the future, with the intention of building squad depth and exposure ahead of the Champions Trophy (2025) and next World Cup (2027).

Star man Shai Hope captains the side, which is likely to have a couple of its own debutants. Batter Teddy Bishop and gloveman Tevin Imlach are in line to earn their maiden caps, while recent Test victors Justin Greaves and Kavem Hodge have put their hands up for recalls.

PLAYERS TO WATCH

AUSTRALIA: Matt Short & Lance Morris

Having taken out the BBL|13 Player of the Tournament award, Short is primed to make a mark on his home deck. The clean-hitting allrounder may not reprise his most comfortable role atop the order, but is sure to go hard late in the innings should he get the chance. A few spin overs may also be in the offing.

Meanwhile, Morris will finally be unleashed on the international scene having spend two years touring with the Test team. The West Australian firebrand has serious pace and x-factor, which should provide his side with a necessary point of difference for years to come. Watch out.

WEST INDIES: Shai Hope & Gudakesh Motie

Much like Test captain Kraigg Brathwaite, Hope is clearly the most experienced player in the ODI setup and thus leads the team. His 50-over record is nothing to scoff at, averaging 51.32 with 16 centuries to his name and a high score of 170. He’ll be the Windies’ lynchpin.

Then there’s Gudakesh Motie. He was dropped for the West Indies’ victorious Brisbane Test, but has a good chance to reestablish himself with the white ball. While still relatively fresh onto the international scene, the spinner already has 10 ODIs under his belt for 18 wickets at a terrific economy rate of 3.81.

PREDICTION

Write off a young and inexperienced West Indian team at your own peril – that, if anything, is what cricket fans should have learned of late. But history is very much against the tourists having lost 12 of their last 14 ODIs against Australia, which won its last nine games at the World Cup. After a shock loss in the Test arena, this could be the series sweep Australia is after, with fresh faces hungry to impress. 3-0 Australia.
