England vs Bangladesh Live Score: England beat Bangladesh by 137 runs

Taskin castled by Curran off the second ball of the 49th and that ends the Bangladesh innings. They are all out for 227 and that means that England have undone a lot of the damage done on their NRR in that first match against New Zealand.

England vs Bangladesh Live Score: Bangladesh 209/8 in 44 overs

England vs Bangladesh Live Score: A six off the fourth ball of that over from Taskin Ahmed. Bangladesh playing for pride now. It is highly unlikely that they can stop their NRR from getting a big hit as well now. They need 156 to win off the last six overs.

England vs Bangladesh Live Score: OUT!

England vs Bangladesh Live Score: Wrong'un sneaks between Mahedi's bat and pad and takes the stumps. Rashid gets one as well and it's only a matter of time now.

Mahedi Hasan b Rashid 14 (32), Bangladesh 195/8 in 40.5 overs

Oct 10, 2023 5:53 PM IST
England vs Bangladesh Live Score: OUT! What a start for Livingstone!

England vs Bangladesh Live Score: Liam Livingstone brought on for the 40th over and his first delivery is an absolute jaffa! Pitches on middle and spins sharply away, it takes Hridoy's outside edge and Buttler does the rest.

Hridoy c Buttler b Livingstone 39 (61), Bangladesh 189/7 in 39.1 overs

Oct 10, 2023 5:49 PM IST
England vs Bangladesh Live Score: Bangladesh 186/6 in 38 overs

England vs Bangladesh Live Score: Hridoy has reached 38 in 58. Mahed on 7 off 21. It seems to be an excercise in match practice from here on for both sides. Bangladesh need 179 to win off just 72.

Oct 10, 2023 5:32 PM IST
England vs Bangladesh Live Score: Bangladesh 168/6 in 33 overs

England vs Bangladesh Live Score: Hridoy on 26 off 44, Mahedi Hasan at othe other end on two off five. Bangladesh's required rate has soared to 11.58 and they are still going at 5.09.

Oct 10, 2023 5:16 PM IST
England vs Bangladesh Live Score: GONE! Topley gets a 4th

England vs Bangladesh Live Score: And it is Mushfiqur who falls. Topley has taken care of pretty much any threat that Bangladesh had sans Litton Das.

Mushfiqur c Rashid b Topley 51 (64), Bangladesh 164/6 in 31 overs

Oct 10, 2023 5:14 PM IST
England vs Bangladesh Live Score: 47th ODI half century for Mushfiqur

A single off the third ball of the 30th does the job. How deep can he take this chase?
