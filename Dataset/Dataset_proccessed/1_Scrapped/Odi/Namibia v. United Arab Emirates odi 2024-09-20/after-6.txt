Namibia’s junior teams

faced physical challenges in South Africa, but

gained crucial experience ahead of future

tournaments.

Tough weekend for

primary schools teams

PHILLIPUS JOSEF

Both the Namibian under12 fifteens and under-13

sevens rugby teams travelled to South Africa over the

weekend to compete in separate tournaments in the

Western Cape.

The U12 team participated

in South Africa’s southern regional tournament, following

their earlier involvement in

the northern regional tournament this year.

The U12 team played three

matches in the A division, but

unfortunately lost all three.

Sport Wrap caught up with

head coach Brian Titus who

explained that the primary

goal of the tournament was

to give the players valuable

experience.

“We have the U13 Craven

Week coming up again next

year, so we wanted to use this

opportunity to prepare the

boys,” Titus said.

He noted a significant size

difference between his players

and their South African opponents, who were much larger

in comparison.

“The players in all three

teams we faced were nearly

twice the size of our boys, but

my players showed a lot of

character,” Titus noted.

“The boys did really well and

fought hard in every match.

Unfortunately, the results didnot go our way, but I’m happywith the exposure they got. Many of these players couldmove on to next year’s U13 squad,” he added.

The third staging of the CAF African

Schools Football Championship’s

Cosafa Qualifier 2024 will take place

in Walvis Bay, Namibia, from 11-13

October as the nine boys and girls

teams vie to represent the region on

the continental stage.

Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho,

Malawi, hosts Namibia, South Africa,

Zambia and Zimbabwe will all be represented, with teams this year again

made up of the best players from their

national qualifiers, rather than single

schools.

This means the best of the young

school’s talent in the country is eligible and this year’s competition will

no doubt add to what has been an exceptionally high standard in the last

two years.

Cosafa currently has an African

school’s champion after South Africa

won the girls competition at the most

recent continental finals held in Zanzibar in May. South Africa were runnersup in the boys competition in 2023 via

their entrant Clapham High School.

The aim is now to qualify for the 2025

finals and the journey will start for the

teams in Walvis Bay.

The boys’ and girls’ competitions

will this year both be played on fullsize pitches with 11-players-a-side, a

change from the previous two years

when the girls competition was 8-aside on smaller playing areas.

The draw for both competitions will

be made in Walvis Bay shortly ahead of

the event, with the teams likely to be

split into three pools of three teams.

It is a big step up from the inaugural

event that was played in Malawi in

October 2022. That competition had

five girls’ sides and was won by South

African school Edendale Technical.

There were six teams in the boys’

competition. Clapham High School

(boys) and Edendale Technical (girls)won the Cosafa qualifiers in 2022. Both are from South Africa.

The format moved away from individual schools in 2023, but SouthAfrica prevailed in the boys’ competition with a dramatic penalty shootout victory over Malawi in the decider,while the girls’ team beat Botswana to make it another double for the country.

In this year’s continental finals in Zanzibar during May, the winners of both the boys’ and girls’ competition each received USD 300 000 prize money to be utilised for developmentprojects within schools. Hosts Tanzania won the boys’ final 1-0 against Guinea, while the South African girls overcame Morocco 1-1 (pen 5-4).

The runners-up received USD 200000, while the bronze medalists tookhome USD 150 000.
