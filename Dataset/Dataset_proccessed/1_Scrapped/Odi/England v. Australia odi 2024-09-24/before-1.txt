ENG vs AUS Commentary
5:31 PM IST Australia, on the other hand, will admit secretly that they got out of jail. They now have a full-strength squad as well, assuming that players have recovered from illnesses, so cannot give any excuses. They will be looking to put their best foot forward come Tuesday, 24th September, 2024 and win the third ODI, sealing the series, so that they can rotate their players for the remaining 2 matches. That is a day-night game, with the first ball scheduled to be bowled at 11.30 am GMT. Our build-up will begin well in advance, so do make sure to tune in. Until then, keep browsing our tabs for all the action from the Caribbean Premier League, SL-NZ, Ind-Ban, AFG-SA and even the Legends League Of Cricket. ADIOS! TAKE CARE!
5:28 PM IST Opportunity missed by England? Or experience worth its weight in gold for Australia? Views might differ from person to person. Irrespective of the experience of Australia, England simply should not have allowed the visitors to cross 240 and while batting, given that the required rate never went up to even 7, maybe a couple of soft dismissals could have been avoided - like Smith and Livingstone. But that is why these games are for, to learn and build on their learnings. England bowled way better than the first ODI, so that is a big positive.
5:25 PM IST Victorious Australian captain, MITCHELL MARSH, says that these days 270 always feels a little bit short. Adds that it felt like a new-ball wicket and early wickets could give them a chance. At the halfway mark, he admits that 270 looked enough but he wanted more. On not able to play out their 50 overs, Marsh credits Carey for taking it deep and adds that these days, batters keep on looking to score, rather than play till the end. Overall, is happy with his team's all-round display. On Australia's experience weighed up against England's inexperience, Marsh puts it down to a challenge to playing in English conditions and how can his side keep improving.
5:24 PM IST England's skipper, HARRY BROOK, says that England bowled nicely to restrict Australia to 270. Puts the loss to early wickets in the batting Powerplay for England. Admits that last-wicket partnerships are frustrating but adds that he does not think he could have done anything differently during that stand. Agrees that his side is so inexperienced that Adil Rashid is their leading run getter in ODIs from this squad! But laughs and says that they need to learn from these games, take the positives and move ahead, sticking to their plans - attacking the bowlers while batting and taking wickets with the ball.
5:22 PM IST ALEX CAREY HAS BEEN NAMED AS THE PLAYER OF THE MATCH, for his match-winning 74 and a couple of catches. Carey says that it was a quiet winter for him and adds that he spent his rest time with his family. Adds that he used to spend time indoors, working on his game. Praises England for bowling really well and has an extra word for Josh Hazlewood for hanging in with him in that last-wicket partnership. Praises all the Aussie quicks for bowling consistently well and is impressed by Aaron Hardie. On losing his spot to Josh Inglis in T20Is, Carey calls him an exciting youngster and wishes him a good future.
