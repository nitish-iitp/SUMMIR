Pathum Nissanka

Pathum Nissanka became the first Sri Lankan batter to score a double century in One-day international format. He achieved this superb milestone during the first match of the series against Afghanistan played at Palleke International Stadium, Kandy on 9th February 2024.

Afghanistan captain Hashmatullah Shahidi won the toss and decided to field first. Nissanka looked in great touch putting pressure on Afghan new ball bowlers along with Avishka Fernando. Sri Lankan openers raced away to 90 for 0 in the first 10 overs.

Nissanka completed half-century off 31 deliveries keeping the pressure on the Afghanistan bowlers. Sri Lankan opening partnership ended with the scoreboard reading 182. The stylish opener kept the momentum going taking singles and hitting boundaries. He completed century off 88 deliveries making life tough for Afghanistan bowlers.

After completing his century, Nissanka upped the ante taking on Noor Ahmad with big sixes keeping the scoreboard ticking. Sadeera Samawickrama also provided great support to him hitting boundaries and sixes at will. The stylish opener displayed great hitting in the death overs hitting a boundary to complete a double century off 136 deliveries.
