Shahid Kapoor shares his plans post the promotions of Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya; watch

In the video, Shahid Kapoor recreated one of Virat Kohli's most viral interviews, adding his own unique charm to the rendition. Carrying a cricket bat, Kapoor mimicked Kohli's walk and gestures, delighting his followers with his spot-on portrayal. However, the real entertainment began as Kapoor humorously shared his post-promotion plans. With a mischievous grin, he announced his intention to indulge in some of his favourite dishes, setting the stage for a mouthwatering feast. From Dal Makhani to Paneer Khurchan, and Garlic Naan, Kapoor's culinary desires knew no bounds.

But the treat didn't end there; he eagerly anticipated savouring Gulab Jamun and Cassata Ice Cream from his preferred stall, promising himself a delightful gastronomic experience. As the day transitioned into evening, Kapoor looked forward to unwinding with some leisure time. He planned on watching TV while relishing packets of Fun Flips.

Talking about the film, Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya, Shahid and Kriti essay the roles of a robotic expert and a robot, respectively. With veteran actors Dharmendra and Dimple Kapadia also part of the cast, anticipation runs high for the film’s release on February 9, 2024.
