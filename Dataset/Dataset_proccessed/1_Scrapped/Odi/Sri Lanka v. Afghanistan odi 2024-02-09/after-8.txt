Afghanistan cricket team’s tour of Sri Lanka continues with a three-game ODI series with the first match this afternoon at Pallekele. The one-off test match was not much of a contest for the hosts as they won easily. The white ball cricket often brings the best of Afghanistan as we have seen in the past. They did well in the recently concluded World Cup in India and will now look to build on to it with some consistency in terms of results. The pitch at Pallekele will be difficult to bat on and there is a high chance of a low-scoring encounter. NEP vs CAN 1st ODI 2024: Rohit Paudel Shines As Nepal Defeat Canada by Seven Runs.

Sri Lanka will be banking on their spin twin, Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana, to come up with the goods against Afghanistan. Dilshan Madhushanka has done well with the new ball and remains the leader of their pace attack. In terms of batting, skipper Kusal Mendis has been inconsistent but if he gets going, there are not many attacks in world cricket that can stop him.

Rashid Khan is not available for Afghanistan as he continues his recovery post-surgery. Mohammad Nabi, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, and Fazalhaq Farooqi are integral parts of the ODI team and the trio will have a key role to play today. Mujeeb ur Rahman should enjoy playing in these conditions given the turn available for spinners.
