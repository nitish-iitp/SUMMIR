Rajinikanth enthusiasts anticipating his on-screen charisma can gear up to see him in the upcoming film, Lal Salaam, originally slated for a Pongal 2024 premiere. Following his last blockbuster venture, Jailer, the megastar's fans will be seeing him in theatres on February 9, 2024. The trailer of the film arrived three days before the theatrical release but it gives a vague idea about the film. Headlined by Vishnu Vishal, the film has an extended cameo of the Tamil superstar.

Lal Salaam Trailer: Rajinikanth plays Moideen Bhai in Aishwarya Rajinikanth’s sports drama starring Vishnu Vishal, watch

The trailer sees Vishnu Vishal, who is an alcoholic but is poised to bring his name to his village through cricket. Rajinikanth plays the role of Moideen Bhai in the movie. While the film doesn’t give any hints about how his character shapes in the movie, the trailer doesn’t leave much impact as his previous works have. “I trust in the justice system. I just don’t trust a few black sheep in the system,” says the character. The storyline seems about religious harmony in society.

The film marks the directorial venture of Aishwarya Rajinikanth. With music composed by A R Rahman, Lal Salaam stars Vishnu Vishal and Vikranth in the lead roles along with Senthil, Jeevitha, Thambi Ramaiah, Ananthika Sanilkumar, Vivek Prasanna, and Thangadurai in pivotal roles.
