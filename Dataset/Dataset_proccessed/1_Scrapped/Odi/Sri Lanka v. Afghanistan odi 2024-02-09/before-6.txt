Good things here

Our locality is exceptionally well-maintained, ensuring a clean and pleasant environment at all times, with no pollution issues affecting the area. We feel very safe here, even at night, as the community is secure and patrolled, providing peace of mind for both ourselves and our families. Water supply is reliable, with no shortage to disrupt our daily lives. Transportation is highly convenient, with cabs and public transport readily available, making commuting a breeze. The streetlights are well -placed and bright, illuminating the roads adequately for evening walks post 9 PM. Additionally, electricity charges are reasonable, and power cuts are rare, ensuring a consistent and comfortable living experience.

Things need improvement

While our locality is genrally well-maintained and offers many convenience, there are a few aspects that could be improved. The public transport system is quite accessible, the frequency of buses could be increased. The limited number of parks an recretional areas, which can be a drawback for families with young children looking for outdoor activities.
