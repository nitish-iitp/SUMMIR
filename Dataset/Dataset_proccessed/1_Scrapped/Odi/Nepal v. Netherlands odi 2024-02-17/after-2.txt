Opinion | My partner and I want to have a baby, but we can’t afford it without leaving Toronto. Is that our fault — or part of a much bigger problem?

Rachel Cairns and her partner Will Stefancic have been hunting for a two-bedroom apartment that fits their budget as they plan to have a child. The rental options are slim.

Andrew Francis Wallace
By Rachel Cairns, Special to the Star

Rachel Cairns is a writer, actor, and creator of Aborsh, a podcast about abortion in Canada. You can check out her work at www.rachelcairns.ca

Every weekend, my partner and I Google two-bedroom apartments, setting the search filter to exclude anything above $3,000 a month.

We scroll the familiar path from dismay to despair, eventually abandoning the pursuit to discuss (for the sixteenth time) rearranging our one-bedroom to accommodate the baby we hope to have.
