Afghanistan's chase was patient and controlled.

Ibrahim Zadran (39) and Rahmat Shah (62) laid a solid platform after the early loss of Rahmanullah Gurbaz for a duck.

Sri Lanka briefly threatened with Afghanistan 131-3 but Azmatullah Omarzai and skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi picked up the baton.

The pair mixed the occasional big hit with excellent strike rotation to hit 73* and 58* respectively. It gave Afghanistan a quite comfortable victory in the end with 28 balls remaining.

Afghanistan won the toss and inserted Sri Lanka but they never really got going.

Pathum Nissanka (46), Kusal Mendis (39) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (36) all got starts but were unable to kick on.

Fazalhaq Farooqi claimed 4-34 but it was Mujeeb Ur Rahman (2-38) who bagged the key wickets of Samarawickrama and Mendis which swung the early part of the game in Afghanistan's favour.

Rashid Khan bowled well but without the rewards, although his setup to dismiss Dhananjaya de Silva was a thing of cricketing beauty.

A total of 241 looked below par.

Afghanistan captain Hashmatullah Shahidi: "I'm quite happy and proud of the team. I thought we performed well in all three departments.

"The Pakistan game gave us a lot of confidence that we can chase down any kind of target.

"We started well today with bowling and fielding. And the way we chased was very professional. I'm very happy with that."

On impact of coaching staff: "They are always very positive. We worked very hard with them before the World Cup. And during matches all the staff are working hard especially Jonathan [Trott], he is always positive. He had a word with me before the game and it changed my mindset a lot."

On Rashid Khan's 100th ODI appearance: "He is a very special player. The best in the world. He is very energetic and positive. The team is full of energy when he is there."

'We were short of runs...'

Sri Lanka skipper Kusal Mendis: "I think we were a little bit short of runs. We needed 280 or 300 on this pitch. I think the bowlers did well in the first 10 overs but it was tough after that.

"There was a lot of dew which made it difficult to bowl. The ball is coming on to the bat and the pitch is getting better.

"Dilshan Madushanka has done well with his bowling. He's a young guy and good at the moment. Going forward he'll do well."

Player of the match Fazalhaq Farooqi, who took 4-34: "It's really good to have three wins in the tournament. I am happy to contribute to the team.

"I tried to find some swing but when I saw there was no swing I just tried to hit the right areas and that's how I had success.

"We have struggled in the past giving away so many runs but we have put work in the nets at bowling at the death. I had a good mind and stuck to the variations."

Ex-Ireland wicketkeeper on Test Match Special

This was the complete perofrmance right from the outset. A few eyebrows were raised when they won the toss and chose to bowl but they were outstanding in the field.

It was good old-fashioned 50-over cricket. There was no panic whatsoever in the chase. They chased it down with ease.

That is back-to-back wins for Afghanistan - and three in the tournament so far.

They still have an outside chance of the semi-finals.

What funky name are we giving this style under Jonathan Trott then?

Afghanistan have done the job quietly, calmly and in style.

This was an outstanding performance and the confidence they will take forward in this competition after winning three big matches, all against former World Cup winners.

They have put a lot of pressure on New Zealand and Australia.

Afghanistan have been so professional, calm and collected. It has been a terrific batting performance.

There's a lot of influence of Jonathan Trott and also batting coach Ajay Jadeja.

They are doing it in style and doing it quite comfortably.

Sri Lanka are a beaten side going through the motions here. They have not had the breaks with the ball, but Afghanistan have been cool, calm and collected.
