Watch out, watch out!! The gap is widening between the top four and the rest. Australia have now won 4 on the trot, while it is a second successive loss for New Zealand. The Trans-Tasman rivalry lived up to the hype and we were treated to some amazing ball-striking from both teams. We have reached that stage of the tournament where every game will carry extra significance with regards to the points table standings. Can, defending champions, England, make a comeback and join the musical chairs race at the top? For that to happen, they need to beat favourites India tomorrow in Lucknow. But before that, you can catch Bangladesh's chase against Netherlands which seem to be nicely poised with a couple of early wickets. Just switch/swipe tabs and enjoy the action. Cheers from Raju Peethala, Ramakrishnan MS, Akshay Maanay, Abhinand Raghavendran and Venky.

This was the first time that Mitchell Starc went wicketless in a World Cup match.

Pat Cummins | Australian skipper: It was awesome. They just kept coming at us and it was a fantastic game of cricket. Travis has been away for 5 weeks, first hit back in the game and the kind of intent they (openers) showed, they led from the front. It was a good wicket and at times we probably gave too much width and some really good partnerships there. Fielding made a big difference. We got about 5-6 day break now, so we will enjoy this moment and get stuck in at the back end (of the tournament).

Tom Latham | New Zealand skipper: Fantastic game of cricket, ebbed and flowed throughout the 100 overs. To come so close obviously hurts, but a fantastic game. They put us on the back foot straightaway and at that point and it was about containing them and keep taking wickets. He (Phillips) bowled well under pressure, to come and bowl 10 overs and pick up 3 wickets it was really crucial. Great to see the work he is putting in and it is paying off. The openers got us off to a fantastic start and Rachin played a fantastic knock, one of the better ones you will see chasing. It was a great effort and proud of the guys. It (Dharamsala) is a fantastic place to play cricket. Just want to say all the best All Blacks (New Zealand rugby team) can't wait to watch the final and hopefully they bring the World Cup home.

Travis Head | PoTM: Nice to be back. Nice to be contributing. Nice to get the win, got very close there, was a hell of a game. I had only had a couple of hits (since returning from injury). Obviously had a six-7 weeks off. I think so (asked if it is just about getting the confidence back on return). Few blokes found it tough out there, keep pushing with the bat. We (him and Warner) play together really well. We complement each other really well, make sure we stay connected with each other and stay with each other

18:30 local, 13:00 GMT, 18:30 IST: What a thrilling game of cricket. Absolute eye-feast and a much-needed one for this tournament. In an ideal scenario, chasing 389 - you need someone from the top 3 to get a big score, a cameo from a couple of batters and a decent start. New Zealand got all of it but still failed to get past the finish line. Perhaps you can attribute a little part to bad luck, but fielding is something New Zealand dearly pride themselves on and unfortunately for them today, they weren't at their best and it did seem to be one of the major difference between sides. Rachin Ravindra played the best knock of his life and his century ensured the Kiwis were on level with Australia (292/5) at the end of 40 overs. The untimely wickets of Phillips and Latham combined with absence of a set batter in the last 9 overs came back to haunt New Zealand. All said and done, Australia seized the crunch moments and their fielding effort too (barring a couple of blips) deserves a special mention, especially in the last couple of overs. Stick around for post-match reactions...

Starc to Ferguson, no run, that's it. Australia win by 5 runs to seal the Trans-Tasman battle. Starc goes round the wicket and bowls it full outside off, Ferguson makes room and can only smash that as far as cover...

Lockie Ferguson, right handed bat, comes to the crease

49.5

Starc to Neesham, out Neesham Run Out!! 1 run completed. A full toss outside off, Neesham slogs it to the left of Labuschagne at deep mid-wicket and the call was always going to be two no matter what. The fielder had the presence of mind this time and he fired the throw at the correct end (batting) to catch Neesham short of his crease. A desperate dive from Neesham but that won't be enough for the Kiwis as Josh Inglis acrobatically dives to break the sticks. Neesham run out (Labuschagne/Josh Inglis) 58(39) [4s-3 6s-3]

Starc to Neesham, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!
