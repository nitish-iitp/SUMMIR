At the start of the chase, the Afghanistan dug-out had split the target of 242 into phases of 10 overs each on its whiteboard. The last row stated ‘48 242’, the coaching staff asking its in-form batting group to cross the line comfortably. And the batters did not disappoint.

Despite falling behind the asking rate at the midway stage, the middle-order ensured that the Afghans got over the finish line well before the target that was set by the coaching group.
