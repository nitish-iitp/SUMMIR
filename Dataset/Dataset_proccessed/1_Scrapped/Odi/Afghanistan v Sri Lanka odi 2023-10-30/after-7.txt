More glory for Afghanistan
Rashid Khan leads Afghanistan's lap of honour at Gahunje•ICC/Getty Images

One win in the previous two ODI World Cups combined. Three already in six matches of the 2023 edition. That's Afghanistan for you, baby! They move to fifth on the points table.

Hashmatullah Shahidi has said that this is Afghanistan's best-ever World Cup. He has ensured he aces another run-chase in order to walk his talk. Sri Lanka are the latest to face the Afghan brilliance and they came fell short.

First it was Fazalhaq Farooqi, whose impeccable lines and lengths Sri Lanka failed to counter. The time when they seemed to do that, Mujeeb Ur Rahman managed to pick up two wickets in quick space to dent them further. And then Farooqi returned with his clever change of pace to wrap up the batting.

AFG

(45.2/50 ov, T:242) 242/3

Afghanistan won by 7 wickets (with 28 balls remaining)

There was hope that Sri Lanka would make a game of this. And that narration lived up almost whenever Dilshan Madushanka had the ball in hand. He first struck with a perfect inswinger to see the early back of Rahmanullah Gurbaz. Then he returned to bounce out Ibrahim Zadran, who looked set for another World Cup fifty. He made sure that the moments leading up to the fifties of Shahidi and Omarzai were nervy, with some edges not going to hand. But there was little that could stop Afghanistan tonight in Pune!

In the last two run-chases combined, Afghanistan have lost just five wickets. Just five. Nervelessness personified. Jonathan Trott can afford more than just a smile. How crucial has the addition of a relaxed Ajay Jadeja been to their backroom staff.

One thing about Afghanistan players is they know how to give. They know of the support they get in India - it was their 'home' country when they were starting off. The adulation Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan and the likes get is special. And now, like we saw after the Pakistan win, they are taking a lap of the Maharashtra Cricket Stadium. To thank the fans. To express gratitude for all the support they got. And of course, Rashid is at the front of that. Scenes!

Hashmat-Azmat fifties
ESPNcricinfo Ltd

Hashmatullah Shahidi played a wonderful hand in Afghanistan's chase against Pakistan. But he finished unbeaten on 48. Today once again he steadies the Afghan ship and brings up a half-century. Well deserved. And almost to celebrate the milestone, he plays one of the most gorgeous drives through covers off Dilshan Madushanka.

ESPNcricinfo Ltd

And then there is Azmatullah Omarzai. Made his name for his exploits with the ball in the Pakistan Super League and Bangladesh Premier League earlier this year. But quite impressively, he has brought out his all-round skills to rightly be Afghanistan's Hardik Pandya. Fantastic half-century, his second in this World Cup.

Omarzai, the gear-changer

Afghanistan are truly exploring - and making use of - Azmatullah Omarzai's batting abilities at this World Cup. Starting with the match against India, he was pushed up to bat at No. 5 and he responded with a fantastic 62. When Omarzai walked in today, the asking rate was touching five an over. But alongwith Hashmatullah Shahidi, he set about steadying the chase before deciding to flex his muscles.

Omarzai first deposited Maheesh Theekshana over deep midwicket. It was a good length ball, but he quickly went back and heaved it across just clearing the man at the ropes. In the next over from Dushmantha Chameera, he arched back to a short ball and ramped it well over deep third.

Samarawickrama drops, Karunaratne takes
Kasun Rajitha accounted for the well-set Rahmat Shah•ICC/Getty Images

Sri Lanka have many positives this World Cup. Fielding may not be one of those. They have dropped a few catches, leaked a few runs on the field. And one such effort was on display today.

Sadeera Samarawickrama is one of the safest fielders in Sri Lanka. But at backward point, he shells a chance that would have meant Rahmat Shah walked back for 62. He had sliced a full ball from Kasun Rajitha which Samarawickrama failed to hang on to.

Rajitha was disappointed. But he then bowled a cross-seamed delivery on a length on the pads. It held up on the surface ever-so slightly. That meant Rahmat was ever-so early in the flick. And it meant that the leading edge was taken. Dimuth Karunaratne at mid-on got under it and safely took it. Rahmat still walked back for 62.

Nip and tuck?

Halfway through the innings, Sri Lanka were steady. They were 125 for 2 and had two batters set. Not any other batters but Kusal Mendis and Sadeera Samarawickrama, both of whom had their eyes in. But thereon, they couldn't build on the platform.

ESPNcricinfo Ltd

Afghanistan now have a set Rahmat Shah, who crossed his second successive fifty in a chase. Captain Hashmatullah Shahidi is keeping him company. The asking rate is under five. The current rate is just where they'd like it to be. And ESPNcricinfo predictor also has them in front. Can anything possibly go wrong for Afghanistan?

Keeping a close eye

Firdose Moonda: "Afghanistan have set themselves 10-over targets as they hunt down 241 against Sri Lanka. A whiteboard in the changeroom showed their first powerplay target as 50 - which they reached for the loss of one wicket - and their 20-over mark as 100. They ended the 20th over on 87 for 2. Their next target is 150 runs in 30 overs with them targeting victory in the 48th over."

Madushanka breaks through again

Madushanka is the man yet again for Sri Lanka. He comes around the wicket and digs one in against Ibrahim, who arches back and looks to ramp it. But he does so straight to Dimuth Karunaratne at deep third. And that ends the 73-run second-wicket partnership for Afghanistan.

Rahmat-Ibrahim vs SL

It is an open secret that both Rahmat Shah and Ibrahim Zadran enjoy batting against Sri Lanka. They are the top two run-getters for Afghanistan against Sri Lanka. And what's more, they also enjoying batting with each other against the Lankans.

Ibrahim Zadran and Rahmat Shah set up Afghanistan with a half-century stand•AFP/Getty Images

In ODIs, Rahmat and Ibrahim have over 850 runs at an average close to 65 in 14 innings. Against Sri Lanka, they have added over 400 runs together at an average in excess of 80. While Ibrahim has made a name for himself with his consistently steady scores, Rahmat's form had dipped a little before he got back among the runs with an unbeaten 77 in the successful chase against Pakistan. How do Sri Lanka separate the pair now?

Wickets Dilshan Madushanka has in the first ten overs of this World Cup

Dilshan Madushanka does what Dilshan Madushanka does. Run in, bowl full, swing it in and dismantle the stumps. At the receiving end this time was one of Afghanistan's trump cards with the bat, Rahmanullah Gurbaz.

Madushanka has the second-most wickets - behind Trent Boult - in the first ten overs this tournament, and is the second-most economical bowler - behind Jasprit Bumrah - at 4.37 rpo among bowlers with at least 20 overs in the phase.

Rest in peace, Uncle Percy!
Uncle Percy waves the flag as Sanath Jayasuriya walks off after his final Test innings•AFP

In what is an unfortunate news for Sri Lankan cricket, Percy Abeysekera, popularly known as Uncle Percy, has passed away at the age of 87. Uncle Percy was a regular at Sri Lanka's cricket matches, most memorably being present at the final of the 1996 men's World Cup in Lahore that they won. He was one of the original travelling superfans, much before it became mainstream. He also was fixture in Sri Lanka's Test matches. Cricket has truly lost a fan today. RIP, Uncle Percy.

Star of the innings

Fazalhaq Farooqi picked up four wickets, alright. But Mujeeb Ur Rahman has been setting up Afghanistan's bowling show in recent times, despite having mixed returns. Which also partially explains Afghanistan unable to consistently notch up wins.

ICC/Getty Images

Here's some inputs shared by my colleague Alagappan Muthu, who did some digging:

Instances of Mujeeb going at a run rate of six an over in ODIs
2017-2019 - 2 in 39 innings
2020-2023 - 8 in 32 innings

"That is a simple measure to indicate that Mujeeb’s mystery stood him in good stead early on in his career, but not so much any more. He came into this game with economy rates of 6.9, 5.7, 5.1 and 8. He’s bounced back from that to go for less than four an over, fill almost half his quota with dot balls and pick up two key wickets."

Today, he picked up 2 for 10 in his last three overs to arrest Sri Lanka's progress. And those were the wickets of Kusal Mendis and Sadeera Samarawickrama. For the rest of the day, the Lankan batters were happy to work him around.

Sri Lanka 241 all out
Fazalhaq Farooqi finished with a four-wicket haul•Associated Press

Sri Lanka don't last the 50 overs and are bowled out for 241. Once again a few batters got starts but couldn't convert it into big scores. Farooqi marked his return to the XI - he was left out for Noor Ahmad in Chennai - with a four-for.

Hashmatullah Shahidi wanted exactly this at the toss. Make use of the dry conditions with the ball. Mujeeb did exactly that. Restrict the oppositions to a low score - which they have done. And now for the chase under lights with assistance from the dew. Will that happen?

Afghanistan are here on the back of a fantastic run-chase against Pakistan. ESPNcricinfo's predictor gives them a 63.27% chance of doing so again.

Mathews, the ODI lower-order bat
Angelo Mathews provided some solidity to the lower-middle order•Associated Press

Angelo Mathews perished for 23 off 25. It was an excellent catch to dismiss him though. Fazalhaq Farooqi deceived Mathews with a slower one. He looked to go big down the ground but skied it high up. Mohammad Nabi covered good ground to his left from long-on, kept his eyes on the bowl and kept his balance to be in the field of play.

It is a very different role for Mathews in the ODI setup for a very long time. His score of 23 was his highest in ODIs since the 87 he made against Bangladesh in July 2019. His innings today included a smart six, where he got inside the line of a Naveen-ul-Haq short ball and helped it over fine leg.

Turn up the noise
Afghanistan fans filled up large parts of the stadium as the day went on•ICC via Getty Images

The buzz in Pune has been quite something, and Firdose Moonda has this to say: "It's cooled down a fair bit here in Pune and from about 4pm, the crowd has started to fill up. The stands on the square boundaries, which were in full sun earlier in the day, are about two-thirds full and it's a sea of blue. There are loads of India shirt-wearing and a fair number are waving Afghan flags. They've been particularly appreciative of a committed effort in the field from Afghanistan, who have been excellent with their ground work. The loudest applause has been reserved for Rashid Khan, an IPL player and evidently beloved so close to Mumbai."

Helps that Afghanistan are doing well, too. Maheesh Theekshana showed his wares with the bat scoring 29 off 31 including a slap over deep midwicket for half a dozen. His partnership for the eight wicket with Angelo Mathews was worth 45 in which Mathews' contribution was 14!

The Rashid Khan conundrum

Rashid Khan is playing his 100th ODI. His bowling average in the format has just touched the twenties. He is that good. But a majority of his wickets in ODIs have come against Ireland and Zimbabwe.

2:49

Why Rashid isn't at his best against the big teams in ODIs?

Rashid did pick up three wickets against England but two of those were of the lower order batters Adil Rashid and Mark Wood - much after the game was decided. Anil Kumble, on ESPNcricinfo Match Day, explained that teams have been happy to see him off, a luxury the format affords.

Rashid's bowling average and strike rate in 2023 - 37.43 and 47 - are the second-worst in a calendar year for the spin wiz. Even today, he has an economy rate of over five an over while Sri Lanka have hovered around four and a half.

Who ups the ante?
5.78
Sri Lanka's run-rate in the last 15 overs in the men's World Cup 2023, the second-lowest among all sides

Sri Lanka have quite literally lacked the power punch lower down the order. They have fared poorer than England, who themselves are amidst a rut in this tournament.

In ODIs since January 2022, only Charith Asalanka and Dasun Shanaka have scored at least 300 runs for them in the last 15 overs of an ODI innings. Dhananjaya de Silva is yet to fire while the returning Angelo Mathews last batted outside the top six in ODIs in June 2012. Experience, yes, but in this situation?

A silver lining - Afghanistan have conceded runs at 9.56 per over in the last ten overs at this World Cup, the second worst behind Sri Lanka.

But Rashid Khan has struck for Afghanistan. He skids one through Dhananjaya de Silva to castle him for 14 off 26. Sri Lanka 167 for 5 in 36 overs.

Mujeeb makes things happen
Mujeeb Ur Rahman ended the third-wicket stand•AFP/Getty Images

After getting Kusal Mendis to slog sweep one to deep midwicket, Mujeeb Ur Rahman nipped off the second set Sri Lankan batter in Sadeera Samarawickrama. He tossed up one and landed it just fuller that good length around off and middle, and got it to skid on. Samarawickrama went back instead of coming forward - deceived purely in flight than the length - and was hurried on in his attempted flick. He was a dead duck and yet was convinced by Charith Asalanka to opt for the DRS but in vain.

Overall, it has not been a duel that has been kind to Samarawickrama - two dismissals in two innings for 14 runs in 21 balls.

The partnership between Kusal Mendis and Sadeera Samarawickrama, their fifth fifty-plus (including three hundreds) stand in ODIs

Kusal Mendis and slog sweep. It's one that he often goes to. In his ODI career, it has given him runs at a very quick rate - a strike rate of 219.14 by scoring 103 off 47 balls. But it has not really come off for him at this World Cup.

Kusal top edged the slog sweep against Aryan Dutt of Netherlands, found deep midwicket off Adam Zampa against Australia and today, once again he finds substitute Najibullah Zadran on the deep midwicket ropes off Mujeeb Ur Rahman. In this World Cup, the slog sweep has fetched Kusal 16 runs off 10 balls for four dismissals.

Nissanka's a goner
ICC/Getty Images

Azmatullah Omarzai is quite crafty. Those who have followed and watched him closely will attest to it. He is only in his initial phase in international cricket. But brought on as the fourth bowler, he began with a steady couple of overs, stifling even the set Pathum Nissanka. Here's how his first two overs went:

•

And then when Rashid Khan came into the attack, Omarzai got a change of ends. He was hit for a crisp four in the third over when he offered Kusal Mendis some width. But on the first ball of his fourth over, he managed to nick off Nissanka, who was eyeing his fifth successive half-century this World Cup. He bowled one on a back of a length around the fifth-stump line and got it to jag back in. Nissanka went for the punch but only feathered an outside edge. He was not sure he edged it - or so he suggested in his discussion with Mendis - and wanted to opt for the review but was timed out. And thankfully for Sri Lanka that, because the UltraEdge did return a spike.

He's a keeper!
Ikram Alikhil copped a blow on a finger in his right hand in the second over•AFP/Getty Images

Rahmanullah Gurbaz is a terrific batter. On days he gets going, Afghanistan's batting worries seem a thing of the past. But Gurbaz also keeps wickets. And Afghanistan wanted him to don the gloves so that they could pick an extra batter or a bowler as per the demands of the situation.

But Gurbaz felt a bit constrained. He did not say it aloud, not in the open at least. He may have said so to the team management. Or he may not have. But they understood. And in came Ikram Alikhil in Afghanistan's third match in this World Cup.

Gurbaz scored 47 and 21 when he was the designated wicketkeeper. Without the burden of the mitts, he scored 80, 11 and 65 - Afghanistan won on both the occasions he struck those blazing fifties. And suddenly, they had found the right formula.

But today, Gurbaz yet again has the wicketkeeping gloves. That is because Alikhil is out with a dislocated finger. He tried intercepting a quick throw in the second over of the match today and copped a blow at the tip of his little finger on the right hand.

But here's the good news - the official word is that the dislocated finger has been put back in place and he will be back keeping in a few overs he won't keep but will bat if required.

In the heat of Pune...

Here's Firdose Moonda from Pune: A child, who was serving as a mascot when the national anthems were being sung ahead of the Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan game in Pune, is receiving medical attention after suffering from the effects of the heat during the ceremony. The child, who was standing with Kusal Mendis, appeared to faint as the Sri Lankan anthem played out. Mendis assisted him before an official from the Afghanistan dugout came out to provide more support, and the child was helped off the field.

An ICC official confirmed to ESPNcricinfo that the child did not lose consciousness at any point and was being checked on by the ground's medical staff but that the situation did not appear to be too serious. The temperatures in Pune were pleasant in the morning, with a bit of a breeze, but rose to 32-degree Celsius with 32% humidity, with no cloud cover, by the time the match got underway.

Unfortunately, though, Dimuth Karunaratne was out lbw to Fazalhaq Farooqi after being beaten on the inside off an inswinging delivery. Against a fullish ball, he went for a drive down the ground but the ball curved in to strike him on the front pad. The on-field umpire did not give him out but Afghanistan used the DRS to get the decision in their favour. He never quite looked home against Farooqi and that brought about his downfall. So, 15 off 20 for Karunaratne on return to opening duties. What would you make of this now?

Not an open-and-shut case
18
The number of players used by Sri Lanka in the 2023 World Cup, the most by a team. In fact, they had used 19 players in the 2015 edition, that is the most across World Cups

Dimuth Karunaratne and his role in Sri Lanka's ODI setup is an interesting case. For four years since 2015, he had not played an ODI, only for Sri Lanka to not only call him up, but also give him the captaincy for the 2019 World Cup. He then played three ODIs apiece in 2020 and 2021 but Sri Lanka seemed to like what he and Pathum Nissanka as an opening combination brought to the table. There was stability, there was spunk, and the scoring rate at the top was the least of their concerns as there were other holes to plug. In fact, since the last World Cup, Sri Lanka tried 17 opening combinations with Karunaratne and Nissanka pairing playing the most with 14 ODIs (excluding today).

AP

But just as Kusal Janith Perera regained fitness and was waiting for a spot in the XI, Sri Lanka decided that Karunaratne was the man to go - with KJP's attacking game being the decisive factor. In fact, KJP showed a glimpse of his sparkling form in the World Cup warm-up game against Bangladesh before he walked out with an injured shoulder. But he was fit in time for the tournament proper and Karunaratne was confined to the bench. But in four of the five outings this World Cup, Perera was out for single-digit figures and the 78 against Australia he scored was not enough to afford him a very long rope. And so, in came Karunaratne today.

One ball's not enough for Rashid Khan to train with•ICC via Getty Images

Yep, the spin wizard is there. Rashid Khan will take the field for his 100th ODI. He was leading Afghanistan's celebration with a bit of dance after they defeated Pakistan. He is yet to set the stage alight with the ball in ODI World Cups. But he has been a perennial presence, almost a mood-lifter - or mood indicator - for Afghanistan. He has played five T20 innings - two for Sunrisers Hyderabad and three for Gujarat Titans in the IPL - at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Ground in Pune and has eight wickets at an incredible average of 15.62. Is this the venue that helps him turn his World Cup record around?

Afghanistan opt to bowl

Dew later in the evening has played a part in this decision, Afghanistan captain Hashmatullah Shahidi said. They have made one change - Fazalhaq Farooqi comes back in for Noor Ahmad. Kusal Mendis, the Sri Lanka captain, said that they anyway wanted to bat first. They have made a couple of changes - Dushmantha Chameera and Dimuth Karunaratne are in for Kusal Janith Perera and Lahiru Kumara.

Afghanistan: Ibrahim Zadran, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi (capt), Azmatullah Omarzai, Ikram Alikhil (wk), Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Naveen-ul-Haq, Fazalhaq Farooqi

Sri Lanka: Pathum Nissanka, Dimuth Karunaratne, Kusal Mendis (capt & wk), Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka, Dhananjaya de Silva, Angelo Mathews, Maheesh Theekshana, Dilshan Madushanka, Kasun Rajitha, Dushmantha Chameera

Open to change?

Afghanistan have been served well by their opening combination. Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran have been the fire and ice combo at the top with Gurbaz teeing off to rapid starts while Ibrahim goes about setting a steady platform for the middle order. They have added two century stands thus far in this men's World Cup. Firdose Moonda writes on the opener who allowed the Afghan batters to open up.

4:06

Dimuth Karunaratne could come into Sri Lanka's XI against Afghanistan

On the other hand, despite being the just, explosive combination on paper, Sri Lanka's Kusal Perera and Pathum Nissanka are yet to set the stage on fire. It has not been all dud but that is one of Sri Lanka's areas of concern, given the middle order puzzle is starting to fall in place. Will we see a change at the top for them?

Harmison: Early wickets will be key in Pune where the ball will seam more than spin

The dream of the semi-final is still alive. For Sri Lanka and for Afghanistan. Both teams are part of the mid-table logjam with four points each. A win for either of the sides will allow them to break away from the rest of the pack, only by a little, though. Sri Lanka have been dealt another blow with Lahiru Kumara, one of their chief destroyers against England, out. He is replaced by Dushmantha Chameera in the squad.
