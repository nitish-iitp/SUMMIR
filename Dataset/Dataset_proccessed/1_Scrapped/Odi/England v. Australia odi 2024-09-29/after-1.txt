England vs Australia Live Score: Australia beat England by 49 runs (DLS method)

England vs Australia Live Score: Talking about Australia, they are in a strong position to win this series now but it has not been a good one for them overall. Barring the second ODI, their seamers struggled in each of the remaining games. They got lucky in the first ODI with England throwing it away while in this game, their spinners brought them back in the game. So fast bowling, which has been their strength, did not work for them much on this tour. Don't think they have any fresh resources in the bank or any experienced personnel missing. Marcus Stoinis and Pat Cummins are the only names which flash to mind but Australia will have to wonder what is going to happen once the big three - Starc, Hazlewood and Cummins retire - and in all likelihood, at the same time. Adam Zampa was way below his best in this series, so they need to work on a Todd Murphy or maybe a Tanveer Sangha for the future. Talking about the batting, it has done reasonably well but one would have expected the likes of Jake Fraser-McGurk to be given more opportunities. There is still quality left in that department but the bowling seems to be a big worry for now.
