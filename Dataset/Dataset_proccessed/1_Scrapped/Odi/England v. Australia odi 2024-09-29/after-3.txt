England vs Australia Commentary
5:32 PM IST And with that, we wrap up this series and also the grand summer of England. With wins over West Indies and Sri Lanka and a drawn T20I series against Australia earlier, this ODI series was the only series loss for them and they will take that. They would have gained a lot for the future and would be keen on building and developing these young stars along with a blend of experience. Australia will be happy to 'get away' without too much damage but they will honestly admit in secret that they need to introspect a lot into the talent pool. While England head overseas, Australia head back home for a grand summer of their own, starting with series against Pakistan before the big one against India comes up. We are done from Bristol, but you can keep checking our page for scores from different games. Hopefully, there will be players rather than groundstaff on Days 4 and 5 of the India-Bangladesh Test while do keep a watch out for the big tournament starting from October 3, 2024 - The Women's T20 World Cup. Until then, ADIOS! TAKE CARE!
5:28 PM IST Victorious series captain for Australia, MITCHELL MARSH, is all smiles, especially having won without him in the 5th ODI. Marsh says that England were on track for a big total and credits Steven Smith for pulling things back. On Australia having so many allrounders, Mitch says that allrounders are now a trend in world cricket and his team's allrounders don't let opposition batters settle. Hopes that it continues for some more time. On the series review, The Bison says that it was a good few weeks with the bowlers and batters doing well. On the next ICC event - the Champions Trophy, Marsh is desperate to win that but for the present, is eager to take on Pakistan at home first. Is happy for the young guys who made it to the international level from this tour, praising Aaron Hardie the most amongst the lot.
5:25 PM IST England's skipper, HARRY BROOK, HAS BEEN NAMED AS THE PLAYER OF THE SUMMER. Brook is happy to get some runs on the board and contribute to the team's cause. Admits that he has not been playing too much ODI cricket, so it means a lot more to him. On this 5th ODI, losing their way from 202/2, Brook says that they are trying to build towards bigger series with a new entertaining brand of cricket, which he believes has been done well. Adds that the bowlers taking wickets throughout has helped. On things working for England, Brook has a special mention for Ben Duckett, attacking the Australian bowlers, especially Adam Zampa. Shys away from the captaincy questions, saying that it was good but he would rather have Jos Buttler handle it for the time being. Clarifies about his earlier statement on how England want to play their brand of cricket, stating that he just wants to emulate Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum's saga from Test cricket into white-ball cricket.
5:24 PM IST TRAVIS HEAD HAS BEEN NAMED AS THE PLAYER OF THE MATCH AND SERIES. Head says that he did not expect to be bowling in the death overs and honestly says that he did not expect to be bowling too much, let alone the last few overs. Details with Glenn Maxwell in the side, he is not usually required to bowl but is happy to roll his arm over when required. Feels that it was a good series for him personally, admitting that Australia could have done better, but are reasonably happy with the series win. On a personal front, Travis says that he is enjoying his form now and only wants to keep contributing. Believes that Australia are in a good space with the white ball and hope to keep sharpening their skills. Is eager to spend some time with the family and then get ready for a big home season starting with the Pakistan series.
5:21 PM IST In reply, Australia were pretty confident and started off with their usual tonking-the-ball business through their openers. Again, they got a good opening stand but this time, they did not let the opportunity slip. With partnerships of 78, 40 and then an unbeaten 47, they ensured that there was no collapse. If this match had been played like a 50-over game, maybe the result could have been different. But England were caught in two minds - whether to play for the rain or try and stall the game - initially, they wanted a quick burst of wickets to push Australia way behind on the DLS par score. But then, Head and Short's barrage of boundaries left them shell-shocked, and then England tried too many things at one time. Brook tried to shake the concentration of Australia by constant changing of bowlers but instead, his own unit got unsettled. Please stay tuned for the presentation...
5:18 PM IST End of a bizarre game. England were skyrocketing with the bat, at 202/2, targetting 500 at the halfway stage, when a dramatic collapse saw them fold up for 309. While the Australian seamers got a pasting, the spinners hauled them back, in the most unlikely fashion. Adam Zampa had gone for 44 in his first 17 balls, before he eventually got Harry Brook and that turned the tide. What surprised England though, was Travis Head churned out 4 wickets which hurt them very badly. It laid to nought all the hard work put in by Duckett and Brook, with the former reaching his second ODI ton.
