ENG vs AUS Commentary
7:36 PM IST Right then, although it ended abruptly, we witnessed another entertaining contest between these two old rivals. At the halfway mark, England found themselves with their backs against the wall, but the way they executed this chase to bring the five-match series to 2-1 will undoubtedly boost the confidence of this young English side. As for Australia, they won't want to dwell on the loss for too long as they still lead the series and they will be hoping that Travis Head and Adam Zampa are fit enough to feature in the next game. The caravan will now move to London with the fourth ODI of the series set to take place at Lord's on Friday, 27th September. It will be another day-night game with the first ball to be bowled at 11.30 am GMT. As always, you can join us early for all the build-up. Until then, take care and goodbye!
7:25 PM IST The captain of England, Harry Brook is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his stellar ton. He says that they started off with the ball very well and got some wickets as well. Further says that Australia got partnerships in the middle to push the score past 300. Lauds Will Jacks for the way he batted during their stand. Shares that the wicket got better to bat on towards the back end of Australia's innings. Mentions that the message to the batters was to go out there and play their natural game. States that it was nice to get his maiden ODI hundred and hopes that he can get many more.
7:22 PM IST Mitchell Marsh, the skipper of Australia says that they did extremely well to get to cross 300 given how hard it was to bat initially. Adds that at one stage, they thought 250 could have been ideal but getting to 300 was great. Talks about the pitch that flattened out a bit and the opposition built a strong partnership which took the game away and they will hope to do better in the next match.
7:22 PM IST Time for the presentation ceremony...
7:21 PM IST Earlier in the game, England won the toss and opted to bowl, a no-brainer given the rain on Monday and the pitch being under covers all day. With the ball nipping around, it was tricky early on for the Aussie top order. After weathering the early storm, Steven Smith and Cameron Green began to build a solid foundation, but their dismissals pegged Australia back. Enter Alex Carey, who stepped up with crucial partnerships alongside Glenn Maxwell and Aaron Hardie. Their late surge helped Australia score 104 runs in the final 10 overs, finishing with a competitive total of 304 on a challenging surface. For England, Jofra Archer and Matthew Potts bowled well with the new ball but could not quite execute their plans at the death. While Potts went wicketless, Archer ended with a couple of wickets to his name and the third seamer, Brydon Carse chipped with a wicket.
7:21 PM IST In response, Australia had to adapt quickly, and they did so with Cameron Green leading the charge with a short-ball strategy. Green was rewarded with a couple of wickets, but England maintained control of the chase, especially with Brook still at the crease. The English skipper showcased remarkable acceleration, racing from fifty to his maiden ODI hundred in just 33 balls. Liam Livingstone came out firing and ensured England stayed ahead in the run chase, which proved crucial as rain eventually intervened. When play was halted, the hosts needed just 51 runs from 74 balls, and with no further play possible, England emerged victorious by the DLS method.
