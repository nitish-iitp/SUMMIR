When the table toppers of the tournament and number four placed team –India and New Zealand – lock horns in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday, 15 November, in the first semi-final of the ICC World Cup 2023 match, fans will witness a repeat of the 2019 semi-final clash.

While Indian fans would ideally prefer a comfortable affair, given the agony from 2019 World Cup semifinal, we can expect riveting experience, given the history of the two teams.

As the cricketing giants gear up for an epic clash, let’s turn back the clock and take a look at what transpired between them in the last ten ODI meetings between them.
1. 22 October 2023 – India Won By 4 Wickets (ICC World Cup 2023)

The men in blue took on the BlackCaps at the picturesque HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala and handed them their first blow of the tournament with a 4-wicket loss. 

India started in usually alarming fashion, chasing a much smaller target of 274 runs, with Rohit Sharma hammering four sixes in a 40-ball 46 that dominated an opening partnership of 71 with Shubman Gill. After that, Virat Kohli took the baton and amassed 95 runs before being bowled out trying to hit the winning six.

For the third and fourth wickets, Kohli was the less dominant partner in half-century stands but he continued with his skillful stroke play while KL Rahul was dismissed for the first time in the tournament after playing down the wrong line against Santner and Shreyas Iyer was trapped by a short ball. A major obstacle struck when he made an error that resulted in Suryakumar Yadav being sent back, but Ravindra Jadeja allayed India's concerns by hitting the winning boundary.

Earlier in the first innings, Mohammed Shami rained wrath on the Kiwis as he finished his spell with a 5-wicket haul. For the visitors, Daryl Mitchell top scored with the bat as he put on 159 for the third wicket with Rachin Ravindra and reached an exact run-a-ball hundred in the 41st over.

5. 30 November 2022 – No Result (3-Match Series)

In the third match in Christchurch, rain played spoilsport and caused the match to be abandoned. Nevertheless, in 47.3 overs, the Kiwi bowling assault held India to 219 runs. The opening pair stitched together 104 runs in only 18 overs as they went on the attack. If it wasn’t for the persistent showers, the hosts would have registered a resounding victory.

This resulted in New Zealand securing a hard-fought win and progressing to the final of the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup.
