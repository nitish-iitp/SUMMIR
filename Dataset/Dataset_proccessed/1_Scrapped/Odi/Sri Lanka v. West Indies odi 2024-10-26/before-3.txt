Brandon King
Age 30
WEST INDIES
Right Handed Batsman

One of the most compact and stylish batters in the Caribbean, Brandon King has been one of the most consistent run-scorers for Jamaica and West Indies from age-group cricket. He was part of the West Indies team in the 2014 U-19 World Cup. Though his performances were not up to the mark in that World Cup, his batting potential was never in doubt.




King soon made his first-class debut for Jamaica against Trinidad and Tobago and impressed immediately. His correct technique along with the ability to score at a brisk rate without taking much risk made him one of the brightest young talents in the Caribbean. His real breakthrough performance came in the 2019 Caribbean Premier League in which he scored 496 runs in 12 games at an average of 55.11 along with an impressive strike rate of 148.94.




After a fruitful season, King was in the radar of the national selectors, and he soon made his ODI debut against Afghanistan in November 2019 in Lucknow. The T20I debut followed against the same opposition at the same ground a few days later, but he failed to book a permanent spot in the team. He finally made his maiden T20I fifty against Pakistan in 2021 in Karachi and followed it up with an impressive 43 in the next game on his 27th birthday.




Brandon King is one of the most talented batters in West Indies. With many senior players either unavailable or retired, King has started to get a good run in the team. If he can work on his consistency a little more, he can be a real asset for West Indies across formats.
