Sri Lanka bowled decently but as the game went on, as it got tougher to grip, there were a lot of loose balls dished out. The fielding also didn’t help and the dropped catch of Rutherford cost them dearly. They’ll be disappointed they could not defend a decent total on a tricky surface.

A fine, fine chase then by the Windies and they avoid a whitewash! It is the comeback man, Lewis and the man in form, Rutherford who do it! They started off cautiously and lost King in the process. Hope and Lewis then built another partnership which laid the platform. Lewis continued and he was the mainstay. Rutherford came out all guns blazing and played the cameo his side needed to round off a very good chase.
