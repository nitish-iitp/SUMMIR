India and Sri Lanka had a thrilling tie in the first ODI of the three-match series on Friday, August 2 at R. Premadasa Stadium, Colombo. After opting to bat first, Sri Lanka could only post 230/8 in their allotted 50 overs as Dunith Wellalage top-scored with 67* (65). In reply, India were bundled out for 230 in 47.5 overs as their batting crumbled against Sri Lankan spinners. Wanindu Hasaranga (3/58), Charith Asalanka (3/30) and Dunith Wellalage (2/39) were the pick of the bowlers for the hosts.

India got off to a phenomenal start as captain Rohit Sharma scored a blistering 58 (47) with the help of seven fours and three sixes. While Rohit took on the bowlers, Shubman Gill failed to get going and was dismissed for 16 (35) by Dunith Wellalage as Kusal Mendis caught his top edge. Rohit also fell prey to Wellalage who trapped him in front of the stumps.

Axar and Rahul's crucial stand

Washington Sundar was promoted to number four but failed to repay the captain’s trust giving his wicket to Akila Dananjaya for 5 (4) to leave India on 87/3 after 15.4 overs. After three quick wickets, a 43-run stand between Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer left the team just 100 runs away from a win in 23 overs.

Just when everything looked alright for the Men in Blue, they were rocked by back-to-back dismissals of Kohli (24 off 32) and Shreyas Iyer (23 off 23) to bring the game wide open on 132/5 after 24.2 overs. With the game on a knife's edge, KL Rahul and Axar Patel stitched a crucial 57-run stand for sixth wicket off 94 balls. There was another twist in the tale as Rahul (31 off 43) and Patel (33 off 57) were dismissed in a space of eight deliveries with India needing 34 runs from 55 balls.

Shivam Dube (25 off 24) fought hard till the end and left his team on the brink of a win with just one run required off 14 balls. However, in a mind-boggling end to the game, Dube and Arshdeep were dismissed on back-to-back deliveries by Charith Asalanka (3/30) to force the game into a tie.

Earlier, after opting to bat first, Sri Lanka got off to a miserable start with their old nemesis Mohammed Siraj(1/36,8 overs) giving them an early blow by dismissing Avishka Fernando. After early dismissal, Kusal Mendis tried to stabilize the innings along with Pathum Nissanka. However, their partnership could only last 39 runs as Shivam Dube (1/19, 4 overs) dismissed Mendis lbw in 14th over.

His dismissal opened the floodgates for Sri Lanka as the spin trio of Axar Patel (2/33), Kuldeep Yadav (1/33) and Washington Sundar (1/46, 9 overs) dismissed Sadeera Samarawickrama (8 off 18), Charith Asalanka (14 off 21) and Pathum Nissanka (56 off 75) respectively. As a result, Sri Lanka were left in all sorts of trouble at 101/5.

With Sri Lanka down and out, Dunith Wellalge held one end and stitched crucial partnerships down the order with Janith Liyanage (20 off 26), Wanindu Hasaranga (24 off 35) and Akila Dananjaya (17 off 21). He remained unbeaten on 67 (65) registering his first half-century in ODIs with the help of seven fours and two sixes. Courtesy of his marvellous knock, Sri Lanka managed to post a fighting score of 230/8 in their allotted 20 overs.
