India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st ODI: What Rohit Sharma said about India’s great collapse against Sri Lanka

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st ODI: Despite Rohit Sharma gave India an impressive start with his explosive knock, the visitors failed to close the game as Sri Lanka ended the 1st ODI in a tie. Reflecting on India’s performance, Rohit admitted that the target was chasable in Colombo and India only batted well in patches. “The score was gettable, you had to bat well to get there. We batted well in patches. No consistent momentum. We had the upper hand, we lost a couple of wicket. With the KL-Axar partnership, we came back. Little disappointing at the end. These things happened. Sri Lanka played well. In the end, it was a fair result. It (pitch) remained the same. It's not where you can come and play your shots. You have to dig in. The game shifted towards both teams at different times. We should have got that one run,” Rohit added.

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st ODI: Dunith Wellalage or Rohit Sharma - Who is the Player of the Match?

India vs Sri Lanka Live Score, IND vs SL 1st ODI: Sri Lanka's Dunith Wellalage is named the Player of the Match for his all-round show against India. Wellalage smashed 67 off 65 balls and picked up two wickets. “I wanted to put their bowlers under pressure. Me and Janith wanted to put some partnership. After that, I had a good partnership with Hasaranga. The wicket was slow. We planned to score 220. Wicket was little bit good during the second innings. Our skipper and Wanindu Hasaranga changed the game. We played a wonderful match today,” he said after the match.
