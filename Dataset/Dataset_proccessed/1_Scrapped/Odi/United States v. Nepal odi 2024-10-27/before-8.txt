USA CRICKET AND CRICKET ASSOCIATION OF NEPAL SHINE AT THE 2024 STAKE STARS AND SUMMIT TROPHY
By USA Cricket MediaOctober 23, 2024

October 23, 2024

The Men’s National Teams for USA Cricket and Cricket Association of Nepal showcased exceptional talent and sportsmanship during the 2024 Stake Stars and Summit Trophy, which featured three T20Is held from October 17 to October 20 at the Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium in Grand Prairie, TX. This year’s tournament saw intense competition, thrilling performances, and a celebration of the growing cricketing spirit in both nations, as Nepal swept the series 3-0.

Despite Nepal’s clean sweep of the tournament, there were some notable performances from Team USA players, such as half centuries from Shayan Jahangir (Match 1), Andries Gous (Match 2) and Sai Mukkamalla (Match 3). The most exciting match of the series was the nail biting Saturday night match that went into a Super Over after the teams were tied at 170 after regulation.

USA Cricket’s CEO, Johnathan Atkeison, stated, “This tournament has been an opportunity to showcase the growth of cricket in the United States and our association with Stake. While the results on the field didn’t go our way, we are grateful to the Cricket Association of Nepal for their partnership and commend their players for their remarkable skills and sportsmanship.”

The 2024 Stake Stars and Summit Trophy not only reinforced the bond between USA and Nepal cricket but also emphasized the importance of international collaboration in promoting the sport. Both teams are committed to nurturing cricketing talent and fostering a competitive yet friendly environment for future tournaments.

Team USA will be looking for redemption in the upcoming Cricket World Cup League 2 series, which will feature two one day matches between USA and Nepal, as well as matchups with the Scotland Cricket Team, as the three teams compete in six ODIs to gain points for qualification to the next ICC ODI World Cup. This ODI series will take place from October 25 to November 4th at Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium.
