BAN vs SL Live Streaming, 1st ODI: Najmul Shanto will lead the hosts in the series. (AP)

Bangladesh will host Sri Lanka in the second leg of the bilateral series for three One-Day Internationals, starting Wednesday. The first ODI will be played in Chattogram, which will also be hosting the remaining games.

The teams are coming off an engaging three-match T20I series which the Lankans won by a 2-1 margin. While the visitors won the first ODI by 28 runs, Bangladesh clawed back with an eight-wicket win in the second. In the series decider, Sri Lanka edged out Bangladesh by a narrow three-run margin after scoring 206 with fifties from Sadeera Samarawickrama and Kusal Mendis.

The Sri Lanka-Bangladesh rivalry has intensified in recent years, despite the former’s commanding record over the Tigers. Sri Lanka have won 42 of the 54 games against Bangladesh with only 10 defeats.
