GG vs UPW Commentary
5:30 PM IST Right then, as the curtains draw on this exhilarating match, Gujarat emerge triumphant, clinching a crucial victory in their penultimate match of this season's Women's T20 League group stage. Their hard-earned triumph now keeps them mathematically alive in contention for the playoffs which although heavily depends on the forthcoming clash between Mumbai and Bangalore. Scheduled for Tuesday, the 12th of March, at 7.30 pm IST (2.00 pm GMT), this match promises to be a spectacle you won't want to miss. Join us early for all the pre-match buzz and build-up. Until then, cheers and farewell!
5:29 PM IST Shabnam Shakil is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for her outstanding bowling spell with 3 wickets for just 11 runs. She says she is feeling happy to perform on a big platform and share the field with big players. Adds that she learned a lot from under-19 and she utilized the experience of Under-19 here and it worked well for her. Mentions that she likes to use the new ball and she was looking to enjoy every moment. Closes by saying that the basic plan was to keep the ball on top of off and she stuck to it.
5:27 PM IST The skipper of Gujarat, Beth Mooney says they stuck to the situation and gave their fans a great game to watch. Adds that they thought they had the game with those five early wickets but they let them creep closer. Credits Shabnam Shakil for the way she bowled and says she is a bigger prospect for the future and she deserved that 4 over spell. Concludes that it is nice to have a win before the tournament ends and that Delhi is a strong team and it will be a close contest.
5:19 PM IST It's time for the Presentation ceremony...
5:19 PM IST The skipper of UP Alyssa Healy says they thought they could give it a shot if they took the game deep and Deepti Sharma did exactly that but was just unhappy with the overall team effort. Adds that they were looking to take on the bowlers in the powerplay and that just did not come out well for them in this game. Mentions that they knew a victory here was their priority and they couldn't get that which leaves things not in their control but they still hope. Closes by saying that the side is full of amazing players happy to put up their hands and take responsibility and Poonam Khemnar is one of them and it feels happy to have such players in the squad.
5:17 PM IST Earlier in the game, Gujarat's openers came out swinging, displaying clear intent by manipulating UP's field placements and effortlessly finding the boundaries. Their partnership laid a sturdy foundation for a substantial total. However, the momentum shifted when Laura Wolvaardt departed in the 8th over, triggering a succession of wickets around Beth Mooney, which significantly slowed down the scoring rate. During the middle overs, it was Sophie Ecclestone who stemmed the flow of runs for UP, applying pressure with her precise bowling. The game's complexion changed dramatically in the final over as Beth Mooney launched a blistering assault on Sophie Ecclestone, plundering five boundaries to propel Gujarat's total to 152 runs staying unbeaten at 74 runs. Despite the onslaught in that final over, Sophie Ecclestone emerged as the standout performer for UP with figures of 3 for 38 in her four overs.
