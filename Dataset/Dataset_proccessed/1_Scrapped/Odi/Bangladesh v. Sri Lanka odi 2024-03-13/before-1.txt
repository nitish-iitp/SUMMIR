Guyana and Barbados will face off at the St Paul’s Sports Complex, Basseterre, in match no. 8 of the ongoing 2024 Women’s Super50 Cup. The game is scheduled for 7:30 PM Indian Standard Time (IST) on the 8th of March, 2024.

Match 8: Guyana vs Barbados

While Guyana has won both of their games this season, Barbados won their closely contested opener but lost by a heavy margin at the hands of Jamaica in the following game.

Squads:

Guyana – Shemaine Campbelle (C), Naomi Barkoye, Shabika Gajnabi, Trisha Hardat, Plaffianna Millington, Sheneta Grimmond, Realeanna Grimmond, Ashmini Munisar, Cherry-Ann Fraser, Mandy Mangru, Kaysia Schultz, Realeanna Grimmond, Cyanna Retemiah, Nyia Latchman

Barbados – Kycia Knight (C), Kyshona Knight, Aaliyah Alleyne, Shanika Bruce, Asabi Callender, Zaliya Camobelle, Shamilia Connell, NaiJanni Cumberbatch, Erin Deane, Keila Elliott, Allison Gordon, Theanny Herbert-Mayers, Trishan Holder, Alisa Scantlebury

Players to watch out:
Shabika Gajnabi

The 23-year-old all-rounder managed only 59 runs, with 49 of them coming in one inning alone, from 4 outings last edition, while also scalping 7 wickets. Though Shabika departed for 20 in the opener, she scored a solid 102-ball 61 in her most recent outing, while has only sent down 4 overs yet. She’ll be relied upon for the goods.

Plaffianna Millington

The 26-year-old off-spinner, averaging 14.37 and maintaining an economy rate of 3.02, picked up 8 wickets from five Super50 appearances last season and also was handy with the bat. Plaffianna has had an outstanding start to this season, returning figures of 4/10 and 2/23. It’ll be hoped she continues this form, leading the tally.

Kycia Knight

The 32-year-old keeper-batter accumulated 117 runs, including the highest of 40, from five Super50 outings last summer. Kycia didn’t have an ideal start to her campaign, departing for 7, but in the following game, top scored with a 134-ball 93. The team will count on the experience of the seasoned campaigner for big runs.

Aaliyah Alleyne

The 29-year-old all-rounder in the 2023 Super50 Cup added 134 runs to the tally from 4 outings while also claiming a wicket from her only bowling inning. This season, while Alleyne has registered scores of 9 and 10 to her name, she’s compensated with the ball, producing figures of 3/24 (8.5) and 2/33 (10.0). She can be trusted for all-round performances.

Pitch:

St Paul’s Sports Complex dishes out a balanced center wicket with a slight advantage for bowlers over batters, as evidenced by a modest average score in the 180s. The conditions will see spinners holding an advantage at the venue.
