Rupee or domestic credit by the banking and monetary sectors to the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) and public corporations continued to overshadow credit to the private sector for the seventh consecutive month to February 2022, a phenomenon last seen nearly 33 years ago in 1989, Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) data of Friday’s (8 April) showed. 

For instance, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,331 billion in February 2022, while credit to the private sector amounted to a mere Rs 7,051 billion in that month, the former being more by Rs 280 billion over the latter. And in the previous month January 2022, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,236 billion, while credit to the private sector amounted to a mere Rs 7,017 billion that month, the former being more by Rs 219 billion over the latter.

Meanwhile, in December 2021, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,467.9 billion, while credit to the private sector amounted to a mere Rs 6,981.4 billion, the former being more by Rs 486.5 billion over the latter. In November 2021, credit to the GoSL and to public corporations amounted to Rs 7,259 billion and credit to the private sector Rs 6,920.1 billion, an increase of Rs 338.9 billion. 

Similarly, in the months of October, September and August 2021 these respective figures were Rs 7,116.8 billion and Rs 6,859.6 billion, Rs 6,915.2 billion and Rs 6,824.6 billion and Rs 6,819 billion and Rs 6,795.5 billion, increases of Rs 257.2 billion, Rs 90.6 billion and Rs 23.5 billion, respectively.   Previously, such a phenomenon occurred for 10 consecutive months, from January 1989 to October 1989, CBSL data showed. 

Three matters of political interest, coinciding with those developments took place during that earlier period. They were President Ranasinghe Premadasa being elected to power at the Presidential Poll of 19 December 1988 and taking over from President J.R. Jayewardene who went into retirement on 31 December 1988, the IPKF fighting the LTTE in the North and East of the country and the JVP fighting the GoSL in the rest of the country. 

However, coinciding with the killing of JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera by the Army on 13 November 1989, private sector credit once more overtook credit to both the GoSL and public corporations together beginning from that month, before its collapse nearly 32 years later  in August 2021 and continuing to play second fiddle to the GoSL and public corporations till February 2022, according to latest CBSL data.

Kusal Mendis led side seeks winning start as focus shifts to ODI’s

Sri Lanka will aim to maintain their impressive performance from the T20I series as they face rivals Bangladesh in the first match of the three-game ODI series today in Chattogram.

Having secured the T20 series 2-1, Sri Lanka now has its sights set on the ODI trophy. The controversial time-out decision during the T20 series fuelled the rivalry between the teams, motivating Sri Lanka to perform at their best.

In the series decider, Sri Lanka displayed a clinical batting performance and followed it up with an excellent bowling effort. They were determined to make life difficult for the Bangladesh batters with their exceptional T20 bowling skills, and they hope to continue this intensity in the ODI leg of the tour.

Despite Sri Lanka’s dominant record against Bangladesh, the rivalry between the two teams has intensified in recent years. Out of the 54 games played between them, Sri Lanka has emerged victorious in 42 matches, suffering only 10 defeats.

The return of skilled all-rounders Wanindu Hasaranga and Dhananjaya de Silva has strengthened Sri Lanka’s lineup, providing better balance and depth. Additionally, the team will be boosted by the return of opening batter Pathum Nissanka, who missed the T20Is due to injury.

However, there is concern regarding the recent form of opening batter Avishka Fernando. The experiment of using him as an opener has not yielded positive results, and the team may need to reconsider whether they should persist with him in the future.

With less than four months remaining until the T20I World Cup, the workload of Dilshan Madushanka will be a primary concern for the Sri Lanka team management. This concern was evident when he was rested during the T20Is. If Madushanka is rested again, Lahiru Kumara could be a potential replacement.

On the other hand, the disappointment of losing the T20 series will still be lingering fresh in the minds of the Bangladeshi cricketers, who have yet to win a series against Sri Lanka at home. Nevertheless, a win in the ODI series would provide some relief and help alleviate their frustration.

The Bangladeshi team possesses a strong and well-rounded squad that can give Sri Lanka a tough challenge on their home turf. They have a good balance and depth in both their bowling and batting line-up.

Furthermore, the return of experienced players like Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Mushfiqur Rahim will greatly boost the team’s morale and encourage them to adopt a more aggressive style of play. The top order, consisting of Sowmya Sarkar, Liton Das, Anamul Haque, and Najmul Hossain Shanto, is solid and has the potential to cause significant damage if they find their rhythm.

The middle order has also been strengthened with the inclusion of talented players such as Towhid Hridoy, Mahmudullah, and Mehidy Hasan Miraz. The bowling attack is in capable hands, with a versatile combination of two left-arm pacers, one right-arm pacer, one leg spin bowler, and one slow left-arm orthodox bowler, which can effectively challenge the predominantly right-handed Sri Lankan batting order.
