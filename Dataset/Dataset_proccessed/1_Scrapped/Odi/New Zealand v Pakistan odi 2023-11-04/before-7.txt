After suffering three successive defeats, New Zealand (NZ) now lock horns with Pakistan (PAK) in the ongoing sixteenth campaign of the World Cup. Match No. 35 is all set to take place on a doubleheader Saturday, November 04, 2023, at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore. The BlackCaps won their opening four encounters but are now on a mini-slump while Pakistan has three victories in seven outings so far.

The runners-up from the last two editions, the Kiwis are suddenly suffering from bad form and are also hit by injuries. They suffered a body blow just before the day of the Pakistan clash with premier seamer Matt Henry ruled out of the remainder of the competition due to a hamstring injury. Tall pacer Kyle Jamieson has replaced him in the squad and may well find a place straightaway into the playing XI.

It has become a must-win game for the BlackCaps especially with Pakistan and Afghanistan just behind them and knocking on the door for a place in the final four. Having lost their previous four matches, Babar Azam and his men finally returned to winning ways when they defeated Bangladesh last time out. With Pakistan now also in the mix, this has suddenly turned out to be a mouth-watering and exciting fixture with both sides desperately looking for that two points.

Meanwhile, here are some of the important stats and numbers ahead of Match No. 35 between New Zealand and Pakistan in the World Cup 2023:

Head-to-Head: The Kiwis and the Men in Green have met each other 115 times in ODI cricket with New Zealand winning on 51 occasions and Pakistan on 60. One game ended in a tie while the remaining three in no result.
