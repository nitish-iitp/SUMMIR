ICC CRICKET WORLD CUP 2023 Schedule
The Indian cricket team will look to end its ICC trophy drought as the ICC Cricket World Cup takes the centre stage. The tournament kicks off in India from October 5. Defending champions England face New Zealand in the opening match, which will be repeat of the 2019 final. The Rohit Sharma-led side won the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka, and also edged out Australia 2-1 in a three-match series in the lead up to the tournament. India's series win over Australia saw them become only the second team in men's cricket history to occupy the number one spot across all three formats after defeating Australia in the first ODI on Friday. Rohit and his men moved past arch-rivals Pakistan to take the top position in the one-day rankings as a result of their latest victory, just before they host the World Cup. India's last ICC title was the 2013 Champions Trophy, which came after MS Dhoni lifted the 2011 World Cup at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. India will begin their campaign against Australia on October 8 followed by a hotly-anticipated clash against arch-rivals Pakistan at the world's biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad. The last three World Cups have all been won by the hosting nations -- India 2011, Australia (co-hosts alongside New Zealand) 2015 and England 2019. The race for the No. 1 ODI batter will get intensified with India youngster Shubman Gill chasing Pakistan captain Babar Azam, who heads into the World Cup with a narrow lead at the top. The latest edition of the World Cup could be the last for some of the stalwarts of the game. The final will be played on November 19 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, which will also host the opener, as well as the blockbuster match between India and Pakistan on October 15.
