Netherlands, the sole associate team in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023, is set for their fifth appearance in the tournament under the leadership of Scott Edwards. Ranked 14th in the ICC's ODI ratings, Netherlands had an impressive journey during the Qualifier tournament, featuring many outstanding individual performances that secured their spot in the finals, making them one of the ten participants. One of the most remarkable moments for the team was their thrilling super over victory against the two-time champions, West Indies. Despite facing some injuries and bolstered by senior players, the Dutch side is determined to give their best shot at advancing to the next stage.

TOP ORDER IN SEARCH OF LONG PARTNERSHIPS

Since January 2022, the Dutch batting performance has been modest. The openers have contributed 1937 runs, averaging 34.6. Although the top three's average is the lowest among the World Cup participants, the middle order shows promise with an average of 29, surpassing teams like Sri Lanka, Australia, and Afghanistan in that stage. Their strike rate of 83.8 in the first powerplay is decent, but building partnerships throughout the innings is crucial to set competitive totals. Unfortunately, the batters struggle to accelerate in the middle overs, with a strike rate of 80.6, the lowest among the nine participating teams.

TOP ORDER BATTING AVERAGE SINCE 2022

Skipper Scott Edwards has been the leading run-scorer for the team in this period, amassing 1057 runs at an impressive average of 45.95. He is the only batter in the squad to score over 1000 runs and maintain an average above 40, making him an integral part of the Netherlands' lineup. Max O’Dowd and Vikramjit Singh have also made significant contributions with the bat, alongside the skipper, and are the only Dutch batters to have faced more than 1000 deliveries in the past two years. Additionally, senior pro, Wesley Barresi, who was part of the 2011 World Cup squad, the last time Netherlands participated in an ODI World Cup, has earned his place in the squad after coming out of retirement last year. He is expected to bolster the middle order.
 

A TEAM OF ALL-ROUNDERS

The team boasts an impressive array of six all-round options, including seasoned pros Colin Ackermann and Roelof van der Merwe. Roelof van der Merwe holds the distinction of being a dual international, having previously played 13 ODIs for South Africa. His experience includes a tour of India back in 2010, during which he claimed 3 wickets in 2 games. With a wealth of T20 cricket experience from around the world, he brings valuable insights from facing top-quality players.

MIDDLE ORDER BATTING AVERAGE SINCE 2022

Teja Nidimanuru serves as a batting all-rounder and stands as the only Dutch player to have scored multiple centuries in the format since 2022. His incredible knock of 111 runs in just 76 balls against West Indies played a pivotal role in securing a victory for the team after a thrilling tie. Another exceptional all-rounder, Logan van Beek, left an indelible mark with three sixes in a super over, marking one of Netherlands' most memorable ODIs.

Bas de Leede is a unique talent, being the only Dutch player and the fourth player in men's cricket history to have scored a century and taken a 5-wicket haul in the same ODI. He achieved this remarkable feat against Scotland during the Qualifiers, providing the depth his team needed. De Leede is also the second-highest wicket-taker for the team, following Logan van Beek, with 23 wickets to his name. Impressively, he has also taken 13 wickets in the death overs.

The team's pool of all-rounders is further enriched by the inclusion of Sybrand Engelbrecht and leg spinner Saqib Zulfiqar. Engelbrecht, who played domestic cricket in South Africa until 2016 before announcing his retirement as a young player, is set to make his Netherlands debut in the tournament. Notably, he represented the South Africa Under-19 team in the 2008 Under-19 World Cup.

NETHERLANDS BOWLING CHALLENGES

Netherlands faces challenges in the bowling department, particularly in terms of strike rates. They have the worst strike rate among the participating nations. During the first powerplay, only Afghanistan performs worse. While the strike rate improves to 63 in the middle overs, Netherlands still ranks low in this category. Surprisingly, they exhibit a better strike rate than the Indian team in the death overs. Netherlands takes a wicket every 17.9 balls, compared to India's 21.4, which is the worst in the lot since 2022. The return of Jasprit Bumrah could potentially alter India's fortunes in the tournament.

BOWLING STRIKE RATES IN ODI SINCE 2022

Medium pacer Logan van Beek has been the standout bowler, capturing 27 wickets in 20 matches, making him the highest wicket-taker for the team in the period. Impressively, 11 of his wickets were taken in the first powerplay, and 8 each in the middle phase and the death overs.

In spin-friendly conditions, off-spinner Aryan Dutt becomes a crucial asset for the team, having collected 19 scalps in 23 matches. He has accounted for 8 wickets in the death overs and is a reliable wicket-taking option. Unfortunately, the Dutch team will miss the services of one of their finest bowling exponents, Fred Klaasen, due to a stress fracture. The team is equipped with only four frontline fast bowlers, which could pose a risk in a World Cup setting. Klaasen, a regular in the County cricket circuit, has claimed 16 wickets in 11 innings for Netherlands since 2022.

While the team may not be considered favorites to qualify for the semifinals, it presents a significant opportunity for its players to gain experience on the big stage and work toward becoming a stronger side in the coming years. The Dutch team has had its moments of glory, with Ryan ten Doeschate's remarkable centuries in the 2011 edition remaining etched in memory. This is a well-deserved chance for the men in orange to surprise the other nine squads and conclude the tournament on a high note.
