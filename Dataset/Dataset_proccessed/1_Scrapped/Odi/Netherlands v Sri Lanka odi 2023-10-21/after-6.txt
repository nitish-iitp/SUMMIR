Netherlands vs Sri Lanka Highlights, ODI World Cup 2023: Composed half-centuries from top-order batter Sadeera Samarawickrama and opener Pathum Nissanka helped Sri Lanka cruise to a five-wicket victory against the Netherlands in their World Cup match in Lucknow on Saturday. This is Sri Lanka's first win in the tournament after having lost their three previous games. Samarawickrama made an unbeaten 91 off 107 balls, while Nissanka scored a 52-ball 54 and shared a 77-run partnership with Charith Asalanka (44) as Sri Lanka overhauled Netherlands' total of 262 in 48.2 overs. The Dutch were earlier bundled out for a below-par score in 49.4 overs, thanks chiefly to the efforts of Dilshan Madushanka (4/49) and Kasun Rajitha (4/50). Number seven Sybrand Engelbrecht top-scored for the Dutch with an 82-ball 70 and added 130 runs for the seventh wicket with Logan van Beek (59 off 75 balls), lifting their team from a precarious 91 for six in the 22nd over.

Right then, that is it from this game where Sri Lanka gets their first win of the tournament while Netherlands fails to make it two wins in a row. There is another cracking game going on at the moment between England and South Africa. You can just switch tabs to enjoy all the coverage of that game. Cheers!

!

Kusal Mendis, the victorious skipper of Sri Lanka says that he is happy with the win. Adds that they did well in all departments. Tells that their bowlers were brilliant in the first 10 overs. Praises Sadeera Samarawickrama for his knock and staying till the end and also credits Pathum Nissanka as well. Says he had three overs left of Kasun Rajitha but decided to save them for the death. Ends by saying there were a lot of positives and he has confidence in his team.

!

Scott Edwards, the captain of Netherlands says that it was an interesting pitch. Adds that they obviously didn't start well but Logan van Beek and Sybrand Engelbrecht got them to a pretty competitive total. Tells that they gave away too many boundary balls and fielding was also not up to standards. Mentions that their bowlers have been good for them throughout but the top order and bowlers let them down here. Says that they had a feeling that it would turn a bit later on and Dutt turns it a bit more than others. Further adds that their batting hasn't quite clicked yet as there have been too many starts that haven't been converted. Ends by saying he is not bothered by batting first or second and they just need to execute their plans better in the next game and is not stressed about this loss.

!

Sadeera Samarawickrama is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his match-winning knock. He says that he is happy to finish the game and the team wanted a win. Adds that the wicket was not easy and the ball was spinning. Shares that the plan was to bat deep and stick to basics. Mentions that the ball was turning and gripping and they wanted to take it deep as it was a difficult wicket. Closes by saying that he is happy with the effort and wants to carry on the momentum.

Presentation Time...

!

Earlier in the game, Netherlands posted a fighting total on the board even after being in a struggling position. They were 91-6 at one point but fifties from Sybrand Engelbrecht and Logan van Beek gave their bowlers something to play with in this match. Dilshan Madushanka and Kasun Rajitha both were excellent with the ball for Lanka and picked up four wickets each while Maheesh Theekshana chipped in with one as well. While chasing, Sri Lanka suffered a couple of early blows but their middle order took their time and a couple of fine knocks got them over the line with five wickets in hand.

!

Netherlands, on the other hand, will be wondering if they could have done better as they failed to match their performance against the Proteas. Aryan Dutt provided them with two crucial wickets inside the first Powerplay but they just couldn't build on that and let Lanka make their back in the game. The Dutch knew that a couple of partnerships would take the game away from them and that is exactly what happened here. They were also a bit sloppy in the field and that missed stumping from skipper Scott Edwards when Sadeera Samarawickrama didn't even open his account cost them a lot. Paul van Meekeren and Dutt struck again in the middle overs but they needed a few more in quick succession to test Lanka even more. Netherlands tried everything, from different tactics to matchups but it was just not their day here.

!

Sri Lanka started a bit cautiously but lost Kusal Perera and skipper Kusal Mendis for low scores. However, Pathum Nissanka held the other end well and kept the scoreboard ticking. He along with Sadeera Samarawickrama steadied the ship with a 52-run partnership but Nissanka lost his concentration right after the first drinks break and departed after reaching his third half-century on the trot. After that, Sadeera took responsibility on himself and found good support from Charith Asalanka as well. Both of them rotated the strike well and managed to score runs at a good rate too which didn't let the game go away from them at any point. They added 77 runs together before Asalanka departed for 44 after playing a poor shot. Dhananjaya de Silva came in and used his experience well and along with Sadeera took them closer to the target with less than a run-ball knock, but he too got out trying to finish things quickly. Sadeera Samarawickrama remained unbeaten on a brilliant 91 and Dushan Hemantha hit the wining runs in the end.

!

SRI LANKA FINALLY GETS OFF THE MARK IN THIS WORLD CUP! Now, every team participating has a win to their name and that is what the audience wants to see in these big events. This was a decent performance from the Lankans, still not their best one but the important thing here is that they got over the line in the end. This is also the highest successful chase at this ground.
