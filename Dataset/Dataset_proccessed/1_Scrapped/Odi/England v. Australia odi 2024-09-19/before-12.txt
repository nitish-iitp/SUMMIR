Morne Morkel on Indian cuisine
The upcoming series against Bangladesh

Former South African fast bowler Morne Morkel, newly appointed as the Indian cricket team’s bowling coach, is already making headlines with his enthusiasm for Indian cuisine. In a recent interview with BCCI.TV, Morkel shared his love for traditional Indian dishes, reflecting his excitement for his new role with the team.

Morkel said he is a fan of puri, enjoys dosas for breakfast, and loves milk, malai, chicken, and naan bread. As a coach, he emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy diet to set a good example for his players.

“I’m a big fan of puri, and for breakfast, I enjoy dosas. I also love milk, malai, chicken, and naan breads. But it’s important for me as a coach to maintain a healthy diet, setting an example for the players,” Morkel said in an interview.

The upcoming series against Bangladesh

As India gears up for the Bangladesh series starting on September 19, 2024, with two Test matches and three T20 Internationals, Morkel will be stepping into his first series as the team’s bowling coach. This home series is crucial for India, especially after their recent ODI series defeat to Sri Lanka.

The Indian cricket team, now under the guidance of head coach Gautam Gambhir and bowling coach Morkel, is poised for a fresh start. The duo, who previously played together for the Kolkata Knight Riders, notably winning the IPL trophy in 2014, bring a wealth of experience and camaraderie to the team.

Gambhir and Morkel’s reunion is expected to inject a new level of energy and strategic insight into the Indian squad. Fans and analysts alike are keenly anticipating how the seasoned duo will influence the team’s performance in the upcoming series.
