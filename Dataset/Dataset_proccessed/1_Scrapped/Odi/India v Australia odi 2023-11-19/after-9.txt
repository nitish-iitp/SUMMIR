IND vs AUS Scorecard
India vs Australia Commentary
4:55 PM IST Right then, after almost two months of action-packed One Day games and Australia have run away with the crown. With a couple of losses to start the tournament, they were under the pump but this proud sporting nation has lived up to the expectations. We saw stellar individual and team performances throughout the tournament and certainly a few future stars were born right on this very stage. The old guards too showed their prowess but for a lot of the players, this was their last shot at glory. In the end, it was a glorious night in Ahmedabad and the team from down under lifted their record-shattering sixth World Cup title. That is it from us and we hope that all of you enjoyed our coverage of the whole tournament. With the conclusion of the World Cup, normalcy resumes and it's bilateral series and other tournaments. You can switch tabs and keep an eye on the latest cricketing action. Until next time, take care and goodbye!
4:46 PM IST The honorable Prime Minister of India walks alongside the deputy Prime Minister of Australia and it will be the Indian Prime Minister to hand over the coveted World Cup trophy to Pat Cummins and fireworks blow up all over the stadium and now, the whole team joins Cummins on the podium to post with the World Title. The rejoicing faces of the Aussie players show what it means to them.
4:45 PM IST Pat Cummins, the victorious skipper of Australia says that he thinks they saved the best for the last. Adds that they have been batting first pretty much the whole tournament and they thought it was a good night to chase. Tells that they boys were fantastic they got an ageing side but everyone is still giving everything on the field. Says they thought 300 might have been tough but achievable on this wicket but it was stunning effort  to restrict them to 240. Praises Marnus Labuschagne for his knock and Travis Head did what he does in the big games. Further adds that that the selectors backed them and the risk paid off. Mentions that you got to go and win the World Cup you can't wait for it. Ends by saying it was a special night and this year will be remembered for a long time as they are in top of the mountain.
4:39 PM IST The players of the buoyant Australian team now come up to collect their winning medals.
4:39 PM IST Rohit Sharma, the captain of India says that the result hasn't gone their way and they weren't good enough in the game but is very proud of the team and the way they have played. Adds that they were 20-30 runs short and when KL Rahul and Virat Kohli were batting, they had a chat and they needed to bat through but Australia were able to get that big partnership and clinch the win. Mentions that when you have 240 on the board, you need early wickets but credit to Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne for the way they played and it was slightly better to bat under the lights. Adds that they knew under lights, it would be slightly better and with another wicket after the first three, things could have been different.
4:32 PM IST The runners-up, players of India now come up one by one and collect their medals.
