Analysis

Australia's ODI World Cup victory over India is the sum of its risk and reward choices

Sometimes long shots pay off big.

That was the message from Australian cricket captain Pat Cummins after his team lifted the World Cup trophy in Ahmedabad, India.

"It was a big risk and it paid off," Cummins said shortly after the unlikely victory.

Five quick hits: Pat Cummins's big call and Travis Head's 'phenomenal' catch

He was speaking about knockout-stage hero Travis Head and selectors keeping a squad spot open for him after the dynamic left-handed batsman fractured his hand in South Africa.

In reality, Cummins could have been speaking about any number of the players in this team.

David Warner, Marnus Labuschagne, Mitchell Marsh, Mitchell Starc and even Glenn Maxwell are names that come to mind.

They have all at various stages been much maligned. Some of their selections questioned. Their consistency up for debate.

Maxwell and Marsh allegedly too hit and miss. Warner ageing and a Test liability, though his white-ball career has few peers. Labuschagne too slow in the modern game where the T20 obsession sees non-sloggers branded outcasts. Starc not economical enough and not the tearaway he once was.

Yet when you put them together in this Australia XI, you get something close to magic and a balanced act that gets results despite not being like the dominant teams from what are viewed as Australia's golden years between 1999 and 2007, when they went back to back to back.

The other greatest ODI innings after Maxwell's heroics

Glenn Maxwell's stunning match-winning double century at the Cricket World Cup has been hailed as the greatest ODI innings of all time. Here are the performances he's up against for that title.

And sure, cricket fans who yearn for the heady days of Steve Waugh's great side — where the "mental disintegration" of opponents was at a premium and South Africa's Herschelle Gibbs "dropped the World Cup" — may never be satisfied by the win-loss record of this Australian team, but it is a team that brings something special.

With this side, it might not be about the result but rather the journey.

And what a journey it has been.

The ODI year started with a 2-1 series win in India before this team led South Africa 2-0 over there. Then the Proteas won the remaining three matches by an average of 132 runs a game and the series 3-2 in September.

Things didn't get much better when the team returned to India and the host nation for the World Cup took the first two matches of the series for an unassailable lead, before a returning Maxwell produced something freakish for Australia to win the final game of that series.

The notion that it gave hope for the World Cup was almost immediately snuffed out as India, then South Africa, comfortably handled Australia in their opening two World Cup matches to leave the eventual champions 0-2 for the tournament.

Things were bleak and the criticism that this team was full of "hit-out or get-out" types was very much real.

The collapse against India was bad, as Steve Smith and Warner scored in the 40s. And against South Africa it was worse as only Labuschagne made it that far.

But what Australia has prided itself on throughout the history of this tournament is winning the big matches — not necessarily every match — and knowing talent can get them through.

Four years ago when Australia was routed by eventual champions England in the semifinals of this tournament, Warner failed with the bat, as did Maxwell.

Starc was belted with the ball, returning figures of 1-70 from his nine overs.

Cummins was economical, while Steve Smith played a lone hand with the bat for 85 runs.

They were the only survivors going into this winning side.

Smith and Warner are generational talents. Starc a strike bowler, Cummins is Mr Consistent, and Maxwell remains equal parts sublime and ridiculous, but a game-turner nonetheless.

That's five.

When Australia achieved its maiden T20 World Cup glory in 2021, those five were present, as were Marsh (who top-scored in the final with 77), Adam Zampa (1-26), and Josh Hazlewood (3-16).

Warner, for his part, made 289 runs at an average of 48 and was named player of the tournament.

Eight of the XI from that final played in this one.

It's part of the beauty of this side — they don't all need to fire every game to still get it done.

One individual talent steps up while they play as a team in the field.

This tournament has been an exercise in that.

With their backs against the wall at 0-2 and playing Sri Lanka, Zampa took 4-47 against a team of fallen former champions.

Against the always dangerous Pakistan, the leg spinner repeated the dose, but it was the mammoth centuries of Warner (163) and Marsh (121) that really set the match up and Australia's tournament.

Everyone got in on the act against the Dutch to make Australia's record a winning one at 3-2, but again in a big game, this time against New Zealand, the big names and big talents stood up.

A returning Head made a ton, Warner fresh off back-to-back hundreds 81 and the enigmatic Maxwell 41 off 24 deliveries.

Zampa again starred with the ball.

England was next, and despite the 2023 World Cup being their annus horribilis, they forced the old enemy into a match, and it was Labuschagne who delivered what would be the first of his heroic performances of the tournament.

His steady rather than spectacular batting delivered a stoic 71 to right the Australian ship before the bowlers skittled England for 253 and 33 runs short of Australia.

Then came Maxwell's heroic and Herculean double-ton rescue job against Afghanistan as he was crippled with cramp.

It is and will forever be the lasting moment of this tournament and the total antithesis to the missed swat he played to get out against South Africa in the semifinal.

But even there, others had his back. It was Head and Warner who got the Aussies off to a fast start and Maxwell, like Head, did damage with the ball when Zampa was getting hit to all corners by David Miller.

Starc, meanwhile, picked up three wickets as he did again in the final. Not bad for a spearhead who can be expensive but often delivers in big games.

And that's where this team has delivered thrice in eight years to win two ODI World Cups and one T20 World Cup. 

It's a pretty good return for some high-risk play.
