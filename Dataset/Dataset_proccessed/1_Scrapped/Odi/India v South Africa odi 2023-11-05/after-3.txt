Overall, Kohli became the sixth batter in the world to score 3000 runs across formats against South Africa after Ricky Ponting, Sachin Tendulkar, Kumar Sangakkara, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, and David Warner.

The India batter grafted the innings against South Africa at Eden Gardens after Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill fell in quick succession inside 11 overs of the game. Kohli, combined with Shreyas Iyer guided India out of trouble in a slow pitch at the Eden Gardens.

At the time of writing, Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer added 103 runs between themselves from 126 balls. Kohli had completed his half-century from 67 balls. The middle-order batters navigated the tough overs of Keshav Maharaj and formed a base for a late assault against the South African side.

The batter has played several memorable innings against South Africa. In fact, Virat Kohli's best score in Test cricket came against South Africa back in 2019. Playing in Pune, Kohli smashed 254*, which allowed India to defeat Faf du Plessis' South Africa by an innings and 137 runs.

Virat Kohli also equalled Sachin Tendulkar in another elite feat. In the 32nd over, Kohli reached 55 runs in the innings to become only the second batter in the history of ODI cricket to reach 6000 runs at home. Only Sachin Tendulkar remains ahead of Virat Kohli with 6976 runs to his name from 164 matches.
