I Wasn't Expecting...: Gambhir's Assistant Coach Gives Honest Verdict On Challenge Overlooked By Team India
India's assistant coach did not mince his words while pointing out a major challenge facing the national team in the wake of their shambolic ODI series defeat to Sri Lanka. India lost a bilateral battle against the island nation after a gap of 27 years in the ODI format with a 2-0 series defeat.

Gautam Gambhir's stint as the head coach of the Indian cricket team started on a forgettable note as the Men in Blue suffered their first defeat to Sri Lanka in a bilateral ODI series in 27 years. The Rohit Sharma team were outplayed as the hosts won the three-match series 2-0 after the first game ended in a tie.
Ryan Ten Doeschate joined the Indian team as an assistant coach in Sri Lanka as part of Gambhir's support staff. The former Netherlands all-rounder shares a long history with Gambhir, having played under his captaincy at Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) for a number of years. The Dutch star was also part of KKR's coaching staff in 2024 when Gambhir was their mentor and lifted the IPL trophy.
Ten Doeschate gave an honest verdict on India's shambolic defeat in Sri Lanka and pointed out the Men in Blue's struggles against spin bowling. The assistant coach of the Rohit-led outfit stated that it is a challenge that has been overlooked by the Men in Blue in recent years as their focus has shifted to doing well overseas.
"The Indian mindset has become so driven to do well overseas that the focus has moved away from what was once their strength-playing spin. I guess one of the challenges that I wasn't expecting and kind of overlooked is the playing of spin.
"[We] were undone in Sri Lanka, and I think the mindset of the Indians has been such that they are so driven to do well overseas. I think the focus has moved to doing well in Australia and doing well in England, and we've kind of let playing spin, which was always the strength of the Indian team, fall back a little bit. So that's one thing I'm looking forward to, helping get to that position where Indians are the best players of spin in the world again," Ten Doeschate told Talk Sport Cricket.
Ten Doeschate is one of two assistant coaches appointed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) alongside former India cricketer Abhishek Nayyar, who was also part of KKR's IPL-winning coaching staff this year. Former KKR pacer Morne Morkel has been named as the bowling coach. Morkel and Gambhir were part of the Lucknow Super Giants' coaching team in the 2022 and 2023 IPL seasons.
