PAK vs HK Commentary
9:31 AM IST Right then, that is it from this game and two arch-rivals, India and Pakistan have secured their places in the semifinals with a couple of spots still to be filled. On Wednesday, the 4th of October we will witness the remaining two quarterfinals and in the first game, Afghanistan will take on Sri Lanka at 6.30 am IST (1 am GMT). This will be followed by a match-up between Bangladesh and Malaysia starting at 11.30 am IST (6 am GMT). Both matches will be played at the same venue and you can join us in advance for the build-up as well. Cheers!
9:29 AM IST Hong Kong will be slightly disheartened with that batting display, particularly the way the middle order just crumbled against the Pakistani spinners. They did play well in patches and bowled extremely well but lost the plot and the very final over of the first innings from Ayush Shukla might have picked have a couple of wickets but he conceded 26 runs as well which handed the mental advantage to the opposition going into the break. With the bat, skipper Nizakat Khan made a decent start but lost his opening partner for a duck. It was then Babar Hayat who escaped a stumping chance and mustered up a few runs. But once they lost 4 wickets, it went downhill all too quickly for them and even a couple of little cameos at the death couldn't take them over the 100-run mark.
9:22 AM IST A very commanding victory then for Pakistan and they have taken a big step forward to get into medal contention as they zoom through into the semifinals. After a fairly difficult start with the bat, the middle order managed to get them back into the contest and the stunning cameo from Aamer Jamal allowed them to get over the 150-run mark. With the ball, however, they made a good start as Arafat Minhas got an early wicket. It was quiet for a while but once they got into that middle order, the likes of Khushdil Shah and Sufiyan Muqeem just ripped through. Slowly but surely enough Pakistan got the job done as skipper Qasim Akram himself came on and picked up the final two wickets.

Qasim Akram to Niaz Ali, no run

OUT! IN THE AIR AND GONE! All over for Hong Kong! Qasim Akram flights this up, full and around middle, Niaz Ali goes for the slog-sweep but miscues it in the air towards deep mid-wicket where Khushdil Shah settles under it and takes a fine catch. PAKISTAN WIN BY 68 RUNS!
