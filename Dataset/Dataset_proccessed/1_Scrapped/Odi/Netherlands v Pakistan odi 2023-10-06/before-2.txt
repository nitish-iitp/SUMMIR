ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 POINTS TABLE
The ICC Cricket World Cup get underway in India from October 5. Defending champions England face New Zealand in the opening match, which will be repeat of the 2019 final. The last three World Cups have all been won by the hosting nations -- India 2011, Australia (co-hosts alongside New Zealand) 2015 and England 2019. The final will be played on November 19 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, which will also host the opener, as well as the blockbuster match between India and Pakistan on October 15. The ICC World Cup 2023 will follow the same format as the previous edition four years ago, meaning that all 10 teams will face one another in a round-robin format. This will be the last edition to follow this pattern as ICC is set to announce a new format for the 2027 showpiece event. As per the current format, 10 teams will play every other side once in a single round robin format, with the top four teams going on to the semi-finals. The top team after the round robin will play the team finishing fourth on the table, while the second and third-place finishers will meet in the other semi-final. The winners of each semi-final will meet in the final on 20 November. After India qualified as hosts, the next seven teams were decided by finishing positions in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup Super League, a three-year competition where 13 teams played eight three-match bilateral series each. New Zealand, England, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Australia, Afghanistan and South Africa all progressed to the Cricket World Cup via a top eight position in the competition, while the bottom five went on to the Cricket World Cup Qualifier, joining others from League 2 and the Qualifier Play-off tournament. Sri Lanka and the Netherlands, after finishing 10th and 13th respectively in Super League, progressed to Cricket World Cup 2023 only via the Qualifier.
