England vs Sri Lanka Live Score, World Cup 2023: Sri Lanka beat England by eight wickets

England vs Sri Lanka Live Score, World Cup 2023: Fifth consecutive win for Sri Lanka over England in World Cup matches, which means this has been the result of this particular fixture for the past 20 years. Another gigantic loss for England and this might just be the death knell for their chances. They now need to beat every team they play next and hope that a plethora of results go their way. How impressive have Sri Lanka been today. Nissanka finished it off with a six off the fourth ball of the 26th from Rashid. He is unbeaten on 77 off 83, Samarawickrama on 65 off 54. This is a shellacking and this will do a lot of good for Sri Lanka's chances as well. That is that from here today, thanks for joining in!
