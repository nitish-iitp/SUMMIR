South Africa vs Bangladesh Highlights: Cricket score and updates from ODI World Cup SA vs BAN

South Africa vs Bangladesh Highlights: SA captain Aiden Markram opted to bat first after winning the toss. They have made one change – Lizaad Williams is in for Lungi Ngidi who has a niggle. Bangladesh have been bolstered by the return of their maverick captain Shakib Al Hasan who replaces Towhid Hridoy.

South Africa will look to build on their superlative performance against the defending champions when they take on a struggling Bangladesh in their World Cup match here on Tuesday, knowing well that taking the foot off the pedal at this stage could spell trouble. South Africa were off to a flier when they thrashed Sri Lanka and Australia by 100-plus margins, but a shocking defeat against the Netherlands pegged them back before they demolished England by 229 runs to put their campaign back on track.

Bangladesh might not look too threatening in the World Cup but their record against the Proteas, especially in World Cups, gives them more than a chance in the contest.

ICC World Cup: Schedule | Results | Points Table | Most Runs | Most Wickets

Three of South Africa’s six defeats to Bangladesh in ODIs have come in the last four years, including when the Tigers beat them by 21 runs in the 2019 World Cup. In their four meetings so far in World Cups — 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019 — the Proteas have lost to the Asian rivals twice — 2007 and 2019. The Proteas can ill-afford to take Bangladesh lightly knowing the damage they have inflicted and the fact that the Asian side is packed with all-rounders, namely their skipper Shakib Al Hasan and Mehidy Hasan Miraz among others.

For Bangladesh, captain Shakib remains a concern as he did not not bowl in their practice session here on Sunday. The all-rounder suffered a quad injury against New Zealand in Chennai on October 13, and has not been in the playing XI ever since with Najmul Hossain Shanto leading the side.

Shanto was confident that Shakib would return to action soon the last time he spoke to the media, and it remains to be seen if the senior-most member in the side is fit enough to take the workload.
