DALLAS — The fourth meeting in the last 40 days between the Dallas Mavericks and Portland Trail Blazers didn’t pose serious implications, but external factors placed a spotlight on the game several hours before tipoff.

Those who braved Thursday’s winter storm across the wet roads of North Texas didn’t do so in vein. The Mavericks rewarded those fans with a 117-111 victory.

The Mavericks exploded for 36 points in the fourth quarter and ended the game on a 17-2 run. After trailing by as many as 12 points, the Mavericks rallied in the fourth quarter to tie the game at 109 with 2:26 left thanks to two free throws by P.J. Washington.

Washington tapped into his clutch gene even further and drained the go-ahead corner 3-pointer to give Dallas a three-point lead, leading to a timeout by Blazers coach Chauncey Billups. The Mavericks sealed the victory after a three-point play by Quentin Grimes, who sent the fans inside the arena into a frenzy.

With the win, the Mavericks have won their last two games without Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, while clinching the season series against the Blazers 3-1. Dallas is now 22-16 with two upcoming games against the Denver Nuggets.

Before the theatrics of the final quarter, Thursday’s game belonged to Jaden Hardy. The fourth-year guard exploded for 18 points through the first two quarters and knocked down a season-high four 3-pointers in the second quarter. He led the Mavericks by scoring a season-high 25 points.

Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups was well aware of Hardy’s recent surge from beyond the 3-point line entering Thursday’s game. He was among several mentioned as Mavericks players who were playing well with Doncic and Irving sidelined with injuries.

Hardy entered the game leading the NBA in 3-point percentage (55.6% with a minimum 25 attempts) since Dec. 28. He knocked down five of nine from beyond the arc on Thursday.

Washington was one of two Mavericks with a double-double of 23 points and 13 rebounds. Dereck Lively II added a season-high 21 points and a season-high 16 rebounds. He was one shy of his career highs in points and rebounds.

The game’s start time was moved up an hour due to snowy weather across the Metroplex. Instead of 7:30 p.m., the teams faced off at 6:30 p.m. The NBA also postponed Thursday’s game between the Lakers and Charlotte Hornets because of the fierce wildfires raving across Los Angeles.

The first 5,000 fans in attendance who braved the weather conditions received Daniel Gafford pins.

Mavericks coach Jason Kidd addressed the earlier tipoff time during his pregame press conference.

“Both teams agreed to move the game up,” Kidd said. “I think we’re ready to go. It was talked about this morning. Hopefully Portland can get out of here safe to their next destination.”

The Blazers will return home to face the Heat on Saturday, while the Mavericks will host the Denver Nuggets in the first of two consecutive games on Sunday.
