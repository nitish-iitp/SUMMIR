Veteran point guard Russell Westbrook delivered his best performance as a Denver Nugget during Tuesday's 144-139 overtime road victory over the Brooklyn Nets. Afterward, he credited Brooklyn's bench for motivating him amid his early-season struggles.

Denver signed Westbrook to a two-year, $6.8 million contract over the offseason. The former MVP was projected to give the franchise a playmaking and scoring boost off the bench while providing valuable veteran leadership.

However, Westbrook experienced difficulty making a positive impact over his first three outings. He averaged 5.7 points, 3.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.3 steals per game, shooting only 20.0% as the Nuggets fell to 1-2.

Amid Westbrook's shortcomings, some began questioning his fit with Denver and whether he deserved to be a key part of the team's rotation. However, the nine-time All-Star silenced some of his doubters on Tuesday. He recorded a season-best 22 points, five assists, one steal and two 3-pointers, shooting 41.7% in just 21 minutes.

Westbrook's offensive contributions helped the Nuggets secure their second consecutive overtime road win after dispatching the Toronto Raptors 127-125 the night before.

Following Tuesday's victory, Westbrook was asked about "talking, pointing at and referencing Brooklyn's bench pretty much all night," and how that "feistiness fired (him) up." He quipped that the Nets inadvertently triggered his competitive spirit, allowing him to break out of his slump.

"They learned the hard way," Westbrook said. "I'm one of the most competitive to play the game. When they wanna raise their level, I raise my level."

While just one game, Russell Westbrook's vintage-like performance should be an encouraging sign for Denver fans concerned about his ability to be a consistent difference-maker.

Denver's second unit elicited concern to start the season, as it struggled to generate consistent production. However, the Nuggets' bench stepped up its play against the Nets, scoring 39 points after tallying between 11 and 24 points over the previous three games.

According to Russell Westbrook, he and his fellow reserves played more aggressively on defense, sparking their offense.

"Just being aggressive," Westbrook said. "For us, it was more defensively, getting some stops, changing the pace of the game a little bit. So, we did a good job of that tonight."

Westbrook and the Nuggets (2-2) will look to win their third straight game and move above .500 when they visit the Minnesota Timberwolves (2-2) on Friday.
