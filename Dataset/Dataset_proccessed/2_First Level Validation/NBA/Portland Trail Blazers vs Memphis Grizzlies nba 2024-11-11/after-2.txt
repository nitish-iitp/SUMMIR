Life in the NBA moves fast during the regular season. That speed was evidenced by the Portland Trail Blazers hitting the practice floor Monday morning in Tualatin.

Less than 24 hours earlier, the Blazers got demolished by the injury-riddled Memphis Grizzlies, 134-89, and Portland head coach Chauncey Billups laid into his players about a lack of effort in the postgame press conference. On Tuesday, the Blazers will take the floor again for the first leg of a back-to-back against the title-contending Minnesota Timberwolves. Portland has to move on and bounce back quickly.

“We still got a lot of games left. We can’t be too deflated right now,” Blazers forward Toumani Camara told reporters after Monday’s practice. “We just need to figure it out.”

Along with Camara, Blazers centers Robert Williams III and Donovan Clingan talked with reporters Monday about the vibes of the team and the process of regrouping after that rough loss. Above all, Williams said he and the other players need to get out of their own heads and put their teammates first.

“[Monday’s practice included] a lot of addressing each other, addressing the elephants in the room, holding each other accountable,” Williams said. “Just resetting and getting the teammate feeling back between us and the coaches and getting the joy back.”

“We’re really just trying to stick together and realize what we’re doing wrong and what we gotta be better at,” added Clingan. “... We just got to get better as a team, we gotta stay together and we’ll be good.”

In all three interviews, “sticking together” was a common message from the players. Another common theme was the importance of communicating through their problems. After the loss Sunday, Jerami Grant had said postgame the players needed to hold a meeting to find solutions to their issues.

I asked Williams if they held that meeting Monday or scheduled it. Williams said there was no formal meeting scheduled, but the players addressed the issues and held each other accountable during Monday’s film session and in text messages following the loss. He said the fact they were even having those conversations marked “a big step” for this team.

“I remember last year, even earlier in this year, we wouldn’t address it,” Williams said. “But now we have the confidence to go to each other and address it, and we see a positive message coming from it after. It’s not negative criticism, it’s all positive, and we respond well to it.”

Camara said that constructive conversation during practice between players and the coaching staff was “needed” and “productive.” He said Billups was the one who started and led the discussion, but several players shared their thoughts.

“It’s something that [Billups has] been doing pretty good is to show that he’s trying to lead us in the in the best way that he can,” Camara said. “A lot of us participated in the conversation. I think everybody had their roles to be played, and we have a lot of leaders in the team that were vocal today and were able to speak their mind.”

The players were asked Monday about Billups’ postgame locker-room address to the team Sunday, which presumably included some of the same fiery remarks he shared with media after the loss. They didn’t seem to mind the content and tone of Billups’ message.

“He was fired up, he was mad. He had every right to be,” Clingan said. “We didn’t show up to play the way we were supposed to, and Coach made sure we knew that.”

“He told us what we needed to hear, man,” Williams added. “We played soft last night. We laid down. He hates that. We hate that.”

Moving forward, the Blazers’ game on Tuesday is a rematch with the same Timberwolves team that beat Portland on Friday, 127-102. A reporter asked Camara what the team needs to do to have a better outcome this time around. First and foremost, Camara said they have to focus on themselves as a team:

“I think, where we are today, the only focus is us. We can’t really get too ahead of ourselves. We need to figure out what we got going on first before we worry about other teams, so I think we just got to play our way, be ourselves, and stay true to what the coaching staff is trying to pour into us and stay positive.”
