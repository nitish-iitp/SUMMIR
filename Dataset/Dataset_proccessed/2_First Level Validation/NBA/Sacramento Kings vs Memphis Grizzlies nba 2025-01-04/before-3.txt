Poll
Do you think the Texas Legislature will pass a bill that decriminalizes possession of misdemeanor amounts of marijuana?
1. Yes. A similar bill passed the House in the last session but didn’t receive a Senate vote.
2. Yes. Gov. Greg Abbott has expressed support for such legislation, freeing up courts and jails.
3. No. This is still a political issue and the Legislature moved farther right in the last election.
4. No. Perhaps it will pass a bill addressing medical marijuana, but nothing beyond that.
5. Unsure. It’s hard to say. We’ll have to see what bills are introduced in the coming days.
