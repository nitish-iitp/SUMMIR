Shorthanded Warriors can't hold off Pacers on Friday night

After securing a much-needed win over the Detroit Pistons on Thursday, the Golden State Warriors didn't have much time to celebrate with the second leg of a back-to-back slated for Friday against the Indiana Pacers. For the second game of their current four-game road swing, the Warriors were without multiple key veteran players, including Steph Curry, Andrew Wiggins and Draymond Green.

Without the firepower of Curry and others, the shorthanded Warriors couldn't pace Indiana's duo of Tyrese Haliburton and Pascal Siakam. Haliburton tallied 25 points, 10 assists, three steals and two rebounds while Siakam added 25 points and nine rebounds in Indiana's 108-96.

Former Pacer Buddy Hield helped lead the Warriors with 17 points on 6-of-19 shooting from the field with three made 3-pointers. Friday marked Hield's third straight game with double-figure scoring numbers.

After Gui Santos stepped up on Thursday against the Pistons, Friday was Pat Spencer's night off the bench. Spencer notched a new career-high with 18 points on 7-of-12 shooting from the floor in 20 minutes.

Rookie Quinten Post made an appearance on Friday, scoring six points in seven minutes off the bench. The rookie out of Boston College buried his first career 3-pointer against the Pacers.

After a back-to-back, the Warriors will get the weekend off before traveling north for a contest with the Toronto Raptors on Monday.
