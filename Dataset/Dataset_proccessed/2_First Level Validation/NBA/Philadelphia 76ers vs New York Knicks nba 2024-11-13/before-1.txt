November 12, 20249:38 AM EST

The Philadelphia 76ers (2-7) remain home to meet the New York Knicks (4-5) on Tuesday for their first 76ers Cup Night presented by Chick-fil-A. The Sixers enter the matchup after a 107-105 overtime victory Sunday over Charlotte, while the Knicks fell to Indiana, 132-121, in Indianapolis. It is the front end of a back-to-back for both clubs, with the Knicks hosting Chicago and the Sixers set to host the 12-0 Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.

Below are a selection of stats ahead of Tuesday’s NBA Cup contest…

Jared McCain (career-high 27 points), Guerschon Yabusele (career-high 20 points), and Jeff Dowtin Jr. (11 points, one off his career high) combined to score 58 points off the Sixers’ bench against the Hornets.
Both Sixers wins this season required overtime on a Sunday (at Indiana and vs. Charlotte).
With his fourth assist last time out, Philadelphia’s Kyle Lowry moved past Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer Tony Parker on the NBA’s all-time assists list and has 7,038 for his career.
Caleb Martin recorded the sixth four-steal game of his NBA career for the Sixers on Sunday night against Charlotte. His first such performance was for Charlotte against Miami (Mar. 11, 2020) and his most recent - prior to Sunday - was for Miami in Philadelphia (Mar. 18, 2024).
The 2024-25 Knicks boast the second-rated offense in the NBA (119.5 points per 100 possessions) through their first nine games.
Philadelphia leads the all-time regular season series 265-208 overall and 149-71 at home.

HOW DOES THE NBA CUP WORK?

The Emirates NBA Cup 2024, the NBA’s second annual in-season competition, divides all 30 teams into six groups (three in each conference), with “Cup Nights” taking place on Tuesdays and Fridays from Nov. 12 through Dec. 3.

Along with Philadelphia and New York, East Group A this season also includes Orlando, Brooklyn, and Charlotte.

The Sixers play each of the other four teams in their group once - two home and two away. Eight teams total (four per conference) will advance from Group Play into the Knockout Rounds: the six group winners and one wild card from each conference with the next-best record.

Knockout-Round matchups are single-elimination and the Quarterfinals will be played in NBA team markets, before the Semifinals and Championship shift to Las Vegas on Dec. 14 and Dec. 17.

All contests count towards the regular season except the Championship.

76ERS-KNICKS INJURY REPORT

Joel Embiid was not listed on the injury report entering gameday morning. Tyrese Maxey (right hamstring strain) remains out for the Sixers. Precious Achiuwa (left hamstring strain) and Mitchell Robinson (left ankle surgery) are out for the Knicks. Miles McBride (left knee inflammation) and Cameron Payne (left hamstring strain) are questionable.

QUOTE TO NOTE

Jared McCain on guarding LaMelo Ball in overtime…

“For me, it’s kind of just being quiet. Everything is so loud around you, so just locking in on the ball and having a quiet mind. My psychologist calls it ‘feel the dance,’ and I just feel the flow and feel the dance and just wanted to get a stop, that’s all I wanted.”

FOLLOW ALONG

Tuesday’s game is a 7:30 p.m. ET start in Philadelphia.
