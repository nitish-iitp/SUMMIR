Joel Embiid Stats Tonight: How did 2023 NBA MVP play fare in season debut vs Knicks after injury return? (Nov. 12) (Image Source: Imagn)

Joel Embiid made his season debut against the New York Knicks on Tuesday in the 2024 Emirates NBA Cup opener. The 2023 MVP returned from a nine-game injury and suspension absence. Embiid was out managing his left knee, which kept him out for six games. The NBA suspended him for the last three after engaging in a physical altercation with a reporter.

Embiid didn't have the return he would have hoped for, as the 76ers lost 111-99. It was a close game until the third quarter, but New York created a significant separation in the final quarter. Embiid struggled in his first game, failing to catch a rhythm.

Joel Embiid game recap vs Knicks

Embiid's anticipated return started with him setting up his new teammate, Paul George, from the elbow. However, the following possessions didn't go his way. He missed a couple of shots and gave up eight points against Karl-Anthony Towns in the first four minutes.

Embiid seemed gassed during that span and even asked to be subbed out. He returned with two minutes left in the first quarter, hit a couple of free throws and set up Guarschon Yabusele and Jarred McCain for 3s to record his second and third assists of the night.

Embiid continued scoring from the free-throw line in the second quarter. He missed all three shots but went 8 of 8 from the charity stripe to finish the first half with eight points. The Sixers trailed 54-50 entering the halftime break. Despite not making a shot from the floor, Embiid's impact was visible, and he returned with a +2 +/-, the highest among the starters.

Joel Embiid finally made a shot from the field in the third quarter. He went 2 of 6, including a 3-pointer. Unlike the first half, he didn't get to the line. However, Embiid didn't have to. He impacted the game with his playmaking and defense. He added another assist and a block to his tally.

Embiid's struggles continued in the fourth quarter. He could produce only three more points as the 76ers lost 111-99 in his first game, dropping to 0-1 in the 2024 NBA Emirates Cup.
