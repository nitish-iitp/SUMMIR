Is Karl-Anthony Towns playing tonight against Charlotte Hornets? Exploring 4x All-Star’s status for preseason game (Oct. 15) (Image Credit: Imagn)

Karl-Anthony Towns is ruled out to play against the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden. The four-time All-Star wasn't listed on the New York Knicks’ injury report but will rest tonight and isn't featured on the Knicks lineup tonight.

Since being acquired by the Knicks from the Minnesota Timberwolves on Oct. 2, Karl-Anthony Towns has hit the ground running for New York. He has played in all three of New York’s preseason games, with the Knicks going undefeated. After Tuesday’s game, they play their final preseason matchup against the Washington Wizards on Oct. 18.

Towns started his Knicks career against the Hornets on Oct. 6, finishing the game with 10 points in 15 minutes. In his next game against Washington on Wednesday, Towns took off, registering 25 points and 12 rebounds in 28 minutes. Against his former team, the Timberwolves, on Sunday, the center had 16 points and 16 rebounds.

After the trade, there were questions if New York had given more than that was necessary for the former No. 1 draft pick. However, if the small sample size is to be considered, pairing Towns alongside Jalen Brunson could prove to be a masterstroke.

While Towns is expected to play, the New York Knicks will be without Mitchell Robinson (ankle), Kevin McCullar Jr. (left knee), Jacob Toppin (sprained ankle) and Pacome Dadiet (finger). The Hornets are expected to be without Nick Smith Jr. as he recovers from a groin injury.

Karl-Anthony Towns felt “weird being on the other side” of Timberwolves

After spending the first nine years of his career with the Minnesota Timberwolves, Karl-Anthony Towns was expectedly shocked by the trade. However, he has had time to settle in with the New York Knicks. After facing his former team on Sunday, Towns said (via Sports Illustrated):

“It’s weird being on the other side but seeing the Timberwolves jersey. A lot of emotions. I had amazing moments and years of my life in Minnesota, a place I call home, so ... guys that are not just teammates, but they’re my brothers, real-life brothers. Wild day.”

While the jitters of playing for a new team are expected to stay until the regular season kicks off, Karl-Anthony Towns was brought in by the Knicks for a reason. If he and Brunson can combine to form a lethal duo, New York’s title drought since 1973 could end next year.
