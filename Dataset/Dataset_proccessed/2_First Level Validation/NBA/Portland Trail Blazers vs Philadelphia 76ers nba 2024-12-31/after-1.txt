The Last Games Of 2024 And Greg Oden Returns On The Brief Case, Episode 126
Casey Holdahl
December 31, 20249:53 AM PST

Greetings from North Portland. With the Trail Blazers finishing off their 2024 Monday night versus the 76ers at Moda Center, it seemed like a good time to get in one last edition of The Brief Case, presented by Spirit Mountain Casino, before starting anew in 2025...

Topics on this edition, which I recorded in two parts (though in retrospect, what was the point?), include...

• Finishing up 2024 with an ugly game versus the 76ers Monday night at Moda Center

• Portland's starting lineup having one of their best games of the season in a victory versus the Mavericks on Saturday

• The recent play of Deni Avdija, Shaedon Sharpe and Scoot Henderson

• Nate Bjorkgren filling in for Chauncey Billups

• One last reminder about New Year's Eve at Spirit Mountain Casino

• Greg Oden's return to Portland, his visit to the practice facility and his thoughts on how he looks back on his time with the Trail Blazers

Consider getting a jump on your "listening to more podcasts" New Year's resolution by subscribing to The Brief Case on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Youtube, IHeartRadio, Amazon Music, TuneIn, Podcast Addict, Podchaser, Pocket Casts, Deezer, PlayerFM. Talk again in 2025!
