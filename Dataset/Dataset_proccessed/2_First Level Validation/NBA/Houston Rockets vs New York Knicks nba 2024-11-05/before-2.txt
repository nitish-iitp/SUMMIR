Reed Sheppard Stats Tonight against New York Knicks (Nov. 4). [photo: Imagn]

Reed Sheppard and the Houston Rockets hosted the New York Knicks on Monday. The rookie didn’t play in the first quarter but started in the second period. Rockets coach Ime Udoka kept him on the floor for roughly five minutes.

Sheppard immediately contributed. He drilled a 28-footer off an Amen Thompson pass. Three plays later, he missed an open 3-pointer before Udoka took him out for Dillon Brooks.

The No. 3 pick in this year’s draft did not get many minutes, with Jalen Green and Fred VanVleet given the lion’s share of the playing time among guards.

Reed Sheppard’s first action in the third quarter happened with 2:49 left. Ime Udoka sent him in to give Fred VanVleet a breather. Sheppard took on the unenviable task of shadowing Knicks superstar Jalen Brunson, who dropped seven points to close the third frame.

The rookie guard showed flashes of what he could do. He was a good fit regardless of who he shared the floor with. Finding rhythm, though, has been a challenge as Udoka has him on a short leash.

The former Kentucky star started the fourth period and contributed two points on 1-for-3 shots. He was taken out for good with 5:28 remaining in the game for Jalen Green.

Reed Sheppard hardly gets playing time with the Houston Rockets

Reed Sheppard's competition for minutes are Jalen Green and Fred VanVleet, arguably the Houston Rockets' best scorers. Before struggling against the Knicks' OG Anunoby and Mikal Bridges, Green had been on a tear, which means Ime Udoka is unlikely to reduce his minutes for Reed Sheppard.

Sheppard could also earn minutes from the point guard spot but VanVleet's leadership and experience are too valuable. Udoka has consistently gone to the veteran for his poise, shooting and playmaking over the rookie.

The former Boston Celtics coach is also unlikely to take out Dillon Brooks to accommodate Sheppard. Brooks is the Rockets' best perimeter defender. Alperen Sengun is untouchable while Jabari Smith Jr. complements Sengun well.

For Sheppard to get more minutes, he must work hard on both ends for Udoka to trust him. The rookie did not play more than eight minutes in his past four games but had 14 on Monday, a good sign for the combo guard.
