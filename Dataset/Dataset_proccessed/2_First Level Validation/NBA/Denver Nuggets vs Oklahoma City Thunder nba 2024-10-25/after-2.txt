Chet Holmgren, player for the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Oklahoma City Thunder was already a contender for everything before the start of the 2024/25 NBA season. After their first game, it is undeniable that their project is special. OKC has crushed the Denver Nuggets in both teams' debut, with a score of 102-87.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, with 28 points, 7 rebounds, and 8 assists, has been one of the two standout performers of the game. Because the MVP of the night was none other than Chet Holmgren, who, with 25 points, 14 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 4 blocks, made life difficult for Nikola Jokic.

This news is an automatic translation. You can read the original news, OKC Thunder va muy en serio: Paliza a los Nuggets de Jokic en el primer partido
