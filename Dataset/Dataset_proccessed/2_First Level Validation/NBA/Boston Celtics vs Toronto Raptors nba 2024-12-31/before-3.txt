The Toronto Raptors and the Boston Celtics duke it out at the TD Garden on Tuesday night. Here’s a Toronto Raptors vs Boston Celtics Prediction. This article will include a Toronto Raptors vs Boston Celtics Pick.
Toronto Raptors 

The Toronto Raptors have been in a real slump as they've lost 13 of their last 16 games overall and they will be hoping to arrest a 10-game losing streak after getting run over by the Hawks in a 136-107 loss on Sunday. Scottie Barnes led the team with 19 points, eight rebounds, and five assists, RJ Barrett added 17 points with six rebounds and four assists while Jakob Poeltl chipped in with 13 points, six rebounds, and three blocks. As a team, the Raptors shot 44 percent from the field and seven of 24 from the 3-point line as they made a run in the second quarter to stay within striking distance of the Hawks, only to get blown out by 72-49 in the second half to fall to 7-25 on the season and 6-11 at home. The Raptors will meet the Nets, Magic, Bucks, Knicks, and Cavs after this game.

Boston Celtics 

Meanwhile, the Boston Celtics have been in a rut as they've lost four of their last six games overall and they will be hoping for a better result after getting beaten by the Pacers in a 123-114 loss on Sunday. Jaylen Brown led the team with 31 points and six assists, Jayson Tatum added 22 points with nine rebounds and six assists while Payton Pritchard chipped in with 21 points off the bench. As a team, the Celtics shot 46 percent from the field and 16 of 54 from the 3-point line but they weren't at their usual standards on the defensive end and were always fighting an uphill battle after allowing 38 points in the second quarter to trail by 16 points. Al Horford had a rough game as he scored just five points on two of 12 shooting while battling foul trouble all night. 

Why the Boston Celtics will win
The Raptors have lost each of their last 13 road games against Atlantic Division opponents.
The Celtics have won each of their last 10 day games.
The Celtics have covered the spread in eight of their last nine games following a home loss.
The Raptors have failed to cover the spread in nine of their last 11 road games against Atlantic Division opponents that held a winning record.
Total Points Facts
Each of the Raptors' last five day games has gone OVER the total points line.
Six of the Celtics' last seven games as home favorites against opponents who are on the first leg of a back-to-back have gone OVER the total points line.
Toronto Raptors vs Boston Celtics Prediction

The Raptors are still keeping eyes on Bruno Fernando, Davion Mitchell, and Gradey Dick who are all questionable, while the Celtics have listed Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis as questionable also. The Raptors come into this game as one of the coldest teams in the league and they must be low on confidence after getting smashed by the Hawks in their last outing. Meanwhile, the Celtics have been playing a little below their best lately as they have been missing some starters, but this looks like a matchup that shouldn't give them too much trouble. The line was always going to be big for this one, but almost 20 points is a lot for any NBA game. With that being said, I am sure the Celtics win this one with ease, but I think the Raptors can hang around long enough to get a cover on the road.
