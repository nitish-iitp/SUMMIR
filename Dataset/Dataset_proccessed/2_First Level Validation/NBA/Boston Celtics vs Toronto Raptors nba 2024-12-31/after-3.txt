12/31 Game Preview: Raptors at Celtics

The Toronto Raptors will attempt to end a 10-game losing streak when they visit the Boston Celtics on Tuesday afternoon.

Among Eastern Conference teams only Washington has a worse record than Toronto, which is 1-14 in road games this season. The Raptors committed a season-high 31 turnovers in Sunday's 136-107 loss to Atlanta.

"I just feel like our effort has to be better," Toronto's Scottie Barnes said. "It's on us. No matter if we're tired, we have to push through that. This is the NBA, so there's no excuse there.

"We just have to be better defensively, guard the ball better, help each other more. Rebound. Do those things and just get back to winning. This isn't fun losing games by 30. This isn't who we are, and we can't just keep allowing it to happen. At some point we have to stand up and we have to put up a fight."

The good news is the Raptors are getting closer to full strength. Center Jakob Poeltl returned to action Sunday after missing four games with a strained groin, and forward Bruce Brown made his season debut following arthroscopic surgery last summer.

Rookie guards Jamal Shead and Ja'Kobe Walter also returned after missing time with injuries, but Immanuel Quickley is still working his way back from an elbow injury and hasn't played since early November.

Toronto will be seeking its first victory since it beat Indiana 122-111 at home on Dec. 3.

The Celtics have their own issues. Boston's 123-114 loss to Indiana on Sunday dropped the team's record to 1-3 in its last four home games. The Celtics have lost four of their last six games overall.

"We've got to get back to emphasizing the defensive side of the ball," Jaylen Brown said. "It's kind of slipped over the last few games, our intensity. Teams are pressuring us and being physical with us. We've got to do the same stuff back to them. We did some good stuff in spots, but just not enough.

"We've had some great moments this season and maybe some comfort has slipped in. Offensively, we're fine. I just think defensively we've got to find ways to get more stops and be more consistent protecting the basket, helping each other, communicating. We just didn't emphasize that enough. Defense is something that you've got to have effort. We haven't had as much intensity and effort that we need. That's pretty much it."

Boston has played its last three games without Jrue Holiday (shoulder) and its last two without Kristaps Porzingis (ankle).

"Winning in the NBA is hard," Jayson Tatum said. "We gotta understand that. We know that. Everybody is confident in our abilities and who we can be as a team. We just gotta do it. Hasn't been the best stretch for us. That's OK. Nobody's panicking or anything like that. We just gotta be better."

Tuesday's game will be the second meeting between the Celtics and Raptors this season. Tatum connected on a 3-pointer at the buzzer in overtime to give the Celtics a 126-123 victory in Boston on Nov. 16.

Tatum had 24 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists in the win. Poeltl led Toronto with 35 points and 12 rebounds. He was 16 of 19 from the field.
