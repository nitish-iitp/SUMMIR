Talk about closing the year with a bang.

The Toronto Raptors — in a performance that sums up the team's 2024 — had their doors blown off in a 125-71 loss to the powerhouse Boston Celtics on New Year's Eve.

The 54-point deficit is the worst in franchise history, eclipsing the previous mark of 48 set in a 133-85 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves in April of 2024.

It also means that the Raptors will end 2024 on the back of an 11-game losing streak, and more specifically, a streak of four blowout losses with a combined deficit of 126 points.

Toronto's 71 points were the lowest they've had since scoring 66 in a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies in 2005.

The Celtics did most of their damage in the third quarter, outscoring the Raptors 45-18 in the frame using an onslaught of three-pointers to pull away and close out 2024 with a blowout.

Boston made 10 of 12 shots from beyond the arc in the period. Tatum hit four threes and Jrue Holiday and Sam Hauser each hit two as Boston shot 74 per cent for the period.

Jrue Holiday returned after missing three games with a right shoulder injury, finishing with 14 points. Payton Pritchard scored 19, Derrick White had 16 and Hauser finished with 12 points. Jaylen Brown added 12 points and nine rebounds in the win.

Scottie Barnes led Toronto with 16 points and 13 rebounds. Jakob Poeltl grabbed 13 rebounds for the Raptors, who went 2-11 in the month of December.

Takeaways

Raptors: Toronto never recovered after committing 12 turnovers in the first half while shooting just 29.5 per cent (13 for 44) in the first two periods. It only got worse in the third quarter as the Celtics more than doubled the Raptors’ scoring.

Celtics: Boston led 90-53 by the end of the third quarter and rested its starters in the fourth.

Key moment

After missing their first nine shots and falling behind 6-2 early, back-to-back 3-pointers by White and Holiday midway through the first quarter started the Celtics on an 8-0 run that put Boston in front for good.

Key stat

Boston forced 21 turnovers while committing just 13.

Up next

The Raptors are home Wednesday against the Nets. The Celtics open 2025 on the road Thursday at the Minnesota Timberwolves.
