Bulls guard Zach LaVine has complete understanding of his situation
It hasn’t always been easy for LaVine to figure out his relationship with the franchise, but he has now. And until his situation changes, he is all about leaving the Bulls in a better place than he found them.

Bulls guard Zach LaVine hasn’t always agreed with how the organization has viewed him, but that has changed with the start of the 2024-25 season. There’s an “understanding” he has about how to handle his business and he’s doing just that so far.

ATLANTA — Bulls guard Zach LaVine always has been comfortable in his own skin.

Being comfortable in his standing with his team is where things have gotten dicey.

Whether it’s because the Bulls let him hit the market as a restricted free agent in 2018, took their time in deciding whether they wanted to offer him a max contract in 2022 or have floated his name in trade rumors for more than two years since, LaVine’s relationship with them is complicated, to say the least.
