*Special Situations*

SOME of the videos for this game have audio with me talking over it (again, I welcome any and all feedback on these)

Just wanted to give everyone a heads up in case you were watching at work or somewhere quiet and weren’t expect them to have noise (don’t want anyone getting in trouble haha)

Also, my wife fell asleep mid 3rd quarter while I was watching soooooo had to stop doing the voice overs at that point

***We talked Pistons ONLY for 30+ minutes on Game Theory***

***Shameless Plug of The Pistons Pulse w/Omari Sankofa II***

Should mention that this was a really good start from Detroit

Would have been easy to look at the opponent and come out slow, especially on the road but they have immediately jumped out to a lead here

Little 1st quarter run from the Nets to cut it down to 5….can Detroit immediately respond?

Cade attacks and gets to the FT line, get a stop and Holland with a TOUGH transition finish with his left hand

Wilson answers with a 3PM, teams getting into a little bit of a flow now

Yup, we have a tie ball game as Brooklyn has made some shots and found themselves offensively

Have actually lost the lead here early in the 2nd quarter, would be great to see them steal back momentum sooner rather than later

Pretty good response here as they immediately make a push to go up 7 before forcing a TO, can they keep the momentum ATO?

Eventually go on a 9-0 run in the 2nd quarter and starting to assert their will again

Solid finish to the 1st half (until the VERY end) which is what quality teams do, they find ways to pull away…..a really quality team would come out of halftime and extend it even further

Looks like they had a chance to put them away in the 3rd quarter but get a little lacks on the defensive end and give up some C&S 3PMs

Followed by some bad TOs and the Nets are right back in the game

WHAT A RESPONSE!!!

Extend it all the way out to 20

If I could sum up this season in 1 word through 36 (37 after this one) games it would be….

RESPOND (this team always responds after a loss, after getting down, after an unfortunate injury)

IF they win Thursday night vs the Warriors give an assist to this 2nd half and allowing just a touch of extra rest to some of the starters

Pistons

Cade, Beasley, THJ, Harris, Duren

OFFENSE

We see an action that continues to build off itself with multiple options

Beasley and Fontecchio playing above the rim in the 1st half wasn’t something I had on my bingo card for this game

DEFENSE

Across the board I feel like their hand placement in potential passing windows is an area that they can grow

Off ball communication (or miscommunication is another area)

One where I don’t think they should have switch and then a second where I do think they should have switched but didn’t (both lead directly to points for Clowney)

Not sure I have a strong feeling one way or the other but I wonder if Detroit has played the fewest amount of possessions in Zone of any team in the NBA? (not sure where to look up that stat)

I honestly have no direct memory of any this year

Do feel like we have seen quite a bit of defensive disruption in the 1st half and that has led to transition points

Happens AGAIN off a nice block from Duren that turns into 3PM for Beasley

BEASLEY starts off with a 3PM tonight!

True HIGH GLASS finish that George Blaha had to love

CADE AS A SCREENER???

You can’t help off of him so if he sets a solid screen it is going to draw two (just like an attack of the basket)

LOVE seeing him use the extension on these finishes

He does it again, I think this could be a huge growth with his finishing around the rim

He truly looks like he is just chillin (and not in a negative way because I think the defensive engagement has been good)

Some really smooth drives and finishes

Seems like he could go get a bucket about anytime he wanted BUT he isn’t forcing it and just hunting those….picking his spots and keeping other involved

The one negative is still the turnovers

Has thrown a couple rocket passes which I just wanted to make note of because changing the velocity of your passes is so important and you see the full range with him

HARRIS with some really nice creation here in the first few possessions

DUREN has done a really nice job adding the little bounce pass behind him to let teammate come right off into a jump shot or drive

Feel like he has done a really nice job giving his chest on these drives from Claxton

He has missed a couple box outs on him in the 1st quarter though

One resulted in a foul and the other in a kick out corner 3PM

Would love to see Duren stay involved on the boards even when he contests a jump shot

Tends to drift on towards HC after he contests

Has an AWESOME transition post here late in the 2nd quarter

Honestly, would have loved if Sasser would have passed it to him for the catch and finish but as it were it still turns into a “highway screen” on the Sasser drive (just misses it)

THIS would be the counter to my above argument on staying involved in the DREBs

Couple very nice blocked shots in the 2nd quarter

THJ defensive energy is really good in the 1st quarter as well

It is even a Pistons game in ‘24-25 season if he doesn’t take a charge??? I don’t think so

HOLLAND finishing some of these tough buckets is so impressive

Feel like we have seen him use his left hand a lot so I went back to my pre draft notes and I did make mention of it in those

*Quite a few left hand attempts (even if not always successful)*

WOW…that is a TOUGH PnR roll man catch and finish in the 3rd quarter

Also, makes a couple very unselfish plays in transition on back to back possessions

I said the entire pre draft process that this kid was NOT selfish, he just struggled with decision making at times and these two plays highlight that

Another really nice pass in the HC to Stew, been a heck of a passing quarter

****I WENT ON NO CEILINGS AND DISCUSSED HOLLAND FOR 30 MINUTES***

STEW has lost guys at the 3P line a little more than I would like

Especially because we know he can move his feet on a closeout

If you look at his synergy FG% against, defending the 3P line is actually the area where he is more “average” than “good” or “excellent”

Awesome rotation block on Evbuomwan and follows up with one in the ball screen (refusal) a couple possessions later

AND ANOTHER one on the Claxton grab and go attempt

Which leads DIRECTLY to transition points on the ensuing possession

They keep testing him and he keeps letting them know that he protects the rim and surprise surprise it leads DIRECTLY to Beasley transition layup

Decision making and flow of actions from one to the next has been solid in the 1st half

Plays the ball handler perfectly and reads him like a book on the PnR lob pass contest

Also, notice at the start of the clip that Stew communicates (judging by where he is moving and where the screen is happening he wants Sasser to “ICE” the screen but you can see his reaction when Sasser doesn’t do it) so the fact that Stew is still able to get back in position and make a play is even more impressive

FONTECCHIO WITH THE POSTER DUNK!!!

Okay, I guess I should be quiet about not putting the ball on the deck, wow

Next two drives not as fruitful

Passing decision TO and missed floater followed by another miss high off the glass

First drive in the 2nd half he converts…been a little bit more of a mixed bag tonight as opposed to overly negative

Continues to find ways to be impactful on the OREBs

Best game he has played all season???

YES SIR!!!! C&S SHOOT THAT THING!!!

SASSER looks REAL comfortable with that jab step 3P pull up jumper

BUT I LOVE that C&S 3PM even more

BUT……him hitting that stepback is kind of sweet though!!!

That jumper is PURE tonight

And think about what this has done

Builds his confidence BUT also because he (and Fontecchio, among others) have made shots in the 2nd half it has allowed all of those other guys to play far less minutes than normal on the first night of a back to back

KLINTMAN first NBA minutes!!!

Nets

Johnson, Martin, Williams, Clowney, Claxton

Just a flat out not very talented offensively talented team with everyone that is out for this game

This really stands out with the amount of passes that are off target and not completed and just inability to make shots at a quality level

Honestly, reminds me of watching some of these Pistons games we have had to watch over the past few years

Have seen MANY NBA teams play zone this year but theirs looks the most “matchup” to me

Whether by Detroit lapses or just running good stuff they have created some good looks here in the 1st half off designed actions

The offense is ROUGH on the possessions they don’t get into something though

CLAXTON with the nice little lefty floater

Making “floaters” at over 50% on the season

Even hits a face up jump shot

WILLIAMS has some intrigue as a defender with his size and length

Just doesn’t have the 3P% to put with it

JOHNSON has a smooth looking jumper but the %s sure do not back that up

CLOWNEY 3P shooting has been solid but has struggled inside the 3P line

Shows off a good looking stroke here in the 1st quarter

Continues to knock down shots

Goodness, he has not been shy in the 1st half

Why not when you are shooting like he is right now

MARTIN has probably been the player that has caught my eye the most in the early going

6’6 Guard out of UConn

BEEKMAN shows off his elite hands defensively on a possession vs Harris in the post

Pretty sure my scout notes said that he probably had the best defensive hands in the class

Just doesn’t have the offensive game to go along with it

Yes, appreciate the voice overs!

I was surprised George and Greg didn't go back and highlight that high glasser.

Thanks Bryce.
