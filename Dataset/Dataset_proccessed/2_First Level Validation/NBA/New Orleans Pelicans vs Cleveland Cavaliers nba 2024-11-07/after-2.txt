New Orleans (3-6) had three 20-point scorers Wednesday, but couldn’t get over the hump against unbeaten Cleveland, as the Cavaliers held off the hosts and improved to a franchise-record 9-0 via a 131-122 victory.

Watch postgame video reaction from Willie Green, Zion Williamson (29 points) and Jose Alvarado (27 points, 7/7 three-point shooting).

Check out action photos from Cavs-Pels.

The Pelicans will travel to Orlando this morning, then practice in Central Florida later today. New Orleans visits the Magic (3-6) at 6 p.m. Friday (GCSEN, WWL).

New Orleans will be off Saturday, then practice Sunday afternoon in the Ochsner Sports Performance Center. Friday’s Pelicans Podcast will feature a radio roundtable with analyst John DeShazier and sideline reporter Erin Summers.
