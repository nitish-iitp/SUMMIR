Sixers at Brooklyn Nets: Game Preview, Injury Report, and How to Watch 01/04/2025

For their sixth consecutive road game, the Philadelphia 76ers (13-19) come back across the country to visit the Brooklyn Nets (13-21) on Saturday evening. The Nets last posted a 113-110 victory Thursday at Milwaukee, while the Sixers took a 139-105 loss at Golden State.

Below are Six Stats to know ahead of Saturday’s contest…

Philadelphia’s Tyrese Maxey tallied a game-high four steals against the Warriors and ranks second in the NBA in steals per game (2.2).
More on Maxey via 76ers PR: Thursday was Maxey’s fifth game this season with four-or-more steals (T-2nd in NBA) after having three such games across his first four NBA seasons. Since Dec. 23, Maxey is averaging 26.8 points, 7.0 assists, and 3.0 steals per game, the only player league-wide with such numbers over this stretch.
Maxey is the first 76er since Hall of Famer Allen Iverson (Nov. 18-Dec. 3, 2006) and the fourth 76er to average at least 25 points, five assists, and three steals over a six-game span. Only Maxey, Iverson, Charles Barkley, and Julius Erving have done so.
The all-time series between the 76ers and Nets favors the Sixers, 126-90, including a 113-98 Sixers’ win in Philadelphia on Nov. 22. The two teams will meet twice more in February.
Saturday will mark just the 15th home game of the season for the Nets, while the Sixers will still have played the fewest home contests in the NBA (14, tied with UTA).
Brooklyn enters their three-game homestand with four consecutive home losses.
76ERS-NETS INJURY REPORT

The Sixers’ injury report against the Nets includes Joel Embiid (left foot sprain / right sinus fracture - mask) as questionable and Kelly Oubre Jr. (left hand sprain) as doubtful, while KJ Martin (left foot stress reaction) and Jared McCain (left knee meniscus surgery) remain out. For the Nets, Noah Clowney (left hip contusion) and Cam Thomas (left hamstring strain) are questionable, Cam Johnson (right ankle sprain) is doubtful, and Bojan Bogdanovic (left foot injury recovery), Maxwell Lewis (left tibia fracture), De’Anthony Melton (left knee ACL tear), and Trendon Watford (left hamstring strain) are out.

QUOTE TO NOTE

76er Paul George on if the loss to the Warriors is just a throwaway or has takeaways…

“Both, you know, you have some of these games where you just come out flat. But definitely learned the pace that they played at, and player movement, ball movement, 40-something assists. That’s great basketball.”

Saturday’s game is a 6 p.m. ET start in Brooklyn.
