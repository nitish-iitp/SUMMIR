San Antonio Spurs star center Victor Wembanyama wasn't in the lineup for Saturday night's game at Dallas because of a right knee contusion.

Spurs interim coach Mitch Johnson said the 7-foot-3 Wembanyama, last year's unanimous selection as NBA Rookie of the Year, is day to day.

Johnson said "a lot of minutes and a lot of shots" will change without Wembanyama.

"Guys need to step up," said Johnson, who has coached the Spurs since Gregg Popovich was sidelined Nov. 2 by what the team called a mild stroke. "We don't need anyone trying to make a whole bunch of plays individually. We need to move the ball, probably play fast and try to continue to maintain our spacing."
