Suns: Phoenix continues to create consternation over what’s wrong. Booker, Durant and Bradley Beal were supposed to form the nucleus of a title contender. Instead, they’ve lost seven of eight and 10 of 13, forcing coach Mike Budenholzer to continue waiting for career win No. 500.

Pacers: Indiana has finally started playing the way it envisioned over these past 11 games. Haliburton is in sync, the defense has improved and the Pacers have won eight times during that span to reach .500.
