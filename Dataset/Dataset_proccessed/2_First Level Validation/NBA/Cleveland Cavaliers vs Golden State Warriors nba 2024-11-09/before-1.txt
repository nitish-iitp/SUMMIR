 Vlad, 8th November 2024, NBA tips, 0 

There are many interesting matchups tonight in the NBA and one of the more exciting ones is a duel between Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors, two teams in great form at the start of the season. The game is scheduled for Saturday, 01:30 AM BST.

In this article, I'll provide a few of my top Cleveland Cavaliers vs Golden State Warriors predictions.

Furthermore, I have also prepared a full Cavs vs Warriors preview, including team form, injuries and other news, along with the latest Cavaliers vs Warriors odds. So, let's take a closer look at this game and what we can expect from it.

Cavaliers vs Warriors predictions

Handicap

Cleveland Cavaliers to win (-4.5)

9/10

Total points

Over 231

9/10

Jarret Allen points + rebounds

Over 25.5

8/11

All odds for my Cavs vs Warriors picks were taken from Paddy Power and are subject to change at any time.

Cleveland Cavaliers to win with handicap (-4.5)

The Cavs remain the only undefeated team in the league after the Nuggets have beaten OKC Thunder a couple of nights ago. However, GSW have also been great, losing just one game so far and this should be a very interesting duel.

That being said, I expect the Cavs to end up winning this match more convincingly that the bookies expect. The Warriors are deep and their bench has been great, contributing as many points as their starting five so far. However, the Cavs have a much better starting lineup and that usually makes a difference, so with them also playing at home, the Cavs to win by five or more points is my first Cavs vs Warriors prediction.

Over 231 total points

Looking at the recent H2H history between these teams, not many games have gone over this line, but this season so far tells a different story since the Cavs and the Warriors are two of the three best offensive teams, at least if we look at points per game.

In this category, Cleveland are at the top with 123.2 points per game, while the Warriors are averaging 121.1 points per game. It might be a simplistic look at things, but I expect these teams to come out guns blazing and give us a spectacle on offence, which is why over 231 total points is one of my Cavs vs Warriors picks.

Jarret Allen over 25.5 total points + rebounds

The final of my Cavs vs Warriors tips is for Jarret Allen to combine for at least 26 points and rebounds. The 26-year-old centre has been in great form this season, averaging 15.1 points per game and 11.9 rebounds per game.

On top of that, he failed to notch 26 points + rebounds in just two of the nine games he played in so far and against the Warriors, who often play small-ball without an imposing presence under the basket, Allen should have a good opportunity to do this once again.

Cavaliers vs Warriors preview – teams news, injuries, and predicted lineups

While Cleveland was seen as one of the better teams in the Eastern Conference without a doubt, I bet no one expected them to start the season with nine wins in a row and be the last team without a loss. Yet, here we are, and the Cavs are looking like a true championship contender early in the season.

Meanwhile, Max Strus, Emoni Bates, and Dean Wade are on the team's injury list heading into this game.

The Cavs enter this match with a 9-0 record.

Cavaliers starting lineup: Garland, Mitchell, Okoro, Mobley, Allen

After losing to the Kings in the play-in last season, the Warriors missed the playoffs and then lost Klay Thompson to Dallas. However, they have a deep team with many young players, aided by the likes of Curry, Green, and Wiggins, which so far seems to work perfectly as the Warriors are sharing the top seed in the West right now.

Golden State might have to manage without Brandin Podziemski, De'Anthony Melton, and Draymond Green tonight, who are all listed as game-time decisions.

The Warriors enter this match with a 7-1 record.

Warriors starting lineup: Curry, Moody, Wiggins, Kuminga, Jackson-Davis
