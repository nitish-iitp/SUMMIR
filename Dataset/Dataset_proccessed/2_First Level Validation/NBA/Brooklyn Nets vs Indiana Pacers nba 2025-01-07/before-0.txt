The threadbare Nets were without eight players in Monday’s 113-99 loss to Indiana, including a decimated backcourt sans point guards D’Angelo Russell and Ben Simmons.

Simmons had been listed with left calf soreness and lower back injury management, though Nets coach Jordi Fernandez suggested it was more the calf than the back.

“D’Angelo had a [right] shin contusion, so we’ll keep him out for [a game], and then we’ll see how he feels,” Fernandez said. “And then with Ben, it’s just management with his calf. So same thing, trying to want him to feel better and see how many days it takes.

“But again, we’re not going to rush him if they’re not 100 percent at play and if it could turn into something worse. For sure, the No. 1 thing for us is their health, their bodies. And we’ll have 10 other bodies to go out there and fight.”

There have been reports linking injured Cam Johnson in trade talks with both the Pacers and Warriors, potentially in a three-way deal. But a source told The Post that reports of anything brewing are “all noise.”

The NBA’s salary guarantee date is Jan. 10. To avoid paying a player on a non-guaranteed contract his full salary teams have to waive the player on or before Tuesday. There are 23 players in that boat, including Jalen Wilson and Keon Johnson. But with both in the starting lineup, that’s not happening.

Johnson started his 14th straight game.

“Great effort obviously starting in defense with his ball pressure,” Fernandez said. “He’s done a great job. That’s one of his superpowers. But then, also a guy that has bought into catch-and-shoot and taking good shots and having the ability to play second-side pick-and-roll. He’s growing. I’ve mentioned it before. Don’t forget he’s 22 years old, even though it seems like he’s been in the NBA for a while.

“But his growth is important for us. Player development is something that we really look week by week or day by day. And he’s a guy that the whole summer, he had an amazing summer. He was here the whole summer, worked, played Summer League. He was great. And you can tell right now his progression. So, you know, we’re happy to see it and we want to see more.”

Johnson had averaged 15.3 points in his past seven games entering Monday.

While he and Wilson presumably are safe, there could be players cut loose who might interest the Nets.

Bojan Bogdanovicć (left foot injury recovery), Johnson (right ankle sprain), Maxwell Lewis (left tibia fracture), De’Anthony Melton (left knee ACL tear), Cam Thomas (left hamstring strain) and Trendon Watford (left hamstring strain) were all out. Dariq Whitehead was called up from G-League assignment.
