NBA fans couldn't believe what the Charlotte Hornets and Chicago Bulls did in their first two head-to-head matchups of the season. The Hornets and Bulls have combined to miss 150 3-point shots in two games, which is a record. They missed 75 on Dec. 13 in Chicago and another 75 on Monday in Charlotte.

In their first meeting earlier this month, the two teams combined to shoot 22-of-97 from beyond the arc. The Hornets were an abysmal 8-of-46, while the Bulls went 14-of-51. They set the NBA record for most combined threes made in a single game.

Fast forward to Monday night, the Bulls shot 60 3s and made 18 of them. The Hornets, on the other hand, went 10-of-43 to tie the previous record for most combined missed 3s in a game.

It highlights the ongoing online chatter about why the NBA ratings are on the decline and the number of 3s being called the culprit. Steph Curry changed the game forever, but it allowed some coaches to believe that they have someone like him on their roster.

The number of misses, 150 in total, showed how much the game has changed for the better or worse. Fans are flabbergasted by the sheer volume of shots from beyond the arc given that the Hornets and Bulls do not have a legitimate 3-point threat.

"Match made in hell," a fan wrote.
"Bad teams playing like they have 2015 Steph n Klay lol Use the rest of the court," one fan suggested.
"Someone tell them they not the Celtics. Stick to 20 attempts a game," another fan commented.

Miles Bridges, who is shooting 27.7% from 3 this season, chucked 13 of them on Monday. Coby White went 1-of-11 from beyond the arc while Bulls center Jalen Smith was 1-of-6 off the bench.

"Clash of trash," a fan quipped.
"Maybe try shooting inside the paint," another fan opined.
"That's some next-level bricklaying," one fan remarked.

According to Basketball Reference, the average number of attempts from 3s this season is 37.6 shots per game. The Boston Celtics take a whopping NBA-leading 50.7 attempts per game, making 36.4% of it.

Fans are blaming the amount of 3s as the main reason why the NBA's ratings are down. Shaquille O'Neal blames Steph Curry for changing the way teams play.

"Steph Curry and those guys messed it up," O'Neal said on 'The Big Podcast with Shaq' last month. "I don’t mind Golden State back in the day shooting 3s, but every team isn’t a 3-point shooter. So why everybody has the same strategy? I think it makes the game boring."

(from 30:00 mark onwards)
