Pelicans Head Coach Willie Green

On CJ McCollum’s 50-point night:

“CJ was incredible tonight. Some of the shots he was hitting tonight. He hit tough ones, he hit easy ones. We just wanted to continue getting the ball to him. He’s such a high-character individual. Every day he comes in, he’s talking to his teammates. Even through the losses, he’s been rock solid for us.”

On starting the third quarter off on a 14-2 run:

“I told them, ‘whichever team is first to get three stops will probably win the game.’ It was an offensive battle. We managed to get more stops in the second half then they did.”

Pelicans Center Yves Missi

On CJ McCollum scoring 50 points tonight:

“It was crazy. That is the first time I’ve seen someone on my team get 50 points, especially in the league.”

On holding the Wizards to 23 points in the fourth quarter:

“Obviously, be more aggressive and then try to play more defense…Communication and try to help each other.”

Pelicans Guard CJ McCollum

On putting on a show for the fans despite everything going on in the world:

“It’s been a rough year for sports fans. I joke about being a Browns fan all the time and how difficult that can be. I think it’s something that we feel. We feel like we’re letting the fans down. We want to win games. We want them to be proud of the team that they support and proud of the team that they go out and cheer for or buy their jerseys, the new cable packages and all of that stuff, but it hasn’t been great. For us, I just think they just need to understand that we are working hard behind the scenes and we understand that there is a lot of season left and we’ve not played well for a lot of the season, and hopefully we can turn it around. It’s nice for them to have something to enjoy for a little bit, to kind of escape everything that may be going on right now.”

On going on runs in the second half to win the game:

“We understood what was at stake. We’ve got five wins, and they have six. We don’t want to be the worst record in the NBA, like you have to have some pride. I think for us, it’s just about building on good habits. Obviously, they’re athletic, they’re fast, they’re young and they’re going to go on runs, but you want to control the half-court, you want to not let them run in transition and get fast breaks. We did what needed to be done, and we have to play better if we want to beat them on their home floor. We’ll get back to the game plan and figure out how to stack some wins, which we haven’t done much this season.”
