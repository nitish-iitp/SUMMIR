History
The Sacramento Kings, led by De'Aaron Fox's 35-point performance, rallied from a 14-point deficit to defeat the Philadelphia 76ers 113-107. This victory marks their second consecutive win under interim coach Doug Christie, following the firing of Mike Brown. Fox was instrumental in the comeback, scoring 14 points in the fourth quarter, as the Kings closed the game with a 19-4 run in the final minutes. Malik Monk contributed 20 points and six assists, while Domantas Sabonis added 17 points, 21 rebounds, and seven assists. Despite Paul George's 30 points for the 76ers, Philadelphia couldn't maintain their lead, struggling in the final stretch. The win was a morale booster for the Kings, who had been struggling with late-game collapses earlier in the season.
Interim coach Doug Christie praised his team's defensive effort, stating, 'That is the type of fight we expect on a night-to-night basis. Across the board so many guys came up huge. Super proud of them.'
De'Aaron Fox's performance was notable not only for his scoring but also for shooting 81.3% from the field, including a remarkable 91.7% on two-pointers.
The Kings closed the game with a strong 15-0 run in the final minutes of the fourth quarter, showcasing their resilience and improved defensive capabilities.
Keon Ellis, starting in place of the injured Keegan Murray, had a significant impact with four steals and two blocks, contributing to the Kings' defensive success against Paul George.
The victory served as a morale boost for the Kings, who had been struggling with late-game collapses earlier in the season, a point emphasized by Fox stating, 'Winning at home always puts you in a good spot.'
