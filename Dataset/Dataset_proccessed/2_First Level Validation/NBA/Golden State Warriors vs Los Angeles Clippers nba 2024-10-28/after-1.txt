The Warriors' hot start to the season might have been dampened.

Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry exited Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Clippers after turning his ankle twice.

The team later announced that he wouldn't return after suffering a left ankle sprain.

Curry seemed to roll his left ankle twice in the outing, with the first instance occurring near the end of the third quarter. The guard subbed out for De'Anthony Melton and Warriors trainers helped him stretch it out and get back into playing shape.

He subbed back in at the 8:08 mark in the fourth quarter but exited on the very next play after seeming to plant his left ankle at a weird angle and re-aggravate the injury. He limped back to his team's locker room with the help of Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy.

Up to that point in the game, Curry had 18 points, four rebounds and six assists in 26 minutes.

Speaking to reporters after the game, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr called the sprain "mild" or "moderate." Curry will get an MRI on Sunday night.

So far this season, the four-time NBA champion is averaging 18.5 points, six rebounds, seven assists and two steals in 26.0 minutes per game.

The 36-year-old has a history of ankle injuries dating back to his first three seasons in the NBA. He played in only 26 games in the 2011-12 season, his third year in the league, after missing stretches of games early into the season and eventually underwent season-ending surgery in April.

However, he has since had a clean bill of health when it comes to his ankles.

He played in 74 games last season, averaging 26.4 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.1 assists and 0.7 steals per game.
