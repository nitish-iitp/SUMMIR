Steph Curry Stats Tonight: How did Warriors superstar perform vs Clippers? (Source: Imagn)

Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors hosted the LA Clippers in their home opener Sunday. Curry has had a subpar start to the season, averaging 18.5 points in two games, shooting 36.7%, including 35.0% from 3. Comparatively, he had a promising game against LA in his third outing.

However, it didn't end well for Curry, as the two-time MVP exited the game with an ankle injury. He sustained blows to the same left leg twice during the game. Once, when he exited the game in the third quarter and got treatment for it, and again after immediately returning to the court.

Here are Steph Curry's stats vs Clippers:

Steph Curry's performance vs. LA Clippers

Curry opened things up for the Warriors, making the first two shots from the field, which came from beyond the arc, before missing his first on a third attempt. He added four assists, a rebound and a block.

Steph Curry's second quarter was decent after he added five points, with one more 3 and two successful trips to the foul line. He also added an assist and was a team-high +7.

His impact was visible as the Warriors struggled in the minutes he wasn't on the court, leading to a five-point first-half deficit. Curry's game came to an early end after he endured multiple injuries to his left ankle. He tweaked it in the third quarter and again after returning in the fourth.

The Warriors were down 10 when he exited the game. Andrew Wiggins tried to keep it close, but it wasn't enough, as the Clippers got 20+ points from three players. Wiggins had 29 points on 11 of 15 shots, but the Warriors lost 112-104. The Warriors are 2-1.

The outcome may have been different if the Warriors had Curry playing. He was in a better rhythm than the previous two outings after shooting over 50.0% from the floor for the first time. The Warriors will hope his injury doesn't hurt them in the long run as their hopes of success rely heavily on Curry without a second bonafide All-Star on the roster.
