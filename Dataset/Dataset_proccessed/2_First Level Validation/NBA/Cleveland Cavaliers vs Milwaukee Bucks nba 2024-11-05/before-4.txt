FANDUEL SPORTSBOOK PROMOS
FanDuel NBA Promo Offer: 25% Profit Boost for NBA SGP Bets on 11/4/24
FANDUEL STAFF
2mo

The NBA is back, and FanDuel Sportsbook has plenty of ways to get in on the action. Ahead of a loaded, 15-game NBA slate, FanDuel Sportsbook has a special promotion for ALL customers.

All customers get a 25% Profit Boost Token for a 3+ leg Same Game Parlay / Same Game Parlay Plus wager on any NBA game(s) taking place on November 4th, 2024!

All 30 teams are in action for Monday's jammed-packed NBA slate, so there is no shortage of basketball to consider using this boost on. Action tips off at 7:10pm ET when the Milwaukee Bucks take on the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Bucks have struggled to a 1-5 record to start the season, and they currently sport the worst record in the Eastern Conference. Cleveland is atop the East and is one of just two remaining undefeated teams across the league.

This will be the second consecutive meeting between the Bucks and Cavaliers. Donovan Mitchell played hero over the weekend, scoring a go-ahead basket with 0.1 seconds left to give Cleveland a 114-113 win on Saturday night.

As a result, the Cavaliers are 7.5-point home favorites as of Monday morning. The total is set at 228.

Full Bucks-Cavaliers odds can be found below, while all NBA odds can be found on FanDuel Sportsbook.
