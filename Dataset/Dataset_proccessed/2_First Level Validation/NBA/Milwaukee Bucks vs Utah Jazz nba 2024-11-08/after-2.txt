Damian Lillard dropped 34 points and Giannis Antetokounmpo added 31 as the Milwaukee Bucks took down the Utah Jazz 123-100 on Thursday, snapping their six-game losing streak.

Lillard also dished out seven assists, while Bobby Portis came off the bench to score 19 points, giving the Bucks a solid boost.

The dynamic duo of Lillard and Antetokounmpo dominated the third quarter, contributing 22 of the team's 31 points. 

By the start of the fourth quarter, the Bucks were in control with an 88-77 lead, and they maintained at least an 11-point cushion for the entire final frame.

Over in Minnesota, Anthony Edwards lit up the scoreboard with a game-high 33 points, along with eight rebounds and six assists, leading the Timberwolves to a 135-119 victory over the Chicago Bulls.

Julius Randle also stepped up, contributing 22 points and 10 rebounds as Minnesota exploded for 45 points in the fourth quarter, handing Chicago its fourth straight loss.

Meanwhile, the San Antonio Spurs clinched a 118-105 win against the Portland Trail Blazers, powered by solid performances from Malaki Branham and Keldon Johnson, who each scored 17 points off the bench.

The Spurs had eight players reach double figures, with Zach Collins, Stephon Castle, and Julian Champagnie all chipping in 14 points. 

Despite strong showings from Deandre Ayton and Jerami Grant, who both scored 21 for Portland, it wasn't enough to avoid their third loss in four games.
