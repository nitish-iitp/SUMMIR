The Washington Wizards won their 6th game (out of 31) of the season on Wednesday night, beating the Chicago Bulls 125-107.

Former Pitt players Bub Carrington and Justin Champagnie both turned in solid games for the Wizards. Both players were in the starting lineup for Washington. Carrington led the team in minutes played with 31, going 4 for 5 from the field, including 3 for 3 from three-point range. He also grabbed four rebounds and passed out six assists. Carrington finished with a +/- rating of 12, third-best on the team on Wednesday.

Champagnie played 21 minutes in the win, scoring 15 points and grabbing two boards. He also had an efficient night shooting the ball, going 6 for 8 from the field and 2 for 3 from three-point range.

Carrington started 33 games for Pitt as a rookie, averaging 13.8 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game. The Baltimore, Maryland native shot 41% from the field and 32% from three-point range in his freshman campaign, and alongside Jaland Lowe and Ishmael Leggett, starred for the Panthers in the back court.

Carrington went No. 14 overall in the most recent NBA Draft, making his way from the Portland Trail Blazers to the Washington Wizards via trade. Carrington was the first player drafted in the first round from a Jeff-Capel-led Pitt team.

Champagnie played two seasons at Pitt from 2019-21, earning All-ACC honors in 2020-21. He started 46 games in his Panther career, averaging 14.7 points and 8.5 rebounds per game in his collegiate career. In his stellar sophomore campaign, Champagnie averaged 18 points and 11.1 rebounds per game in 20 games. He went un-drafted out of Pitt but has now been on several NBA teams and has shined in the NBA G-League as well.
