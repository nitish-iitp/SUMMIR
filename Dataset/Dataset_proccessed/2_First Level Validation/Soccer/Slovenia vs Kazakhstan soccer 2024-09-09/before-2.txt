Can Slovenia Take Full Advantage of Kazakhstan’s Struggles?
Kazakhstan’s attacking woes continue
Kazakhstan have failed to score in four of their last five matches, with their latest performance against Norway yielding zero shots on target. This lack of offensive threat makes them unlikely to trouble Slovenia’s defence, especially with Jan Oblak returning in goal.
Slovenia’s dominance at home remains a strong factor
Slovenia are unbeaten in their last 11 home matches across all competitions, a run that includes eight victories. Their defensive stability in Ljubljana has been key, and this form is likely to continue against a Kazakhstan side struggling for form.
Sesko’s reliability in front of goal
Benjamin Sesko continues to be Slovenia’s most dangerous player, having scored 12 international goals at just 21 years old. He converted a penalty in their last match against Austria and will be crucial in unlocking a Kazakhstan defence that managed to shut out Norway.

Slovenia to Win to Nil @ 22/25

Reasoning
The best bet for this match is Slovenia to win without conceding. Slovenia's defensive strength, home advantage, and Kazakhstan's recent scoring struggles make this a likely outcome, especially with Jan Oblak bolstering Slovenia's backline.
Odds subject to change



	

Slovenia are set to host Kazakhstan in their second UEFA Nations League match at Stozice Stadium, with both teams coming off draws in their opening fixtures. Slovenia, having drawn 1-1 against Austria, will feel they missed an opportunity to grab all three points, while Kazakhstan will take confidence from their goalless draw with Norway. Both teams will be eager to secure their first victory of the campaign, but Slovenia’s home advantage and superior form make them favourites in this contest. Despite Slovenia’s struggles in recent matches, the visitors’ inconsistent performances might tip the balance in favour of the hosts.

The atmosphere in Ljubljana is expected to be electric, with Slovenia seeking to break a winless streak that has seen them draw six consecutive matches. Despite this frustrating run, they have shown resilience by avoiding defeat in regular time across their recent fixtures. Kazakhstan, on the other hand, are hoping to break their own winless run, which extends to five games. Their defensive display against Norway provided a glimmer of hope, but they face a much tougher test away from home. All signs point towards a closely fought encounter, with Slovenia likely to edge proceedings.

The standout prediction for this match is Slovenia to win without conceding. This selection is supported by several factors, including Slovenia’s stronger squad, home advantage, and Kazakhstan’s recent scoring difficulties. Kazakhstan managed to keep Erling Haaland and Norway at bay in their last outing, but they were largely toothless in attack, failing to register a shot on target. With Slovenia possessing a more cohesive attacking unit and a much more experienced goalkeeper in Jan Oblak, the chances of Kazakhstan breaching Slovenia’s defence appear slim.

Kazakhstan’s recent attacking stats further highlight their limitations going forward. The Kazakhs have scored just once in their last five outings, and their match against Norway saw them manage only four total shots, none of which tested the opposition goalkeeper. Against a more defensively sound side like Slovenia, it’s difficult to see them improving much in terms of attacking output. With Slovenia boasting solid possession statistics and averaging 28 clearances per game, their defensive organisation should be enough to stifle Kazakhstan’s limited forward play.

From Slovenia’s perspective, their home form has been solid, having remained unbeaten in their last 11 matches across all competitions. Although they have struggled to score frequently in recent games, their defence has remained tight, with no goals conceded in several crucial moments. The anticipated return of Jan Oblak, one of Europe’s top goalkeepers, will further strengthen their backline. Oblak’s presence alone significantly reduces the chances of Kazakhstan breaking through, as Slovenia will be aiming to maintain defensive solidity throughout the 90 minutes.

As BettingTips4You.com expert Wolfgang Shotten emphasises, “Slovenia’s defensive organisation, combined with Kazakhstan’s scoring troubles, makes this the ideal bet. Slovenia should dominate without much threat from the visitors, securing a clean sheet in the process.” Given the circumstances, a Slovenia win to nil appears to be the most secure bet for this fixture.

Correct Score Prediction: Slovenia 2-0 Kazakhstan

With the defensive qualities of both sides in mind, a 2-0 victory for Slovenia feels like the most probable outcome. Slovenia are expected to control possession and apply consistent pressure on the Kazakhstan defence, but their own goal-scoring form has been somewhat lacklustre. Despite creating several opportunities against Austria, they only managed to convert once, and this has been a recurring theme throughout their recent matches.

Slovenia’s reliance on players like Benjamin Sesko and Andraz Sporar means they should create enough chances to find the net at least twice, but expecting an attacking explosion is unrealistic given recent form. The team have only scored more than two goals in one of their last 13 matches, indicating that they may struggle to break down deep defensive blocks. However, Kazakhstan’s limited attacking potential and Slovenia’s ability to control the tempo should keep this match in the hosts’ favour, allowing them to score twice without significant resistance.

Kazakhstan’s defensive structure, as seen against Norway, is capable of withstanding pressure for extended periods, but they eventually look vulnerable. As fatigue sets in, Slovenia’s attacking options should find the gaps necessary to secure the second goal late on, which will confirm a comfortable yet unspectacular win. A 2-0 victory, in line with Slovenia’s overall form and Kazakhstan’s lack of threat, appears to be the most fitting outcome.
