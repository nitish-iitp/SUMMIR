-A summary that ties it all together and produces a favorable betting outcome for today’s game between Slovenia vs Kazakhstan. 

Slovenia Betting Preview

Slovenia faced off against Austria in the first UEFA Nationals League Game and they were able to play a 1-1 draw. The only goal for Slovenia came in the 16th minute by Benjjamin Sesko on a penalty kick. Slovenia ended up finishing with 37 percent of the possession and one shot on target. At this point it doesn’t appear that any injuries happened in the first game and they could end up playing the same lineup. In this game Slvenia is going to need to get out to a fast start with the offense and really put the pressure on. Jan Oblak is expected to move into the starting lineup in goal here. 

Kazakhstan Betting Preview

Kazakhstan faced off against Norway in the first game and they were able to squeak out a point with a 0-0 draw. Kazakhstan had 29 percent off the possession and zero shots on target. They dind’t play bad, they just didn’t get a whole lot of offensive chances. Abat Aymbetov is probably the best player on this team and they are going to need more production here. If they don’t get the scoring chances early, this could end up being a very long game. 

Slovenia vs Kazakhstan Prediction

I just don’t see how this Kazakhstan team finds many scoring chances. They don’t have a whole lot of offensive playmakers and they are going to really struggle here. Slovenia is going to get out to a fast start with the defense and they are going to dominate here. Kazakhstan isn’t going to have even a scoring chance and Slovenia isn’t going to score more than once. Back the under 1.5 goals to cash here.
