How France could line up against Chile

Didier Deschamps is expected to make numerous changes to his France side ahead of the visit of Chile to the Stade Velodrome on Tuesday night.

France were beaten 2-0 by Germany on Saturday in Lyon, as Deschamps gave opportunities to players who may not usually be first choice.

Kylian Mbappe was among the starters and should keep his place, but there could be as many as eight or nine alterations for this encounter.

Brice Samba had an excellent game in goal and kept the scoreline down for Les Bleus, but AC Milan's Mike Maignan is likely to come back in between the sticks.

The entire back four could change, as central defensive pairing Dayot Upamecano and Benjamin Pavard are set to make way for William Saliba and Ibrahima Konate.

At full-back, Theo Hernandez could replace his brother Lucas Hernandez, while there may also be a spot for Jonathan Clauss if Pavard does not move over from centre-back.

Olivier Giroud remains in good form for Milan and could also come into the side here, with his contribution to the French setup still vitally important.

Another player who may keep his place is young Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Warren Zaire-Emery, who got just his second cap against Germany after making his debut in the 14-0 win over Gibraltar.

There is no Antoine Griezmann in the squad though, as his injury means the 84-game streak he had managed in the French side is now over.

Kingsley Coman and Boubacar Kamara are also absent with injury, while Jean-Clair Todibo and Axel Disasi were left out by Deschamps.

France possible starting lineup:
Maignan; Clauss, Saliba, Konate, T Hernandez; Zaire-Emery, Tchouameni, Camavinga; Kolo Muani, Giroud, Mbappe
