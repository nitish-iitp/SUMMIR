Spain Berlin-bound

It's time for me to wrap up this live blog. Sad, I know.

We now know half of the Euro 2024 final in Berlin, as Spain took down France to earn their place in Sunday's showpiece.

Luis de la Fuente's young exuberant side once again showed why they are the best team in this tournament, ripping apart the best defence of this Euros.

It didn't start well for them, though. Randal Kolo Muani headed France ahead after just nine minutes.

But then stepped up Spain's 16-year-old superstar, Lamine Yamal. The teen sensational produced a moment of magic to fire Spain level, and only four minutes later Dani Olmo smashed them in front.

The lead was never relinquished and Spain are in the final of a major international tournament for the first time in 12 years.

Who will they face, though?

Tomorrow it's England's turn and you simply won't want to miss it.

I will be there, and I know all of you will be too, and more! until then, get some rest, it's going to be a massive night.

Goodbye!

22:26
More Fan Reaction...
James, London: I feel sorry for the team who make it to the final to play Spain on Sunday.
Dave, Banbury: I hope England lose tomorrow save the embarrassment of losing to Spain on Sunday.
Mohamed, UAE: The final has been played already... Neither England nor Holland could beat these two teams... Spain will roll over whoever reaches the final!
22:22
Micah Richards: 'Spain are favourites'

Micah Richards, former England defender, speaking on BBC One:

The worries I had about this Spanish team, they answered tonight, But just how they can adapt to situations, and when you have pace on the wings you always have a chance. They look really balanced and I think they are favourites.
22:19
Pick of the stats!

Let's have a look at some of the best statistics from a magical night in Munich:

Dani Olmo became the first Spanish player to score in three successive games at the UEFA European Championship finals, while his five-goal involvements at Euro 2024 (3 goals, 2 assists) is the most by a Spaniard at a major tournament since David Silva at Euro 2012 (2 goals, 3 assists).
Spain are only the second side to reach as many as five finals of the UEFA European Championship after Germany (6).
France opened the scoring and lost for only the second time in a game at the UEFA European Championship finals after a 3-2 defeat to Netherlands in the group stages of Euro 2000.
Kylian Mbappé has now been involved in 11 goals in 12 knockout stage games for France across World Cups and Euros combined (8 goals, 3 assists).
Randal Kolo Muani has been involved in five goals in his last five starts for France in all competitions (4 goals, 1 assist), while he became just the third player to score for Les Bleus in the semi-finals of both the World Cup and Euros after Michel Platini and Zinedine Zidane.

SOFASCORE STATS: Spain 2-1 France

Erm... These are not the stats of that game, surely?

I thought that was one of the games of the tournament. It ebbed and flowed. there were flashes of brilliance with regularity.

These statistics don't show that. There were only 15 shots between the two sides. Only five of them were on target.

This is why we watch football with our eyes.

22:10
Young Yamal

OK, this one has sent me over the edge...

I have just figured out that Lamine Yamal would have been 12 when the COVID lockdown began in March 2020.

If that doesn't make you feel old, I don't know what will.

22:08
Luis de la Fuente: 'A tough of genius from Yamal'

Luis de la Fuente, Spain boss, on Lamine Yamal in his post-match press conference:

We saw a touch of genius from a footballer who we all need to take care of. I would like him to work with the same humility and keep learning with the same attitude and maturity he shows on the pitch. Hopefully, we can all enjoy him for years to come.

22:04
Another semi-final defeat for France

If you're French, this statistic is going to hurt.

France have been knocked out at the semi-final stage of a major tournament since Euro 1996.

Only Germany have been eliminated from major tournaments at the semi-final stage more often among European sides than France, who have failed at this hurdle six times.

It will never get easier.

21:57
Alan Shearer: 'France so frustrating'

Alan Shearer, former England captain, on BBC One:

France had the advantage of scoring that goal. So many times they were getting into good positions but so frustrating when you get in there that they were delivering balls which were not a good ball and nothing happens.
21:54
Ineffective Mbappe

This really wasn't Kylian Mbappe's tournament.

The French forward is one of the best players in the world because of how clinical he usually is.

That can't be said about his time in Germany this summer.

23 shots without scoring from open play is extremely poor for a player of his calibre.

Normally he'd bag at least two or three of those.

21:50
Rio Ferdinand: 'Yamal always makes the right decision'

Rio Ferdinand, former England defender, on BBC One:

Yamal plays like someone who has been playing for a long time. He makes the right decisions in the right moments.
The simplicity with which he plays, it is so rare. Normally you come in and you're trying to prove yourself and you try too hard. He always makes the right decision.
21:47
Man of the Match: Lamine Yamal

Oh my word, I am so shocked... NOT.

As soon as that ball went in the back of the net from Lamine Yamal's boot, I was pretty sure he would be Man of the Match.

And well, he is.

Not only was his goal ridiculous, but he did all the small things right. His delivery is always perfect, he drives the team forward, and he had France's full-backs in a daze.

So it's no surprise he won this.

21:41
The youthful Yamal

I've just been thinking about Lamine Yamal, and he is making me feel really old... I turn 24 on Friday!

Yamal was only 11 years old when I finished school, and only 13 when I decided I wanted to be a journalist.

When I was 16, I was watching season two of Love Island instead of revising for my GCSEs (sorry Mum).

I know which life I would rather have at that age...

21:36
Fan Reaction...
Tony, Stockport: What a wonderful goal from a quite magnificent young talent.
Spain fan, London: We beat Italy, we beat Germany and now we beat France. Who have England and Netherlands beaten? France and Germany are way better sides than England and the Dutch. Yamal is on a different level. Vamos!
Ceejay, Nigeria: 16-year-old old sensation Yamal along with Olmo are some special players! This Spanish team has no weakness and I don't see anyone stopping them from winning EURO 2024.
21:30
'Spain by far the best'

Aadam Patel, Mail Sport, in Munich:

Spain. The best and most entertaining team of the tournament, by far. That Lamine Yamal moment will live long in the memory.

21:28
France's faltering attack

That goal I have just shown you is the only goal France scored from open play all tournament.

The reason they are being criticised so much is because of how disappointing their attack was in this tournament.

With the talent they have at their disposal, you just expect so much more from France.

They leave Munich with their tale between their legs.

21:25
WATCH: Kolo Muani opens the scoring

It all started so well for France...

After failing to score in open play all tournament, it took them just nine minutes to do so in this semi-final.

Credit where credit is due, it's a fantastic cross from Kylian Mbappe and a great header by Randal Kolo Muani.

It was all downhill from there.

21:22
Morata's final now in doubt?

Oh dear, another pitch invader has caused chaos.

There have been so many of them this tournament and now one may have ruined Alvaro Morat's hope of leading his country out in the final.

As Spain were celebrating, an invader raced through them after being chased by security.

One of the guards then slipped and took out Morata, who twisted his knee in the process.

The Spain skipper went off the pitch wincing, it didn't look good at all.

Let's hope it's not too serious. It would be a real shame.

21:17
Spain make history

The records just keep on tumbling with Spain and their squad.

They have become the first team ever two in six matches in a European Championship without needing penalties.

Winning is all that Spain know, they have won 12 competitive matches on the spin.

One more, and glory will be there's!

21:11
What next for the French?

Micah Richards, former England defender, speaking on BBC One:

We have never questioned France before because they have got over the line. They are playing horribly and they haven't won so where do they go from here?

I feel this is a bit harsh. France still have a young side and are led by Kylian Mbappe - they will be OK.

21:09
WATCH: Mbappe's big miss

This is the moment France, and Kylian Mbappe, will look back on and regret.

As the winger races through you are just expecting him to finish, it's his signature move after all.

So when the ball sailed over the bar I was stunned, and so were the French crowd.

Just imagine if he had scored...

21:07
Despair for the French

It just wasn't to be for France.

Tonight was their best performance in this tournament by some distance, but the fluidity of Spain just proved too much for them.

They came into this tournament as favourites with England, but after several sub-par displays, they have been sent packing.

Their devastation is clear to see on their faces.

21:03
'England or the Netherlands will have to raise their game'

Matt Barlow, Mail Sport, in Munich:

Whoever takes Spain on, be it England or the Netherlands will have to raise their game to face opponents superior by some distance to anything they have yet to face, here in Germany.
21:01
Chris Sutton: 'Spain deserved it'

Chris Sutton, It's All Kicking Off! co-host, on BBC Radio 5 Live:

Spain deserved it, they have been the outstanding team and they had top work at it in the second half. They limited France to few chances and that moment from Lamine Yamal with a brilliant finish - people will be talking about it for years to come.
20:59
A star is born

This was the Lamine Yamal semi-final.

When people look back on this game in a decade's time, they will remember the day a 16-year-old star tore apart one of the best teams in the world.

If you didn't know about him before, you certainly do now.

Not only was his goal sensational, but he caused France problems for large parts of tonight.

He is only going to get better and better.

20:57
Spain's time has come again!

Wow, this Spain side really are sensational, aren't they?

After their youthful exuberance put them in a strong position at half-time, their grit and determination got them home.

Their players are now celebrating with the fans. Those Spaniards in the stands have been waiting over a decade for this feeling.

The good days are well and truly back!

20:54
FULL-TIME: Spain 2-1 France

Spain hold on!

After 12 years of hurt, Luis de la Fuente has guided them back to a European Championship final.

The Spanish places are away in celebration while the French drop to their knees in despair.

In the end, attack really does beat defence.

It's fully deserved, they have been the best team at Euro 2024 by a clear margin.

20:53,
95'
Spain 2-1 France

The final minute is now here.

France just need to pump it in the mixer, that's their only hope at this stage.

Spain fans are whistling...

20:52,
94'
SUBSTITUTION: Spain 2-1 France

A memorable night for Lamine Yamal has come to an end as he is replaced by Ferran Torres.

If the result stays as it is, it will be remembered for his moment of magic to level the scores on 21 minutes.

Nico Williams is also replaced as Martin Zubimendi comes on.

20:51,
93'
Spain 2-1 France

I may jinx Spain by saying this, but France really do not look like scoring in this stoppage time.

It really doesn't look like they believe they will either, their attacking potency has dropped.

20:49,
91'
YELLOW CARD: Spain 2-1 France (Yamal)

Now Lamine Yamal goes into the book for stopping a France counter-attack.

He won't care about that, and neither will his team-mates. The set-piece ends up with Dayot Upamecano heading well wide.

20:48
FIVE added minutes

France have just five minutes to save their tournament.

They really are running out of time, and their hope is draining with it.

Can they get one more big chance?

20:47,
89'
YELLOW CARD: Spain 2-1 France (Camavinga)

The Spain bench races to the touchline in anger as Eduardo Camavinga goes in late on Marc Cucurella.

It is very naughty from the Frenchman and he gets a yellow card for it, unsurprisingly.

20:45,
87'
BIG MISS! Spain 2-1 France

Oh my word, I'm in shock, Kylian Mbappe has just blazed miles over the bar.

Mbappe has Spain back-tracking, he then cuts inside on the edge of the area and you think it's curtains for the Spanish.

But he smashes the ball miles over. Very unlike him.

is he going to rue that missed chance come full-time?

20:41,
84'
OUCH! Spain 2-1 France

Aymeric Laporte is currently rolling around on the floor with blood all over his face.

It looks painful, very painful, but it was an accident involving Olivier Giroud.

He just needs the special sponge and he will be OK.

20:40,
82'
CLOSE! Spain 2-1 France

Stop that Lamine Yamal, just stop it!

It's nearly de ja vu for the teenage sensation as he cuts in from the right 25 yards out and decides to have a pop.

He nearly produces a carbon copy of the equaliser, but the ball flies inches over the bar.

So, so close.

20:38,
80'
Spain 2-1 France

10 minutes plus stoppage time to go, can France get the goal to take this match further?

They are trying their hardest, but at the moment Spain are holding on.

20:37,
79'
SUBSTITUTION: Spain 2-1 France

It's time for Olivier Giroud.

He comes on for Ousmane Dembele at the ripe old age of 37 years old.

He is certainly going to change the dynamic of this match.

20:36,
78'
SUBSTITUTION: Spain 2-1 France

Luis de la Fuente does decide to make some moves.

Alvaro Morata and Dani Olmo are being hooked after both putting in brilliant shifts, especially Olmo.

The two Mikel's are now on, Oyarzabal and Merino.

20:34,
77'
CHANCE! Spain 2-1 France

Was that the chance for France?

Antoine Griezmann clips a lovely ball to the back post with Ousmane Dembele lurking.

The ball then bounces to Eduardo Camavinga, who sets up Theo Hernandez who is in acres of space in the area.

He just has to put the ball on target, but he leans back and blazes over.

Hernandez puts his hands to his head... he knows.

20:32,
74'
Spain 2-1 France

Luis de la Fuente needs to start thinking about making some changes soon.

His side are finally having a bit of the ball for what feels like the first time in forever.

They aren't looking threatening, though.

20:31
Chris Sutton: 'Spain lost control'

Chris Sutton, It's All Kicking Off! co-host, on BBC Radio 5 Live:

Spain are trying to draw the French team onto them and it's not been a comfortable second half for them. They haven't found their rhythm or control.
20:29,
71'
Spain 2-1 France

Bradley Barcola steams down the left-hand side in style, but his cutback isn't met by any of his teammates.

The PSG man is so direct, and he is starting to unsettle the Spanish backline.

20:27,
69'
Spain 2-1 France

Spain don't quite look the same team that they did earlier.

France are growing in confidence, are getting more of the ball, and limiting Lamine Yamal's involvement.

This is a good spell for the French.

20:22,
64'
CHANCE! Spain 2-1 France

France are already ramping up their attacking intent.

Just like Aurelien Tchouameni should have scored his header from a corner earlier, Dayot Upamecano has to do better.

He meets the corner poorly and heads the ball into the ground and over.

20:21,
63'
SUBSTITUTION: Spain 2-1 France

Didier Deschamps has seen enough and he is not holding back.

Eduardo Camavinga, Antoine Griezmann, and Bradley Barcola are all on for France.

Adrien Rabiot, N'Golo Kante, and Randal Kolo Muani are off.

20:20,
61'
YELLOW CARD: Spain 2-1 France (Tchouameni)

It's taken a while but we now have our second booking of the game.

Aurelien Tchouameni is the recipient and it comes after some good forward play from the French.

But Unai Simon did well to deny Kylian Mbappe from turning home inside the six-yard box.

20:18,
59'
Spain 2-1 France

Now that is cheeky from Nico Williams.

He nutmegs Jules Kounde and the crowd reacts with an 'oooo'.

But Kounde saves his embarrassment and manages to knick the ball back.

20:16,
57'
SUBSTITUTION: Spain 2-1 France

Jesus Navas is struggling and his night is well and truly over.

He is replaced by Dani Vivian, who isn't actually a right-back. It needs to be done, though.

That is surely the last time we see Navas in major tournament football at international level.

What a career he has had.

20:15,
56'
Spain 2-1 France

Jules Kounde is gassed as he just about gets to the ball ahead of Nico Williams as the forward is racing through into the box.

France then counter and the ball ends up in the path of Kylian Mbappe. He drives the ball low and hard towards goal but Unai Simon collects comfortably.

20:12,
54'
CHANCE! Spain 2-1 France

Oh, Aurelien Tchouameni, you have to do better...

The Frenchman rises highest from a corner to meet the ball, and he is unchallenged.

I was expecting the header to cause Unai Simon all sorts of problems, but it's a tame effort and easy for the keeper to collect.

He simply has to connect better.

20:11,
52'
Spain 2-1 France

That's a bit better from France.

Of course, it's Ousmane Dembele at the centre of it. He brings the ball down ridiculously well, but his end product is lacking.

They need more of that, France.

20:08,
50'
Spain 2-1 France

New half, the same pattern of play.

It is just too easy for Spain to pass around this France team, it's a joy to watch.

Like a flash, they work the ball to the left before Marc Cucurella fires a ball across the six-yard box.

William Saliba just does enough to deny Alvaro Morata.

20:05,
47'
Spain 2-1 France

Mike Maignan is either brilliant or he is lucky...

Nico Williams is racing onto a lovely slide rule pass from Alvaro Morata, and he looks away.

But Maignan commits to racing miles out of his goal, and I mean miles, to clear the ball.

The keeper just about gets there first.

20:03,
46'
SECOND HALF: Spain 2-1 France

Just like the first-half, that break just flew by!

We are now back underway in Munich as Spain get the ball rolling.

No changes from either side for this half.

20:02
Golden Boot chaser

Dani Olmo is well in the hunt for the Golden Boot after that goal.

He is level with Cody Gakpo on three goals at the top of the pile, but his two assists on top of that mean he leads the race.

Olmo would not have been my guess for the top scorer at the start of the tournament.

He has been ace, though!

20:00
WATCH: Olmo turns it around

This goal ain't too shabby either!

The way Dani Olmo twists and turns inside the area is exceptional. The French defenders would have been seeing stars.

Jules Kounde may have deflected the ball in, but there is no taking that goal away from Olmo.

It was definitely heading for the corner.

19:57
'Special is an understatement'

Aadam Patel, Mail Sport, in Munich:

I think I've watched the replay of that Yamal goal at least ten times already. Special is an understatement.
19:56
Alan Shearer: 'Yamal's goal outrageous'

Alan Shearer, former England captain, on BBC One:

Just incredible. We've been talking about him all tournament and saying what a ridiculously young age it is. To do that, it's just outrageous. It's that late he shouldn't even be up at night never mind playing in the semi-finals of a European Championship!

19:53
Yamal makes more history

It was already a historic night for Lamine Yamal, but he just can't stop breaking records.

With that crackerjack of a goal, Yamal has now become the youngest player in history to score in a major international tournament.

What were you doing at 16?

Don't answer if you're Luke Littler...

19:52
WATCH: Yamal nets a screamer

Goals don't get much better than this.

At this point, France were getting real joy on the counter-attack, and Spain were struggling to cope.

Then Lamine Yamal decides to do this.

My mouth was fully agast as this hit the back of the net, it really was some strike.

Now you can watch it over, and over again, below.

19:47
HALF-TIME: Spain 2-1 France

It's time to catch our breath!

The referee brings an end to one of the best halves of football we have seen in this tournament.

And it's Spain that go into the break deservedly in the lead.

After falling behind to an early Randal Kolo Muani header, a spectacular Lamine Yamal strike, and Dani Olmo's third goal of the tournament turned it around.

I really didn't want that match to stop, but unfortunately, they needed a break.

19:47,
46'
Spain 2-1 France

Dani Olmo is having some game!

He has caused France several problems and William Saliba just decides to take him out.

No booking, though.

19:44,
43'
Spain 2-1 France

Alvaro Morata has been working hard defensively today, which is strange to say about a striker.

He seems to pop up to clear all the time, and he does so yet again from Ousmane Dembele's swinging cross.

19:41,
40'
Spain 2-1 France

For a small fella, Jesus Navas does well to head away a dangerous France free-kick.

Only moments later, Spain launch a dangerous counter and suddenly Lamine Yamal is free on the right.

He tries to bend another effort in but it takes a deflection.

This match is just non-stop and I absolutely love it.

19:38,
38'
Spain 2-1 France

Ousmane Dembele is looking like France's brightest spark at the moment.

He wins them a corner after some good work on the right-hand side, but it's wasted.

19:37,
37'
Spain 2-1 France

Spain are having a field day, right now.

They work their way up to the edge of the area where Fabian Ruz picks up the ball.

He decides to go for goal, but his effort is deflected just wide. The corner is then cleared.

19:36,
35'
Spain 2-1 France

France are getting a little frustrated, you can tell.

Lamine Yamal has been ripping them apart, so Theo Hernandez just decides to hack him down.

That's one way to stop him I guess...

19:33,
32'
Spain 2-1 France

Nico Williams, what a player.

Spain's wingers are wreaking havoc on this French defence, and now it's Williams' turn to cause problems.

He dances around several defenders and into the box, before backheeling the ball to Alvaro Morata.

The striker tries to squirm through the bodies but proves unsuccessful.

19:30,
29'
Spain 2-1 France

France had only conceded one goal in this tournament before today.

But Spain have just knocked two past them inside four minutes to turn this game on its head.

That is why people are raving about this Spanish side.

19:28
'Breathtaking'

Aadam Patel, Mail Sport, in Munich:

Breathtaking stuff. For all of France's experience, they have been stunned by Spain in the space of five minutes. Three goals already in less than half an hour. More of this please
19:25,
25'
GOAL: Spain 2-1 France (Olmo 25')

Spain have turned it around in a matter of minutes!

What a game we are witnessing in Munich. Dani Olmo has delivered yet again for the Spanish.

He turns the French defence inside out before striking the ball toward the bottom right-hand corner.

It is heading in but takes a massive deflection of Jules Kounde before smashing into the net.

What a match!

19:25,
24'
Spain 1-1 France

They have just shown the goal again and I still can't quite get over how incredible it is.

To score such a goal at just 16 years of age in a European Championship semi-final, I mean, just wow.

I've nearly been rendered speechless, which is hard to do as my colleagues would tell you

19:23
'Take a bow, son'

Aadam Patel, Mail Sport, in Munich:

Just WOW! Take a bow, son. Even some of the French fans are standing in awe of that strike. What were you doing when you were 16? What a star.
19:21,
21'
GOAL: Spain 1-1 France (Yamal 21')

LAMINE YAMAL THAT IS SENSATIONAL!

The 16-year-old draws Spain level with an absolute pearler of a goal.

25 yards out he decides to just have a crack, and my word, what a crack it is. He curls the ball into the top corner off the post.

This kid is special.

19:20,
19'
Spain 0-1 France

France are causing Spain all sorts of problems on the break.

They sit back and soak up pressure before launching a counter-attack and the ball ends up in the path of Kylian Mbappe.

he lets fly, but his effort is blocked and Spain end up getting it clear.

19:19,
18'
Spain 0-1 France

Marc Cucurella is being booed with every touch of the ball by the crowd.

It is surely from any Germans in the crowd due to his handball incident in the quarter-final against the hosts.

19:18
'Rough start for Navas'

Matt Barlow, Mail Sport, in Munich:

Rough start for Navas. One change of pace to intercept Mbappe but then the goal comes from his side and an early yellow card is going to make it even tougher for the ex-Cityman.
19:15,
14'
YELLOW CARD: Spain 0-1 France (Navas)

Jesus Navas has just sent Adrien Rabiot, and he gets a yellow card for it.

Spain will be happy with that, though, Rabiot had Kylian Mbappe in miles of space on the left.

If he had managed to get the pass off, Spain would have been in real trouble.

19:12,
12'
Spain 0-1 France

This is a massive test for Spain now.

This is a situation they have rarely found themselves in during this tournament.

France will now be happy to soak up their pressure and cause them problems on the counter.

19:11
'Kolo Muani makes no mistake'

Aadam Patel, Mail Sport, in Munich:

Spain have just had a huge chance to take the lead but Fabian Ruiz headed over. At the other end, Randal Kolo Muani makes no mistake and within nine minutes, he has justified Didier Deschamps's decision to bring him in for Antoine Griezmann.
19:09,
9'
GOAL: Spain 0-1 France (Kolo Muani 9')

France take an early lead!

Randal Kolo Muani manages to do what Fabian Ruiz couldn't do just a matter of moments ago.

Kylian Mbappe does really well on the left and clips the ball to the back post for his former PSG teammate to head home.

After not scoring from open play all tournament, France have done it when it matters most.

The favourites are behind...

19:08,
7'
Spain 0-0 France

Jesus Navas has still got it!

The 38-year-old knows he has a tough battle with Kylian Mbappae on his hands tonight, but he wins the first one.

The Frenchman looked like he was away and through on goal, but Navas races across to clear at the pivotal moment.

The pace is still there then.

19:06,
5'
BIG MISS! Spain 0-0 France

Fabian Ruiz has to score, but he heads over!

The midfielder gets on the end of a delightful Lamine Yamal cross just a matter of yards from goal.

You just expect the net to ripple. I was convinced he was going to score.

But somehow he heads over the bar. I can't quite believe it.

19:05,
4'
Spain 0-0 France

I must say, I am very surprised that Kylian Mbappe has ditched the mask already.

I know he was struggling to get used to it, but usually, players have to wear them for months after such injuries.

I wonder what the medical team think about it?

Spain 0-0 France

The pattern of this match seems to have been set out already.

The early signs are in Spain's favour as they pin back the French in the first few minutes.

After what seems like an eternity of passing, Fabian Ruiz sends in a cross to the back post, but Lamine Yamal slips as the ball comes his way.

KICK-OFF: Spain 0-0 France

Why are France not playing in Blue?

I really don't understand why even when there are no kit clashes, the French turn to their away strip.

Also, there is NO MASK for Kylian Mbappe as the French get this game underway.

Very interesting...

18:58
The roar of 'La Marseillaise'

Look, the Spanish national anthem is good, but the French one is just so fun to listen to.

'La Marseillaise' is blasted out first by the players and their fans. As ever, I began to wiggle with delight as |I listened to it.

Yes, that sounds weird, but I'm working so I have to be subtle.

Anyway, the anthems are now over, and the waiting with it.

18:57
The Allianz is BOUNCING

What an atmosphere inside the Allianz Arena.

One end there is a sea of red, and on the other a sea of Blue.

The buzz inside the stadium is immeasurable as the two sides come out for the national anthem.

That means it's time for 'La Marseillaise'!

18:52
Rio Ferdinand: 'Superstars normally deliver'

Rio Ferdinand, former England defender, on BBC One:

Superstars bring something that no one else in your team can. Deschamps only criticised Mbappe because he knows there will be a positive reaction. The superstars normally deliver but it is huge pressure.

18:48
Kick-off closing in...

Is anybody else getting as excited as I am?

Both France and Spain have now completed their warm-ups, so you know what that means.

At this very moment, Didier Deschamps and Luis de la Fuente are giving their final speeches to the players.

I wonder what they are saying...

Probably something inspirational.

18:45
Will Mbappe deliver?

Is today the day Kylian Mbappe sparks into life?

The French winger hasn't looked himself this tournament, especially after breaking his nose in the first game.

He has struggled with his mask every match, he hasn't looked comfortable whatsoever.

But he usually delivers when it matters most, and today is one of those days.

Mbappe only has one goal this tournament, but will he add to that tonight?

I think he will.

18:40
Griezmann in a giving mood

Aadam Patel, Mail Sport, in Munich:

Antoine Griezmann may not be in the starting eleven but he's just spotted his family in the seats in front of us and came over to give them a football. So there's one less ball to warm up with!

18:35
Can Spain make it six?

Spain are simply on fire at the moment.

They are the only team to have won all five of their matches so far at this tournament.

I mean, England could only dream...

If Luis de la Fuente's men win without penalties tonight, they will become the first team ever to win six matches at a European Championship.

It would be an incredible feat.

18:32
France's attacking woes

This is not a post I thought I'd be writing this tournament.

The French have some of the best attacking talent in the tournament, they literally have Kylian Mbappe, arguably the best player in the world.

But something just hasn't clicked, and it's hard to figure out what.

They have only scored three goals this tournament, two of which were own goals.

In fact, they are still yet to score a goal from open play, and we are at the semi-final stage.

It's quite incredible how they have got here.

18:27
Outfits of the day

It's time for one of my favourite posts.

I absolutely love seeing the different wacky outfits that fans wear at the European Championship.

there are certainly some belters today. My number one pick goes to the Spanirad in the glasses.

I'm not sure why... but the picture made me laugh.

18:22
Vamos!

The Spanish have joined the party!

Well, they haven't just joined it, they are taking over. Red is starting to swarm all over the seats in the Allianz Arena.

As you can tell by these pictures, they aren't staying quiet, the chants are in full flow.

Spain fans know how to make an atmosphere.

18:19
Youth and experience...

I knew the age gap was big, but my word.

We have already told you about Lamine Yamal becoming the youngest player to feature in a major tournament semi-final, but there's more.

They also have the oldest outfield player to achieve the same feat.

Jesus Navas is 22 years Yamal's senior, but he is still cutting it with the big boys.

Not bad, eh?

18:16
'What a night for Navas'

Matt Barlow, Mail Sport, in Munich:

What a night for Jesus Navas at 38… the former Manchester City winger now back at Sevilla and converted into a full-back. Navas was preferred in the Spain squad to Pedro Porro and nearly 15 years after his debut called in to replace Carvajal who is suspended after a red card in the quarter-final, and charged with looking after Kylian Mbappe.

18:15
Chris Sutton: 'Likely that France will smother Spain'

Chris Sutton, It's All Kicking Off! co-host, on BBC Sport:

If I was being logical about this, I would still say Spain will win - Lamine Yamal is so exciting, Nico Williams has arguably been the player of the tournament, and Rodri and Fabian Ruiz run things in the middle of the pitch - but I just have a feeling that France will get through.
Of course, Mbappe could play like the superstar he is, or Dembele could cause Marc Cucurella problems if he starts... but it is more likely that France will just smother Spain and, even if they do not play well, get the job done.
18:13
Yamal the history-maker

What a day for Lamine Yamal!

The 16-year-old Spanish sensation has written his name into the record books tonight.

When the match gets underway in under an hour, Yamal will become the youngest player in Euros history to start a semi-final.

He won't be a passenger either, that's for sure!

18:07
'This should be worth watching'

Matt Barlow, Mail Sport, in Munich:

Forty years ago these two nations met in the final of the Euros and France prevailed inspired by Michel Platini. This should probably be the final again. Spain, fluent from the start when they fired three past Croatia inside 45 minutes in Berlin.
France, solid and strong at the back while not at their best going forward. ‘Don’t watch if you don’t want to’ was Didier Deschamps' reaction to accusations that his team is boring but this should be worth watching. France’s goalkeepers are just out to warm-up and the tricolores are flying.
18:04
NO Griezmann

Antoine Griezmann is usually a staple in this French side.

However, his lack of form has cost him dearly in this tournament, this point had to come eventually.

It would have been tough for Didier Deschamps, though, as he usually always relies on the attacker.

In fact, this is the first time since the 2014 World Cup, that Griezmann is not starting a knockout stage match for France at a major tournament.

A real rarity.

17:56
France Team News - Griezmann DROPPED

The leak was spot-on!

Antoine Griezmann is indeed dropped this evening with Ousmane Dembele coming into the starting 11.

The only other change is that Adrien Rabiot is back in for Eduardo Camavinga in the midfield.

Still, it's a very strong side.

17:55
Mbappe vs Navas

This individual battle could be key tonight.

38-year-old Jesus Navas can expect one of the toughest nights of his career this evening if Kylian Mbappe is on it.

Yes, Navas does have pace, but certainly not as much as he used to.

The French winger has struggled this tournament, though. His mask is causing him all sorts of trouble.

Still, he will be licking his licks at the prospect of tonight.

17:52
'Too hard to call'

Aadam Patel, Mail Sport, in Munich:

This one promises to be a hell of a spectacle. Of the past 13 World Cup and Euros finals, nine have featured either France or Spain. Of course, that will become 10 out of 14 tonight. It's too hard to call.
Spain, undeniably the best football side in the tournament so far but France have all the experience and know-how in recent times.
The atmosphere around town has been beautiful all day. It was 30 degrees earlier and scorching but that has cooled down now so hopefully we get a brilliant game between two top sides.
17:46
French turning the Allianz BLUE

The French presence in Munich is certainly outdoing the Spanish.

Thousands of France fans have already packed themselves into the Allianz Arena.

They aren't just admiring the turf either, they are setting the scene in what is set to be a loud night.

The atmosphere is already ramping up.

17:38
France arrive at the Allianz

It just got real!

Kylian Mbappe has arrived at the Allianz arena alongside his French teammates ahead of tonight's crunch match.

It's fair to say, they look like they mean business. Not a smile in sight.

They've been here before, they know what it takes.

17:35
'22 years separate Navas and Yamal'

Aadam Patel, Mail Sport, in Munich:

Just the 22 years separate Jesus Navas (38) and Lamine Yamal (16) who both start down the right for Spain tonight. Navas is actually older than Yamal’s dad, Mounir, whose Instagram handle is hustle_hard_304. Well worth a look.
17:34
Attack vs Defence

One team scores, the other stifles.

Spain's attacking fluidity in this tournament has been something to just sit back and admire.

They have netted the most goals of any team this tournament, netting 11 in five matches, so far.

But they may find it tougher to hit the net tonight.

They are up against the toughest defence in Euro 2024, France.

Didier Deschamps' side are very sturdy at the back, they have only conceded once all tournament.

Who will come out on top in the battle?

17:30
Spain Team News - Olmo STARTS

Well, I was right about Dani Olmo!

I mean, I'm pretty sure everybody expected Olmo to be named as Pedri's replacement tonight.

Jesus Navas and Nacho Fernandez are the other two changes to the side that beat Germany on Friday.

Alvaro Morata also keeps his place despite all the drama!

17:24
Ain't no first rodeo!

These two teams certainly have a history.

Spain and France have met on six serious occasions at major tournaments.

It's fair to say, it's rarely a boring clash...

Why do I say that? well, these results will show you just what I mean:

Euro 1984 final: France 2-0 Spain
Euro 1996 group stage: France 1-1 Spain
Euro 2000 QF: France 2-1 Spain
World Cup 2006 last 16: France 3-1 Spain
Euro 2012 QF: Spain 2-0 France

17:19
Why is Morata causing chaos?

A little shameless plug of my own work...

Look, it's completely understandable why Spaniards are so upset with Alvaro Morata over his comments yesterday.

When the country has one of its biggest matches in recent history coming up, you want the preparation to be smooth sailing.

And while although I agree that his comments are ill-timed, it makes sense why he made them.

Want to know why?

Well, I have the perfect article for you to read about it, by yours truly.

Click below and find out:

Why is Morata causing chaos before Spain's Euro semi-final?
Morata is yet to taste defeat while wearing the armband for his country and is expected to lead the line on Tuesday in what is arguably the country's biggest match in over a decade.
Mail Online

17:15
The Morata madness

Spain's preparations have not been the smoothest, that's for sure.

When your captain comes out swinging, saying he's not 'respected', it's sure to shake the camp.

Well, that's exactly what Alvaro Morata has done...

The striker went to the Spanish press on Monday to share his discontent at the lack of respect he gets in Spain.

In turn, he has stated that he will likely retire from international football upon the conclusion of Euro 2024.

It's fair to say, these comments have not gone down well in Spain.

They will surely forgive him if he scores tonight, though?

17:09
Didier Deschamps: 'Spain have been the best team'

Didier Deschamps, France manager, speaking on Monday:

Spanish teams always have the ability to have a strong midfield. Pedri is not there, but they have the ability to help their team maintain control of the match. This makes them a tough team.
Rodri, especially, is a player who is the backbone of Spain. But it's all of them in Spain, everything they've been doing since the beginning of the tournament. I don't want to put pressure on them, but they have been the best team in this European Championship and that's the impression I have.

17:06
Luis de la Fuente: 'We try to play nice football'

Luis de la Fuente, Spain boss, speaking on Monday:

In principle, what you try to do is to prepare a game plan that will help you win. Of course, you have an idea - if we talk about the show or whatever, we are talking about a model, an idea and maybe our idea is closer to a nice show, a nice spectacle - if we do it right. In that respect, I think we are a nice team to watch.
But in the end, it's about winning, and even more so at this stage. We try to play nice football, but we want to play practical football too because what you will analyse later and assess later is the result.
Our players have recovered well. There's tension, of course, and stress. Our players will need to overcome certain moments physically. France are one of the most physical teams in the tournament but we know how to play them. We will try to impose our strengths.

17:00
Will Spain cope without Pedri?

Speaking of team news, Luis de la Fuente has some big calls to make tonight.

One of those is in regards to replacing Pedri. I don't envy him on this one.

The Barcelona man picked up a knee injury after just eight minutes in their quarter-final against Germany.

You could hear the groans all the way from Spain when he started rolling around on the floor.

It was obvious straight away that he would be out for a while.

Can they cope without him? I believe so.

Dani Olmo was given the task of replacing him, and my word did he deliver for the Spanish.

He netted the opener in that match, and then sent in a delightful cross for Mikel Merino to dramatically head home in the 119th minute.

Surely, De la Fuente will turn to Olmo tonight?

16:53
France's LEAKED line-up

It seems France's line-up has been leaked...

The French have had troubles with leaks this tournament, and they have yet again.

French media outlet, RMC Sport, have revealed the 11 players they understand will start tonight.

So, here they are:

France LEAKED XI: Maignan; Koundé, Upamecano, Saliba, Hernandez; Kanté, Tchouameni, Rabiot; Dembélé, Kolo Muani, Mbappe

Is this team strong enough to win?

16:45
Adrien Rabiot: Griezmann's poor form a 'surprise'

Adrien Rabiot, France midfielder, speaking about Antoine Griezmann on Monday:

It is a surprise because we know what he is capable of, what he did at the last World Cup. I don’t know how to explain the tough time he is going through now. We have high expectations when it comes to Antoine.
How are we going to win without the best Antoine? We have a high-level team and it is a team sport. If someone is having a rough patch then, fine; we are there to support them.
But of course, it would be easier if we had the Antoine and the Kylian, which hasn’t been the case. Although we are maybe having trouble, we have reached the semi-final. Antoine’s and Kylian’s legs are not as fresh as they could be but we have 100% faith in them. We know they can change the game at any point. We will need them if we are to get to the final.

16:38
Griezmann to be dropped?

Now this is massive news.

According to reports in France, Antoine Griezmann is set to be benched by Didier Deschamps this evening.

Griezmann has been a pivotal part of the French's success in recent years, so for him to be dropped would be a big surprise.

But should it be?

While he has started four of their five games this tournament, Griezmann has struggled to impress.

With their attacking shortcoming this tournament, Deschamps did need to switch it up. It looks like he will be.

Who will come in though?

I suspect Ousmane Dembele will come in on the right of the French attack in a system change.

Dembele was bright when he came on against Portugal, so it would make a lot of sense.

16:31
Time flies

I saw this tweet and simply had to share it.

The story of Lamine Yamal is sensational. It also shows that you can do a lot in a year.

Within the space of 12 months, he has gone from playing France at Under 17s level, to now in a European Championship semi-final.

Well, if he gets picked that is.

What were you doing at 16? I was consuming Yazoo's and Haribo's as my lunch on a daily basis.

I still do that, to be honest.

16:24
Alan Shearer: 'Such a tough game to call'

Alan Shearer, former England captain, predicting the outcome of Spain vs France via Betfair:

Such a tough game to call. France have been nowhere near what we expect from them but they're still in the semi-finals. Spain have been the best team in the tournament and they've shown great intent, playing wonderful football. [Nico] Williams and [Lamine] Yamal are outstanding.
I'm going to go with France. They defend deep and are a really solid defensive unit. I think they may just pip it. I can see both semi-finals going to penalties.
16:21
Friendly atmosphere

The French and the Spanish seem to be getting along.

In the hours before kick-off, fans of both sides have been gathering in Munich's city centre to get in the spirit for tonight's match.

Sometimes in football, this can cause problems, but not today. The love is being shared between the countries.

They are neighbours after all...

Although, my neighbor and I don't always see eye-to-eye.

16:14
How did France get here?

France's road to Munich has not been quite as smooth as Spain's.

Didier Deschamps' side have certainly rode their luck on several occasions this tournament. They won't care, though.

They were beaten to top spot in Group D by Austria, finishing on five points. Not many predicted that, that's for sure.

Their attacking struggles then continued into the last 16, and then the quarter-finals. But yet again, it didn't matter.

So, let's look back at their results:

MD1: Austria 0-1 France
MD2: Netherlands 0-0 France
MD3: France 1-1 Poland
LAST 16: France 1-0 Belgium
QF: Portugal 0-0 France (France win 5-3 on penalties)

16:08
Spain's path to the last four

So, how did Spain get here then?

It's fair to say, they have been the best team in this tournament, so far. They have truly deserved their spot in the semi-finals.

They cruised through the group stage, getting past the likes of Croatia and Italy with relative ease.

The knockout stages may have proved tougher - more dramatic too - but their freight train has not slowed down.

Let's have a look at all five of their results:

MD1: Spain 3-0 Croatia
MD2: Spain 1-0 Italy
MD3: Albania 0-1 Spain
LAST 16: Spain 4-1 Georgia
QF: Spain 2-1 Germany (AET)

16:03
La Roja against Les Bleus

This match feels like it has the makings of a classic.

Yes, Tyson Fury’s fight with Oleksandr Usyk was nearly two months ago now, but the heavyweights are truly back in action tonight.

You have Spain who have been awoken by boss Luis de la Fuente from their slumber. His young team have breathed life, and hope, back into Spanish international football.

Then there is France. Despite being largely underwhelming this tournament, under Didier Deschamps they just know how to get the job done.

The two sides have differing styles, but both have the same goal.

It’s set up to be a cracker.

16:00
Battle to reach Berlin

Tonight is a night where dreams will be made, and they will also be destroyed.

The European Championship has got to that stage where there is simply no messing about anymore. It’s crunch time.

Two giant footballing nations, steeped in rich footballing history, are about to do battle in Munich for a spot in the Euro 2024 final on Sunday.

Will it go to Spain and Luis de la Fuente’s scintillating young side? Or will the ever-pragmatic French make another major tournament final?

It’s a match that you simply don’t want to miss.
