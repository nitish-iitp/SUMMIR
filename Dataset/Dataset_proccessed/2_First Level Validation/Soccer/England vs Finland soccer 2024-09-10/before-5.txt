England out to equal all-time national team record in Finland Nations League clash

England could match an all-time national team unbeaten record when they welcome Finland to Wembley in Tuesday's UEFA Nations League showdown.

The Three Lions host their Scandinavian counterparts on the back of making a flying start to life under Lee Carsley, who masterminded a 2-0 win over the Republic of Ireland over the weekend.

Jack Grealish and Declan Rice - two former Ireland youth internationals - struck the pivotal goals in Dublin, where England's first-half play in particular earned plenty of acclaim.

The Three Lions' failure to add more goals to their tally in the second half was a minor blot on Carsley's notebook, though, and despite their perfect start, they are behind Greece in League B Group 2 on goal difference.

Finland were subjected to a 3-0 hammering at the hands of the Greeks in their opening Nations League contest, and the Huuhkajat are still waiting for their first victory over England at the 12th attempt.

However, should England claim at least a point over Finland on Tuesday, they will equal their all-time men's record for the most games against a single country without ever suffering defeat.

The Three Lions have not been beaten in any of their first 11 meetings with Finland, winning nine of them and playing out two draws, and they have only enjoyed a better undefeated streak against Bulgaria, winning eight and drawing four of their 12 games against them.

England and Finland have only locked horns twice since the turn of the millennium, though, and this will be their first meeting since March 2001, where goals from Michael Owen and David Beckham propelled the Three Lions to a 2-1 victory in World Cup qualifying.

Five months prior, Finland had held the 1966 World Cup winners to a goalless draw on home soil, but they have been beaten in each of their three away games against England, conceding nine goals and notching just two of their own in the process.

While England are bidding to equal an all-time team record, Carsley is out to ensure that the Three Lions avoid matching an 11-year feat, having lost their last home game 1-0 to Iceland under Gareth Southgate.

Not since the days of Roy Hodgson in 2013 have England suffered consecutive home defeats, but Carsley could also join an exclusive club of the more desirable variety with victory in midweek.

Indeed, only three England men's managers have ever won both of their opening matches in charge; Joe Mercer, Ron Greenwood and most recently Steve McClaren, who did so back in 2006.

Tuesday's fixture will also be a momentous occasion for captain and all-time record goalscorer Harry Kane, who is expected to start on what would be his 100th senior appearance for England.

The Bayern Munich striker would become just the 10th man to reach a century of England caps should he feature on Tuesday, where Carsley is expected to have all 23 players available.
