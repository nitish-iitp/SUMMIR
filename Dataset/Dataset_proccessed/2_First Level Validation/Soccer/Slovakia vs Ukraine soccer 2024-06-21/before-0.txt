A shocker from Martin Dubravka – Slovakia progress now in the balance…
6 MONTHS AGO 6 COMMENTS
SHARE    

Martin Dubraka had the chance to be the first Newcastle United player through to the knockout stages of the 2024 European Championships.

After a stunning 1-0 win over Belgium in their opening match, Slovakia knowing a win on Friday afternoon over Ukraine would guarantee them last 16.

Whilst a point would almost certainly be enough as well, with still one game to play.

All was going to plan with Slovakia by far the better team and Schranz following up his winner against Belgium, with the opening headed goal against Ukraine on 17 minutes.

Slovakia going on to have plenty more chances in that first half that could/should have finished this game off, Ukraine with the odd break and Martin Dubravka making the odd decent save, but overwhelmingly Slovakia on top.

A bit of a game of two halves, as Ukraine came out with purpose and some poor marking allowed an unmarked Shaparenko to equalise when the ball was squared, Dubravka given no chance.

The second half then continuing in that vein with now Ukraine by far the better and most dangerous team.

However, the game looked to be heading for a 1-1 draw as time went on, a result that would very much suit Slovakia and very likely be enough for them to end up in the last 16.

Then out of the blue,with 10 minutes to go, a clever ball by goalscorer Shaparenko was lifted into the path of Yaremchuk running into the box and he did have a great first touch as it dropped, then all he could do was touch it again and it trickled towards goal. Commentators and oundits have raved about it but for me, it was a shocker from Martin Dubravka. He was in a decent position and when the ball was played over the top, if he had come to meet it then I think all but impossible for the goal to be scored, whilst even after backing off, he should still have stopped the shot, as there was so little for the attacker to aim at, but Martin Dubravka actually made himself smaller, rather than as big as possible, which was all it would have taken to save it for sure. Sadly, a goal that perfectly sums up why Dubravka’s time at Newcastle United is up for sure, Nick Pope would never have conceded that goal.

It is Belgium v Romania tonight and the group finely balanced, with currently Romania, Ukraine and Sovakia all on three points. Very interesting if Belgium get the victory tonight and four of them on three points heading into their final games on Wednesday – Slovakia v Romania and Belgium v Ukraine.

Newcastle United players on international duty:

Saturday 15 June

Switzerland 3 Hungary 1 (Euros Group match)

The Newcastle United defender with a very good personal performance, playing the full 90 minutes as the Swiss deservedly beat Hungary.

Sunday 16 June

England 1 Serbia 0 (Euros Group match)

England got the job done, eventually.

Anthony Gordon an unused substitute but Kieran Trippier playing the full 90 minutes and doing ok at left-back. His job to stretch things in attack up England’s left hand side, with likes of Foden not willing/able to stay out wide and instead continually drifting inside. With the plan clearly for all of England’s main attacking to be through the middle and especially out wide on the right.

That is where the excellent winning goal came from, a great ball from Walker putting Saka in behind and his deflected cross perfectly then flighted for Bellingham’s pinpoint run into the box and the header giving Serbia’s keeper no chance.

At the other end was Trippier’s main task though and with the rest of the defence he did well, especially after the break when England suddenly went all defensive and invited Serbia to go for the equaliser. The Three Lions offering zero threat in the second-half apart from sub Bowen’s cross where the keeper made a great save but in reality Kane should have given him zero chance with the header.

Pickford only had one shot on target to save all game and whilst the commentator and pundits raved about it, in reality it was from outside the box and straight at him, the England keeper tipping the ball over the bar.

The highlight of Trippier’s performance was when Serbia got into the box on the left and an equaliser beckoned for Serbia with Mitrovic waiting for the ball to be squared for a tap-in. However, the Newcastle defender covering his central defenders had got across and was too strong for Mitro who was sent sprawling  and claiming for a forlorn penalty.

Monday 17 June

Slovakia 1 Belgium 0 (Euros Group match)

Martin Dubravka and his Slovakia teammates pulling off a massive shock, third ranked in the world Belgium beaten by a team ranked 48th.

Schranz scoring after only seven minutes and the Newcastle keeper and his international teammates more than matching Belgium. What a victory.

Wednesday 19 June

Switzerland 1 Scotland 1 (Euros Group match)

Fabian Schar and Switzerland with a nightmare start after 13 minutes, the Newcastle defender deflecting a McTominay shot past his keeper, a shot which would almost for sure have been saved without Schar’s intervention.

The NUFC defender recovering to have another decent game. Helping Switzerland stand up to a very physical but limited Scotland team, Shaqiri with a brilliant 26th minute long range curled into the top corner effort to equalise. The Swiss should have went on to win but wasted a fair few chances and Scotland got lucky with two goals denied by VAR fine margins.

Thursday 20 June 2024

England 1 Denmark 1 (Euros Group match)

Yet another Gareth Southgate masterclass of cluelessness and negativity.

The team playing so deep and defensive, clearly the plan to try and stop Denmark scoring and not a plan of how England would score.

On 18 minutes some individual opportunism and ambition by Kyle Walker as he ignored Southgate’s orders and pressed high, won the ball in a dangerous position and Kane scoring from close in, he couldn’t miss.

Southgate’s reaction was to have England even more negative and defensive, invited Denmark on and they equalised 16 minites later. The whole game a shambles with the negative tactics and no apparent plan as to how England were trying to win the game. Very lucky to get a draw.

Kieran Trippier played well on the left and didn’t put a foot wrong.

Friday 21 June 2024

Slovakia 1 Ukraine 2 (Euros Group match)

Martin Dubravka and Slovakia looking to be cruising through to the last 16 when dominating the first half and leading 1-0. However, Ukraine came out for the second half all fired up and turned it around, equalising on 54 minutes and then a shocker with 10 minutes to go from Martin Dubravka, when a ball was played over the top that he should have dealt with, allowing the striker to score from a narrow angle and he should have stopped it for sure.
