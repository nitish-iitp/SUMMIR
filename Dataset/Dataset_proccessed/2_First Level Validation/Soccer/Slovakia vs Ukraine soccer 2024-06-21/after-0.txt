England must address their issues after Denmark draw, says Gareth Southgate

Ukraine roused themselves in the nick of time to salvage their Euro 2024 hopes as substitute Roman Yaremchuk’s late strike saw them hit back after falling a goal behind to beat Slovakia 2-1 in a lively Group E clash.

Trailing at halftime to an early header scored by Ivan Schranz, Ukraine’s hopes of reaching the knockout stage were in peril, but they stormed back in front of their joyous fans.

Slovakia, who produced the shock of the tournament so far to beat Belgium in their opener, would have sealed a last-16 berth with a win but sat back after a dream start and were punished.

Man of the match Mykola Shaparenko equalised in the 54th minute with a close-range finish before his pass sent Yaremchuk clear to prod the winner and spark ecstatic celebrations from the ranks of yellow and blue inside the Duesseldorf Stadium. Victory lifted Ukraine level on three points with Slovakia and Romania, who face Belgium on Saturday.

Follow the score and all the latest updates from Ukraine v Slovakia below.

This is why Ralf Rangnick turned down Bayern Munich - Austria can cause a real Euro 2024 upset

So this is why Ralf Rangnick rejected Bayern Munich. Euro 2024’s oldest manager could have taken charge of the biggest German club but rejected them to stay with Austria. Instead, he may be coaching for a little longer in his homeland this summer. A stirring victory gave Austria a fighting chance of reaching the last 16.

For Christoph Baumgartner, there was a seismic strike to accompany his statistical marvel. In March he scored what appears the fastest goal in the history of international football. After that six-second effort against Slovakia, a goal in the 66th minute felt slovenly, but it was also well-taken and decisive, putting Austria ahead.

Then came what could prove the final blow for Poland. Penalties had taken them to Euro 2024, with Wojciech Szczesny’s shootout save from Wales’ Dan James deciding their play-off. A penalty gave Austria a cushion. It was conceded by Szczesny, with Marko Arnautovic then beating him from 12 yards.

And so Austria, narrowly defeated by France, with the Netherlands to come, can glimpse the last 16. They got there in Euro 2020, but from a lesser group, playing duller football. This, however, was the Rangnick revolution put into practice, Germany’s original gegenpresser showing what he can do on the international stage.

This is why Rangnick turned down Bayern - Austria can cause real Euros upset

Next matches

So Austria will face the Netherlands in a potentially huge game on Tuesday, 25 June at 8pm BST. They will meet in Berlin, with both potentially being on three points (if the Netherlands lose tonight), so they may essentially be battling it out for second place in the group.

Poland will face France on the same evening at the same time, with that match taking place in Dortmund. Poland are all but out of contention for the last 16 now.

Euro 2024: Poland 1-3 Austria

94 mins

It’s a procession in the final couple of minutes as both teams wait for it to end.

The final whistle goes and Austria have a brilliant win and a vital three points! Their match against the Netherlands should be very interesting now, and they’ve done their ‘dark horses’ tag no harm in Berlin.

CLOSE! A great chance out of nowhere for Poland. It’s an inviting cross from the right towards the back post and Grosicki is unmarked, but he can only skew his volley wide.

Austria are still driving forward, led by Laimer again this time, but his attempted pass to Gregoritsch is overhit.

There’ll be four minutes of added time in Berlin.

It begins with an Austria free-kick, but they opt to go backwards and keep possession.
