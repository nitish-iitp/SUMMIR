Romania Secures 3-0 Victory Over Kosovo in Nations League Opener
23 0

Romania kicked off the new edition of the Nations League with an impressive 3-0 win over Kosovo on Friday, September 6, in Priština. This match marked the debut of Mircea Lucescu as Romania’s national team coach after a 38-year hiatus. The goals were scored by Dennis Man, Răzvan Marin (from the penalty spot), and Denis Drăguș.

The Romanian side, known as the “Tricolorii,” dominated the first half of the Kosovo-Romania encounter, creating several chances early on. The first opportunity came in the 7th minute when Valentin Mihăilă had a shot on goal, followed by Dennis Man in the 13th minute. Man eventually broke the deadlock in the 40th minute with a brilliant solo effort, curling a superb shot into the far corner from the edge of the penalty box.

Just before halftime, in the 44th minute, Dennis Man set up Mihăilă with a promising pass, but the latter struck the post. Romania continued their control after the break, and in the 51st minute, Man was fouled in the box by Valon Berisha. After reviewing the incident on VAR, the referee awarded a penalty. Răzvan Marin calmly converted from the spot to extend Romania’s lead to 2-0.

Despite Kosovo’s efforts to get back into the game, Romania remained dangerous. Mihăilă hit the post again in the 59th minute, coming close to adding a third. Finally, in the 82nd minute, following a defensive mistake by Kosovo, Denis Drăguș pounced to score from close range, sealing Romania’s dominant 3-0 win.

This victory provides a strong start for Romania in the Nations League and offers a promising beginning for Mircea Lucescu’s new tenure as head coach.
