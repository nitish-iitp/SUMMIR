Was watching the training highlights on Victor Modo channel on YouTube. It looked an intensive session with Chima Onyeike, the Dutch-born fitness coach seriously drilled them that the players looked drained at the end of the session.

Finidi, James, and Baruwa didn’t do much, except for the pep talk by Finidi later. He seemed to have adopted a soft, laissez faire leadership style – a sharp departure from Keshi’s imposing, non-nonsense or Oliseh’s autocratic and tactless approach.

Hope it works for him and he isn’t forced to find a middle ground later. Example, Amokachi was conspicuously absent.
