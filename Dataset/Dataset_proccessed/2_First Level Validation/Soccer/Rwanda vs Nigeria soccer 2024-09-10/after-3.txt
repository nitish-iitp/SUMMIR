Rwanda vs Nigeria Player Ratings; A goalless draw for Super Eagles in Rwanda
Africa Cup Of Nations
Rwanda vs Nigeria

The Africa Cup of Nations 2023 runners-up, Nigeria shared spoils with Rwanda in an evenly contested 0-0 stalemate in the second match week proceedings of the Group D clash of the AFCON 2025 qualifiers at Amahoro National Stadium.

The Wasps were reluctant in defence, against the visitors which gave them a tough time in front home crowd. Rwandan shot-stopper Fiacre Ntwali delivered an exceptional performence to stop Nigeria’s well-capable attack from scoring to break the deadlock. Following the result, both sides are sitting in first (Nigeria) and second (Rwanda) place on the Group D points table with 4 and 2 points in their hands respectively.

Also to be noted, is that other group members Libiya and Benin will play against each other later today. Thus, their result will affect their standing upon the end of the September International break and two match weeks.
