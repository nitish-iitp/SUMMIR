Germany awaits!

That's all from us tonight. Thanks for joining us for England's final warm-up game ahead of the European Championships. Next time, it'll be for real.

I'm getting nervous just typing it. For now, bask in the unimportance of the result to Iceland and dream of victory on the continent!

England are my favourites to win Euro 2024 - but they've left their best goalkeeper at home, writes GRAEME SOUNESS

I believe this is the strongest England squad I have seen going into a top tournament.

Yes, there are a few frailties in defence, particularly if Luke Shaw falls over, but generally it’s a fantastic squad and a common sense selection.

Do a poll of the teams in the tournament and no one will want to play against England. Ask their biggest rivals Germany, Italy, France, Spain or Portugal and they’d all want to avoid this English team.

Southgate confident England will be better against Serbia

The Three Lions start their European Championships campaign against Serbia on June 16. Many supporters have begun to fear the worst following Friday night's defeat by Iceland but Southgate has assured fans his team will improve.

THE NOTEBOOK: Fans start petitions over Jack Grealish's omission, stars discuss their club futures and Gareth Southgate draws level with Sir Bobby Robson

England took to the pitch for their final dress rehearsal ahead of Euro 2024 as they took on Iceland in a friendly at Wembley.

Nearly eight years have passed since Friday's visitors inflicted one of the most humiliating defeats on England in the history of the national team.

Rather than vanquishing those demons however, England were instead forced to endure another defeat by the team ranked 72nd in FIFA's rankings, with Jon Thorsteinsson's opener on 12 minutes ultimately proving the difference.

Rooney claims 'disjointed' England missed Harry Maguire

Wayne Rooney has claimed that England missed Harry Maguire in their disappointing 1-0 defeat to Iceland.

Maguire, who has 63 caps, wasn't included in the final squad for the tournament due to injury.

Rooney stated that England's back line was 'disjointed' at Wembley and expressed his belief that Manchester United defender Maguire could have made a major difference if fit.

Southgate did say that Stones should be fine and that his withdrawal was just precautionary. But listen to him say it. Does he sound that convinced?

I don't know about you but I'm worried.

England set an unwanted record going back 70 YEARS against Iceland

England suffered the dubious distinction of equalling an unwanted 70-year record when they faced Iceland at Wembley.

In the opening stages of Friday's friendly Gareth Southgate's side promptly found themselves a goal down courtesy of an early strike from Jon Thorsteinsson.

The former Fulham youngster found himself in space after just 12 minutes, and promptly fired his shot beyond Aaron Ramsdale at the goalkeeper's near post to give the visitors the lead.

How Gareth Southgate broke up England's 'Avengers'

James Maddison and Jack Grealish's Euro 2024 omissions mean there will be no involvement in the England squad for 'The Avengers' WhatsApp group.

The Manchester City and Tottenham midfielders were two of the most surprising names to be axed by Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate, who confirmed his 26-man squad for the tournament in Germany on Thursday.

Harry Maguire, Jarrad Branthwaite and Curtis Jones were also among those cut, with the likes of Eberechi Eze and Adam Wharton set to take part in their first major international tournaments.

England's cancelled post-match send-off

Gareth Southgate, BBC Radio 5 Live:

I think you run the risk of that when you're planning something post-match on a night like tonight. We have to accept that the performance didn't warrant people staying.
Had we taken a couple of our chances which we had really good ones then that could've looked different but it wouldn't have corrected everything that needed to be better. In some respects everything was exposed tonight and it gives us plenty to work on.
21:54
How did the rest of Europe get on?

Every country involved in the European Championships will be playing their final warm-up game this weekend. The likes of Portugal, Spain and Croatia play on Saturday, while Italy and France are in action on Sunday.

There were however some sides like England playing on Friday night. Here are the results from some of the other international friendlies.

Wayne Rooney and Joe Cole name the two players they feel should have been on the plane

Wayne Rooney and Joe Cole have identified two players they felt were unfortunate to miss out on England's 26-man squad for the upcoming European Championships.

The former international teammates appeared together on punditry duties as England faced Iceland at Wembley in their final warm up before the tournament kicks off next Friday.

After naming his provisional squad last month, Gareth Southgate whittled his team down to 26 players, with multiple big names missing out on the final cut.

England 0-1 Iceland STATS BREAKDOWN

It doesn't make for great viewing for England fans. The home side bossed possession but weren't able to do very much with it.

The Three Lions managed one ONE shot on target, while Iceland had FOUR and really should have scored at least one more goal on the night.

21:28
Rice speaks on his partnership with Mainoo

Declan Rice, Channel 4:

We did it in March and it was really positive. I can imagine because we've lost some people are saying stuff but that's football these days. We're going to learn every game we play. Every game is a chance to learn and get better.
21:25
Rice says result is 'not ideal'

Declan Rice, Channel 4:

When we have that much of the ball, we have a couple of clear-cut chances and get beat 1-0 at home just before a Euros is not ideal. But there were a lot of positive performances.
In the end it becomes a frustration game, you're chasing your tail a little bit and get caught on the counter-attack. It's not ideal we lost but there's a lot of learning curves you can build on as a team.

21:20
England boss reflects on loss

Gareth Southgate, Channel 4:

It was obviously a disjointed and disappointing performance and we didn't show enough character but I think it's good for us before an international tournament."I think we've got to be better without the ball. I think that there were a lot of reasons for that and across the two games we probably haven't had our full side out across any two games.
We've been able to look at people, we've been able to learn about the balance of the team."I've been involved in a lot of last matches leading into a tournament. Inevitably players have one eye on what's coming in terms of early challenges. No excuses on the result but there are a lot of things we can put eight quickly.

ENGLAND PLAYER RATINGS: Which established star 'is a worry'? And who was 'poor' by their standards?

England's final preparation game for Euro 2024 didn't go to plan as they suffered a 1-0 defeat to Iceland.

Jon Dagur Thorsteinsson's first half goal proved to be the difference between the two teams at Wembley.

There was also a further cause for concern for Gareth Southgate, with John Stones having to be substituted at half time.

Some England fans certainly think so. They have blasted goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale after Iceland opened the scoring in their final friendly before Euro 2024.

The Arsenal stopper was handed a rare start for the Three Lions, but was picking the ball out of his net within twelve minutes after Iceland took a shock lead.

Jon Thorsteinsson cut in past the England defence before beating Ramsdale at his near post to leave Wembley stunned.

For what it's worth, England finished third at the 1968 Euros. The kicker is that there were only four teams in the competition.

BOOS on full-time at Wembley

20:38,
95'
FT: England 0-1 Iceland

Boos ring out at Wermbley at the final whistle. A bit harsh that! It was a poor one from England no doubt. They only managed one shot on target and the night ended up providing more questions than answers for the England boss.

Add in the injury scare to John Stones and, let's be honest, it's not been the greatest evening of action.

20:35,

Penalty box scrap! England 0-1 Iceland

A chance presented itself to Mainoo after pinball in the Icelandic penalty area. The United midfielder shanked his shot well wide and then saw the flag raised because Saka was offside in the build-up.

20:33,
90'
FIVE ADDED MINUTES! England 0-1 Iceland

Go on England. Give us something to cheer...

20:32,

Wembley has started to empty. The crowd have seen enough. Iceland have been brilliant and they are only minutes away from their first-ever win at the stadium.

20:27,
86'
Mainoo tries from range! England 0-1 Iceland

The Manchester United youngster's effort balloons high over the bar. He attempted the effort from around 25 yards so was justified in taking it but the execution was poor.

20:25,
84'
England 0-1 Iceland

We're into the final 10 minutes here at Wembley. Has the party already been spoilt? England have managed only one shot on target so far tonight.

20:21,
79'
England 0-1 Iceland

Iceland are growing in confidence. Southgate's changes haven't helped the pressure in midfield. The visitors are finding more space and joy and have come close to grabbing a second a few times.

20:19,

Eze enters the fray! England 0-1 Iceland

Cole Palmer departs for the in-form Palace man. Can he be the answer?

More defensive woes! England 0-1 Iceland

Marc Guehi is now on the canvas after taking a shot flush on the side of the head. The Palace defender looked like he was going to be replaced by Liverpool youngster Jarrel Quansah.

But he's up and appears fine to continue. Heart in the mouth stuff. How many centre backs are we down to?

20:12,

Trent's having an impact! England 0-1 Iceland

The Liverpool star has been on for a few minutes and he's already been involved in a couple of promising chances for England.

20:10
More on that MASSIVE Iceland chance

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport:

Well if England do get out of this jam they will have the length of Jon Dagur Thorsteinsson’s studs to thank.The Iceland number nine only had to side foot the ball in to the empty net as his team ripped through the England rearguard.
But he lost his footing at the worst possible moment and couldn’t make proper contact. England ragged here…
20:08,
63'
FOUR changes! England 0-1 Iceland

Alexander-Arnold, Saka, Toney and Gomez come on for Walker, Gordon, Kane and Trippier

20:06,
62'
Should have been TWO! England 0-1 Iceland

What a let off for England. Kyle Walker plays the Iceland winger onside and the visitors were in, with two players baring down on goal.

Luckily for England, the goalscorer slipped as he went to tap in the low cross. Really should have been two.

20:03
England can't let themselves lose this game

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport:

I wasn’t concerned by the England performance in the first half. Other teams are allowed to score goals after all. They need to pick up the tempo with half an hour left however.  They really cannot let themselves lose this game.
20:02,
59'
Movement on the bench! England 0-1 Iceland

Changes are not very far away. England have just gone a little flat. They could do with a spark.

20:01,
58'
Catching practice for Ramsdale! England 0-1 Iceland

I may be downplaying the ferocity of the attempt from Gudjohnsen. The Iceland striker was allowed the freedom of Wembley and duly obliged with a craxcking half volley from 25 yards.

Luckily for the England stopper the effort was straight down his throat.

19:56,
53'
Hot Palmer! England 0-1 Iceland

The Chelsea star lost his composure or maybe he tried too much. Palmer received a great pass from Rice and was one-on-one but opted to try and round the stopper instead of shooting.

A massive chance spurned but England are creating more in this half.

19:55,
52'
Kane brilliance nearly unlocks the door! England 0-1 Iceland

Breathtaking stuff from the England captain. First he turns in the centre of the park and then he let's off a pinpoint pass with the outside of his foot into Palmer.

The Chelsea forward wasn't able to get his shot on target from a tight angle but the bit before it was very good indeed.

19:51,
49'
Foden goes close! England 0-1 Iceland

It's a better and sharper from England. More good stuff from Gordon and Foden. The Man City star played a one-two with the winger then tried a shot from the edge of the box.

His effort ended up curling wide but it was an encouraging passage of play.

19:47,
45'
Stones OFF at the break! England 0-1 Iceland

Iceland get the second half underway but the big news is that John Stones is OFF at the break.

Konsa comes on in his place.

19:43
England MUST keep their width

Wayne Rooney, Channel 4:

You have to keep the width, Gordon has done well doing that, but Palmer's coming in a lot and it's very congested in that number ten area. Keep the width, keep moving the ball from side to side.
19:32
HT: England 0-1 Iceland

Well, well, well. Iceland are trying to spoil the party again. All credit to them, the visitors took their chance really well when it came and have been resolute in defence.

Gareth Southgate will want to see more from these players in the second period. It's not that they've been bad, just a little uninspiring.

19:32,
44'
Guehi saves Three Lions! England 0-1 Iceland

A Brilliant block from the Palace man denies the visitors and in all likelyhood stops Iceland from doubling their lead.

The away team crafted another good opening, found themselves on the byline and then cut the ball back to the penalty spot.

19:30
WATCH! Harry Kane's HUGE miss

19:28,
43'
England 0-1 Iceland

A few minutes left to go in the first half and the atmosphere at Wembley is pretty flat. Every once in a while England produce an incisive pass or piece of skill to get people excited.

But Iceland have done well so far. There's really only been that chance for Harry Kane. Can they fashion something in the couple of minutes that remain?

19:25
'Gordon and Trippier don't look quite right'

Craig Hope, Mail Sport:

I watch a lot of Trippier and Gordon for Newcastle, and I rate the pair so highly. But, being honest, neither looks 100 per cent fit here.

19:23
Maybe Jurgen Klopp would be a good fit for England

19:21
The Wembley mood

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport:

The first paper aeroplanes have started to drift down from the corporate seats above the press box and that’s a common sight at Wembley.
The truth is that this is a very watchable game and the Iceland goal has introduced a bit of jeopardy which is not necessarily a bad thing.
Friendly games too often lack an edge but this one has one now. It may stand England in good stead…..if they can recover.
19:20,
33'
England 0-1 Iceland

There's no space to operate

This is a good test in patience for England. Iceland are doing a great job of being compact and have in the few minutes started to frustrate England just a little bit.

19:15,
29'
Kane misses a sitter! England 0-1 Iceland

Palmer put in a brilliant pass from the right side that fell very invitingly onto the foot of Europe's top marksman. But, to the shock of everyone in north London, Kane miscued his kick.

The ball went high over the Iceland goal and to make matters worse, replays showed he was onside.

Huge chance for the leveller there!

19:10,
25'
England 0-1 Iceland

So far so...bad?

Obviously Southgate would prefer that his side weren't behind but England have started this game well and have really only been caught out by a good sequence of play from their opponents.

Gordon has been influential, as has Foden and Kane. Surely it's only a matter of time until they find a breakthrough.

19:08
More on that Stones scare

Craig Hope, Mail Sport:

That really was a scare with John Stones earlier. The replays here drew audible gasps from the press box when the Iceland striker landed on his ankle. Thankfully, he appears OK.
19:05
WATCH! Thorsteinsson stun Wembley

19:04
Credit to the visitors for the opener

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport:

Iceland are wearing a lovely electric blue kit and have just scored an equally lovely goal.
We can talk about how easily they moved front to back through the England midfield but the truth is it was a beautifully constructed goal from the team ranked number 72 in the world.
19:02,
16'
Wasteful from Gordon! England 0-1 Iceland

It was almost an immediate reply from Southgate's side. The move was back to front with superb touches from Palmer and Kane before Gordon took on his man on the left.

The Newcastle winger did everything but find the target and produced a finished that sailed well wide.

Nevertheless, it's decent stuff from the winger. He's certainly the one looking most likely for England.

18:58,
13'
GOAL! England 0-1 Iceland (Thorsteinsson)

The visitors take a shock lead and it's not great from Ramsdale or from Stones to be honest. The winger received the ball out wide and turned the Man City man before unleashing a shot beyond the Arsenal back-up.

18:56
How Southgate has set his side up

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport:

Gareth Southgate has gone for two holding midfield players once again here and it seems as though calls for him to play with just one in the Euros are about to fall on deaf ears.
Tonight it’s Kobbie Mainoo who will play in the orbit of Declan Rice and it will be interesting to see how far upfield the Manchester United youngster is allowed to roam.
Rice told reporters yesterday his instruction to his midfield partner is always to ‘do what you do and let me take care of the rest’. So let’s see…

18:54,
8'
Foden's purring! England 0-0 Iceland

Foden gets the crowd on their feet with a gorgeous turn and pass out wide to Trippier. The Newcastle defender had to come back inside before the move eventually fizzled out but it was a lovely little demonstration of his ever-improving talents.

18:51,
5'
England 0-0 Iceland

Foden is operating more centrally

There was some debate over where Fodena and Palmer would play and in the early moments it's the Man City star that is in the No 10 position.

No goalmouth action just yet but England have made a positive start and look in better shape than they did early on against Bosnia.

18:49,
3'
England 0-0 Iceland

Early stoppage

And breath...John Stones stayed down after a tackle but he's swiftly back onto his feet and play has resumed.

It's been a steady start for the home side.

Gareth Southgate, Channel 4:

We wouldn't have any hesitation in starting [Mainoo]. He's shown incredible maturity, he progresses the ball forward quickly. He had two fabulous appearances here in March
We should see [Saka]. He's been a little bit behind.

18:38
'Let's see how Guehi does tonight,' IAN LADYMAN

Ian Ladyman, Mail Sport:

After all the fuss about James Maddisson and Jack Grealish today, the real problem facing Gareth Southgate is apparent tonight at Wembley.
No Harry Maguire at the heart of the England defence means that John Stones needs someone else to form a partnership with and tonight it’s Crystal Palace’s Marc Guehi.
My colleague man in the know Sami Mokbel wrote on Tuesday that Guehi is favourite to start against Serbia a week on Sunday so let’s see how he goes tonight.

18:32
'Only two players will come into this XI,' says CRAIG HOPE

Craig Hope, Mail Sport:

It feels like this team-sheet is very informative ahead of the group opener against Serbia. I think only two players will come into this XI, and that is Jordan Pickford for Aaron Ramsdale and Jude Bellingham, for one of Cole Palmer or Anthony Gordon.
But I think Gordon has a strong chance of staying in the team, especially given his willingness to protect his left back, a problem position for England. His club-mate Kieran Trippier starts there tonight and that relationship could be at the forefront of Southgate's thinking.
18:30
Magpies make their bit of history

Gordon and Trippier are the first Newcastle pair to start for England since August 2007.

18:22
Gordon pushing to starting in Germany

Anthony Gordon, Channel 4:

It's an absolute dream to represent England at a tournament. I can't wait to get there now. I always knew I would do what I've done this year, it was just a matter of when.
You've got to keep getting better.It's an amazing thing to hear, Rooney was my idol growing up. Just be myself. The manager likes my style of play.
18:18
Marc Guehi wild turnaround

Lewis Steele, Mail Sport:

Marc Guehi was 2/1 to start first game of the Euros four days ago btw

The Crystal Palace defender looked likely to miss the tournament having been sidleined with a knee injury for the majority of the second-half of the season.

Monday's 3-0 win over Bosnia was actually Guehi's second start since March. But here he is. The injury to Maguire means that he will be partnering Stones in defence for that first game against Serbia.

18:13
Players are out onto the pitch

Players are out onto the pitch and the warm-ups are underway. We're only 30 minutes away from kick-off at Wembley.

Southgate not afraid to pick players from unfancied sides

The headline after Southgate's squad was confirmed - after we had got over the Grealish axing - was the revelation that Crystal Palace were the best represented team in the England team.

In fact, this squad has the lowest percentage of top six players in 32 YEARS!

18:04
Rooney says 'time will tell' whether Southgate was right to announce squad before tonight's game

Wayne Rooney, Channel 4:

Time will tell. Normally you'd wait until afer the game to confirm the squad because there might be injuries.
But I think Gareth has taken any doubt away. It's an exciting team and England are right up there.

Fans are pouring into the national stadium for the final England game before the Euros gets underway. Will they be leaving full of even more hope and optimism? Is that possible?

17:51
Hopes of a quieter night at Wembley

It was the hottest ticket in town. The face value of an official UEFA Champions League final ticket last weekend ranged from £60 to £610 but online and on the black market, they were selling for thousands of pounds.

A quick scroll through Live Football Tickets - a popular secondary ticket website - in the hours before kick-off showed a going rate of around £4,000 and these were for upper-tier seats. Some of the lower-tier seats were selling for close to £10,000.

Gareth Southgate, England manager:

‘It wouldn’t have been fair on the players that we’ve released, wouldn’t have been fair on the players that were waiting to have confirmation that they were in.
‘Inevitably, we knew when we named a 33 there would be a period of a nice prep camp, and then there was going to be a couple of days where there would be a lot of anxiety and a difficult couple of days for us all.
‘But we’ll close that down later tonight and now tomorrow everybody’s heads are clear.’

At times last season it appeared that the former Manchester City forward was single-handedly keeping Chelsea in the top-flight. I kid, only a little.

Across Europe's top five leagues, only Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe had more goal involvements. But unfortunately for the uber confident youngster there are a number of very qualified players ahead of him in the England pecking order.

Can he impress enough to force his way into the starting side or should he just be thrilled to be here?

History repeating itself

Cast your mind back to the summer of 2004. England, fit with an exciting young talent, faced Iceland in their pre-tournament send-off.

The Three Lions battered their opponents 6-1 at the Etihad with Wayne Rooney bagging himself a brace.

He of course went on to set Euro 2004 alight and might have led England all the way to the trophy if it wasn't for that pesky injury in the quarter-final defeat by Portgual.

Lions are in the house

Here are the troops walking out onto the Wembley turf for tonight's game against...Iceland. We're over the whole Iceland thing now, right? Right?

A little audition for Mainoo

Speaking of the Man United midfielder, his absence from Monday's win over Bosnia - due to starring in the FA Cup final - opened the door for a couple of players to gain some attention.

Such is the talent in this England squad, you could argue that Gallagher, Alexander-Arnold and Wharton all made decent cases to start alongside Declan Rice next week.

If Mainoon gets the start today you can assume that he's in the box seat but he'll need to make sure his performance is top notch. Going off his performances in the Premier League last season, there's no reason to assume he won't do just that.

17:10
Will tonight's line-up start the Euros?

Many are predicting that Southgate will use this fixture - the first half at least - as a dress rehersal for England's tournament opener against Serbia on June 16.

Makes total sense. This is the last chanve he'll get to see his team in a somewhat competitive enviornment and there are still so many question marks over the defence and midfield.

Mainoo or Gallagher? Is Guehi really good enough to replace Maguire and will it Foden on the left, right or somewhere else entirely. Oh, and don't forget about Cole Palmer.

The Man United and Man City contingent are back involved tonight but Jude Bellingham is still enjoying a mini holiday after winning the Champions League...It's a fair excuse I suppose.

The unlucky seven

There's only one place to start and it's with the seven unfortunate players who were cut from the provisional 33-man squad on Thursday. News started coming through early in the day that James Maddison, Jarrel Quansah and Curtis Jones had been told they wouldn't go.

Then came the kicker that Harry Maguire didn't make it because of injury and then the shock of Jack Grealish's omission.
