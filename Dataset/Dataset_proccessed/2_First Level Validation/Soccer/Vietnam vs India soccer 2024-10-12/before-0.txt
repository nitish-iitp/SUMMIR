India vs Vietnam: Blue Tigers face big threat in friendly clash

Neither team enters this match in peak form. India has struggled throughout 2024, and Vietnam has lost 10 of their last 11 matches.

The Indian football team, known as the Blue Tigers, is gearing up to face Vietnam in a crucial international friendly on October 12, 2024, at the Thiên Trường Stadium in Nam Định. While it may be a friendly match, both teams are hungry for a win, and India faces significant challenges against a formidable Vietnamese squad.

As the two nations reignite their football rivalry, India will need to overcome Vietnam’s strength and current form to secure a morale-boosting victory.

Historical rivalry revived: India vs Vietnam

India and Vietnam’s football rivalry dates back to the mid-20th century, with regular encounters in the Merdeka Cup and Asian Games. However, since Vietnam’s unification, meetings have been rare. This match marks only the fourth time the unified Vietnam has faced India in senior international football.

In their last encounter during the 2022 Hưng Thịnh Friendly Tournament, Vietnam comfortably defeated India 3-0. Two years on, the teams meet again, each in a phase of transition, but both eager to come out on top.

Transitional Phases for Both Teams

Both India and Vietnam are navigating periods of change, with new head coaches leading each side. Vietnam, currently ranked 116th in the world, recently appointed former South Korean international Kim Sang-sik as head coach. Under his leadership, the team has had mixed results, including a win over the Philippines but losses to Russia and Thailand.

India, ranked 126th, is under the guidance of Spanish coach Manolo Márquez, who took over earlier this year. Despite a winless run since November 2023 and narrowly missing out on FIFA World Cup qualification, Márquez remains optimistic. “We’ve improved physically since our league started, but we can still be better,” he said, as he prepares the team for this challenging friendly.

Key players to watch in India vs Vietnam

Both teams will field a mix of seasoned veterans and emerging talent. Vietnam’s squad includes 13 players from their 2022 victory over India, with key figures such as Nguyễn Văn Toàn, Nguyễn Văn Quyết, and prolific striker Nguyễn Tiến Linh. Captain Quế Ngọc Hải and goalkeeper Đặng Văn Lâm are also key pillars of the team.

India, meanwhile, features 10 players from their 2022 squad, including goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, defender Anwar Ali, and winger Lallianzuala Chhangte. Márquez has introduced new faces like left-back Aakash Sangwan and midfielder Lalrinliana Hnamte to add fresh energy to the team. Forward Farukh Choudhary also returns after a three-year absence, providing another attacking option.

Tactical Challenges and Key Battles

For India, controlling the midfield will be crucial. Players like Jeakson Singh and Brandon Fernandes must dictate play, while the creativity of wingers Chhangte and Liston Colaco will be vital in breaking through Vietnam’s defense. India’s defense, led by Anwar Ali and Chinglensana Singh, will need to contain Vietnam’s attacking threats, particularly striker Nguyễn Tiến Linh.

Vietnam will rely heavily on Nguyễn Quang Hải, who had a brief stint in France’s Ligue 2, to orchestrate their attacks. Defensively, the experience of Quế Ngọc Hải will be key in organizing Vietnam’s backline and neutralizing India’s forward line.
