TELL ME MORE

After a tight first half where Brian Brobbey and Cyle Larin should have scored for the Dutch and Canada respectively, three second-half goals in 13 minutes effectively ended the contest. Memphis Depay notched his 45th goal for his country after tucking home a sumptuous cross from Frimpong five minutes after the break, before the tricky winger made it 2-0 in the 57th minute with a lovely curled finish from a tight angle. And six minutes later, substitute Wout Weghorst stabbed in from close range after reacting quickest to goalkeeper Dayne St. Clair's error. While Canada made it too easy for the hosts, particularly with Virgil van Dijk's 83rd-minute header, this was a confidence-boosting win for Holland ahead of Euro 2024.

THE MVP

After scoring 14 goals and bagging 12 assists for Leverkusen as the German side won a domestic double this season, Frimpong looks set to be a real weapon for Netherlands going forward. His excellent assist, clinical finish and pace in behind will be a threat to any side. He has done himself no harm ahead of Euro 2024.

THE BIG LOSER

While Jesse Marsch's side were cut open far too easily on numerous occasions over the contest, despite putting in a good defensive display for the first half, Cyle Larin missed a glorious opportunity for Canada just before half time when the game was goalless. From just eight yards out, the Mallorca striker simply HAD to score but missed the target completely.

WHAT COMES NEXT?
