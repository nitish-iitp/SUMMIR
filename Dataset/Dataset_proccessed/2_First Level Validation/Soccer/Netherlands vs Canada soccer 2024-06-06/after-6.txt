Alphonso Davies gets CanMNT captaincy audition he wanted

One tried-and-tested way to stamp your authority as a new head coach is to pick a new captain from the get-go. Jesse Marsch’s authority doesn’t really need stamping. But, still, he understandably wants his own leader for the Canadian men’s national team. At the first time of asking, that man was Alphonso Davies.

Davies captained Canada as the Marsch era officially began on Thursday with a 4-0 defeat to the Netherlands.

“I was happy for him. I think he wore it in a good way and I think he represented himself and the team in a good way,” Marsch said in his post-match press conference.

“Alphonso has been a big factor in terms of the overall energy of what the first week has been like and his work ethic, his positivity, his motivation and concentration to help the team transform into what we want it to come become has been really good.”

Marsch stressed post-game that this was not a permanent decision. Not yet, at least. He said he will “rotate” captains in his early games. But Davies is evidently a leading candidate to wear the armband permanently.

While the identity of Marsch’s long-term captain is unclear, what is clear is that this Canada team needs new-age leaders.

Gone for good are Atiba Hutchinson, Milan Borjan, and Steven Vitória. These were players who weren’t always the brightest stars or the most impressive performers on the field, but who typified what leading this team meant. 

Who will step up now, in what is arguably the most formative two-year period in the long history of this national team? Who will be the man who answers for this team alongside Marsch, who picks up teammates when they’re feeling down, who mediates disputes, who leads discussions with referees, who keeps his emotions in check, who does everything he does with the sole focus of driving this team on to be the best version of itself it can possibly be?

Davies was very forthright in March as Mauro Biello led Canada into the Copa América qualifier against Trinidad and Tobago. He said he wanted the captaincy, stressing that he felt ready to shoulder the gravity of the armband and all its myriad responsibilities and lead this team forward.

“I didn’t really ask [Biello] that I want to be captain, I just asked him to put me in the running,” Davies said at that time. “I think I’m ready to lead this team.”

Biello said no, instead opting for the reliable midfield metronome and quiet personality Stephen Eustáquio.

Fast-forward to this week and as Davies sat alongside Marsch at a press conference in Rotterdam, the issue of the captaincy wasn’t directly addressed. But reading between the lines, it was obvious even before the lineup announcement pre-game on Thursday that Davies, the most talented and decorated player in the history of the Canadian men’s national team, would be the first man given his chance to lead.

“The first time we met, he asked me two or three times: ‘What does it mean to be a Canadian?'” Davies said on Wednesday. “The first time, I told him my answer. But then he really asked me to sit down and think about it. Then he asked if he were to put me in a situation to wear the armband, how would I carry myself? Those aren’t questions that I get every day.”

Davies said Marsch had already spoken to him about being the one to lead the team speeches pre-game doing the team speeches, something Davies said is “out of my comfort zone” but that he is happy to take on.

“What I’m challenging him to do now is to be a good leader, not just a great player,” Marsch had said on Wednesday, sat six feet away from Davies. “Be someone who takes care of the group, finding the right way to have the right kind of conversations with new players, experienced players.”

Thursday’s game was the first chapter in a new story for CanMNT. Never in the program’s history have they played three games of such a high profile in a row. They’ve played more important ones in terms of results, but it’s all about all that this represents.

It’s playing three of the world’s best seven teams in a row. It’s the short run-up to competing with some of the world’s best at Copa América starting two weeks today against world champions Argentina. It’s the long run-up to co-hosting a World Cup for the first time in two years’ time. It’s the start of a new era under a new head coach who has been charged with taking this team to the next unprecedented step.

Above all, it’s the opportunity to prove that all the success that has come before for this team was no flash in the plan; that the men’s national team can lead sustained and impactful growth towards Canada truly being what so many people love to airily term “a football country.”

Davies has done a huge amount for this country and this team already. He’s led them (unofficially in performance, if not officially as captain) to finish as the top team in CONCACAF and qualify for a first World Cup in 36 years. He’s scored their first-ever goal at a World Cup. His globally recognized name and five Bundesliga titles have been the biggest factor in raising awareness of the talent this generation of this team holds.

He had, quite frankly, a pretty poor game in Rotterdam on Thursday. He was rinsed by Bundesliga winner Jeremie Frimpong for the first goal and was outmatched for much of the game down Canada’s left flank, particularly as CanMNT faded after a high-intensity start.

Whether his long-term position is at left-back or further forward is a big ongoing debate and a headache for Marsch.

But that’s one for another day.

While Alphonso Davies’ position on the field is still up for debate, his standing on this team isn’t. Others will audition for the armband in the coming days and weeks. Whether Davies gets it permanently or not, he’s one of Marsch’s chosen leaders.

In a formative couple of years for this team and this program, it’s time for one of its foremost figureheads to step up.
