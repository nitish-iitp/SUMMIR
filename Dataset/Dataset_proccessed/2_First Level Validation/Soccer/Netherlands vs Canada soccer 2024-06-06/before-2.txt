Preview: Netherlands vs. Canada - prediction, team news, lineups

Netherlands continue their final preparations for Euro 2024 with an international friendly against Canada on Thursday evening.

Oranje will be looking for a morale-boosting win against the 2022 World Cup participants having ended the March international break on a low note.

Ronald Koeman is preparing to take Netherlands into another tournament as one of the dark horses in a bid to end their 36-year wait for another major trophy.

Netherlands had been on a four-match winning streak either side of the turn of the year, scoring 12 goals in matches against Greece, Republic of Ireland, Gibraltar and Scotland without conceding a goal.

However, losing 2-1 to Germany last time out has halted their momentum and perhaps highlighted that improvements will be required just to progress through a difficult group at Euro 2024.

France, Austria and Poland lie in wait for Koeman and his squad and they will be eager for a confidence boost against Canada and Iceland.

Koeman has already taken the decision to select his 26-player squad for the tournament, easing the pressure - to a certain degree - on the players who are eager to break into the starting lineup.

These two nations have gone three decades without crossing paths, with Netherlands running out 3-0 victors when they met in Toronto in 1994.

Canada are a far different animal compared to back then having played at the 2022 World Cup, yet they have underachieved since that long-awaited second appearance at that tournament.

Although six wins have come from 12 matches, Canada have posted few notable victories, as well as suffering defeat on penalties to the USA in the Gold Cup quarter-finals.

Former Leeds United head coach Jesse Marsch has now been placed in charge of the Canucks and is tasked with rebuilding his own reputation as much as keeping Canada as a threat in international football.

This is a rare encounter against European opposition for Canada; since the coronavirus pandemic, their only two such games - against Croatia and Belgium - came at the World Cup.

Although Koeman has the 11 players who started the Germany defeat at his disposal, he is expected to make changes to his first XI.

If Koeman sticks with a back three, a solution is required at left wing-back, with Nathan Ake, Daley Blind and Jeremie Frimpong all players who could be used.

Teun Koopmeiners and Cody Gakpo may return in midfield and attack respectively, but Frenkie de Jong remains absent with an ankle injury.

With Joel Waterman not available, Marsch must decide who to select at centre-back, providing that he sticks with a defensive five.

Derek Cornelius or 18-year-old Fulham defender Luc De Fougerolles are options, as is the experienced Richie Laryea who may be drafted back into the side.

Recent Sheffield Wednesday loanee Ike Ugbo could retain his place down the centre of the attack.


Netherlands possible starting lineup:
Verbruggen; Ake, De Ligt, Van Dijk; Dumfries, Veerman, Reijnders, Blind; Koopmeiners; Gakpo, Depay

Canada possible starting lineup:
Crepeau; Buchanan, Laryea, Miller, Johnston, Davies; Eustaquio, Kone; David; Larin, Ugbo



We say: Netherlands 3-1 Canada

There are players in this Canadian squad who will feel that they can impact on this contest, perhaps even guide Canada to a draw. However, we are backing the Dutch to eventually come through in style, potentially courtesy of a fast conclusion to the match.
