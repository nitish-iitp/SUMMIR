Preview: Ukraine vs. Georgia - prediction, team news, lineups

Top meets bottom in League B Group 1, as growing force Georgia meet last-placed Ukraine in the UEFA Nations League on Friday.

Buoyed by a superb showing at Euro 2024, the Georgians claimed maximum points last month, while their opponents suffered back-to-back defeats.

While Georgia had the time of their lives in Germany, Ukraine were unfortunately eliminated at the group stage despite picking up four points, as they fell at the first hurdle for a third time in four European Championship appearances.

Serhiy Rebrov's side were determined to bounce back from such disappointment in September, but they failed to cling onto a one-goal lead against Albania in their Nations League opener, losing 2-1 in Prague.

As war continues to rage in the Ukrainians' homeland, they will now host Friday's game in Poland, having also come away empty-handed from a five-goal thriller against the Czech Republic.

Trailing by two when heading into the closing stages, the Blue and Yellow were given fresh hope by Heorhiy Sudakov's 84th-minute strike, but their hosts held on and consigned Ukraine to last place in the Group 1 standings.

Already renowned for his national-team feats as a player, Rebrov had only lost three of 16 previous matches in charge, but his team now face a real fight to retain their League B status.

Yet, with four games left, there is still time to turn the tide and even contend for promotion to Europe's top tier, which they last competed in four years ago: second place would secure a playoff, so two wins this month could keep that dream alive.

In six past meetings with Ukraine, there have been no wins to celebrate for Georgia, who have spent most of their time since gaining independence as one of the continent's outsiders.

Having taken the Nations League route to Euro 2024, though - topping their League C group and then progressing through the playoffs - their status has sky-rocketed over the past few months.

After making the knockout stage in Germany, Willy Sagnol's side returned to action in fine style last month, when they put four past the Czech Republic - with talisman Khvicha Kvaratskhelia opening the scoring from a penalty - and edged out Albania.

That established a three-point cushion over both of their September victims, and they occupy top spot in Group 1, with back-to-back promotions now a distinct possibility.

Due to competing in its lower echelons, Georgia's overall Nations League record is particularly impressive, having won seven of their last eight fixtures in UEFA's newest international tournament.

However, across all competitions, the Jvarosnebi have lost six of their last nine on the road, so Sagnol will take nothing for granted before heading to Poznan.

One of his nation's all-time top scorers, Serhiy Rebrov will be glad to welcome back Ukraine's current star striker, as in-form Roma forward Artem Dovbyk returns after being sidelined in September.

However, Premier League duo Oleksandr Zinchenko and Vitaliy Mykolenko are both unavailable, in addition to Girona winger Viktor Tsygankov and Genoa midfielder Ruslan Malinovskyi, the latter of whom recently suffered a serious ankle injury.

Andriy Yarmolenko picked up a knock at the weekend, so Ukraine's 48-goal captain will also be missing on Friday. Midfield pair Taras Stepanenko and Volodymyr Brazhko have dropped out too.

Meanwhile, Georgia have far fewer absences to concern them, but MLS 'Player of the Season' nominee Saba Lobzhanidze will not travel to Poland.

Khvicha Kvaratskhelia usually grabs the headlines, but Liverpool-bound goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili proved his potential by topping the save charts at Euro 2024, where Lyon striker Georges Mikautadze shared the Golden Boot.


Ukraine possible starting lineup:
Trubin; Konoplya, Zabarnyi, Matvienko, Mykhaylichenko; Sudakov, Buyalskyi, Shaparenko; Zubkov, Dovbyk, Mudryk

Georgia possible starting lineup:
Mamardashvili; Gvelesiani, Kashia, Dvali; Kakabadze, Chakvetadze, Kochorashvili, Kiteishvili, Lochoshvili; Kvaratskhelia, Mikautadze



We say: Ukraine 2-2 Georgia

As Ukraine have been struck by a series of injuries to key men - and they are still denied home advantage - they may have to settle for one point against a well-drilled Georgia side.

The Group 1 leaders have a clear identity and some talented forwards, so they can keep their Nations League unbeaten streak going.
