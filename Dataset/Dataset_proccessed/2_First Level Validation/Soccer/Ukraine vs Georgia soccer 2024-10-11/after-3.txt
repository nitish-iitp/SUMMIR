NATIONS LEAGUE 2024/25: UKRAINE CLAIMS FIRST WIN OF THE TOURNAMENT AGAINST GEORGIA

11.10.2024 23:51

The national team of Ukraine continued their UEFA Nations League 2024/25 campaign with a match against Georgia in Poznań.

Serhiy Rebrov's side entered the tournament with defeats to Albania (1:2) and Czechia (2:3). The team traveled to Poznań, Poland, where they played what was officially a home match against Georgia, the current group leaders.

Ukraine faced numerous squad issues and forced changes before the match, unable to field their strongest lineup. Notable inclusions were debutant Kalyuzhnyi, as well as Talovierov and Hutsulyak. It should be mentioned that Stepanenko and Kabaiev were left out of the matchday squad.

Early in the match, both teams exchanged unsuccessful attempts — Kvaratskhelia's free-kick and Sudakov's shot wide of the far post. Later, Talovierov headed over the bar from a Mudryk set-piece delivery. Overall, Ukraine consistently pressured Georgia in their half. In the 35th minute, the pressure paid off: Ukraine's press forced a turnover in Georgia’s half, Sudakov passed to Mudryk, who took on the defense, cutting in from the flank and firing into the near post to open the scoring.

Georgia responded with a shot on target by Kochorashvili, who later missed from a promising position. Shaparenko had a chance for Ukraine but missed following a Sudakov cross. Towards the end of the first half, Ukraine switched to a more defensive approach but held onto their lead.

In the second half, both sides had chances — Mikautadze shot wide, while Mudryk’s effort from outside the box was saved by Mamardashvili. The rest of the match saw few dangerous attacks, though Georgia did force Trubin into action a few times near the end.

In the end, Serhiy Rebrov's team secured a 1:0 victory, their first of the group stage. Ukraine will remain in Poland as they prepare for their next match on October 14, a nominally home fixture against Czechia at the Tarczyński Arena in Wrocław (kickoff at 21:45 Kyiv time).
