Mykhailo Mudryk finally ended his lengthy goal drought with a stunning strike in Ukraine’s 1-0 win over Georgia on Friday night.

The Chelsea winger hadn’t netted for club or country since opening the scoring against Nottingham Forest back in May, but he put things right with a sublime right-footed finish in the 35th minute of Ukraine’s Nations League victory.

After a poor misplaced pass, Mudryk regained possession inside the Georgia half and after skipping past three defenders, he cut onto his stronger right-foot and arrowed a finish into the near post.

Giorgi Mamardashvili, who will join Liverpool next summer, was unable to get near Mudryk’s effort, with the Chelsea speedster helping Ukraine to their first win of the new Nations League campaign.

Before netting against Georgia, Mudryk had gone 20 games without a goal for club or country (including friendlies), while he only managed to register two assists during that time.

His goal comes amid increasing speculation that he could leave Chelsea during the January transfer window.

Will Mykhailo Mudryk leave Chelsea?

Mudryk has only started one Premier League match so far this season and he has amassed just 81 league minutes of action from a possible 630 in 2024-25.

The Ukrainian has wildly underperformed since his initial €70 million move from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2023 and a January exit has been touted as a distinct possibility.

Marseille were linked with a move this summer, with Roberto De Zerbi keen on a reunion with the 23-year-old, while rumours have suggested that a loan to Chelsea’s sister club Strasbourg could be an option.

However, Ben Jacobs has denied reports that Mudryk could leave Stamford Bridge during the winter window.

The Ukraine international is reportedly seen as “strong competition” for Jadon Sancho, while Enzo Maresca believes Mudryk is an important player, despite his lack of action so far this campaign.
