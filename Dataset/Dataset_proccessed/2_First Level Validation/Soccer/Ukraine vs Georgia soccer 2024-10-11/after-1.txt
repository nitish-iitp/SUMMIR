UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE
UKRAINE
GEORGIA

On October 11, 2024, at 18:45 GMT, Ukraine will face Georgia in a crucial UEFA Nations League match at Stadion Poznań, Poland. The match will be officiated by Austrian referee Weinberger J., and the stadium will welcome up to 42,837 spectators. As part of the third round in League B of the UEFA Nations League, this football clash is set to be an important fixture for both teams, with Georgia currently leading the group and Ukraine striving to recover from a tough start.

This match holds high stakes for both nations. Georgia, fresh off a strong Euro 2024 performance, looks to maintain their top spot in the group, while Ukraine, battling injuries and the displacement of their home games, seeks a much-needed win. The football world will be watching closely as both teams, under their respective coaches Willy Sagnol and Serhiy Rebrov, aim to secure vital points in this international competition.

BETTING TIPS AND MATCH INSIGHTS

As we dive into the details of the Ukraine vs Georgia prediction today, it’s important to consider the form and momentum each team brings into the match. Ukraine has struggled in recent fixtures, grappling with injuries and poor results. On the other hand, Georgia has enjoyed a streak of victories, especially after their impressive Euro 2024 campaign. Despite Ukraine’s home advantage being diminished due to their games being played in Poland, they will look to capitalize on their experience. Georgia, though less experienced in the higher echelons of European football, has demonstrated their growing strength, making this match unpredictable.

Ukraine Results

Ukraine has faced mixed results recently, with their performance in various competitions showcasing both promise and frustration. Below is a summary of Ukraine’s last five games:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	W/L
10.09.24	UNL	Czech Republic vs Ukraine	3-2	L
07.09.24	UNL	Ukraine vs Albania	1-2	L
26.06.24	EUR	Ukraine vs Belgium	0-0	D
21.06.24	EUR	Slovakia vs Ukraine	1-2	W
17.06.24	EUR	Romania vs Ukraine	3-0	L

Ukraine has struggled to find consistency, with only one win in their last five matches, and two back-to-back defeats in the Nations League. Their offensive output has been limited, as seen in their goalless draw with Belgium and the narrow loss to Albania. These results indicate that Ukraine is under pressure to improve, especially as they fight to retain their position in League B.

Georgia Results

Georgia, in contrast, has been riding high following their Euro 2024 success, with solid performances in the Nations League as well. Here’s a look at Georgia’s recent matches:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	W/L
10.09.24	UNL	Albania vs Georgia	0-1	W
07.09.24	UNL	Georgia vs Czech Republic	4-1	W
30.06.24	EUR	Spain vs Georgia	4-1	L
26.06.24	EUR	Georgia vs Portugal	2-0	W
22.06.24	EUR	Georgia vs Czech Republic	1-1	D

Georgia has shown strong form, winning three of their last five matches, including an impressive 4-1 victory against the Czech Republic. Their offense has been firing on all cylinders, with key players like Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Georges Mikautadze delivering when it matters most. This level of consistency makes Georgia a dangerous opponent.

Ukraine vs Georgia Head-to-Head

Here is a summary of the last five meetings between Ukraine and Georgia:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result
09.06.15	FI	Georgia vs Ukraine	1-2
08.09.07	EUR	Georgia vs Ukraine	1-1
06.09.06	EUR	Ukraine vs Georgia	3-2
03.09.05	WC	Georgia vs Ukraine	1-1
13.10.04	WC	Ukraine vs Georgia	2-0

Historically, Ukraine has had the upper hand, with three wins and two draws in their last five encounters. However, with Georgia’s recent rise in form and Ukraine’s current struggles, this head-to-head record may not fully reflect the current balance of power between the two teams.

Ukraine vs Georgia: Unavailable Players

In football, injuries and suspensions can play a pivotal role in determining a team’s strategy and performance. Here is an overview of the players who will be unavailable for Ukraine vs Georgia due to injuries and other reasons.
