Scotland will be expecting to snap their winless streak when they kick off their Euro 2024 preparations against minnows Gibraltar in Portugal.

The Tartan Army have seen their side fail to win in their last seven matches since securing qualification for this summer's tournament, although that run should come to an end because their opponents sit 203rd in the world rankings and have lost their last 12 games in a row.

Whether Gibraltar will provide Scotland a stiff enough test for the hurly burly of the Euros remains to be seen, although manager Steve Clarke will want to get through the game unscathed after striker Lyndon Dykes recently joined a lengthy injury list.

Watch Gibraltar v Scotland on Premier Sports

The QPR striker was spotted leaving training on a stretcher last Friday and has since been ruled out of contention, joining the likes of Bologna attacking midfielder Lewis Ferguson and Premier League defenders Aaron Hickey and Nathan Patterson at home.

Southampton striker Che Adams is likely to lead the line in Dykes' absence, but 31-goal Hearts hotshot Lawrence Shankland should be given minutes against Gibraltar, while Liverpool's rising star Ben Doak will be hoping to win a maiden cap.

RadioTimes.com has rounded up everything you need to know about how to watch Gibraltar v Scotland on TV and online.
