It kicks off in Dortmund at 18:00 CET (16:00 GMT) on Saturday, June 22, 2024.

Both sides won their opening fixtures in Group F in dramatic circumstances. Vincenzo Montella’s Turkey risked conceding the equaliser for 2-2 in stoppages before scoring on the counter into an empty net to beat Georgia 3-1. Portugal scraped their 2-1 comeback victory over Czechia in added time with substitute Francisco Conceicao.

Montella is the Italian coach of Turkey, with players at his disposal including Inter midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu and Juventus teenage talent Kenan Yildiz. Milan star Rafael Leao needs to make an impact for Portugal after he was substituted in the opening game.
