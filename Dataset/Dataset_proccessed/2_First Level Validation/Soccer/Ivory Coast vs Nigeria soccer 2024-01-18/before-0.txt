Host nation Ivory Coast take on Nigeria in the group stages of AFCON 2023

Ivory Coast delighted their fans with a 2-0 victory against Guinea-Bissau, highlighted by Seko Fofana’s stunning goal. The Ivorian squad looks formidable, and a win in the next game could secure their spot in the last 16.

Contrastingly, Nigeria faced pressure after a draw with Equatorial Guinea, where Victor Osimhen equalized following Ivan Salvador’s surprising lead. Despite Nigeria’s talented attacking unit, they last won the tournament in 2013, two years before Ivory Coast’s second triumph, adding to the stakes for the Super Eagles.

Players to watch
Seko Fofana (Ivory Coast)

Recognized for his dynamic approach, Seko Fofana is distinguished by robust technical prowess, remarkable dribbling skills, and proficiency in midfield control. His versatility shines through as he actively contributes to both defensive efforts and attacking maneuvers. Having gained experience playing across Europe alongside top-tier players, Fofana emerges as a crucial asset for the host nation’s success in the current AFCON edition.

Victor Osimhen (Nigeria)

At 25 years old, Victor Osimhen is set to shine as the focal point of the Nigerian squad. With an impressive record of 7 goals and 2 assists in 13 Serie A games this season, Osimhen’s equalizer earned Nigeria a point in their AFCON opener. His style is a well-rounded combination of athleticism, skill, and goal-scoring proficiency.
