FT: Ivory Coast 0.0 Nigeria. Neither side was able to dominate possession in the first half, which ended in a goalless draw. However, the Super Eagles improved in the second half and got the reward they were looking for when Victor Osimhen was brought down by Diomande inside the box. The referee awarded Nigeria a penalty after a VAR review and Troost-Ekong scored the winning goal from the spot. The Elephants tried to score an equaliser until the end but Jose Peseiro's side held on for the win.
