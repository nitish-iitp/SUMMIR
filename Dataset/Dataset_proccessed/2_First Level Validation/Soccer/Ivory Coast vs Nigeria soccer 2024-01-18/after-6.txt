AFRICA CUP OF NATIONS
IVORY COAST 0-1 NIGERIA: SECOND HALF WILLIAM TROOST-EKONG PENALTY GIVES SUPER EAGLES NARROW WIN OVER HOSTS
BYMICHAEL HINCKS

UPDATED 18/01/2024 AT 19:35 GMT

A tense battle between 2024 Africa Cup of Nations hosts Ivory Coast and Nigeria went the way of the Super Eagles following a second-half penalty from captain William Troost-Ekong. The defender struck from 12 yards for the only goal of the game after VAR deemed that Victor Osimhen had been fouled. Nigeria move to four points after two games in Group A with Ivory Coast remaining on three.

William Troost-Ekong’s penalty secured victory for Nigeria against hosts Ivory Coast and swung Group A back in the Super Eagles’ favour at the Africa Cup of Nations.
After drawing their opening game against Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria were good value for this narrow victory, although it only came after a debatable second-half penalty when Ousmane Diomande was deemed to have clipped Victor Osimhen.

Captain Troost-Ekong stepped up to score from the spot, and Nigeria were able to then keep Ivory Coast at bay and leapfrog them in the table into second.

Equatorial Guinea remain top and face Ivory Coast on Monday, at the same time Nigeria will fancy their chances against Guinea-Bissau.
With third perhaps enough to qualify for the knockouts, Equatorial Guinea, Ivory Coast and Nigeria can all still progress – but defeat on Thursday certainly ramps up the pressure on the hosts heading into those final round of Group A fixtures.
TALKING POINT – MISFIRING OSIMHEN
Osimhen may have got the goal in their previous match and earned the penalty that ultimately won them the game on Thursday, but Nigeria need more from their star striker, who in turn needs greater service if they are to go the distance at this tournament.
The Napoli forward missed a glorious opportunity in the first half when he really should have done better - and that summed up a frustrating evening for him personally.
All strikers miss chances, of course, and it didn’t cost them today, but unless he improves his finishing you fear it could cost Nigeria in the bigger moments. That said, he has the quality to make amends and really prove to the continent and the world why he is the reigning African Football of the Year.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH – CALVIN BASSEY (NIGERIA)
A tough call with a handful of deserving candidates, including Ademola Lookman and match-winner Troost-Ekong, but we’ll give it to Fulham’s Calvin Bassey. The defender was a rock for Nigeria, putting in a proper shift and clearly enjoying the battle.
PLAYER RATINGS
Ivory Coast: Y. Fofana 6; Ndicka 6, Diomande 6, Konan 6; S. Fofana 5, Aurier 5, Sangare 5, Kessie 5, Kouame 6, Boga 5, Krasso 5. Subs: Singo 6, Bamba 6, Pepe 6, Diakite n/a, Konate n/a.
Nigeria: Nwabali 7, Aina 6, Troost-Ekong 7, Ajayi 7, Bassey 8, Zaidu 7, Onyeka 7, Iwobi 7, Lookman 7, Chukwueze 7, Osimhen 6. Subs: Simon 6, Osayi 6, Omeruo n/a, Onuachu n/a.
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
8’ HUGE CHANCE! - Osimhen is right to be disappointed… He latches onto a brilliant through ball and is ahead of Aurier with only the goalkeeper to beat, but he cannot keep his effort down. Lack of composure there.
17’ SAVE! - The cross comes in from deep and Kouame does well to play it back for Ndicka, the defender who is arguably among the players Ivory Coast would least like to have with a free attempt from 15 yards out. He lines up his shot, but it’s straight at Nwabali for a simple save.
53' VAR CHECKING PENALTY - Osimhen remains down in the Ivory Coast box and replays show Diomande may well have caught him. Big decision coming up as referee Mustapha Ghorbal goes to the pitchside monitor...
54’ PENALTY! - Indeed. You just got the sense the minute he checked the monitor. Mustapha Ghorbal runs back on and points to the spot.
55’ GOAL! IVORY COAST 0-1 NIGERIA (TROOST-EKONG) - It’s a big moment for Troost-Ekong as the crowd make their feelings about the decision clear… Right down the middle! No stopping that. Well. Unless you stay down the middle. But Fofana didn’t…
KEY STATS
William Troost-Ekong scored his fifth goal for Nigeria.
This was the first AFCON meeting between the two sides since 2013. On that occasion Nigeria beat Ivory Coast 2-1 in the quarters and went on to win the tournament.
