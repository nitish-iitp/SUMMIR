Hosts Ivory Coast take on Nigeria in the group stages of AFCON 2023

Ivory Coast delighted their fans with a 2-0 victory against Guinea-Bissau, highlighted by Seko Fofana’s stunning goal. The Ivorian squad looks formidable, and a win in the next game could secure their spot in the last 16.

Contrastingly, Nigeria faced pressure after a draw with Equatorial Guinea, where Victor Osimhen equalized following Ivan Salvador’s surprising lead. Despite Nigeria’s talented attacking unit, they last won the tournament in 2013, two years before Ivory Coast’s second triumph, adding to the stakes for the Super Eagles.

The AFCON 2023 match between Ivory Coast and Nigeria will be on Thursday, 18th January 2024, 5:00 PM (GMT); 10:30 PM (IST) at Alassane Ouattara Stadium.
