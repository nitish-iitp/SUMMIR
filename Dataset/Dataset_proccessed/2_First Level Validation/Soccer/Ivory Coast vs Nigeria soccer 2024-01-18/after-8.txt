The Africa Cup of Nations continues this evening with a much-anticipated battle between Ivory Coast and Nigeria. The result of this match could determine which nation finishes top of Group A. The Ivory Coast currently hold first place following their 2-0 victory over Guinea-Bissau in their Afcon opener and look like a confident force under French boss Jean-Louis Gasset.

Nigeria in contrast slumped to a shock 1-1 draw with Equatorial Guinea last time out. Ivan Salvador opened the scoring for the visitors before the Super Eagles’ talisman, Victor Osimhen, netted an equaliser two minutes later. Nigeria then failed to assert their dominance on the match and could not find a winning goal. They now need to triumph in a trickier contest against the Elephants in order to get their campaign back on track.

Nigeria’s last of their three tournament triumphs came in 2013 with the Ivory Coast becoming champions, for a second time, two years later. However, both nations have underperformed in recent years and will have their sights set on reaching the latter stages of the competition.

FT Ivory Coast 0-1 Nigeria

Nigeria will expect to beat bottom side Guinea-Bissau in their final match. If they avoid defeat, they are guaranteed to progress as one of the top two.

And if Nigeria avoid defeat, hosts Ivory Coast must win against the group leaders to finish in the top two and go through automatically.

FT Ivory Coast 0-1 Nigeria

How’s Group A shaping up now?

Equatorial Guinea beat Guinea-Bissau 4-2 earlier today and moved to the top of the group with four points. Just behind them are the Super Eagles.

Nigeria also have four points through a draw and a win from their opening two games, but their goal difference is one fewer than Equatorial Guinea’s.

Ivory Coast are third with three points, and Guinea-Bissau are bottom with zero after two losses.

Ivory Coast 0-1 Nigeria

90+5 mins: The Nigerian players are trying to eke minutes out of the game. Going down and taking their time recovering from minor injuries.

Nigeria have never beaten Ivory Coast in their own backyard and they’re mere minutes away from a big win.

Ivory Coast 0-1 Nigeria

80 mins: Into the final 10 minutes now and Ivory Coast have flooded the pitch with attacking players in order to find a way through Nigeria.

The Super Eagles are happy to just defend this lead but with the way the momentum is turning they’ll have to be perfect in defence.

Ivory Coast 0-1 Nigeria

73 mins: Chance! Ivory Coast have made a few changes, one of which is Nicolas Pepe, who makes an enterprising run down the right wing.

He gets into the box as the ball comes over the top only for Stanley Nwabili to push the ball away from him. The hosts regain possession and pull it back to Seko Fofana who curls a shot wide of the far post.

All the pressure is now on Ivory Coast who will drop to third place should they lose.
