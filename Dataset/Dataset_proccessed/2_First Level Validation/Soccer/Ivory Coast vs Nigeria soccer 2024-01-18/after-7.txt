HIGHLIGHTS
AUTO REFRESH IN 29…
END OF 2ND HALF
FT
FULL-TIME
Not an AFCON classic but a huge win for Nigeria. Their campaign has lift-off and they are up to second in Group A above Ivory Coast.
It makes for a fascinating Monday. Advantage Super Eagles in this group? You’d think so now.
90+6'
KILLING TIME?
Onuachu goes down clutching his shoulder and you can’t help but feel it’s just to waste a few more precious seconds.
Less than three minutes to go…
90+4'
NIGERIA DOING ENOUGH
The ball is in the Ivory Coast half and that suits Nigeria of course. They’re winding down the clock well.
90'
ADDED TIME
It’s… NINE MINUTES ADDED ON.
That explains the roar from the home crowd.
89'
LATE SUB
Off goes Osimhen, the African Footballer of the Year. No goals today and he’ll be disappointed.
On comes Onuachu in his place.
87'
CAPTAIN
And match-winner?
84'
ALMOST!
Osayi carries the ball for an age as Nigeria go on the counter – they’ve been happy to sit back and welcome the pressure from the hosts – but it’s a few touches too many from Osayi as a huge tackle from Diomande dispossesses him.
And now on comes Konate fir Krasso.
80'
MORE SUBS
Omeruo and Osayi on with Lookman and Zaidu off. Big shifts from the two outgoing players.
The Ivorian change sees Diakite come on to a huge roar and replace Konan.
78'
DROGBA LOOKS ON
Ivory Coast won’t be going down without a fight. Pepe has injected some pace into their attacks and it’s now about game management for Nigeria.
Nervy 15 minutes or so coming up as the camera cuts to Drogba, who doesn’t look best pleased.
75'
WIDE!
Strong goalkeeping as Nwabali rushes out and manages to parry the ball away under pressure from Pepe.
The ball makes its way back to Fofana, but he can’t quite curl his effort on target. Just wide.
73'
SUB
First change for Nigeria as Simon comes on. Fresh legs that should help them see out this match!
71'
COOLING BREAK
Still 31C out there - it means the final quarter of this match will get back under way shortly and a few drinks.
70'
WHAT IT MEANS
20 minutes to go, but that could well be the winner...

68'
TRIPLE SUB!
On come Bamba, Pepe and Singo for Ivory Coast.
Aurier was hobbling and goes off, as do Kouame and Boga. Two attacking changes.
66'
WIDE!
Konan meets a deep cross but cannot direct his header on goal.
63'
OVER!
Tell you what, another big chance for Osimhen. Maybe I’m being harsh as it’s a difficult angle, but he cannot direct his header on goal and Ivory Coast survive.
61'
CHANGES?
Got to wonder now if Ivory Coast will turn to their bench as they chase this match. Suddenly that final game of the group against Equatorial Guinea is looking like a biggun.
58'
CAPTAIN FANTASTIC
55'
GOAL! IVORY COAST 0-1 NIGERIA (TROOST-EKONG)
It’s a big moment for Troost-Ekong as the crowd make their feelings about the decision clear…
Bosh… Right down the middle. No stopping that… Well. Unless you stay down the middle. But Fofana didn’t…
A fifth Nigeria goal for Troost-Ekong.
PENALTY
W. TROOST-EKONG
NIGERIA
54'
PENALTY!
Indeed. You just got the sense the minute he checked the monitor.
Mustapha Ghorbal runs back on and points to the spot. Osimhen went down like he'd been shot but that and the slight touch from Diomande is enough to convince the referee.
