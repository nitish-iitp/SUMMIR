Preview: Scotland vs. Poland - prediction, team news, lineups

Having both picked up just one point at Euro 2024, Scotland and Poland will be targeting victory on Thursday, when they meet on the opening matchday of a new UEFA Nations League campaign.

The two nations meet at Hampden Park, ahead of tough tests against their other League A Group 1 rivals, Croatia and Portugal.

After suffering a five-goal defeat to the tournament hosts, before drawing with Switzerland and then losing to Hungary, Scotland's latest attempt to reach the knockout phase of a major tournament ultimately ended in failure.

While Steve Clarke's squad came up short in Germany, they have recently qualified for back-to-back Euros and earned promotion to the Nations League's elite level.

Beating Ukraine and the Republic of Ireland to top spot in their group last time around means that the Scots will face tougher competition during the 2024-25 edition: they follow Poland's visit with a trip to Portugal on Sunday.

Finishing inside the top two would send them through to the quarter-finals of UEFA's newly expanded tournament; third place would result in a relegation playoff, while bottom spot confirms demotion back to League B.

Qualifying for the 2026 World Cup - which would be their first global finals since 1998 - is Scotland's medium-term priority, but first they will try to hold their own in League A.

Like Thursday's hosts, Poland finished fourth in their European Championship group this summer, losing their opening two matches - against the Netherlands and then Austria - before frustrating France in Dortmund.

All-time top scorer and record appearance holder Robert Lewandowski scored from the spot to salvage a 1-1 draw against Les Bleus, but he was hampered by a thigh problem throughout the tournament, in which his nation barely made an impact.

Michal Probierz took charge in September 2023 and had won six of his 10 matches before losing for the first time at the Euros, and though Poland's exit continued a trend of disappointing performances at major finals, he has been retained as manager for now.

Between coming through the playoffs to reach both Qatar 2022 and Euro 2024, the Eagles survived relegation in their most recent Nations League campaign, finishing a distant third behind Belgium and the Netherlands last time around.

Now, Probierz is expected to keep his nation afloat at Europe's elite level once again, before plotting a course for the World Cup.

After scoring his first goal for new club Torino last month, Scotland striker Che Adams has had to withdraw from Steve Clarke's squad for the Nations League games against Poland and Portugal due to injury.

Celtic duo James Forrest and Greg Taylor, and Kilmarnock goalkeeper Robby McCrorie, have also pulled out, but Rangers midfielder Connor Barron has been given a first call-up, while Josh Doig and uncapped Dundee goalkeeper Jon McCracken have been brought in as cover.

Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder Ryan Gauld makes his international comeback after several years out in the cold, and he will hope to finally earn a first senior cap; Sturm Graz right-back Max Johnston has been selected for the first time.

In the absence of Adams, either Lawrence Shankland or Lyndon Dykes may start up front, but there is no doubt surrounding the identity of Poland's centre-forward.

Captain Robert Lewandowski leads a squad missing long-serving pair Kamil Grosicki and Wojciech Szczesny - both of whom have retired from international duty and the latter from football entirely - plus injured Juventus striker Arkadiusz Milik.

Bologna's Lukasz Skorupski is likely to take the gloves, while Piotr Zielinski should feature in midfield despite being sidelined at new club Inter Milan.


Scotland possible starting lineup:
Gunn; Ralston, Hanley, McKenna, Robertson; McClean, Gilmour; McGinn, McTominay, Christie; Dykes

Poland possible starting lineup:
Skorupski; Bednarek, Dawidowicz, Kiwior; Frankowski, Zielinski, Szymanski, Moder, Zalewski; Piatek, Lewandowski



We say: Scotland 0-1 Poland

With key players injured or short of fitness - notably Napoli pair Billy Gilmour and Scott McTominay - Scotland could have a tough time reversing their recent slump.

Although Poland are similarly short in certain areas, they do possess a lethal finisher and can match their hosts' work rate, so the Eagles may leave Glasgow with maximum points.
