Scotland‘s first encounter with top-tier Nations League football ended in despair as Nicola Zalewski’s penalty in added time handed Poland an undeserved 3-2 win at Hampden Park.

Sebastian Szymanski’s long-distance strike gave Michal Probierz’s visitors the lead after only eight minutes of the League A Group I opener.

Scott McTominay thought he had levelled in the 23rd minute but referee Glenn Nyberg chalked it off for handball and there was more dismay for the Tartan Army when Poland’s superstar striker Robert Lewandowski netted a penalty to make it 2-0 before the break for his 84th international goal.

However, in a second-half turnaround, Billy Gilmour reduced the deficit after a minute and McTominay grabbed a well-deserved equaliser in the 77th minute.

The home side finished the match strongly but in the sixth minute of eight added on, Grant Hanley fouled Zalewski inside the box and the Pole got up to fire in the winner.

Steve Clarke’s battling side now have to face Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal in Lisbon on Sunday and despite an encouraging performance, will go into the game looking to improve their current record of one win in 13 games.

Scotland‘s first match after such a dismal Euro 2024 where they exited with one point from three group-stage games was always going to be heavily scrutinised.

Due to long-term injuries and late withdrawals, Clarke’s squad had a different look to it and there was talk of a freshness to the team.

However, there was a familiarity about the line-up with striker Lyndon Dykes and midfielders Kenny McLean and Ryan Christie in for retired Celtic captain Callum McGregor and injured duo Jack Hendry and Che Adams, with all the potential debutants among the substitutes.

Lewandowski, who had scored twice in his last appearance at Hampden in 2015, led the line for the visitors and was involved in the opening goal.

Gilmour was robbed in the middle of the park and when the Barcelona star striker helped the ball on to Szymanski, the Fenerbahce player fired a shot from 30 yards low past keeper Angus Gunn and in off the post.

It was an early boost for the visitors who were supported by a large and noisy support who seemed to have infiltrated every part of the ground.

McTominay scooped a pass from Christie high over the bar in the 20th minute and three minutes later he bundled the ball in from close range after getting on the end of an inswinging John McGinn free-kick, but it was ruled out amid a VAR check and some confusion.

Scotland began to pose more of a threat, though.

Christie drove wide from the edge of the box and in the 37th minute McTominay took advantage of slack play by Jakub Kiwior and burst into the Poland box, but his cut-back evaded everyone in a dark blue shirt before Dykes slashed at a shot just six yards out to hit the side-netting.

However, the Scots were dealt another blow just before the interval when Anthony Ralston brought down Zalewski as the Pole drove into the box and Lewandowski sent Gunn the wrong way with an assured penalty.

The Scots were given early second-half hope when Poland failed to clear their lines and Gilmour stepped in to drive low past keeper Marcin Bulka with only his second-ever goal to get the Tartan Army singing again

The home side had more defending to do though as the Poles looked to restore their two-goal lead and Syzmasnki curled the ball just wide from the edge of the box.

There was little between the sides as the match entered the final 20 minutes.

In the 71st minute 28-year-old Ryan Gauld and 18-year-old Ben Doak came on to make their Scotland debuts along with fellow attacker Lawrence Shankland, with Dykes, McLean and Christie departing.

Doak made a quick impact on the right when he set up the over-lapping Ralston whose cut-back was confidently slid into the net by McTominay to make it 2-2.

That set up a frenetic finale where Hanley clumsily brought down Zalewski inside the box and the Pole got up and struck his penalty past the diving Gunn for a last-gasp winner.
