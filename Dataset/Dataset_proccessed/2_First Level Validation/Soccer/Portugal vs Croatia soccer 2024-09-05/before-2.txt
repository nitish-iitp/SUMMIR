Portugal Predicted Lineup vs Croatia Preview

The Nations League is a biennial international football competition that brings together the men’s national teams of all UEFA member associations. Cristiano Ronaldo has retained his spot in the Portugal squad for the upcoming UEFA Nations League matches against Croatia and Scotland, despite a lacklustre performance during Euro 2024.

The 39-year-old could not find the back of the net during his sixth appearance at the European Championship, as Portugal was eliminated in the quarterfinals. However, coach Roberto Martinez continues to support him.

“When I decide to step away from the national team, I won’t give anyone a heads-up… Currently, my main focus is to offer my assistance to the Selecao,” Ronaldo expressed in a recent interview with Portuguese TV.

Ronaldo has kicked off the new season in impressive form, finding the back of the net four times in as many games for Saudi side Al Nassr. Ronaldo is expected to spearhead the Portugal attack, with Paris Saint-Germain striker Goncalo Ramos out of action due to an ankle injury.

With the recent retirement of veteran defender Pepe at the age of 41, there is a sense of transition in the air. Looking ahead, Martinez has made an exciting move by calling up 17-year-old Sporting Lisbon winger Geovany Quenda for Friday’s match.

Chelsea’s latest addition, Renato Veiga, and Lille’s defender, Tiago Santos, are among the fresh faces joining the squad for the upcoming matches against Croatia and Scotland on September 5 and 8 in Lisbon.
