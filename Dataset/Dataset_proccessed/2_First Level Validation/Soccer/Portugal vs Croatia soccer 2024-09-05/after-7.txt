Portugal 2-1 Croatia: Cristiano Ronaldo scores 900th career goal
Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 900th goal of his career as Portugal got off to a winning start in the Nations League.

Portugal got off to a winning start in the UEFA Nations League as Cristiano Ronaldo's 900th career goal helped his side secure a 2-1 victory over Croatia at Estadio da Luz. 

A fixture full of high-profile names did not disappoint. 

Diogo Dalot opened the scoring in the sixth minute to give the hosts the lead, before a historic Cristiano Ronaldo goal doubled the score for Portugal. 

Dalot netted again shortly after but this time in his own net which allowed Croatia a way back into the game. 

Portugal start their Nations League campaign perfectly as they look to win their second title after winning the inaugural edition in 2019. 

Story of the Match

Before the first half got underway the recently retired Pepe was honoured on his behalf of serving his nation for so long.

The centre-back made 141 appearances for Portugal and a ceremony was held prior to kick-off to celebrate his efforts and achievements for his nation. 

It did not take long for Portugal to take the lead, the sixth minute in fact. 

The Manchester United duo of Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot collaborated for the opener. Fernandes threaded a ball through to Dalot who was a late arrival into the box. 

His first touch allowed him to go past Borna Sosa and finish clinically into the bottom left corner with his left foot.

Cristiano Ronaldo could have had his 900th career goal before he went on to do so as he saw his driven effort with his left kept out by the hopeful foot of Dominik Livakovic. 

Portugal fans showed their appreciation towards the splendid build-up play by Ronaldo and Rafael Leao on the left side of the box before the attempt was denied. 

Croatia were not short of possession after the half-hour mark, having 45 per cent of the ball. However they were struggling to break down the firm defensive structure of Roberto Martinez's side. 

Their best chance up until that point being Andrej Kramaric's half-volleyed effort which forced Diogo Costa into a smart save to his left. 

900 for Cristiano 

A relieved and emotional Ronaldo ran to the corner flag and collapsed to his knees after he netted his 900th career goal. 

PSG left-back, Nuno Mendes, delivered a precise and whipped ball into the box and the man of the moment was there to convert the ball past Livakovic with a side-footed volley.

It will go down in the history books. A role model of the game we love. 

A young boy from Madeira who shared this love and still does as a veteran provided Lisbon and the rest of his compatriots a memory to cherish. 

Shortly after Portugal doubled their lead, the goal difference was swiftly back to one. 

Former Leicester City striker, Andrej Kramaric, zipped a dangerous ball into the box and a sliding Sosa was at the back post to keep the attack alive. 

The ball then glanced off of the unfortunate Dalot which resulted in the ball ending up in the roof of Costa's net. 

Dalot now had one at each end. 

Pedro Neto showed off his raw pace when he ran the length of the half with the ball. The flourishing run ended with a powerful shot from the Chelsea winger, however he saw his effort blaze against the crossbar. 

He must have done something of good quality as the run and effort got an applause from Cristiano Ronaldo. 

Portugal's hero Ronaldo was passionately cheered off of the pitch in the 87th minute, the fans showing their gratitude towards a figure who has produced some of Portugal's finest footballing moments. 

A national hero. A sporting hero. A role model for all aspiring footballers out there. 

The referee blew the whistle to signify the end of the 90 minutes. 

On a night of history and celebration, Portugal had made the perfect start to their Nations League campaign. 

Player of the match - Cristiano Ronaldo

Cristiano Ronaldo - does any reason have to be typed. The man has 900 career goals and on another night he could have had three tonight. A special moment topped off by a nostalgic performance.

Before the article is finished, a special mention has to go out to Mateo Kovacic who was absolutely outstanding tonight. If Ronaldo did not hit his milestone tonight then he would have been fighting for the prestigious player of the match award.
