Cristiano Ronaldo becomes the 1st man to reach the 900-goal milestone in Portugal’s victory: ‘It was emotional’

UPDATED: September 5, 2024 at 5:40 PM CST

LISBON, Portugal — Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 900th goal in Portugal’s Nations League victory against Croatia on Thursday, becoming the first man to reach the milestone in official matches for club and country.

The star forward found the net in the 34th minute at the Stadium of Light, securing the historic goal with a volley from 6 yards off a cross from Nuno Mendes to put Portugal 2-0 up in the 34th minute. Portugal went on to win 2-1.

“It means a lot,” Ronaldo, 39, said. “It was a milestone I wanted to reach for a long time. I knew I would reach this number, because as I continue to play, it would happen naturally.”

In the celebration, Ronaldo raised his hands to his face and dropped to his knees.

“It was emotional because it’s a milestone,” he said. “It seems like any other milestone, but only I know, and the people around me, how hard it is to work every day, to be physically and psychologically fit, to score 900 goals. It’s a unique milestone in my career.”

The five-time Ballon d’Or winner is 58 goals ahead of his nearest challenger, Lionel Messi, who is on 842. Brazilian legend Pelé is third on the list with 765.

It was the 131st goal of his international career. Ronaldo plays club soccer for Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League.
