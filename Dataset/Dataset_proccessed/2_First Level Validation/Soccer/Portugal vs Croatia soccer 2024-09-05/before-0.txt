"It won't be a difficult decision" - Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo issues retirement update

Portugal icon Cristiano Ronaldo has insisted that he has no immediate plans to retire from international football, but has admitted that it "won't be a difficult decision to make" when the time comes.

Still strutting his stuff at the age of 39, Ronaldo holds the world record for international goals having scored 130 for Portugal since making his senior debut back in 2003.

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner is also the all-time leading appearance maker in men's international football having played 212 games for his country.

Now plying his trade at club level with Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr, Ronaldo competed at a record sixth European Championship this summer, but he was unable to score in any of Portugal's five matches as they eventually lost to France on penalties in the quarter-finals.

After the tournament, Ronaldo released a statement hinting that he intends to be a part of Portugal's squad going forward in preparation for 2026 World Cup qualifying.

Ronaldo has since been selected in Roberto Martinez's 25-man squad for Portugal's upcoming UEFA Nations League double-header against Croatia and Scotland.

Ronaldo admits he will "move on" from Portugal "when the time comes"

While 41-year-old defender Pepe has decided to hand up his boots, with Ronaldo saying the defender "left through the front door", Portugal's No.7 is keen to continue representing his country for the time being.

Speaking at a press conference ahead of Portugal's clash with Croatia on Thursday, Ronaldo said: "When the time comes, I'll move on. It won't be a difficult decision to make.

"If I feel like I'm no longer contributing anything, I'll be the first to leave."

Last month, Ronaldo suggested that he is unsure when he will retire, but he will "probably" retire at his current club Al-Nassr.

"I don't know if I will retire soon, in two or three years, but probably I will retire here at Al-Nassr," said Ronaldo.

"When I leave the national team, I won't tell anyone in advance and it will be a very spontaneous decision on my part, but also a very well thought-out one."

Ronaldo is expected to start as captain for Portugal in Thursday's Nations League fixture at home against Croatia at the Estadio da Luz, and he is also set to feature against Scotland at the same stadium three days later.
