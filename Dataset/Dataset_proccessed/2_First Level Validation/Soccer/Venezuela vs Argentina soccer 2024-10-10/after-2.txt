Lionel Scaloni will likely be satisfied with a point as his side struggled through 90 minutes on a terrible playing surface in Maturin

Argentina will have few complaints after leaving Venezuela with a point in World Cup qualifying. The Albiceleste spent most of Thursday evening's affair engaged in a rather sloppy battle in difficult conditions, as Salomon Rondon claimed a 1-1 draw for the unfancied hosts.

A rain delay saw the fixture pushed back by 30 minutes, and a waterlogged pitch seemed to suit the home side. Still, Argentina took the lead - albeit against the run of play - when centre-back Nicolas Otamendi turned home from close range 13 minutes in.

Venezuela came close shortly before half-time when veteran striker Rondon's crafty volley was pushed away by reserve Albiceleste goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli. Rondon's moment arrived though, as he rose above two defenders and headed past a sprawling Rulli in the 65th minute.

Lionel Messi seemed poised to restore Argentina's lead, but saw his effort denied by Rafael Romo after darting into the box late in the match. Manager Lionel Scaloni switched to a back five soon after, and will likely go home happy with a draw that keeps his side very much in control of their own destiny in 2026 CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying.

GOAL rates Argentina's players from Estadio Monumental de Maturin...

Goalkeeper & Defence

Geronimo Rulli (6/10):

In for the suspended Emi Martinez. Made a couple of neat saves when called upon, but could do nothing about Rondon's goal.

Nahuel Molina (5/10):

Won some important duels, and held down the right side of the pitch. Skinned for the Venezuela equaliser, though.

Nicolas Otamendi (5/10):

Grabbed the opening goal with a sneaky finish. Otherwise had a bit of a nightmare at the back.

German Pezzella (5/10):

Engaged in an intriguing battle with Rondon for the most part - one he was often bested in.

Nicolas Tagliafico (5/10):

Venezuela didn't attack much down his flank. Struggled, like everyone, to connect passes effectively.

Midfield

Enzo Fernandez (5/10):

His metronomic passing was nowhere to be found on such a waterlogged pitch. Won just one tackle throughout.

Rodrigo De Paul (7/10):

A proper scrappy performance, as per usual. Played a few nice passes in the final third.

Giovani Lo Celso (5/10):

Barely involved before being removed in the second half.

Thiago Almada (4/10):

Barely had a kick in a rare international appearance. Sacrificed at half-time, rather unfortunately.

Attack

Lionel Messi (7/10):

Not really a game for him, given the state of the pitch - but he still managed to make an impact. Provided a crucial delivery that led to his side's opening goal.

Julian Alvarez (6/10):

Can't be faulted for his running and pressure. Made a few nice runs and tricky turns, but Argentina probably needed a central presence.

Subs & Manager

Gonzalo Montiel (6/10):

Won a few tackles, ran around a lot.

Leonardo Balerdi (7/10):

Offered a bit more physicality at the back, which Argentina needed to see out the game.

Lautaro Martinez (N/A):

Barely touched the ball.

Leandro Paredes (N/A):

No time to make an impact.

Lionel Scaloni (6/10):

His side got a goal, but then he made the perhaps prudent decision to settle for a draw after being pegged back. Can't win them all, and he can leave Venezuela with an acceptable point.
