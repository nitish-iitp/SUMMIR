Preview: Venezuela vs. Argentina - prediction, team news, lineups

A full house is expected at the Estadio Monumental in Maturin on Thursday, when Venezuela host world champions Argentina in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying.

The hosts have their most promising opportunity yet to reach a maiden World Cup, while Argentina are already on the brink of sealing their spot at the finals as we approach the halfway stage.

World Champions and back-to-back Copa America winners Argentina enter October's international window knowing that two wins this week will all but confirm their place at the 2026 finals.

Lionel Scaloni's side sit top of the section after eight games, having picked up 18 points so far, and reaching the mid-20s will almost certainly see them progress, based on what has been required in past qualifying sections.

Nothing will be assured so early in the campaign, but with the midway point being hit after this encounter, Argentina already look a shoo-in to be present at the next World Cup.

That is despite the Albiceleste losing their most recent fixture to Colombia, which saw them suffer a second defeat in four qualifiers, as Uruguay also got the better of Scaloni's side last November.

As South America's strongest outfit though, and a nine-point buffer inside the automatic qualifying positions, nobody will bet against the holders from making it through, especially when you consider they have conceded just seven goals in their last 19 qualifiers.

With Venezuela up next, and Bolivia to follow, usually they would be seen as the two weakest nations in CONMEBOL, but not this time around, as both have made promising starts and are definitely in contention to qualify.

Argentina are often overpowering when facing Venezuela, though, having gone unbeaten in the last seven competitive meetings, and they have only lost twice in 28 head-to-heads.

For the hosts, games do not come much tougher on the international stage than this, but should they pull off a miraculous performance and take something from it, that will only strengthen their chances of reaching a first World Cup.

After eight matches, Fernando Batista's side are level with Brazil, having taken 10 points so far, and they currently occupy the final automatic qualifying spot.

The Argentinian manager knows his side will likely need at least a point against his native country to remain in those places after this set of games though, with Paraguay and Bolivia breathing down their necks.

There were mixed emotions following September's fixtures, as Venezuela suffered a humbling 4-0 defeat in the extreme altitude away to Bolivia, but they then held an impressive Uruguay to a 0-0 draw a few days later.

Improving their attacking output will be crucial if they are to maintain a challenge, though, as La Vinotinto have scored just once in their last four qualifiers.

Team News

The big news for Argentina is that Lionel Messi is back and should feature for the first time since their Copa America final success.

Despite that positive news, Scaloni will be without his goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez for both matches this month, as he was handed a two-game suspension for his antics after losing to Colombia last month.

Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Exequiel Palacios is back in the squad after some injury problems, but Serie A duo Paulo Dybala and Nicolas Gonzalez, and Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho were all late withdrawals after picking up issues this weekend.

Venezuela have a couple of notable injury concerns, including one to Sparta Rotterdam defender Teo Quintero, who has been denied the chance to make his international debut this month.

Fellow defender Jhon Chancellor remains out injured, so the back four could look the same from the one that held Uruguay last time out.

Salomon Rondon's resurgence after a tricky time at Everton has been key to their success in this section so far, as the veteran striker has scored two of their six goals in qualifying, and has 20 in 33 games for club side Pachuca since arriving earlier this year.

Venezuela possible starting lineup:
Romo; Aramburu, Osorio, Ferraresi, Navarro; Bello, Casseres, J. Martinez, Segovia, Soteldo; Rondon

Argentina possible starting lineup:
Rulli; Molina, Otamendi, Romero, Tagliafico; De Paul, Fernandez, Mac Allister, Alvarez; La. Martinez, Messi



We say: Venezuela 0-2 Argentina

Going away anywhere in South America is rarely straightforward, but Argentina have won three of their four games on the road in qualifying so far, and are clear favourites to claim another.

Venezuela have proven a tough nut to crack on home soil, as they are still unbeaten in four qualifiers, but they are yet to face a side with the quality of Argentina, and their attacking deficiencies could cost them here.
