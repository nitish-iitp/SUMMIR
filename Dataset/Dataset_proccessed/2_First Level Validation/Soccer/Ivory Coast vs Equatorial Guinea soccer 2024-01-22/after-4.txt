Ivory Coast's match against Equatorial Guinea

Rabat - Equatorial Guinea delivered a resounding 4-0 defeat to Ivory Coast, marking the heaviest home defeat in the host’s history in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). With the win Equatorial Guinea qualified for the Round of 16. 

The stunning victory was spearheaded by the 34-year-old Emilio Nsue, who Alicante, emerged as the top scorer of the tournament and captained his national team into the second round.

The match unfolded with Equatorial Guinea dominating from the start, leaving Ivory Coast grappling to catch up. 

The turning point came in the 42nd minute when Nsue found the net with a brilliant finish, set up by a fine run from right-back Carlos Akapo. This marked Nsue’s fifth goal of the tournament.

Equatorial Guinea continued their relentless attack, and in the 73rd minute, midfielder Pablo Ganet sealed the poor fate of Ivory Coast with a spectacular free-kick from miles out. 

The Ivory Coast goalkeeper, Yahia Fofana, had no answer to Ganet’s “Beckham-esque” strike, plunging the hosts into deep trouble.

The final blow came in the 86th minute when Buyla capitalized on Ivory Coast’s defensive vulnerabilities, running the ball and scuffing his shot into the net. The 4-0 scoreline left Ivory Coast humiliated and the home crowd in disbelief.

With Equatorial Guinea’s sensational performance, they have become the “dark horse” of the Africa Cup of Nations, and Nsue’s leadership and goal-scoring prowess have undoubtedly been instrumental in their success.
