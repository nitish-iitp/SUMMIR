Argentina vs Ecuador Predicted Lineups Preview

Argentina and Ecuador will go head-to-head on Sunday evening in what will be their first warm-up match before the Copa America 2024. The Argentine national team will kick off its Copa America title defence this summer with a friendly match against Ecuador.

Lionel Messi and his teammates are aiming to win another Copa America title, following their victory in the World Cup held in Qatar in 2022. Argentina is widely regarded as the top contender for the tournament, with Brazil also considered a strong contender.

They enter Copa America as the current number one team according to FIFA rankings. In contrast, Ecuador is ranked 31st. It’s been a while since Argentina and Ecuador faced off on the football pitch. The last time they played was in September 2023, with Argentina coming out on top with a 1-0 victory in a World Cup qualification match.

It seems that Lionel Scaloni is keen on ensuring that most of his players get valuable playing time this Sunday. Anticipate a formidable lineup from La Albiceleste, with the starting forward being a point of intrigue.

Scaloni has the luxury of having both Julian Alvarez and Lautaro Martinez available for selection this summer. Both strikers will have their chances this summer, but Alvarez has a big opportunity to establish himself as a key player alongside Messi and Angel Di Maria.

Ecuador possesses a wealth of talent that could potentially pose a challenge for Argentina. Enner Valencia, Moises Caicedo, and Piero Hincapie form a formidable core that provides a solid foundation for the team to rely on during the match.

Valencia, Ecuador’s all-time leading goal scorer, will be the key player to make a significant impact. Argentina is poised to deliver a captivating performance that demonstrates their preparedness to defend their Copa America title. Pay attention to the player who begins the match in the forward position, as Scaloni determines the most suitable choice for the attacking role.
