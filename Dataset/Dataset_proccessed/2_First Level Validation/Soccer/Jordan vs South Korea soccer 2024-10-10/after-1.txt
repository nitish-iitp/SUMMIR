[Amman(Jordan) = Reporter Yoon Jin-man of Sports Chosun] Hong Myung-bo defeated Jordan in the enemy territory to take revenge for the first time in eight months, regain the lead in the preliminary group, and caught two rabbits.

The national soccer team, led by head coach Hong Myung-bo, won 2-0 with Lee Jae-sung (Mainz)'s first goal in the 38th minute of the first half and Oh Hyun-kyu's additional goal in the 23rd minute of the second half in the third Asian qualifying round for the 2026 North-China World Cup against Jordan at Amman International Stadium in Amman, Jordan, at 11 p.m. on the 10th (Korea time).

As a result, Hong Myung-bo tied the matches of Palestine (0-0 draw) and Oman (3-1 win) last month, winning two wins, one draw and seven points in three games, lowering Jordan (4 points) and taking the lead in Group B alone. If he wins the fourth match of the third qualifying round against Iraq at Yongin Mir Stadium on the 15th, he can gain an advantage in advancing to the World Cup finals.




It was a victory that doubled the joy of Jordan, where the opponent caused pain. South Korea failed to win the Qatar Asian Cup semifinal in February, losing to Jordan 0-2. It was the beginning of the nightmare of Korean soccer. The aftermath of the defeat against Jordan (Ping Pongate) and the issue of attendance led to the early replacement of coach Jurgen Klinsmann, and the Korea Football Association wasted five months before appointing the next official coach. The team showed its potential to make a crisis an opportunity without being shaken even when Korean soccer emerged as a political issue.

Hong replaced captain Son Heung-min (Tottenham), who injured his hamstring, and put Hwang Hee-chan in the left-side striker position on the day. With Joo Min-kyu (Ulsan) as the top, Hwang Hee-chan and Lee Kang-in (Paris Saint-Germain) and Lee Jae-sung (Mainz) set up the second term. Hwang In-beom (Feyenoord) and Park Yong-woo (Al Ain) defended the midfield, while Seol Young-woo (Trvenazvezda), Cho Yoo-min (Sharja), Kim Min-jae (Bayern Munich) and Lee Myung-jae (Ulsan) built the four-back. Cho Hyun-woo (Ulsan) defended the goal. Three positions have changed compared to the match against Oman last month.




Jordan was left out of the entry due to injury, as reported by local media. The Jordanian home crowd cheered enthusiastically for Altamari, who briefly appeared on the ground before the game. Major striker Yazan Al-Naimat (Al-Araibi) started off the bench.

South Korea couldn't find a clue to the attack, whether it was depressed by Jordanian fans' unilateral support in the early first half. In the 5th minute, Joo Min-kyu connected the pass that Hwang Hee-chan stabbed into the box with a shot, but it went off the post. Lee Myung-jae, who was handed the ball given by Hwang Hee-chan in the 19th minute, attempted a bold mid-range shot, but it was also missed and turned away from the post. Hwang Hee-chan was the most active player in the Korean offense in the early and mid-first half.




Did you say that players always get hurt when their bodies are light. The premonition of sadness was not wrong. Hwang Hee-chan was hurt in the 10th minute of the first half when he sprained his ankle on the opponent's 'Beamana' back tackle while trying to dribble boldly in the opponent's side. Hwang Hee-chan, who returned from a simple treatment, continued the game while complaining of discomfort in his ankle. Bae Joon-ho (Stoke City) and Um Ji-sung (Swansea City), who were warming up, returned to the bench.

Then, in the 22nd minute, he hurt his ankle again under the opponent's harsh pressure while trying to dribble from the opponent's side. Immediately after the injury, Hwang Hee-chan raised his hand toward the bench complaining of excruciating pain. The gesture was that he could no longer play and needed an immediate replacement. In the end, Hwang Hee-chan returned to the bench with the help of the medical staff, and Um Ji-sung was hastily put in. For Coach Hong, Son Heung-min and Hwang Hee-chan have lost two key attack cards. The plan is twisted.

In the 38th minute of the first half, when an unstable trend almost occurred, South Korea scored a golden first goal. On the right side, Lee Jae-sung rushed to the ball that Seol Young-woo delivered high in front of the goal and cut the net with a 'Awl header'. In his team Mainz, Lee Jae-sung, who also scored more goals with his head than with his feet, broke the 0 flow at valuable timing. It is the first time in five games that Lee Jae-sung scored in the A-match since the match against Thailand in March. Lee Jae-sung, who was excluded from the match against Oman last month, turned his mind around and scored his first goal under Hong Myung-bo. The first half ended with South Korea leading by one goal.

Oh Hyun-kyu's debut goal that silenced Jordanian spectators

Six minutes into the second half, South Korea faced a second variable. Um Ji-sung, who replaced Hwang Hee-chan, complained of injury. Coach Hong put in Bae Joon-ho. And in the first half, Oh Hyun-kyu was put in except for Joo Min-gyu, who did not contribute much to the offense. Three attackers were replaced early in the second half. Oh Hyun-kyu warmed up his toes with bold shots in the 11th and 14th minutes of the second half. Hwang In-beom's shot from the front of the arc in the 17th minute of the second half went off the post.

In the 23rd minute of the second half, Oh Hyun-kyu's effort paid off. Oh Hyun-kyu, who received Bae Joon-ho's pass, scored an additional goal with a sharp right-footed shot that stabbed the bottom left of the goal at the left diagonal point in the opponent's penalty box. Oh Hyun-kyu ran in front of the South Korean away supporter's seat and had a goal after goal with his fans. Oh Hyun-kyu, who re-elected to the national team for the first time in eight months, scored his long-awaited debut goal in the 12th A match.

Jordan showed a big difference in power from when it drew 2-2 with South Korea in the group stage of the Asian Cup and beat South Korea 2-0 in the semifinals. It seems to be due to the aftermath of Altamari and Al-Naimat injuries that will make a difference in the offense. On this day, his concentration seemed to be collapsing after he allowed additional runs. Ahmad Ersan and Mohammad Abualnadi, who substituted in the 31st minute of the second half, were also not enough to make a difference in the game. Coach Hong put in Baek Seung-ho and Hong Hyun-seok without Lee Kang-in's Hwang In-beom at the end of the game. The game ended in a cool revenge play by Korea.
