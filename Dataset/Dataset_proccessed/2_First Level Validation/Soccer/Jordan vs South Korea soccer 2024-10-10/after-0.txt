[Amman(Jordan) = Reporter Yoon Jin-man of Sports Chosun] Hong Myung-bo, the national soccer team coach who beat Jordan and turned the crisis into an opportunity, gave the players credit for the victory.

After winning the third Group B match against Jordan 2-0 in the third Asian qualifying round for the 2026 North-China World Cup at Amman International Stadium in Jordan on the 10th (Korea time), Hong congratulates the players who won the difficult away match in Jordan. The players performed better than they prepared. It was a short preparation time, but I think I showed it perfectly. I am also grateful to the cheering squad who came all the way to Jordan.

Coach Hong suffered a bad news before the game when captain Son Heung-min fell due to a hamstring injury, and Hwang Hee-chan, who started as a left striker in place of Son Heung-min, was replaced by Um Ji-sung in the 23rd minute of the first half due to an ankle injury.




However, in the 38th minute of the first half, Lee Jae-sung scored the first goal with Seol Young-woo's cross as a header, and Oh Hyun-kyu, who replaced him in the 23rd minute of the second half, scored a wedge mid-range goal.

Coach Hong, who led the technical area with enthusiasm, said "We communicated more during this convocation than during the first convocation. The preparation went well. I think that's why it came out good."




As for Hwang Hee-chan's physical condition as he got on the bus on his way home from work lying face down by the medical staff, "I started well, but I was unfortunately replaced by an injury. I was embarrassed. "I'll go back and check my physical condition accurately."

Coach Hong went to a National Assembly hearing in July over the controversy over the process of appointing the national team coach. Still, the public's view of Hong is not good. Asked if the game could lay the foundation for a reversal, Hong said, `Regardless of that, I'm the coach. I just play the role of a director."




South Korea, which had two wins, one draw and seven points in three World Cup qualifying matches, defeated Jordan (four points) to become the group leader. The team, which traveled directly to Queen Aria Airport in Amman after the match against Jordan, will return to Korea on a chartered plane. Hong Myung-bo aims to win all two games against Iraq in Yongin on the 15th.
