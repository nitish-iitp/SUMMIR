Italy vs Belgium Predicted Lineups Preview

Italy’s head coach Luciano Spalletti has announced a 23-man roster for the upcoming Nations League matches. The roster features AC Milan defender Matteo Gabbia and Monza forward Daniel Maldini. Gabbia and Maldini are two of the four fresh faces, alongside Juventus goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio and AS Roma midfielder Niccolo Pisilli.

Maldini carries on the legacy of his father Paolo, a legendary figure in Italy with 126 caps for the national team, and his grandfather Cesare, who last donned the national colours 61 years ago. Gabbia seizes his chance after a strong beginning to the season with Milan, highlighted by his decisive goal in the derby victory over Inter Milan in late September.

Unfortunately, Federico Chiesa, who is currently dealing with an injury at Liverpool, and Lazio winger Mattia Zaccagni were not included in the squad. Italy will play Belgium on Thursday, then play Israel in a Nations League game on October 14.

In a disappointing turn of events, captain Kevin De Bruyne will be sidelined for Belgium’s upcoming Nations League clashes with Italy and France. Coach Domenico Tedesco confirmed on Friday that De Bruyne has also requested additional time away from the national team as he unveiled his squad.

De Bruyne suffered an injury while representing Manchester City in the Champions League clash against Inter Milan last month, causing him to miss the English champions’ last four matches. Man City boss Pep Guardiola has already stated that De Bruyne is likely to be sidelined until after the upcoming international break due to a muscular injury.

On Thursday, Belgium will take on Italy in Rome, followed by a home match against France in Brussels on October 14. During a press conference on Friday, Tedesco mentioned that De Bruyne had requested to sit out the last two matches in Nations League Group A2 against Italy and Israel in November, as he aims to manage his game load.

After a 2-0 loss to France in Lyon on September 9, the 33-year-old De Bruyne raised concerns about his international future, expressing doubts about the fighting spirit and capabilities of his teammates. However, Tedesco mentioned that De Bruyne is dedicated to pursuing his international career all the way to the 2026 World Cup.

Romelu Lukaku of Belgium, who was absent from last month’s fixtures while completing his transfer from Chelsea to Napoli, has not been called back to the squad despite scoring two goals in Serie A since his return.
