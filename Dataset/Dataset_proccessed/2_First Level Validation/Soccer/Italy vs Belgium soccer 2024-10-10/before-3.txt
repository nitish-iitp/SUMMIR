Italy vs Belgium: match preview

After their dismal last-16 exit from Euro 2024, Italy have started their 2024/25 Nations League campaign with two wins from two, beating Israel and 2021 winners France in their opening Group A2 games in September.

Luciano Spalletti’s men lead the group by three points ahead of Belgium and France, with Israel pointless in fourth. The Belgians began their Nations League bid with a 3-1 win over the Israelis, before going down 2-0 to the French.

After facing Belgium, Italy move on to a clash with Israel in Udine on Monday, while Les Diables Rouges host France in Brussels on the same day.

Italy vs Belgium: major squad news

Belgium’s squad features neither Kevin de Bruyne nor Romelu Lukaku, who both asked to be left out of Domenico Tedesco’s October squad. Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is also absent, having stepped away from the international fold over his differences with Tedesco.

Italy’s squad, meanwhile, includes a first call-up for Monza forward Daniele Maldini, the son of AC Milan and Azzurri legend Paolo.

What time does Italy vs Belgium start?

The Nations League matchday-three clash between Italy and Belgium will be played at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Italy, on Thursday October 10, 2024. Kick-off is scheduled for 2:45 p.m. ET/11:45 a.m. PT.
