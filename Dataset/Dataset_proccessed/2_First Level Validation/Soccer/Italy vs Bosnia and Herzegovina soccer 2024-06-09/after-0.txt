TELL ME MORE

It was Davide Frattesi's lone goal that gave Luciano Spalletti the win over Sergej Barbarez's Bosnia side as they prepare for their title defence of the European Championship. The game was largely dominated by Gli Azzurri as they maintained 63% possession throughout the game despite rotating their starting XI. Spalletti afforded starts to the likes of Raoul Bellanova and Nicolo Fagioli, who will fight for a spot against Bryan Cristante.

THE MVP

Frattesi's spectacular finish on the volley in the first half from Federico Chiesa's ball gave Italy the lead after a frustrating start to the match. It was the Inter Milan star's fifth goal for the national team. Frattesi has now scored the most goals for Spalletti's side since his debut in June 2022.

THE BIG LOSER

Gianluca Scamacca is coming off a good season with Atalanta and is the likeliest option to be the starting number nine at the Euros for Italy. However, it wasn't his best showing against Bosnia as he squandered multiple good chances to give Gil Azzurri a bigger margin.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Italy will now make the trip to Germany with Spalletti already having chosen his 26-man squad for the tournament. They will kick off their tournament with a clash against Albania on June 15 before they take on Spain and Croatia.
