Italy confirm which three players have been cut from Euro 2024 squad

European Championship holders Italy have announced their final 26-man squad for Euro 2024, confirming which three players have been cut.

Manager Luciano Spalletti initially named a 30-man provisional squad three weeks ago for their Coverciano training camp, but two of those players were forced to withdraw due to injury.

Indeed, Inter Milan's Francesco Acerbi has pulled out after sustaining a groin problem, just four days before Giorgio Scalvini picked up an ACL injury while representing Atalanta BC in their final Serie A game of the season.

Juventus' Federico Gatti was called up as a replacement for Acerbi and Spalletti worked with a 29-man squad for the goalless friendly draw with Turkey on Tuesday.

All 24 nations competing at Euro 2024 have until June 7 to submit their final squads of up to 26 players, and Italy have decided to announce theirs a day before the deadline.

Provedel, Ricci, Orsolini cut from Italy squad

It has now been confirmed that Lazio's Ivan Provedel, Torino's Samuele Ricci and Bologna's Riccardo Orsolini are the unfortunate trio who have been cut from Spalletti's final squad.

Few will be surprised to see goalkeeper Provedel being sent home; the uncapped 30-year-old largely struggled with an ankle injury towards the backend of the 2023-24 campaign.

The same can be said about 22-year-old Ricci, who only has two international caps to his name, and although he did impress for Torino last season, Spalletti has opted to select more experienced midfielders in his squad.

As for winger Orsolini, he scored 10 goals in 33 Serie A games to help Bologna qualify for next season's Champions League, and his club form was rewarded with a start in Tuesday's friendly clash against Turkey.

However, the 27-year-old failed to make the desired impact in his seventh international appearance and has subsequently been left out of Spalletti's final squad.

Italy are now gearing up for their final warm-up match against Bosnia-Herzegovina at the Stadio Carlo Castellani on Sunday, before travelling to Euro 2024 host nation Germany the following day.

The Azzurri, who won Euro 2020, will begin their Group B campaign against Albania at Borussia Dortmund's Westfalenstadion on June 15, before facing Spain on June 20 and then Croatia on June 24.
