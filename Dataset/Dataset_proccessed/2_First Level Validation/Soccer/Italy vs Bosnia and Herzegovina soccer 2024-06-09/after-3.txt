Italy take on Bosnia and Herzegovina this weekend

Italy gear up for Euro 2024 with another friendly encounter this weekend as they lock horns with Bosnia and Herzegovina in an intriguing clash at the Stadio Carlo Castellani on Sunday. Both teams can pack a punch on their day and will be determined to win this game.

Bosnia and Herzegovina topped their group in League B in the UEFA Nations League and have been in good form in the last couple of years. The away side slumped to a 3-0 defeat at the hands of England last week and will aim to bounce back in this match.

Italy, on the other hand, finished in second place in the UEFA Euro qualification standings and have been inconsistent over the past year. The Azzurri were held to a 0-0 stalemate by Turkey in their previous game and will need to take it up a notch this weekend.
