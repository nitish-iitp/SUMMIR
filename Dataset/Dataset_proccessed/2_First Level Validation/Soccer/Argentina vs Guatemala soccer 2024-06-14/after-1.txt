Guatemala vs Argentina

The Inter Miami star bagged a brace, while Inter's main man staked his claim for a starting spot this summer

Lionel Messi was up to his usual tricks, and might just have found a perfect running mate in Lautaro Martinez, the striking duo combining for three of the four Argentina goals in a comfortable 4-1 win over Guatemala. La Albiceleste were sloppy at times, but eventually found their scintillating best to seal an easy victory.

The early exchanges of the game were surprisingly chaotic. Guatemala took a surprise lead after four minutes, Lisandro Martinez turning a set piece into his own goal. But Argentina soon responded when goalkeeper Nicholas Hagen skewed a clearance to Messi's feet, allowing the captain to pass the ball into an empty net.

Martinez gave La Albiceleste the lead after 39 minutes, tucking a penalty into the bottom corner. He nearly added a third with an acrobatic bicycle kick attempt, but his ambitious effort was well denied.

Argentina turned it on after the break. Martinez made it three to top off a wonderfully crafted move - Enzo Fernandez finding Messi, who cut back to the striker for an easy finish into an open net. Messi bagged a fourth to kill the game for good, converting an Angel Di Maria pass with a delightful dink.

GOAL rates Argentina's players from Commanders Field...

Goalkeeper & Defence

Emi Martinez (6/10):

Could have done better on Guatemala's shock opener, almost surrendered a second soon after. Had nothing to do for the rest of the contest.

Nahuel Molina (6/10):

Solid in what was effectively a shielding role. Switched to the right side of a back three at times - and held his own.

Nicolas Otamendi (7/10):

Completed almost all of his passes, did well against the physical Rubio Rubin.

Lisandro Martinez (5/10):

Scored an own goal, picked up a silly yellow, and looked uncomfortable throughout.

Nico Gonzalez (6/10):

Looked slightly uncomfortable in a deeper position; he's usually a pretty advanced winger.

Midfield

Valentin Carboni (8/10):

Put in the hard yards on the right flank. Won the penalty that gave Argentina their second goal. Enough to make the Copa roster?

Enzo Fernandez (7/10):

Received the ball and circulated it quickly. Pinged some nice long passes, too.

Alexis Mac Allister (6/10):

Not his most influential showing with the ball, but he got stuck in without it.

Giovani Lo Celso (7/10):

Failed to hold his width on the left, and didn't receive the ball much as a result. Much more involved when granted license to roam after the break.

Attack

Lionel Messi (9/10):

Took his first goal comfortably - even if it was one of the easiest he will ever have. As eye-catching as ever on the ball, although he was playing with minimal effort. Set up Martinez's second, bagged a terrific third. Wonderful.

Lautaro Martinez (8/10):

Converted from the penalty spot, denied of a spectacular second when his bicycle kick was well saved. Eventually got his brace. Might have played his way into the starting XI next week.

Subs & Manager

Angel Di Maria (8/10):

Almost scored a spectacular bicycle kick. Set up one for Messi. A magnificent cameo.

Rodrigo De Paul (6/10):

Saw a goal ruled out for offside within seconds of coming on.

Leandro Paredes (7/10):

Asserted himself on the game effectively. Dictated tempo, sprayed the ball around.

Julian Alvarez (7/10):

Gave his manager a selection headache with an exciting substitute appearance.

Lucas Quarta (N/A):

No time to make an impact.

Lionel Scaloni (7/10):

Kept Messi in, but made some big calls in defence. He will be disappointed to see his team concede so early, but take heart from the quick recovery. Argentina played at half of their usual quality and grabbed themselves a convincing win.
