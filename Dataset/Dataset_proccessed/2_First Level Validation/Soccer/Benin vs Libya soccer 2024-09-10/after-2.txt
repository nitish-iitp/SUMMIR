Benin have lost their last two games in the fixture

Benin and Libya clash at the Felix Houphouet Boigny Stadium in neutral Ivory Coast on Tuesday in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. Neither side won their first game of the round in Group D.

Ranked 91st in the world, the Cheetahs are looking to reach the AFCON showpiece next year for their fifth appearance in history, and a first since 2019. However, their qualification bid suffered an early blow at the hands of Nigeria.

Ademola Lookman struck twice on either side of a goal from Victor Osimhen as the Super Eagles won 3-0 to claim top spot in the group, while Gernot Rohr's side were relegated to the bottom.

On the other hand, Libya were pegged back by Rwanda in a 1-1 stalemate. Subhi Al-Dawi put them in front only 16 minutes after kick-off, but Innocent Nshuti brought the Wasps level early into the second half.

Unable to find any further goals, the Mediterranean Knights settled for a share of the spoils and sit in third place on the group table. If they are to end a 12-year wait for another AFCON appearance, it is imperative for them to pick up the pace sooner rather than later.

Benin vs Libya Head-To-Head and Key Numbers

The Mediterranean Knights have beaten their West African opponents in their most recent two encounters: 3-2 in February 2011 and 1-0 in November 2013 (both friendlies).
The sides are clashing for the first time in almost 11 years.
The Cheetahs are ranked 91st in the world. Their rivals from North Africa are 26 places adrift.

Benin vs Libya Prediction

The Mediterranean Knights have seen a better run than their rivals, who've been going through a rough patch since last year. Back-to-back wins over Rwanda and Nigeria in the World Cup qualifiers signaled a possible return to form, but the Super Eagles crushed them last week to lay bare their vulnerabilities.

Prediction: Benin 1-2 Libya
