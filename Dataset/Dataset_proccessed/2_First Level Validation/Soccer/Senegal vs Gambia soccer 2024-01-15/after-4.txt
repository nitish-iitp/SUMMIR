AFRICA CUP OF NATIONS
SENEGAL 3-0 GAMBIA: LAMINE CAMARA STRIKES TWICE AS AFCON DEFENDING CHAMPIONS START WITH BIG WIN IN GROUP C
BYNADEEM BADSHAH

UPDATED 15/01/2024 AT 22:20 GMT

Senegal kicked off their Africa Cup of Nations title defence with a comfortable 3-0 win over 10-man Gambia in Group C. It took just five minutes for them to break the deadlock as Pape Gueye struck after good work from Sadio Mane. Lamine Camara then scored twice after the break – including a brilliant curling effort late on – to mark a solid start to Group C.

Defending champions Senegal began the defence of their Africa Cup of Nations title with a 3-0 win against 10-man Gambia.
Aliou Cisse's side made the perfect start when Sadio Mane teed up an unmarked Pape Gueye, who rifled his shot into the bottom corner from inside the box.

Gambia created some good opportunities in the first half with Musa Barrow curling a free-kick into the side netting while Ali Sowe headed over following a corner.

But their chances of salvaging something were dealt a huge blow before half-time when Ebou Adams was shown a red card for a studs up challenge after a VAR check.
And the Lions made their man advantage count when Ismaila Sarr threaded the ball through to Lamine Camara, who timed his run perfectly to score with a low shot.
In the closing minutes, Camara capped off a player of the match performance by curling a beautiful first time shot from outside the box into the top corner.
In the other Group C match, Cameroon drew 1-1 with Guinea.
Mohamed Bayo gave Guinea the lead after just 10 minutes but Francois Kamano saw red just before half-time. Cameroon were able to take advantage with a Frank Magri equaliser shortly after the restart, but they could not find a winner.
In Group D, Baghdad Bounedjah scored for Algeria on 18 minutes, but Angola nabbed a 1-1 draw when Mabululu scored from the spot midway through the second half.
TALKING POINT - EARLY GOAL OF THE TOURNAMENT CONTENDER
Ndiaye produced some lovely skill to twist his way into the box before teeing up Camara who dispatched a rocket of a shot into the top corner from distance.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - LAMINA CAMARA (SENEGAL)
The 20-year-old Metz player looks like an exciting prospect with his box-to-box runs. He took his goal brilliantly after running onto Sarr's through ball. And his second was a thing of absolute beauty.
