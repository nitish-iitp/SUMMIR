FIFA World Cup Qualifiers

Uganda 1-2 Algeria

Uganda Cranes suffered a 2-1 loss to Algeria in the 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers at Mandela National Stadium, Namboole on Monday.

While Uganda took a 1-0 lead in the first half, Algeria returned in the second half ruthless and claimed all the maximum points on the day.

Travis Mutyaba opened the scoring for Uganda with a powerful low shot that found the back of the net in the early minutes.

The midfield battle intensified as the half progressed. Fahad Bayo dispossessed an Algerian player in midfield and found Steven Mukwala on the right flank. Mukwala's curling effort went just wide after a sliding tackle by Madani Mohamed conceded a corner to Uganda.

Uganda continued to press, with Mutyaba and Kenneth Semakula combining to set up Mukwala for another chance. However, his effort sailed narrowly wide.

Algeria threatened late in the first half when Ronald Sekiganda's loose pass found Bounedjah Baghdad. Lwaliwa made a crucial block to deny Baghdad's goal attempt.

Rogers Mato's powerful shot from distance was well-saved by Algerian goalkeeper Anthony Manderea in the closing minutes of the first half.

The second half saw a quick turnaround in fortunes. Houssem Aouar equalized for Algeria with a powerful close-range effort just two minutes after the restart.

Uganda then had a penalty shout denied when Rogers Mato was brought down in the box.

Algeria took the lead in the 58th minute through Benrahma Moamed. A defensive lapse by the Ugandan backline allowed the Desert Foxes to break through and take control of the match.

Despite the strong fight from the boys, the visitors took advantage as they stretched to nine points.

Uganda Cranes remain on six points in four games, having registered two victories and as many losses.

Elsewhere, Botswana registered a 3-1 victory against Somalia in the other game played in Group G of the ongoing Qualifiers.
