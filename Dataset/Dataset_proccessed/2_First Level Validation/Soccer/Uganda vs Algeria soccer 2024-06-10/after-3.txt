•Uganda Vs Algeria-Mandela National Stadium ( Live on FUFA TV at 7PM)

Uganda Cranes will eye back to back wins at Mandela National Stadium when they host Algeria in Group G of the 2026 World Cup qualifier on Monday night.

Paul Put’s charges made a return to Namboole in nearly five years with a narrow 1-0 victory over Botswana on Friday last week.

Muhammad Shaban who came on as a substitute was the match winner for Cranes.

Algeria on the other hand suffered a 2-1 home defeat to Guinea in their previous game.

Both sides are currently on six points along Guinea and Mozambique.

Uganda Cranes head coach Put anticipates a tough contest

“We are going to play a big team, one of the best in Africa. So it will not be an easy game for us but I have the belief to what I have been seeing after Botswana that can make it difficult for Algeria.” We respect them, they have big players who play in the English Premier league and after the defeat to Guinea they want to react.” Said Put
