EURO 2024
ROMANIA 3-0 UKRAINE: NICOLAE STANCIU SCREAMER KICKSTARTS DREAM WIN FOR EURO 2024 UNDERDOGS IN GROUP E
BYALI IVESON

UPDATED 17/06/2024 AT 15:22 GMT

Romania kicked off their Euro 2024 campaign with a superb 3-0 win over Ukraine. A belter from Nicolae Stanciu, moments after a dreadful clearance from Ukraine and Real Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin, set them on their way. Ukraine had their moments but were rebuffed by a sturdy Romanian defence, as Razvan Marin and Denis Dragus struck after half-time to deliver a convincing win.

Romania opened their Euro 2024 campaign with a stunning 3-0 victory against Ukraine, inspired by Nicolae Stanciu's wondergoal to get the party started.
Romania had been second best until captain Stanciu smashed the ball into the top corner from range in the 29th minute, capitalising on poor distribution from Ukraine goalkeeper Andriy Lunin.

From then on Romania were well on top and doubled the lead shortly after the break when Razvan Marin's speculative strike squirmed under Lunin.

Denis Dragus added a third with a tap-in, ensuring the thousands of Romania fans in Munich could enjoy a stroll to the country's first European Championship win since 2000.
Romania now sit top of Group E and are well positioned to qualify, given three points was enough to reach the knockout rounds of Euro 2020 as a third-placed side.
Ukraine are bottom while Belgium and Slovakia play later.
TALKING POINT - DID STANCIU SCORE THE GOAL OF THE TOURNAMENT?
It is only day four, so far too early to tell, but Stanciu is the clubhouse leader.
It was a sensational first-time strike, arrowing into the top corner with curl which took it away from the flustered goalkeeper, and a fantastic moment for Romania which will live long in the country's collective conscience, regardless of what else happens this tournament. Given how the game changed after Stanciu scored, it is hard to overstate the goal's importance.

PLAYER OF THE MATCH - DENNIS MAN (ROMANIA)
Credited with two assists - the second outstanding, the first owing much to the excellence of Stanciu - and was a menace for Ukraine throughout his time on the pitch. Romania did a lot with not much of the ball and the play of the wingers was a big factor towards that.

MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
GOAL! UKRAINE 0-1 ROMANIA (STANCIU) 29' - What a goal! Lunin gives the ball away cheaply as Man cuts out a pass. He squares to Stanciu, outside the box, who unleashes a brilliant shot curling into the top corner.
CLOSE! 36' - Mudryk beats his man, puts in a good cross and Dragusin almost heads into his own goal, but it's just over, thankfully for him and Romania.
OFF THE BAR!39' - Stancui takes a corner on the Romania left, looks to go for goal with Lunin well off his line and hits the bar.
GOAL! ROMANIA 2-0 UKRAINE (R. MARIN) 53' - A Romania counter-attack looks to have stalled, but Marin slams hopefully goalward from 25 yards and Lunin lets the ball squirm under him.
GOAL! ROMANIA 3-0 UKRAINE (DRAGUS) 57' - From a corner, Romania work it well and Dragus has a tap-in from Man's driven cross.
