Euro 2024 odds for Monday’s three group matches including France-Austria
By Dan Santaromita
Jun 16, 2024

1

France has been a world power in the sport for decades, but the last 10 years have seen Les Bleus produce incredibly talented and deep squads that few in the world can match on a regular basis. In the last four major tournaments, France has made three finals but was upset in the last Euro in the Round of 16.

The French start the push to add to their recent legacy on Monday with a match against Austria. France is not the biggest favorite of the day, though. That honor goes to Belgium, which takes on Slovakia.

Monday’s games start with Romania and Ukraine in Group E. Ukraine is favored, but this match is relatively even in the odds.

All odds from BetMGM.

Romania vs. Ukraine

Kickoff time: 9 a.m. ET/2 p.m. BST/3 p.m. CEST

Venue: Allianz Arena — Munich

Ukraine made it to the quarterfinals at the last European Championship, delivering the country’s best-ever performance at the tournament. Ukraine is expected to get out of the group again here. Belgium is the heavy favorite to win the group, but Ukraine is second in the odds and is -275 to advance.

Romania would be thrilled to get out of this group. The last time Romania made the knockout stage at a major tournament was 2000. That’s also the last time Romania won a match at a major tournament.

But, consider this: Romania went undefeated in qualifying with six wins and four draws, winning a group that included Switzerland.

Belgium vs. Slovakia

Kickoff time: Noon ET/5 p.m. BST/6 p.m. CEST

Venue: Deutsche Bank Park/Frankfurt Arena — Frankfurt

Belgium’s golden generation has had deep tournament runs but is running out of time to win a trophy. Kevin De Bruyne is 32. Romelu Lukaku is 31. Both players are still playing at a high level, but there aren’t many chances left for them. Beyond those two, Jan Vertonghen (37 years old) and Axel Witsel (35 years old) have been staples in this era.

After the shocking group stage exit at the 2022 World Cup, Belgium will likely be playing with something to prove. The Group E draw provides a great opportunity for Belgium. On paper, Slovakia, Ukraine and Romania don’t pose major threats. Belgium is an overwhelming favorite (-200) to win the group.

Slovakia has never beaten Belgium in three meetings (two losses, one draw).

France vs. Austria

Kickoff time: 3 p.m. ET/8 p.m. BST/9 p.m. CEST

Venue: Merkur Spiel-Arena/Düsseldorf Arena — Düsseldorf

The final match of the day is arguably the most intriguing. France can be a joy to watch when at its best, and Austria has enough quality that fans shouldn’t automatically expect this to be an easy France win.

The French are a big favorite (-185) to win the group, even with Group D being deep on paper.

Kylian Mbappé is also co-favorite with Harry Kane to be the top scorer in the tournament. Mbappé was the top scorer at the 2022 World Cup with eight goals and was tied for second with four goals at the 2018 World Cup. He has the scoring track record and the team around him to be an obvious favorite for that spot. Will he get going with a goal against Austria?
