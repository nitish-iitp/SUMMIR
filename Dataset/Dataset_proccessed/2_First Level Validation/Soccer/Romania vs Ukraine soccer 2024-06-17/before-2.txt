UEFA Euro 2024, Groups, Format, Venues and Schedule: UEFA Euro 2024 kicks off in India in the early hours of June 15, as hosts Germany take on Scotland in the opening encounter. Germany is hosting a major international tournament for the first time since the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Defending champions Italy - who are drawn in what many have claimed is the 'Group of Death' with Spain and Croatia - start their campaign against minnows Albania on June 16. Kylian Mbappe's France are hot favourites, and begin their tournament on Austria on June 18, while his soon-to-be Real Madrid teammate Jude Bellingham begins his campaign with England a day earlier, against Serbia. And can Cristiano Ronaldo get his hands on a second European Championship? Portugal kick off against Czech Republic on June 19.

The knockout stage begins on June 29, with the Final to be held at the Olympiastadion in Berlin on July 15.
