Spain Analysis: On a 3-game winning run

First up, Spain kicked off their European Championship journey last weekend with an impressive display as they dominated World Cup bronze medalists Croatia 3-0. La Roja undoubtedly have a feverish atmosphere in their camp. The three-time European winners have only lost once in their previous 13 appearances across all competitions, with some projecting Luis de la Fuente’s team as a possible dark horse contender this summer. Spain, who won their first Nations League title last summer, have also developed a true clinical edge in the closing third. La Roja concluded their pre-tournament preparations by defeating Northern Ireland 5-1 and Andorra 5-0, respectively. La Roja finished their pre-tournament preparations with victories of 5-1 and 5-0 over Northern Ireland and Andorra, respectively.

 

Italy Analysis: Undefeated in their last 7 matches

Italy proved they could get results even when they weren’t playing their best football as they defeated Albania 1-0. Despite the absence of several important players due to injuries, Italy produced a strong performance that demonstrated their tactical discipline and efficiency—two qualities that Luciano Spalletti’s team is known for. Bologna’s 22-year-old center back, Riccardo Calafiori, made his tournament debut and turned in a strong performance. His defensive prowess and poise were crucial in containing Albania, and his performance has significantly improved Italy’s back line. Similar to their rivals, the Italians are probably going to choose continuity going into this match. It is doubtful that such a potent defense will be compromised, while the midfield tandem of Davide Frattesi, Barella, and Jorginho seems more than capable of taking on Spain’s best players.
