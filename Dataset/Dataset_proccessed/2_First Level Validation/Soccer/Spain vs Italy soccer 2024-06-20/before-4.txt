How Spain could line up against Italy

Spain seek a place in Euro 2024's knockout stages when they meet Italy on Thursday, as they aim to build on beating Croatia in their Group B opener.

Alvaro Morata, Fabian Ruiz and Dani Carvajal were on the scoresheet in Berlin, and all three should start again as La Roja tackle one of their potential title rivals in Gelsenkirchen.

Both Morata - who is now Spain's second-top scorer in major tournaments - and Manchester City midfielder Rodri picked up minor knocks at the weekend, but having since resumed training, they are set to play prominent roles in Luis de la Fuente's starting XI.

While Rodri's former City teammate Aymeric Laporte is now fit and available following an injury that ruled him out of the opening game, Nacho and Robin Le Normand are expected to pair up in central defence.

Previous reports suggested that De la Fuente had planned to rotate his full-backs throughout the tournament, but Carvajal and Chelsea's Marc Cucurella could have made themselves undroppable after showing up well against Croatia.

Therefore, veteran right-back Jesus Navas and recent Bundesliga-winner Alex Grimaldo must make do with a place on the bench, alongside strong attacking options such as Dani Olmo and Mikel Oyarzabal.

Spearheading an otherwise youthful front three - also featuring Nico Williams and Barcelona teenager Lamine Yamal - Morata will captain his national team once again.

Spain possible starting lineup: Simon; Carvajal, Le Normand, Nacho, Cucurella; Pedri, Rodri, Ruiz; Yamal, Morata, Williams
