Spain vs Italy Predicted Lineups Preview

Spain is participating in their 12th UEFA EURO tournament and has been victorious three times, which is tied with Germany for the most wins. In addition, they hold the unique distinction of being the only country to have achieved consecutive victories in the tournament.

All of Spain’s last 50 goals at the UEFA EURO have been scored from inside the box. Their most recent goal from a distance came from Raul’s powerful strike against Slovenia during the group stages of the 2000 edition.

Italy has made its 11th appearance in the UEFA European Championship, with only Germany and Spain having won the tournament more times than the Squadra Azzura (2, in 1968 and 2020). Italy aims to achieve a rare feat by winning consecutive UEFA EURO tournaments, a feat only accomplished by Spain in 2008 and 2012.

Italy has maintained a solid defensive record in their recent UEFA EURO participation. Throughout their last 12 matches in the competition, they have only allowed a total of six goals, never conceding more than one goal in a single match.

This impressive defensive performance showcases their ability to keep their opponents at bay. Italy has played 45 matches at the UEFA EURO, resulting in an average of 1.84 goals per game (52 goals scored, 31 goals conceded). This is the lowest ratio compared to any of the 25 teams that have participated in 10 or more matches in the competition.

Going into this fixture, Spain has a win probability of 45%, whereas Italy has a win probability of 30%.
