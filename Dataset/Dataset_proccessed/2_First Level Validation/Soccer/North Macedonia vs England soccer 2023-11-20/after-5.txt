MATCH REPORT
England's equaliser arrived in the second half, moments after Harry Kane's arrival as a substitute
England came from behind to draw 1-1 with North Macedonia in Skopje to end their UEFA EURO 2024 qualification unbeaten.

Gareth Southgate’s side went into the break a goal down, after Enis Bardhi scored from the rebound of his penalty following a save from Jordan Pickford.

But the Three Lions were brought back level as Harry Kane’s header was turned home by Jani Atanasov to see England top Group C and head into the EURO 2024 draw as one of the top seeds.

Debutant Rico Lewis displayed the confidence that has seen him make his first England appearance a day shy of his 19th birthday as he had England’s first attempt of the evening, sending a shot over the bar.
Another long-range effort followed in the 14th minute as Declan Rice struck the post to send a warning to the hosts.

The defence was breached again when Ollie Watkins was found free in the box, but the Aston Villa striker could only head across the face of goal.

Watkins was inches away from two more chances for England on the half-hour mark, first just failing to connect with a Jack Grealish cross before Phil Foden’s pass was just too far in front of Watkins.

With 39 minutes gone, and against the run of play, North Macedonia were awarded a penalty with Lewis judged to have handled the ball in the area following a review by VAR

Pickford did well to save Enis Bardhi’s spot-kick, but could not deny the midfielder as he rifled home the rebound to put the home side ahead.

Lewis looked to make amends down the other end as he set himself well on the edge of the box before firing low, forcing a save from Dimitrievski.

The shot-stopper was called into action two minutes later as England searched for an injury-time equaliser, with Trent Alexander-Arnold's dipping shot having to be turned behind.

England emerged from the break full of attacking intent and looked to have equalised just two minutes into the second half through Grealish.

Bukayo Saka had been strong and skilful in the build-up before sending in a cross that Grealish turned home only for the goal to be disallowed for offside.

Just seconds after coming on as a replacement, Kane was involved in the equaliser, heading a Foden corner towards goal before Atanasov turned the ball into his own net in the 59th minute.

Nikola Serafimov gave North Macedonia a late chance at a winner as he headed just over before substitute Marcus Rashford sent a free-kick wide for England as the game moved into injury time.

The Three Lions continued to fight for a winner but could not find one as England ended the year with a draw but unbeaten in 2023.
