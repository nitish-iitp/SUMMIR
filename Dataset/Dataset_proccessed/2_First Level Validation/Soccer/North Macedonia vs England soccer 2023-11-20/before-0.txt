England will head to North Macedonia on Monday evening knowing that a point in their final Euro 2024 qualification fixture would secure their spot in Pot 1 for the draw.

The Three Lions have enjoyed a strong campaign, picking up 19 points from seven matches to comfortably top Group C and advance to next summer's European Championship, but North Macedonia have been eliminated from qualification contention, with the visitors down in fourth position in the section.

North Macedonia have won two, drawn one and lost four of their seven qualification matches for Euro 2024, which has left them down in fourth position in Group C on seven points.

The Lions managed to reach the finals of Euro 2020, which was their first-ever participation in a major tournament, but they will not be present at next summer's European Championship.

Blagoja Milevski's side will enter this match off the back of a 5-2 defeat to Italy on Friday, while they were also beaten 2-0 by Ukraine in the middle of October.

Both of North Macedonia's wins in this section have come against Malta, and they suffered a 7-0 defeat in the reverse match with England at Wembley in the middle of June.

The Lions will be bidding to challenge for a spot at the 2026 World Cup, and they actually reached the playoff final for the 2022 World Cup, losing 2-0 to Portugal, with Bruno Fernandes netting a brace for the hosts.

England will enter their final Group C fixture off the back of a 2-0 win over Malta at Wembley, with Harry Kane netting in the 75th minute after an own-goal from Enrico Pepe had sent the home side ahead.

It was an uninspiring performance from the Three Lions, but they have now won their six and drawn one of their seven matches in the section to collect 19 points, which has left them comfortably clear at the summit.

Gareth Southgate's side are six clear of second-placed Italy, and they need a point versus North Macedonia to be certain of being in Pot 1 for the finals draw.

England were eliminated in the quarter-finals of the 2022 World Cup by France, while they were runners-up at Euro 2020, losing on penalties to Italy.

This group of players should be confident of advancing deep into next summer's tournament, and it is shaping up to be a fascinating European Championship, with France, Germany, Spain and Portugal also among the teams to watch.

Southgate will already have settled on the majority of his squad for Euro 2024, but there are still some spots open, demonstrating the importance of Monday's contest, as a strong performance from a certain player could see them cement their spot in the group.

North Macedonia head coach Milevski is expected to make changes to the side that took to the field for the first whistle against Italy on Friday night.

Jani Atanasov scored a brace off the bench in the team's last match, and he is now expected to come into the side, while Milan Ristovski and Stefan Ashkovski could also be introduced into the XI.

Napoli's Elif Elmas and Trabzonspor's Enis Bardhi should continue in the starting side, while there is also expected to be another position in the XI for Ezgjan Alioski.

As for England, head coach Southgate is expected to make changes to the side that took to the field for the first whistle against Malta on Friday night.

Rico Lewis could be introduced for his debut at left-back due to the lack of options in that area of the field, while Bukayo Saka, Kalvin Phillips, Kyle Walker, Declan Rice and Jack Grealish could also come in for starts.

Marcus Rashford was forced off injured against Malta after colliding with teammate Trent Alexander-Arnold, and he is unlikely to be in the side against North Macedonia.

Nick Pope, John Stones, Luke Shaw, Reece James, Jude Bellingham and James Maddison are notable absentees from the squad due to fitness issues, while Raheem Sterling was again overlooked despite his strong form for Chelsea this season.


North Macedonia possible starting lineup:
Dimitrievski; Ashkovski, Serafimov, Musliu; Dimoski, Atanasov, Elezi, Alioski; Ristovski, Bardhi, Elmas

England possible starting lineup:
Pickford; Walker, Guehi, Maguire, Lewis; Alexander-Arnold, Rice, Phillips; Grealish, Kane, Saka



We say: North Macedonia 1-2 England

This has the potential to be a tricky match for England, as North Macedonia have a number of talented players, and the Three Lions were not exactly at their inspiring best against Malta. We are expecting England to win, but it might be a close match in terms of the scoreline on Monday night.
