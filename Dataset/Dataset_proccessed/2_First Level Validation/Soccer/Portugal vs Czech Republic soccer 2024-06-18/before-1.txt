The UEFA EURO 2024 is already underway with some emphatic results so far. As we head into the final Matchday 1 of the group stages, all eyes are fixed on Portugal, who will kick off its journey on Tuesday, June 18, 2024, at 21:00 CET at the Red Bull Arena, Leipzig against Group F rivals, Czechia. Entering the tournament with new boss Robert Martinez, expectations are high for the Cristiano Ronaldo-led side.

They ended the UEFA EURO Qualifiers with a perfect 10-win record. However, in the last five friendly ties against Slovenia and Croatia, they stumbled to get a defeat. Yet, that won’t rule out their desire to bring the trophy back to the streets of Lisbon, having last won the tournament back in 2016. Also, a memento for a 39-year-old Ronaldo, who potentially might be playing his last Euro.

On the other hand, Czechia, better known as the Czech Republic, hasn’t seen the trophy for a very long time. They lifted their only trophy back in 1976 as Czechoslovakia. Hence, the struggle to break its 48-year exile continues. They are entering the tournament with quite a decent form, having lost a UEFA Euro qualifier match back in October 2023. Certainly, Ivan Hasek’s side will look to surprise the 2016 winners.

Portugal vs Czech Republic: Team news

Injury news

Portugal: Otavio was the only player, who was expected to make it to the squad but unfortunately couldn’t. The Al Nassr star couldn’t be considered for the month-long tournament due to an unknown injury. But the rest of the 26-man squad handpicked by Roberto Martinez is fit and fine.

Czech Republic: As for Czechia, they will be deeply missing Michal Sadilek, who sadly wasn’t available at Ivan Hasek’s disposal. The FC Twente midfielder suffered a laceration in a bicycle accident earlier. However, the rest of the 26-man squad managed to keep itself safe until the Euros.

Expected line-ups

Portugal: Diogo Costa; Cancelo, Pepe, Ruben Dias, Nuno Mendes; Palhinha, Vitinha, Bruno Fernandes; Rafael Leao, Ronaldo, Bernardo Silva

Czech Republic: Stanek; Holes, Hranac, Krejcí; Coufal, Soucek, Provod, Barak, David Jurasek; Kuchta, Schick

Head-to-head and prediction

Total matches played: 5

Won by Portugal: 4

Won by Czech Republic: 1

Draw: 0

Portugal is definitely the preferred choice of many to lift the 2024 Euro. The same will be the case for this opening group stage clash. However, one can’t rule out the capabilities of the Czech Republic. Yet, the fixture can turn out to be a close one. We reckon Portugal 2-1 Czech Republic.
