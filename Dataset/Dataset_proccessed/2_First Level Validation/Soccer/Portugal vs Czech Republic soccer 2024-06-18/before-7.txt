How Portugal could line up against Czech Republic
By Matt Law, Football Editor

Cristiano Ronaldo is set to lead the Portugal line in the country's Euro 2024 opener against Czech Republic, with the forward remaining a vital player for his country at the age of 39.

The Al-Nassr striker scored twice in Portugal's 3-0 win over Republic of Ireland in their last friendly, and he has now managed 130 goals in 207 caps during a staggering career.

Ronaldo is chasing a host of records at Euro 2024, including the most tournament appearances, the oldest outfield player at the competition and oldest player to score, and it is certainly not beyond him to lead this Portugal side to their second European Championship title.

Pepe will be 41 years and 113 days old on Tuesday, and he is expected to feature in the middle of the defence to become the oldest player in the history of the tournament.

Head coach Roberto Martinez has big decisions to make all over the pitch, but Bernardo Silva will be a certain starter, while Rafael Leao is also expected to be given the nod in the final third of the field.

Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes will also start, and he is likely to be joined in midfield by Vitinha and Joao Palhinha, with Joao Cancelo and Nuno Mendes operating in the full-back positions.

Such is the strength of the squad, the likes of Antonio Silva, Diogo Dalot, Joao Neves, Joao Felix and Diogo Jota are likely to find themselves on the bench for their side's first match at the competition.

Portugal possible starting lineup: Costa; Cancelo, Pepe, Dias, Mendes; Palhinha, Vitinha, Fernandes; Leao, Ronaldo, Bernardo
