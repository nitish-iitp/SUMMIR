Euro 2024 odds for Tuesday’s two group matches including Portugal-Czechia
By Dan Santaromita
Jun 17, 2024

Group F finally gets underway at Euro 2024, the final pair of matches in the first set of the group stage. Portugal, still featuring 39-year-old superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, takes on Czechia after Turkey and Georgia start things off.

After three days of three matches per day, there are just two matches on Tuesday. The three-match cadence will return for the following four days to complete the second round of the group stage.

Turkey and Portugal are favored for Tuesday. Here’s a look at the odds and what to watch for.

Turkey vs. Georgia

Kickoff time: Noon ET/5 p.m. BST/6 p.m. CEST

Venue: BVB Stadion Dortmund

Georgia entered Euro 2024 as the lowest-qualified team in the FIFA rankings, at No. 75 in the world. The team won two out of eight qualifying matches in Group A and finished fourth out of five teams, but it was given a second chance via the Nations League playoffs. There, Georgia beat Luxembourg and knocked off Greece in penalty kicks to get this spot.

This is the first major tournament for Georgia.

Turkey was far more impressive in qualifying, winning a group that included Croatia and Wales. After losing all three matches at the last European Championship, Turkey should be confident in a better performance this time. Starting against Georgia is a good opportunity for Turkey to get off to a good start.

The odds have Turkey as second-best in this group, with +400 odds to win the group and -350 odds to advance. Georgia is the long shot of the group (+1400 to win the group, +160 to advance).

Portugal vs. Czech Republic

Kickoff time: 3 p.m. ET/8 p.m. BST/9 p.m. CEST

Venue: RB Arena — Leipzig

Could this be the last major tournament for Ronaldo? The 39-year-old is not playing in Europe on the club level anymore but is still scoring for Portugal. He scored twice in a warmup match against Ireland. He and 41-year-old teammate Pepe are the two oldest players at Euro 2024.

There are plenty of other talented attacking players on Portugal’s roster, which is why the team is among the tournament favorites in the odds. AC Milan’s Rafael Leão, Barcelona’s João Félix and Liverpool’s Diogo Jota will give opposing defenses plenty to watch. In midfield, Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva and Manchester United’s Bruno Fernandes are among the stars as well. In short, Portugal is loaded, at least in terms of the club names attached to so many of its players.

That’s not the case for Czechia, which has 16 players on its roster from the domestic league. That could lead to some extra chemistry and familiarity, though. Nine of those players are from Slavia Prague, four are from Viktoria Plzeň and three are from league champions Sparta Prague.

Since Czechoslovakia split, this national team has made it to all eight Euros, including a runner-up showing in 1996 and a semifinal appearance in 2004. Three years ago, this group made the quarterfinals after beating the Netherlands in the Round of 16.
