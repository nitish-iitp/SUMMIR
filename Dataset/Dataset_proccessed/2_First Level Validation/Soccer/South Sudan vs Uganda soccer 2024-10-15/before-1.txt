South Sudan and Uganda will both be looking to close out October's round of Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers with a victory when they square off at the Juba Stadium on Tuesday afternoon.
 
Following a 1-0 defeat against the visitors last time out, the hosts will be looking to exact revenge and keep their AFCON ambitions alive with a much-needed victory.

Despite being in the ascendancy for large spells of their meeting against South Sudan, Uganda just about managed to scrape a 1-0 triumph at the Nelson Mandela National Stadium on Friday.
 
Bevis Mugabi picked a perfect time to open his account for Paul Put's men as he broke the deadlock less than two minutes into the second period to decide a tight affair.
 
As a result, the Cranes have now picked up back-to-back wins for the first time since January and are unbeaten in five of their last six outings, with their only defeat coming in June's World Cup qualifier against Algeria.
 
Albeit only on goal difference, Uganda sit top of Group K, level on points with South Africa and four clear of the Congo Republic in third ahead of their next involvement.
 
A win for the visitors on Tuesday would see them secure safe passage into the group stages of the upcoming AFCON tournament should Congo fail to secure all three points against South Africa.

South Sudan did not do much wrong in their defeat to Uganda, but a lack of cutting edge in attack ultimately proved to be their biggest undoing once again.
 
Nicolas Dupuis's men failed to find the back of the net for the fourth time in seven matches since the turn of the year, and it is little surprise they are without a win in that time.
 
Defeat number four on the bounce last time out has dampened the mood even further for the Bright Stars, whose wait for a maiden AFCON tournament is set to go on barring a drastic turn of events.
 
One of three teams without a point midway through the qualifiers, South Sudan are rooted to the bottom of Group J and currently have a seven-point deficit to make up with just three games left.
 
Anything less than a victory on Tuesday would seal the hosts' fate, and given they have yet to emerge triumphant on home turf since 2022, South Sudan have it all to do in a must-win encounter in front of their fans.

Midfield duo Ronald Ssekiganda and Travis Mutyaba were both subbed off at half the interval last time out and could have to make do with a place on the bench in this one.
 
Bevis Mugabi missed training on Saturday with a flu infection but is expected to be available to feature for the visitors in defence alongside the experienced Halid Lwaliwa.
 
Given his side's attacking malaise, Nicolas Dupuis could opt to ring the changes up front with a number of players yearning for a starting appearance.
 
Among them is 20-year-old Paul Jawa, who has not got much of a look-in since making his international debut for the hosts in June 2023.


South Sudan possible starting lineup:
Jenaro; Ouma, Angier, Malis; Loki, Okocha, Taban, Juma; Gaddafi, Majak, Thomas

Uganda possible starting lineup:
Watenga; Kayondo, Mugabi, Lwaliwa, Semakula; Ssekiganda, Mutyaba, Aucho; Mato, Omedi, Ssemugabi



We say: South Sudan 1-2 Uganda

Uganda have put together a near-perfect qualifying campaign so far and are deservingly on the verge of completing the job.
 
South Sudan, on the other hand, will set out to delay the seemingly inevitable as a recovery from here seems unlikely in the context of AFCON qualification.
 
We are backing the away side to come out on top at the sound of the final whistle.
