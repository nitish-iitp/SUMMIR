Match Preview: Paul Put anticipates tough duel against South Sudan in Juba

2025 AFCON Qualifiers | Fixture

South Sudan vs Uganda - 4 PM
Congo vs South Africa - 7 PM

Uganda Cranes is set to lock horns with South Sudan in the 2025 AFCON Qualifiers encounter on Tuesday in Juba.

Uganda Cranes come into this fixture with a step away from securing a spot in the forthcoming 2025 AFCON tournament.

After picking a 1-0 victory against South Sudan on Friday, Uganda needs to secure a victory in Juba to end the dull of spell without AFCON engagements.

Uganda Cranes head coach Joseph Paul Put expects a tough duel against South Sudan in the second leg.

"We know it will be a tough game. We have prepared and are ready for the tough duel because South Sudan is playing at home," he said.

"They will want to take revenge, so if we are not prepared, then it will be a very tough game," he added.

"We play against South Sudan, which is a very organised game. They created a number of chances in the first leg."

"We have to be aware of that (it will be tough) going into this fixture. We know some of the challenges ahead of us, but we have prepared well."

Uganda and South Africa top group K with seven points each. The Cranes sit on top of the group due to the away goals against South Africa.

Team News

Elio Capradossi has shaken off the knock he suffered while in Kampala. There has been concern with his training, but he managed to cut the travelling squad.

Bevis Mugabi missed the recovery session after Friday's game after catching a cold, but the gaffer says he has since fought against the illness.

Head to head

The two sides have met twice. Among those, Uganda has registered five wins suffered one loss and made one draw.
