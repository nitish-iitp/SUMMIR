Uganda secured back-to-back wins over South Sudan to enlighten chances of qualifying for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations with a 2-1 victory in Juba.

Denis Omedi first half goal and an own goal from Alfred Leku turned Johana Juma goal into a mere consolation as Cranes moved top of group K with 10 points and could join the Afcon party if South Africa win in Congo.

Ismael Kiyonga rates the Uganda Cranes players from the Juba international stadium

Isma Watenga 6.0: Had less to do on the afternoon and could do less about the goal conceded.

Kenneth Ssemakula 6.0: Unlike the reverse fixture where he was overrun by Okocha, he defended steadily and even went forward well.

Aziz Kayondo 7.0: Found a little wanting when he went forward as his deliveries weren’t as decent but defensively astute.

Bevis Mugabi 6.0: Should have read the game better before he was turned inside out for the South Sudan goal but otherwise solid and made quick decisions.

Halid Lwaliwa 6.0: Went off injured at the break but had done well until he couldn’t play after a head injury.

Khalid Aucho 7.0: Far more comfortable in possession, positional sense and awareness than in the first game at Namboole.

Taddeo Lwanga 8.5: A man of the match show on his return. Was in control of proceedings, determined tempo of the game and was never afraid to receive the ball.

Allan Okello 6.5: Assisted the opener and had some good touches but was constantly physically bullied by the opponents. Taken off for Travis Mutyaba

Rogers Mato 4.5: Struggled to get into the game before he was taken off and his final ball lacking somewhat. Rightly taken off for Jude Ssemugabi.

Denis Omedi 7.0: Set the ball rolling with a well taken goal and was a constant menace to the hosts defence throughout.

Derrick Nsibambi 6.0: Didn’t get the service he would crave for a forward but his involvement in team plays was brilliant especially in the build up to the first goal.

Substitutes

Travis Mutyaba 6.5: Carried on from Okello had left and his free kick resulted into the match winner. Better display than on Friday when he was anonymous.

Timothy Awany 6.0: Replaced Lwaliwa and showed his class with a good display.

Jude Ssemugabi 7.0: Literally won the game with his flick that was turned into own net by Leku.

Steven Mukwala 4.5: Offered the team a different dimension in attack but was wasteful.
