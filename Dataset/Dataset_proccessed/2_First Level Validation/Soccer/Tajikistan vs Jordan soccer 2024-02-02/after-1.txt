Hussein Ammouta, Jordan's head coach

Rabat - Moroccan head coach Hussein Ammouta is taking his Jordanian team to the semi-finals of the ongoing Asian Cup, taking place in Qatar.

Jordan defeated Tajikistan today 1-0 to secure a spot in the tournament’s semi-finals. Reports said that this is the first time for Jordan to reach this advanced phase of the competition.

Tajik football player Vakhdat Khanonov allowed Jordan to take the win, after scoring an own goal against his squad in the 66th minute of the match.

Ammouta joined the Jordanian national team in June of last year. The appointment came as  the Jordanian national team had been seeking to secure spots in international tournaments, including the 2026 World Cup and the Asian Cup.

The coach is known for successful campaigns with several clubs in Morocco, including Wydad Casablanca and FUS Rabat.

“It was a piece of history for Jordan under their Moroccan coach Hussein Ammouta,” the outlet AFP posted, “ (as) the kingdom (had) been defeated in their previous quarter-finals in 2004 and 2011.” 

Jordan is scheduled to play the semi-finals game in Qatar on Tuesday, February 6. The rival team is still to be determined following the games that will be played today and tomorrow.

Australia and Korea will play their quarterfinals at 4:30 Moroccan time.

Tomorrow, Qatar, the host country of the competition, will face Uzbekistan, while Iran will play against Japan.
