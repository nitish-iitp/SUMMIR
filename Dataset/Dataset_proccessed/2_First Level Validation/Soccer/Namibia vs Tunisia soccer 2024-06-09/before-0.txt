Warriors’ road to World Cup
June 4, 2024

Brave Warriors Head Coach, Collin Benjamin upped the Warriors’ tempo as the Senior Men’s National team continued their preparations for the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers against Liberia and Tunisia. Namibia will host Liberia on 5 June at the Orlando Stadium followed by their second encounter against Tunisia on 9 June 2024.

Warriors Head Coach, Benjamin says it has been a competitive camp in Johannesburg, with great display of skill and dedication from the players. Namibia played to a one all draw against Lesotho in a preparatory match on Saturday.

“I think it was a good test to get the young players exposed to international football. Lesotho was impressive, the way they could come out from the back, I think that is one of the key areas we needed to work on as well. Tactically it was a good game, and it was a learning curve for the players and that’s what we need for our players to grow and compete on the international stage”.

Blue Waters, Forward, Erastus Kalula who scored the goal for Namibia on his national team debut was excited on playing in the Warriors attire for the first time.

“The intensity at national level is high and the games are very fast, it was a good experience overall and scoring on my debut was definitely a confidence booster. There are still a few things we need to work on as a team, but the entire coaching staff has been really helpful and pushing us to our limits and I appreciate that”
