EURO 2024
PORTUGAL 0-0 SLOVENIA AET (3-0 PENS): CRISTIANO RONALDO IN TEARS AS SIDE BOOK PLACE IN EURO 2024 LAST EIGHT
BYEUROSPORT

UPDATED 02/07/2024 AT 06:47 GMT

There was drama of the highest order in Portugal's victory over Slovenia on penalties in the last 16 of Euro 2024. Cristiano Ronaldo, after failing to fire all night, missed from the spot in extra time, breaking down in tears as a result. Benjamin Sesko then missed a one on one for Slovenia, before a penalty shoot-out saw Portugal net all three of their kicks - and their opponents none.

Portugal narrowly avoided a huge upset and beat Slovenia on penalties to reach the Euro 2024 quarter-finals, with goalkeeper Diogo Costa the hero on a night on which Cristiano Ronaldo was reduced to tears.
Ronaldo had a penalty saved in extra time - which prompted his emotions to spill over - after a generally turgid affair remained goalless at 90 minutes with a series of Ronaldo free-kicks, three of which were off-target, the main talking point.

Benjamin Sesko had a huge chance for Slovenia in the second half of extra time after a mishap from 41-year-old Pepe, who looked that age once he had played for more than 100 minutes, but Costa saved the one-on-one.

Penalties were required to settle the tie and Costa saved all three of Slovenia's spot kicks. Portugal, through Ronaldo, Bruno Fernandes and Bernardo Silva, scored all three.
They advance to play France in the quarter-finals, while Slovenia can go home with heads held high after reaching the knockout rounds at a major tournament for the first time.

TALKING POINT - STILL NO GOAL FOR RONALDO
Ronaldo has an uncanny ability to make any game about him - through his play on the field and a force of personality which attracts the ball, as well as the histrionics - and this was no different. In the first half, Portugal against Slovenia was almost relegated to a sideshow behind his battle for a first goal of the tournament, with two unsuccessful free-kicks standing out as mini pieces of theatre.
It only got worse as the match wore on and Portugal got worse, culminating in the penalty Oblak saved which reduced Portugal's captain to tears. It was not to be for Ronaldo - although he does deserve credit for scoring in the shoot-out.
Ronaldo's 14 European Championship goals are the all-time record, as is scoring in five different editions of the Euros. He will have another chance to make it six in the quarter-finals, when everyone else will have another chance to wonder if Portugal could not field a better team without him, given the wealth of other options at Roberto Martinez's disposal.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - DIOGO COSTA (PORTUGAL)
The match-winner thanks to his incredible showing in the shoot-out, this was an easy choice. The save he made from Sesko in extra time should not be forgotten though, that too was a huge moment.
PLAYER RATINGS
Portugal: Costa 9, Cancelo 7, Pepe 6, Dias 6, Mendes 7, Palhinha 6, Vitinha 7, Fernandes 5, Silva 5, Leao 4, Ronaldo 4. Subs: Jota 5, Conceicao 5, Ruben Neves 5.
Slovenia: Oblak 8, Karnicnik 6, Drkusic 8, Bijol 8, Balkovec 6, Stojanovic 6, Cerin 6, Elsnik 6, Mlakar 5, Sporar 6, Sesko 5. Subs: Celar 5, Stankovic 6, Verbic 5, Ilicic 5.
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
CLOSE! 34' - Ronaldo takes a free kick, 25 yards from goal, and strikes it brilliantly, but just over the bar.
OFF THE POST! 45+3 - Leao twists, turns and cuts the ball back to Palhinha at the top of the box. Slipping, he shoots first time and clips the outside of the post.
SAVE! 55' - Ronaldo thunders the free kick at goal. Oblak - who barely has to move - beats the ball away.
BIG CHANCE! 61' - Sesko is racing through on goal and too quick for Pepe as Slovenia spring a rapid counter. Pepe doesn't give up though and does just enough to force a horrible shot, scuffed well wide.
PENALTY TO PORTUGAL! 103' - Jota dribbles into the box, among four Slovenia defenders, and takes a tumble over the leg of Drkusic. Silva and Slovenia play on, but the referee points to the spot!
PENALTY SAVED! 105' - Ronaldo takes, shooting to the goalkeeper's left, and Oblak pulls off a brilliant save! Wow.
SAVE! 115' - Pepe stumbles on the poor pitch, Sesko takes the ball away and is through on goal, but cannot beat Costa who brilliantly saves.
PORTUGAL WIN 3-0 ON PENALTIES! Costa saves all three Slovenia penalties and Ronaldo - making amends for the earlier miss - Fernandes and Silva convert for Portugal. They're into the quarter-finals, heartbreak for Slovenia.
