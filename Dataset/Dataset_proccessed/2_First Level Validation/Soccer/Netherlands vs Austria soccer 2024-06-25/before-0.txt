How the Netherlands could line up against Austria

Playing their final Group F fixture on Tuesday evening, the Netherlands are within a point of guaranteeing progress to Euro 2024's knockout stages.

As they prepare to meet Austria at Berlin's Olympiastadion, the Oranje should have a full squad available, as back-up striker Brian Brobbey has now recovered from a hamstring injury sustained in training last week.

Both Brobbey and Wout Weghorst will be hoping to displace Memphis Depay up front, following the latter's underwhelming displays so far, but head coach Ronald Koeman may instead opt for continuity in the final third.

That would most likely see Depay spearhead a 4-2-3-1 formation, in which Cody Gakpo, Xavi Simons and either Jeremie Frimpong or Donyell Malen provide support from behind.

Tijjani Reijnders is set to keep his place in midfield, though PSV pair Jerdy Schouten and Joey Veerman - both of whom are on a booking - could be paired instead if Koeman moves the AC Milan star further forward.

Unless Micky van de Ven, Lutsharel Geertruida or Daley Blind are brought in to freshen up a fairly solid defence, captain Virgil van Dijk will again join Nathan Ake and Inter Milan teammates Stefan de Vrij and Denzel Dumfries in the Dutch back four.

Meanwhile, Brighton & Hove Albion goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen has now established himself as the Netherlands' number one: the 21-year-old stopper has started nine of his nation's last 10 matches, keeping six clean sheets in the process.

Netherlands possible starting lineup: Verbruggen; Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake; Reijnders, Schouten; Frimpong, Simons, Gakpo; Depay
