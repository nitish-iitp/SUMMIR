Slovenia vs Portugal

The Selecao's all-time top goalscorer endured a forgettable evening as Roberto Martinez's side drew a blank

Cristiano Ronaldo, for all of this goals, accolades, and magic moments, cannot be the main man every night. And for Portugal against Slovenia, his shortcomings were laid bare as his side turned in a disheartening showing that eventually finished in a 2-0 loss.

Ronaldo was barely involved throughout, and managed just the one shot from open play, spending more time searching for fouls and complaining to officials than making a material impact.

After a drab first half, things opened up in the second. Benjamin Sesko came close for Slovenia, forcing a neat save out of Diogo Costa in the Portugal net, while Ronaldo, too, showed signs of life, a shimmy and strike flashing just wide of the post.

Adam Gnezda Cerin provided the crucial moment, though, making a smart run from central midfield to finish off a well-constructed goal for the hosts - who were good value for their lead. Portugal offered something of a response, however, as Joao Felix pinged a header off the post.

Timi Elsnik then doubled the Slovenia lead, lashing into the roof of the net from a tricky angle to put the contest beyond doubt - and end an 11-game winning streak for Roberto Martinez's men.

GOAL rates Portugal's players from Stadion Stozice...

Goalkeeper & Defence

Diogo Costa (5/10):

Couldn't do anything about Cerin's goal. Made an impressive stop to deny Sesko. Perhaps beaten too easily for the second.

Pepe (6/10):

A solid 45 minutes in which he had pretty much nothing to do except keep the ball moving.

Danilo (5/10):

Failed to track his man on Slovenia's opening goal, and was left looking for answers.

Goncalo Inacio (5/10):

Tidy on the ball, but both goals came down his side of the pitch.

Midfield

Diogo Dalot (4/10):

Heavily involved in attacking situations, but severely lacking in quality. One launched cross - when he really should have squared the ball to a wide open Ronaldo - encapsulated his struggles.

Ruben Neves (7/10):

Accurate in his passing, and kept the ball circulating. Not the kind of defensive midfielder that this tight game required, though.

Vitinha (6/10):

Never static, and looked to make forward runs, but his understanding with his side's forward players just wasn't there.

Joao Cancelo (5/10):

Did a lot of pretty things with the ball, but didn't have much of an impact. The nice trivela passes don't always work...

Attack

Otavio (5/10):

Barely involved in 45 middling minutes of football.

Cristiano Ronaldo (4/10):

Created problems based on presence alone, but was otherwise poor throughout. Spent a lot of time whining, and fired wide in his one real look of the game. No magic this time.

Joao Felix (5/10):

Spent most of the game searching for nutmegs rather than making the timely pass. His chance creation was lacking.

Subs & Manager

Antonio Silva (5/10):

Brought on at half-time, and Portugal looked significantly weaker with him at the back.

Chico Conceicao (6/10):

A buzzing presence on the wing. Active on the ball, and exciting in the right areas without creating much.

Joao Neves (N/A):

No time to make an impact.

Jota Silva (N/A):

No time to make an impact.

Roberto Martinez (4/10):

Kept things as expected with a 3-4-3, but he never really got a performance out of his side, who lacked quality and couldn't get their main man involved. A forgettable night.
