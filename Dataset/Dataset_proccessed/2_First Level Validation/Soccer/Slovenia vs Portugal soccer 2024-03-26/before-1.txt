How Portugal could line up against Slovenia

Portugal head coach Roberto Martinez will ring the changes for Tuesday's international friendly against Slovenia, as he bids to continue his 100% record since arriving as head coach.

Martinez has posted 11 straight wins since becoming manager of the European nation last January, including a 5-2 success over Sweden in a friendly on Thursday night.

Bernardo Silva, Ruben Dias, Joao Palhinha, Nelson Semedo, Toti Gomes, Rafael Leao, Bruno Fernandes and Goncalo Ramos have all been released from the camp ahead of the clash with Slovenia.

Those eight have been replaced by Cristiano Ronaldo, Diogo Dalot, Joao Cancelo, Danilo Pereira, Otavio, Ruben Neves, Vitinha and Joao Felix, so there will be a fresh look to the side on Tuesday night.

Ronaldo is set to win his 206th cap for Portugal against Slovenia, and the 39-year-old will be bidding to add to the incredible 128 goals that he has managed for his national side.

Rui Patricio should continue between the sticks, while it is possible that 41-year-old Pepe will again feature in the middle of the defence, with Antonio Silva potentially introduced alongside him.

There had been concern over Cancelo's involvement, as the defender missed Barcelona's La Liga clash with Atletico Madrid last weekend due to fears over a potential heart problem.

However, tests revealed that the 29-year-old had no issues, and he is therefore in line to feature on Tuesday, while Dalot, who has arguably been Manchester United's best player this season, should also start.

Portugal possible starting lineup: Patricio; Dalot, Pepe, A Silva, Cancelo; Danilo, R Neves, Vitinha; Otavio, Ronaldo, Felix
