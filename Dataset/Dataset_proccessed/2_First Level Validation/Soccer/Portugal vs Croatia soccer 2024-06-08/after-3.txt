“Portugal without Cristiano Ronaldo is nothing” - Fans react as ‘horrible’ Portugal suffer 2-1 loss to Croatia in friendly before Euro 2024

Fans have reacted on social medai as Portugal suffered a 2-1 loss to Croatia without Cristiano Ronaldo in a friendly on Saturday, June 8. The Selecao were unable to meet expectations at the Estadio Nacional do Jamor as their European counterparts were the better side on the night.

The game started off with an early goal (8') for the Vatreni through captain Luka Modric, who placed his effort into the bottom corner from a penalty kick. The rest of the first half saw the Selecao struggle to find their equalizer. They came out blazing in the second half as substitute Diogo Jota scored in the 48th minute.

However, the Selecao couldn't retain the draw, as Ante Budimir scored the winning goal for Croatia in the 56th minute. The visitors tightened up their defense, preventing the hosts from finding another equalizer. However, manager Roberto Martinez decided against bringing on Cristiano Ronaldo.

Trending

Fans reacted on social media after the game, criticizing Portugal's display.

"Cristiano Ronaldo carrying this trash Portugal side to another Euros this summer should honestly be considered as one of the greatest achievements in the history of this sport," one fan wrote.
"Portugal had 0 shots on target in the first half! They look all over the place without Cristiano Ronaldo..." another fan complained.
"Portugal 1-2 Croatia. Portugal without Cristiano Ronaldo is nothing..🐐🇵🇹" another warned.
"Well, a reality check would be putting it kindly. First time Selecao have played a class team (and not one of the elite) under Martínez and they were well beaten. Best to happen now and not in Germany I guess, but that was disheartening," another complained.
"This is why I don't see them as genuine contenders. The squad is there, but they still fail to play with the confidence of champions," wrote one.
"Thank God Ronaldo didn't play. They would have laid all the blame on him that Portugal lost as soon as he came back into the team. Most of this team are living on past glory as most of them have passed their prime. Lol," another added.
"Not a good result going into the Euros but it could be blessing in disguise for Portugal.. they needed this humbling. First time in years they faced a real tough side for 90 mins without Ronaldo and looked like an average team. 39-yo needs to carry them for one last time," a fan slammed the side.

Cristiano Ronaldo could break records at EURO 2024 with Portugal

The legendary striker is widely seen as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, and at the age of 39, he remains at the top of his game. He just won the Golden Boot in Saudi Arabia after scoring a record 35 goals for Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League.

He could well add to his tally of record 128 goals for the Selecao at Euro 2024. Ronaldo could become the first-ever player to partake in six EUROs, as he currently has played in five. He could also become the oldest to play in the tournament and become the oldest to score a goal if he does find the net.

He has scored in each of his last five tournaments, and if he scores in this one, he will become the first ever to score in six separate EUROs. Ronaldo could also become the oldest player to score in an EURO final if Selecao reach that stage. They are in Group F with Tukriye, Georgia, and Czechia.
