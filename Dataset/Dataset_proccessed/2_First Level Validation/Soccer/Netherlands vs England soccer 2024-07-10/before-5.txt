Ticket sale information for England's UEFA EURO 2024 semi-final with the Netherlands on Wednesday 10 July
Ahead of the ticket sale for England's UEFA EURO 2024 semi-final with the Netherlands for 2022-2024 England Supporters Travel Club members, we wanted to outline as much of the process as possible to help fans plan ahead.

It is important to note, that for each knockout stage match England play in, sales will take place over a very short period of time, due to the nature of how these games will be sold, via UEFA’s website.

The fixture will be played at 9pm local time (8pm BST) on Wednesday 10 July 2024, at BVB Stadion, Dortmund

Please note that the below information on Sale Windows is subject to change.

There is a chance the final allocation we receive could differ, by several hundred tickets, from the initial allocations we were given. UEFA are unable to confirm the exact allocation and category splits ahead of time as this will depend on:

1) If we are Team A or Team B (from a ticketing point of view this can be different to being home/away team in this tournament)
2) Which stadium we are playing in
3) Who our opponent is
4) The size of the stadium buffer zones

With this in mind, and in order to allow as many members as possible the chance to book their travel, we initially conducted a ballot for the top 70% for each KO stage match, however, we were unable to confirm which category they would be in.

The remaining 30% of tickets would be balloted to the remaining members who applied for said match via the tournament ballot rules (20% and 10% ballots).

Unfortunately, due to the sale of KO stage tickets via UEFA’s website being sold on a match-by-match basis, this will mean tight turnarounds and short sale windows for each KO stage fixture England progresses to.

What to expect for our semi-final sale

As it is unlikely UEFA will be able to confirm our final allocation with enough time to conduct our ballots ahead of the sale windows, we will conduct our ballots based on the minimum allocation outlined by UEFA Ticketing for this fixture. We understand that this may not be ideal, however, it will give a greater degree of clarity to the majority of members, particularly those in the ‘30%’.

After our match against Switzerland, UEFA and other stakeholders (including local authorities) will enter dialogue over the final allocation and buffer zones.

This means that some additional tickets, in each category, may be added to the sale after we have conducted our ballots. However, It could also be the case that very few to no additional tickets are added.

With this in mind, we expect the sale to take place on Monday 8 July 2024.

We anticipate being able to send every member, who initially registered their interest and was in the Top 70%, and then those who become successful in the 20/10% ballot, an access code tomorrow (Sunday) evening. This access code will become active during a designated Sale Window (see below).

The Sale Window you are in will be dictated by the number of tickets in each category and the number of caps you had in the initial ballot.

The caps total you were on when the initial ballot took place will be outlined to you in the ballot result email.

Wheelchair and Easy Access/Accessible Members:

We had our Wheelchair and Easy Access/Accessible minimum allocations for all knockout stages confirmed to us before we announced the ballot results. Any member who registered in either of these categories will be able to see their ballot result by re-checking the email.

This email was sent on Tuesday 12 December 2023 with the subject 'UEFA EURO 2024 Germany Ballot Results'.

Therefore, if you were successful, you will receive an access code for any potential sale at the same time as everyone.

At present, we do not expect to receive any additional tickets in these categories but we will endeavour to obtain more to meet the demand.

Sale Windows will be as follows on Monday 8 July 2024:

- Please be aware that the timings may differ from previous sale windows
- Information stated in UK Time
-The same ballot rules will apply as they did for the group stages
- Information subject to change

Top 70%: (we can confirm at this stage that we will receive enough Fans First and Category 3 tickets to cover the top 70%)

Sale Window 1: 7am until 10.30am (guaranteed Fans First / any Category)

Sale Window 2: 11am until 1.30pm (guaranteed Category 3)

30% Ballot (made up of the 20% and 10% ballot rule):

Sale Window 3 (20%): 2pm until 4pm (guaranteed a ticket from remaining Categories)

Sale Window 4 (10%): 4:30pm until 6pm (guaranteed a ticket from remaining Categories, however, may include Restricted View tickets)

Once your access code is active, you will be able to access the sale until it is sold out.

All members entered into Sale Windows 1,2,3 and 4 will be guaranteed a ticket. If you miss your Sale Window, your preferred category may no longer be available.

As per our Sale Guidance, please be aware that you must be at least 18 years old to purchase tickets from UEFA. Minors cannot create an account and purchase tickets, but they can attend the match as guests of the adult ticket purchaser. If the adult and U18 member are successful in different Sale Windows, you will need to wait for their Sale Window in order to purchase both tickets. If you choose to purchase your ticket in an earlier window, as per UEFA's rules you will be unable to purchase the U18's ticket as a single ticket order later on.

If you have a friend or family member who is successful in a separate Sale Window, but want to ensure you secure your preferred category, we would advise buying your ticket as soon as possible. If they end up obtaining a ticket in the same category as you, you will then be able to link orders via UEFA's website. However, please bear in mind this does not guarantee you will be sat together. If you wish to be sat together, we would advise purchasing all tickets in a single grouped order (up to 4).

All remaining 2022-2024 ESTC members who initially registered but were made unsuccessful:

Sale Window 5: 6:30pm until 8:30pm or sold out (ticket not guaranteed).

You will only be able to access Sale Windows 5 if you were a 2022-2024 ESTC member who initially registered. We expect demand to be much higher for this match from those who registered their interest hence why we are operating Sale Window 5 for this group only.

All remaining 2022-2024 ESTC members who did not initially register:

Sale Window 6: 9pm until 10pm or sold out (any remaining tickets, on a first come, first served basis). Tickets are not guaranteed.

You will only receive an access code if tickets are still available at this point.

We understand that these sale windows will be short and would suggest that if you are unable to be online within the above stated timelines, that you ask a member of your travelling group, or a family member, to log in and purchase on your behalf.

They would need to log in using your details. They will also need your access code.

We would strongly suggest re-familiarising yourselves with the sale guidance before any potential KO stage sale to avoid making an error or putting your order in jeopardy. You can review this information here
