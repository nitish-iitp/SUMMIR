Argentina and Chile lock horns in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers

Argentina will welcome Chile to Estadio Mâs Monumental in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers on Thursday. The hosts are at the top of the CONMEBOL qualifying standings and La Roja are in eighth place in the table with just one win in six games.

La Albiceleste will play for the first time since their Copa America triumph in July and will look to continue their winning run in this match. They have a 100% record in all competitions in 2024 and in their previous World Cup qualifying match, they registered a 1-0 away win over Brazil. Nicolás Otamendi scored the game's only goal with Giovani Lo Celso picking up the assist.

Chile were eliminated from the group stage of the Copa America, failing to score in three games. They have won just two of their last nine games in all competitions with both wins coming in friendlies. They suffered a 1-0 away loss to Ecuador in their last World Cup qualifying match.

Argentina vs Chile Prediction

La Albiceleste are on an 11-game winning streak in all competitions, keeping eight clean sheets. They have an unbeaten home record against La Roja in all competitions, though the last two home meetings have ended in draws.

Lionel Scaloni has a few key absentees for the ongoing international break as Lionel Messi misses out due to an injury, while Nicolás Tagliafico and Leonardo Balerdi also dropped out from the squad. Ángel Di María retired after the Copa America and will be honored before the match.

La Roja have been in poor touch in the World Cup qualifiers with just one win in six games. They have failed to score in four games in that period which is a cause for concern. They have suffered four consecutive losses in away games in the qualifiers and will look to improve upon that record.

Claudio Bravo announced his retirement from international football last week and is not in the squad. Alexis Sánchez and Diego Valdez will also play no part in the match due to their injuries.

Considering the current form of the two teams and home advantage for the Copa America 2024 champions, the home team should be able to eke out a narrow win.

Prediction: Argentina 2-1 Chile
