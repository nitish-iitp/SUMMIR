Cameroon vs Guinea LIVE!

Cameroon could not get the better of 10-man Guinea in a rather flat start to their latest Africa Cup of Nations campaign. The five-time winners, beaten as hosts on penalties in the semi-finals last time around, fell behind to an early Mohamed Bayo strike in Monday evening's second Group C - AKA the 'Group of Death' - clash in Yamoussoukro.

The Indomitable Lions failed to register a single shot on target in the first half, but got a boost before the break when Guinea's stand-in captain Francois Kamano saw his yellow card for standing on the back of Frank Magri upgraded to red after the referee was told to consult the pitchside monitor by VAR.

Cameroon got their equaliser shortly after the break when Magri headed in an excellent Georges-Kevin Nkoudou cross from close range, but failed to make their numerical advantage count thereafter ahead of Friday' key showdown with defending champions Senegal.

Match report

Cameroon were unable to defeat 10-man Guinea in a frustrating start to their Africa Cup of Nations campaign.

The Indomitable Lions had Frank Magri to thank for ensuring they took a point from their Group C opener in Yamoussoukro on Monday evening, with the Toulouse forward heading in Georges-Kevin Nkoudou's delightful deep left-wing cross from close range early in the second half.

Guinea had earlier gone ahead inside just 10 minutes through Mohamed Bayo, who slotted low beyond Fabrice Ondoa at the second attempt after fierce pressing to force a costly error from Olivier Kemen on the edge of his own box.

Cameroon appealed for a foul that never came after an initial strong save from Ondoa - cousin of Andre Onana, who was not in the squad after his late arrival from Manchester United was further delayed by travel chaos - to deny Bayo and a huge challenge from Harold Moukoudi on Ilaix Moriba.

94 mins: Guinea understandably haven't shown much by way of attacking ambition with 10 men in this second half.

But they do get forward in stoppage time, with Ilaix Moriba firing a low effort well wide.

Two touches from Toko Ekambi to get away from his marker and rifle a shot on target after a deflected cross from the byline fell his way.

81 mins: Cameroon press on once more, earning another corner that is scrambled clear.

This is an impressive rearguard effort from undermanned Guinea just at the moment. Can the 10 men hold out?

77 mins: That's a real chance for a second Cameroon goal as a delicious deep cross from the right from Jean-Charles Castelletto is glanced wide off the head of Nkoudou, who had the beating of his marker.
