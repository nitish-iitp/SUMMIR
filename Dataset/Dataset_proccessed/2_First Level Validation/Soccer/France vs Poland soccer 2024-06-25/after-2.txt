There was the moment of unbridled joy Kylian Mbappé had presumably visualised in recent days: whipping off his black mask and celebrating in front of thousands of France supporters daubed if not decked out in tricolour in the imposing, iconic Südtribüne. He struck a nerveless second-half penalty to register his first goal at a European Championship and relieve France’s goal­scoring frustrations – but by the end of a stodgy team performance he cut a contrasting figure, fidgeting with the mechanics of his mask in sticky heat, wiping the sweat clear with a towel.

Mbappé was comfortably the most dangerous player on the pitch – he had six shots, five on target – but the bad news for France was there was another returning forward in the shape of Robert Lewandowski, who secured an unlikely point, also ­scoring from the spot.

It was a damaging goal that had ramifications, with Austria ­beating France to top spot in Group D, m­eaning Didier Deschamps’s team find themselves surrounded by ­stellar company; France are in the same ­lopsided half of the draw as Germany, Portugal and Spain and will face the runners-up of Group E – possibly Belgium – in Düsseldorf next Monday. Few would have predicted France, favourites at the outset, would head into the last 16 fuelled by an own goal and a penalty.

On another day Mbappé could have left with the match ball. In the first half there was a sidefoot effort after latching on to a neat backheel by the tricky France debutant ­Bradley Barcola, kept out by the Poland goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski, and in the second he sent a devious, dipping shot narrowly wide.

France’s lack of goals has gnawed at Deschamps throughout the tournament and Mbappé, Ousmane ­Dembélé and Theo Hernández could count themselves irritated at the ­display of Poland’s reserve goalkeeper, who was preferred to Wojciech Szczesny.

Lewandowski, Poland’s captain, who scored 74 goals for Borussia Dortmund, many of them here, had to retake his penalty after the France goalkeeper Mike Maignan jumped from his line prematurely to save his effort. In scorching heat ­Lewandowski stayed cool to repeat the same staggered run-up, ­waiting for Maignan to blink first, and squeezed his shot into the same corner, clinking his penalty off a post. Mbappé moved towards the touchline to ask questions of the fourth official, Rade Obrenovic, about the legitimacy of Lewandowski’s ­second effort. Deschamps had no complaints afterwards.

In the buildup Deschamps’s ­Polish counterpart, Michal Probierz, described the France manager as a professor but Deschamps grew irked as his side struggled to breach a stubborn defence. He knew the chances were totting up for France and by half-time they had registered eight shots, four on target. It all felt a bit mad professor when Deschamps scratched his head furiously after the 33-year-old Skorupski thwarted Mbappé for the first time after a slick give-and-go with Barcola.

Given the hype and hysteria, perhaps it was inevitable Mbappé would ease any concerns. Until then, it seemed France really did have a goalscoring problem as the chances came and went. Then ­Dembélé powered into the box and was chopped by Jakub Kiwior, pre­senting Mbappé with the chance to dispatch the spot-kick. The cele­brations were low-key but telling, Adrien Rabiot and Mbappé among those to high‑five Dembélé. France needed this moment and it was one Mbappé understandably savoured, ripping off his mask to get a proper look at the dancing fans.

Deschamps clearly felt he could begin to freshen things up with one eye on the last 16. Antoine ­Griezmann, Edouard Camavinga and Olivier ­Giroud entered just after the hour and it seemed France had finally hurdled the awkward bit of this contest. Piotr Zielinski had provided the game’s first shot on six minutes, Kacper Urbanski was allowed a free strike in the box and an unmarked Lewandowski also headed wide but all of those efforts arrived before the 35th minute and a rousing comeback seemed unlikely.

Poland were eliminated last week so surely they were dead and buried? France appeared guilty of rushing to that conclusion. ­Lewandowski sent a dipping effort wide on 72 ­minutes and then Dayot Upamecano’s clumsy challenge on Karol ­Swiderski ­presented Lewandowski with the chance to level from the spot after a VAR review. Seconds earlier Mbappé fluffed his lines, sending a weak shot at goal at the end of a counterattack.

Now the ball was on the spot in the opposition box. Maignan saved low to his right but the referee, Marco Guida, ordered the retake. After scoring Lewandowski was suddenly on the rampage, overwhelming defenders. The same cannot be said for France. At least not yet.
