How Spain could line up against Colombia

Spain head coach Luis de la Fuente is expected to name a strong starting XI for Friday's international friendly with Colombia at the London Stadium.

There are three uncapped players in the squad - Real Sociedad's Alex Remiro, Athletic Bilbao's Dani Vivian and Barcelona's Pau Cubarsi - and the trio will be hoping to be involved over the international break.

Cubarsi, 17, has become a vital player for Barcelona this year, but he is not expected to be in the starting XI on Friday, with Robin Le Normand likely to be joined by Aymeric Laporte in the middle.

Alejandro Grimaldo could win just his second Spain cap as a starter at left-back, while Mikel Merino could be given the nod in central midfield alongside Fabian Ruiz and Rodri.

Alex Baena has one goal in one cap for Spain and is another option, while Martin Zubimendi and Oihan Sancet have also been selected in the midfield department.

Alvaro Morata, who has 34 goals for Spain, is the captain and is set to lead the line, with Dani Olmo and Nico Williams potentially operating in the two wide positions.

De la Fuente has a whole host of options in the final third of the field, though, with Pablo Sarabia, Mikel Oyarzabal, Gerard Moreno, Joselu and Lamine Yamal also in the squad.

Spain possible starting lineup: Simon; Carvajal, Le Normand, Laporte, Grimaldo; Merino, Rodri, Ruiz; Olmo, Morata, N Williams
