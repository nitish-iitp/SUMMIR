JAKARTA, KOMPAS - The Indonesian National Team has penetrated Asia's elite level after securing a place in the third round 2026 World Cup Qualification. The 2-0 victory over the Philippines, Tuesday (11/6/2024) evening, at the Gelora Bung Karno Utama Stadium, Jakarta, helped "Garuda" complete the two quotas from Group F to advance to the next round involving the 18 best teams from the Asian zone.

A goal contribution from the flamboyant midfielder, Thom Haye, with a long-range shot in the 32nd minute was enough to get Indonesia through to the third round. That was Thom's debut goal in the four matches he played in the Garuda uniform.

"The players showed their hard work, allowing us to make new history by advancing to the third round. This team is getting better. I will prepare the team as best as possible to compete in the next round," said Indonesian Coach Shin Tae-yong after the match.

When the second half had only been running for 11 minutes, the central defender, Rizky Ridho, doubled the lead thanks to a header using Nathan Tjoe-A-On's free kick. The SUGBK Tribune, filled with 64,942 spectators, roared to welcome Ridho's goal.

Indonesian national team midfielder, Thom Haye, celebrated his goal against the Philippines in the 2026 World Cup Qualifiers for the Asia Zone Group F at the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium in Jakarta on Tuesday (11/6/2024). Indonesia's first goal came from Haye's long-range shot in the 32nd minute.

With that result, Indonesia collected 10 points from six matches. Shin Tae-yong's team sits in second place behind Iraq, who have performed perfectly in their five matches in Group F. Iraq will play their final second-round match against Vietnam at the Basra International Stadium on Wednesday (12/6/2024) early morning WIB.

We are the weakest team in the third round. But, I won't give up.

Advancing to the third round also makes Indonesia eligible to join the ranks of Asia's elite national teams. Out of the 46 national teams competing in the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) zone, a total of 18 top Asian teams will have the opportunity to compete for the six initial tickets for Asian representatives to the 2026 World Cup.

The draw for the group stage of the third round will be held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on June 27. In order to bring fair competition, the AFC will divide the three groups consisting of six teams each, based on the latest FIFA rankings and performance in the second round.

It is not surprising that Indonesia will be in the last pot of the draw for the third round. "Garuda" has the opportunity to meet two of the six teams that represented Asia in the last two editions of the World Cup, namely Japan, South Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Qatar.

Thom expressed a very special feeling of being able to score a goal in front of Indonesian supporters and his family. He is not afraid of Indonesia's chances of facing tough Asian teams.

"I can't wait to meet the next opponent in the next round. We have sent a message in the match against Iraq that we are stronger than before," said Thom.

Shin emphasized that the match in the third round will not be easy. "We are the weakest team in the third round. But, I will not give up," he said.

Indonesia national team player Calvin Verdonk suffered an injury during the 2026 World Cup Qualifiers for the Asia zone match at the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium in Jakarta on Tuesday (11/6/2024).

Apart from Indonesia, three other teams also secured their places in the third round. They are North Korea (Group B), China (Group C), and Kyrgyzstan (Group D). The final spot is contested by two representatives from Group A, Afghanistan and India. The final match between the two teams ended early Wednesday morning Indonesian time.

With 17 teams already securing their spots in the third round until Tuesday night, Indonesia is confirmed as the only representative from Southeast Asia in that round. Thailand was eliminated due to a record of losing to China, while Malaysia failed to compete with Kyrgyzstan.

Total domination

Shin made three substitutions compared to the match against Iraq. The position of Jordi Amat, who was absent due to a red card, was replaced by Jay Idzes. Asnawi Mangkualam and Calvin Verdonk played their first match, replacing Sandy Walsh and Shayne Pattynama. The initial formation of 3-4-3 remained Shin's main choice.

Since the beginning of the first half, Indonesia has dominated ball possession. The Philippines' pattern of applying a low defensive block helped the Garuda squad comfortably play the ball up to the midfield line. Entering the middle third of the field, Indonesia's central midfielder duo, Thom and Nathan, have a big role in determining their attacking position.

Supporters are giving their support to the Indonesian National Team during the 2026 World Cup Qualifiers in the Asian Zone held at the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium, Jakarta, on Tuesday (11/6/2024).

The domination of Indonesia's attacks comes from both wings. Asnawi is assisted by Marselino on the right, while Calvin collaborates with Nathan to create attacks from the left side. Meanwhile, Ragnar Oratmangoen and Rafael Struick are more dominant in moving in the center and the Philippine penalty box.

Apart from that, Indonesia applied high-pressing from the Philippines penalty box. Rafael, Ragnar and Marselino did not stop pressing the Filipino defenders who were trying to build attacks from below. This pattern meant that the Philippines were never able to control the ball for more than 40 seconds.

The game strategy was successful, leading to Thom's first goal. The 29 year old player only needed four seconds from a turnover or snatching the ball from a Filipino player to hit the net of the Filipino goalkeeper from Persib Bandung, Kevin Ray Mendoza.

In the second half, the Philippines increased their pressure by using a high block. However, this game pattern only lasted until the 60th minute as the physical condition of the Filipino players began to decline. After an hour of the match, the pressure from the Philippines in Indonesia's defense zone weakened.

Coach Shin Tae-yong stands together with the players after the victory achieved by the Indonesian National Team in the 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers in the Asian zone at the Bung Karno Main Stadium, Jakarta on Tuesday (11/6/2024).

Another change in tactics was attempted by Philippine Coach Tom Saintfeit by instructing his players to be more courageous in controlling the ball and to quickly move it to Indonesia's final third. This temporarily increased the Philippine's ball possession duration to 91 seconds in the 51st minute.

Despite this, the "Azkals" still failed to make a single shot on target towards the Indonesian goal. The Philippines produced seven shots, the majority of which were taken from outside the Indonesian penalty box.

Overall, Indonesia collected 54 percent possession of the ball with 20 shots. Seven of them hit the target. In addition to Ridho's goal, Garuda also created opportunities through Jay's header that hit the post in the 71st minute.

"We tried to change the game and be more dominant in the second half. However, we failed to create good opportunities. In addition, Indonesia's second goal is very regrettable, so I am disappointed with our performance," said Saintfeit.
