This defeat now means Scotland haven’t tasted victory in any of their last eight competitive fixtures. That’s the longest non-winning streak in their history. Before that, they’d won 15 of their previous 18 competitive matches. Talk about going from feast to famine. “At least Scotland didn’t concede after the 90th minute, like they did against Germany, Hungary and Poland,” notes a chipper Simon McMahon, who may or may not be viewing tonight’s result through the base of a tumbler that once contained a ball of malt. “Always look for the positives, eh?”

Another game, another late blow for Scotland. Once again they played well in patches – and Scott McTominay’s opener was superb – but defensive lapses did for them. Thing is, even though Angus Gunn should have saved Bruno Fernandes’s equaliser, he was otherwise Scotland’s man of the match, making three outrageous saves among a series of other fine stops and interventions. So Scotland can’t say that the winner, late though it was, hadn’t been coming. Portugal deserved their victory on the balance of play and sheer number of chances created. Without Gunn’s heroics, the hosts would have had at least a couple more.

In the other game in A1, Croatia have beaten Poland 1-0 thanks to a 52nd-minute Luka Modrić goal. All of which means the table looks like this …

Portugal P2 W2 D0 L0 F4 A2 Pts 6

Croatia P2 W1 D0 L1 F2 A2 Pts 3

Poland P2 W1 D0 L1 F3 A3 Pts 3

Scotland P2 W0 D0 L2 F3 A5 Pts 0

… leaving Scotland in all sorts of bother.

FULL TIME: Portugal 2-1 Scotland

Some eejit comes racing onto the pitch in the hope of meeting Ronaldo, and is bundled off to the cells. Then the whistle goes, and Ronaldo celebrates. More disappointment for Scotland after another semi-promising showing.

21.40 BST

90 min +4: Morgan picks out McTominay on the edge of the Portugal box. McTominay’s shot is deflected out for a corner, the ball ushered out by Morgan … who is then flagged offside. So no corner for Scotland, and no late reprieve.

Share

21.38 BST

90 min +2: Doak tries to skedaddle down the left, but who’s that tracking back? Ronaldo, that’s who. Strange the boost of energy scoring one’s 901st goal gives you.

Share

21.36 BST

90 min +1: The first of five additional minutes sees McGinn replaced by Doak.

90 min: Scotland win a corner down the left. Gilmour takes, but Scotland push and shove too eagerly in the box and the whistle goes.

21.35 BST

89 min: McKenna was snoozing a bit there. Then again, it was a vicious cross along the corridor of uncertainty.

GOAL! Portugal 2-1 Scotland (Ronaldo 88)

Yeah, well, to be fair, this had been coming. Nuno Mendes crosses from the left. Jota extends a leg but misses the ball. Ronaldo, just behind him, doesn’t. He taps home, and it’s more late heartbreak for Scotland.

87 min: Morgan replaces Christie.

85 min: Ralston is booked for time-wasting as Portugal continue to push Scotland back. The visitors really clinging on here. But those two saves by Gunn: wow! A huge strong hand to stop Felix’s header, then a last-ditch scoop off the line to deny Felix bundling Ronaldo’s header into the net.

8 Sept 2024
21.31 BST

83 min: Portugal immediately come again, and Ronaldo, found free six yards out by Fernandes’s scooped pass, aims a header towards the left-hand side of the net … and off the inside of the post! Felix should bundle home, but hesitates, and Gunn flaps away. What a save! Again!

Share
8 Sept 2024
21.30 BST

82 min: Dalot twists Robertson down the right and cuts back for Felix, whose diving header towards the bottom right is brilliantly parried by Gunn. The ball squirts right for Ronaldo, who hits the post!

21.26 BST

80 min: Fernandes is booked for flapping his gums at the referee, having just fouled McGinn. He keeps on going, too, but eventually calms down before talking himself into serious trouble.

79 min: That was a gorgeous move by Portugal, though, and came about because Scotland started sitting back again, like they did at the start of the half. And look how that ended up.

21.24 BST

78 min: Portugal open Scotland up with some pretty triangles down the inside-left channel. Ronaldo’s back-heel finds Felix free. He’s one on one with Gunn and looks for the bottom right. Gunn sticks out a leg and blocks brilliantly. That’s made up for the mistake he made for the equaliser. The keeper back in credit tonight!

76 min: Nélson Semedo is replaced by Diogo Dalot.

21.19 BST

74 min: McLean goes down and requires some treatment. Ronaldo suggests some time-wasting is going on. Robertson has his say too, and the referee tells them both to zip it. McLean can’t continue, though, and is replaced by Gauld, while Conway comes on for Dykes.

Share
8 Sept 2024
21.18 BST

72 min: The crowd give Gunn the what-for as he takes an age over distributing the ball. Scotland are doing a good job of frustrating Portugal, who were flying during the moments leading up to their goal, but have been strangely subdued since.

Share

21.16 BST

70 min: Scotland are back in this game. McTominay and Ralston battle down the right to win a corner. The set piece is only half cleared. Ralston meets it on the edge of the D, but blazes wildly over, and in any case McKenna had clattered Costa so the whistle goes to release the pressure on the hosts.

21.14 BST

68 min: Rúben Neves is booked for a clip on McGinn. Then Portugal make a double change, swapping out Bernardo Silva and Rafael Leão for João Félix and João Neves.

21.13 BST

66 min: McTominay has a dig from distance. Diogo Costa claims easily enough. Portugal counter, Diogo Jota dribbling into the box and going over, but Gunn, spread at his feet, didn’t touch him. A quick VAR check confirms.

65 min: A bigger penalty shout by Scotland this time, as McTominay’s shot from a tight angle on the right is blocked. Christie picks up the rebound and slams the ball goalwards. It pings off António Silva’s chest and then caroms off Nélson Semedo. Did it hit an arm? Scotland say yes. Referee and VAR say no. The replays favour the latter.

64 min: Scotland win a corner down the right. They do nothing with it, but this is much better: they’ve responded well to conceding the equaliser.

21.09 BST

63 min: Robertson slips a diagonal pass infield from the left for Gilmour, who tries to break into the box but falls and surfs the turf on the old nips. The crowd scream for a penalty, with António Silva right behind him, but Silva nicked the ball and there wasn’t much contact anyway. Gilmour doesn’t claim, which speaks volumes.

21.08 BST

61 min: Some medical attention for the poor referee, who has run slap-bang into Hanley and taken a whack upside the head. An ice cube is pressed on his temple. He’s fine to continue.

21.06 BST

60 min: … so having said that, McGinn shows in attack on the left and is brought down by Nélson Semedo. Gilmour floats the free kick into the Portugal box, and though the ball pinballs around, it doesn’t drop to Scottish feet.

59 min: “Nice to see Scotland giving the grass a chance to recover at the other end of the pitch,” notes a tinder-dry Jake Robertson. Scotland had some sort of threat on the counter during the first half. Now they’re offering nothing. Time for Ben Doak, perhaps?

21.03 BST

57 min: Ronaldo sashays in from the right and aims for the top left. He finds the top left of the stand behind the goal. “I reckon your empty half-time postbag is a timing-of-the-game thing,” begins Scott Blair. “I want to stress unreservedly, and without fear of let or hindrance, that I am not a stereotypical Scottish person. However, when this game kicked off I had just about dealt with my hangover from Saturday, and I’m working on Monday. It’s simply not natural.”

21.01 BST

56 min: To be fair, Fernandes did give that a good whack, but you’d still expect your keeper to parry or turn the ball around the post. A shame for Gunn, who made a couple of fine stops in the first half.

GOAL! Portugal 1-1 Scotland (Fernandes 54)

This had been coming. A cutback from the left by Leão. From the edge of the D, Fernandes hits a first-time shot towards the bottom right. Gunn should save but his hand isn’t strong this time, and the shot squeaks into the corner.

53 min: Ronaldo claims a tug on the jersey by McKenna, but the referee’s not interested. Portugal come again, and Fernandes crosses dangerously from the right. Gunn punches clear confidently, but the hosts have started the second half as they finished the first: pinning Scotland back.

52 min: Ronaldo makes a run down the right. Danger here, but he flashes his shot into the side netting.

20.57 BST

51 min: Robertson goes in late on Rúben Neves, half tackle, half slip. It didn’t look deliberate, but it was clumsy. A yellow card, and there’s no argument from Scotland’s captain, who apologises.

49 min: Scotland continue to sit deep. The away supporters entertain themselves with a loud version of Flower of Scotland. They give it laldie. Always enjoy yourself when the going is good.

20.53 BST

47 min: Portugal are immediately on the front foot. Nélson Semedo and Jota combine down the right but can’t get the better of McGinn and Gilmour. António Silva then dribbles dangerously down the inside-left channel, but runs out of space in the Scottish box.

Portgual get the second half underway, having made two changes. Cristiano Ronaldo and Rúben Neves come on for João Palhinha and Pedro Neto.

Our half-time postbag isn’t exactly bulging at the seams, but here it is anyway. “Good to have the jaws of victory stretched open and wide for inspection by Scotspeople everywhere, before the inevitable snatching arrives. McTominay’s fine goal has made those teeth shine brighter, while it lasts” – Justin Kavanagh

HALF TIME: Portugal 0-1 Scotland

Of all footballing nations on earth, Scotland know not to count their chickens. And yet it should still be acceptable to say the following: well, well, well.

45 min: There will be one additional first-half minute.

44 min: Leao has the chance to tee up Neto, but opts to drag a shot wide left. Neto is not happy.

20.32 BST

43 min: Bernardo Silva jinks and spins elegantly down the left and chips a cross into the middle. Scotland half clear, but the ball drops to Fernandes on the edge of the D. He absolutely blooters a volley goalwards, but McKenna takes it flush in the chest to stop what would have been almost certainly a spectacular goal. What bravery!

20.29 BST

41 min: Leão has been torturing Ralston, so Christie comes across to help this time. The plan works, too, with Leão clumsily running the ball out of play after finding there’s no opportunity to cross.

20.27 BST

39 min: Christie is booked for upending an in-flight Nuno Mendes. As tackles from behind go, you can’t get much more agricultural, and there are no arguments. “This is just the same hope/disappointment cycle stretched out longer,” suggests James Humphries. “Though to be fair, losing at home to Poland then somehow mugging Portugal away (to, inevitably, miss out by one or two points in the end) would be Peak Scotland.”
