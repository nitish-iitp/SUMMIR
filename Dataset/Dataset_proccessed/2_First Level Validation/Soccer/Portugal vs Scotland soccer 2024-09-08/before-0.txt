Cristiano Ronaldo and his inclusion in Portugal’s eleven and squad is a hot topic of debate but he scored as Portugal defeated Croatia by two goals to one the other day, whilst Scotland suffered another late, gut-wrenching loss at Hampden Park.

PORTUGAL PREVIEW: A NEW ERA FOR ROBERTO MARTINEZ

Roberto Martinez is in charge of another so-called European ‘golden generation’ and Portugal were extremely underwhelming at UEFA EURO 2024 as they went out in the quarter-finals on penalties against France.

The Portuguese enjoyed a very strong first 12 months under the former Wigan Athletic boss but performances have been shaky and inconsistent throughout the calendar year of 2024 so a strong UEFA Nations League campaign is required.

SCOTLAND PREVIEW: SORRY SCOTS

Steve Clarke remains in charge of the Scottish national side after qualifying for back-to-back UEFA European Championships but Scotland have been poor at both tournaments, collecting just two points from six matches and being knocked out in the group stages twice.

They head into the 2024/25 UEFA Nations League having gained promotion from League B but with Clarke desperate results, losing 3-2 in what is, on paper, their easiest game with a 97th minute penalty, he is under immense pressure now.

PORTUGAL TEAM NEWS: CR7’S IMPORTANCE

As mentioned, the topic and debate around Cristiano Ronaldo’s inclusion in the Portugal eleven and squad. The 39-year-old Al Nassr forward is expected to start once again, though, after he got himself another goal against Croatia the other day.

PREDICTED XI (4-3-3): Costa; Diogo Dalot, Dias, Inacio, Mendes; Silva, Vitinha, Fernandes; Neto, Cristiano Ronaldo, Leao

SCOTLAND TEAM NEWS: LIKELY TO BE UNCHANGED

Steve Clarke has been wedded to a back three with wing-backs as Scotland boss but he changed to a 4-2-3-1 the other day due to defensive injuries including Aaron Hickey, Nathan Patterson and Kieran Tierney

PREDICTED XI (4-2-3-1): Gunn; Ralston, Hanley, McKenna, Robertson; Gilmour, McLean; McGinn, McTominay, Christie; Dykes

PORTUGAL VS SCOTLAND PREDICTION

Portugal still have an abundance of attacking talent and a front six that includes Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo, Bernardo Silva, Rafael Leao and Pedro Neto has the ability to outscore pretty much any team in Europe. They face a Scotland side that are adapting to a new system and showed some positive signs against Poland but remain generally weak. Portugal should win this one quite comfortably.
