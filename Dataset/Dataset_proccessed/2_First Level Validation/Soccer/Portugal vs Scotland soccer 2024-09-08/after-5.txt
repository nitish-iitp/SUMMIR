Substitute Cristiano Ronaldo struck a late winner as Portugal came from a goal down to beat Scotland 2-1 to continue their strong start to the Nations League on Sunday.

After Bruno Fernandes had fired in Portugal's equaliser, Ronaldo pounced in the 88th minute for his 901st career goal.

Scotland were given hope of a first win against Portugal since 1980 as they were given a shock early lead with Scott McTominay's bullet header in the seventh minute.

The visitors repelled a Portuguese barrage before halftime but Fernandes finally got Portugal's equaliser with a well-struck 54th-minute shot from the edge of the area that Scotland keeper Angus Gunn could not keep out.

Ronaldo, who came on for the second half, hit the post late on with a header but made no mistake when he got on the end of a low Nuno Mendes cross.

Portugal lead Group A1 with six points after they also beat Croatia in their opening match. Scotland have suffered two defeats, both of them to late goals.
