Portugal vs Scotland Prediction & Betting tips

On Sunday evening at 19:45, the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Benfica’s arena, will host the match between Portugal and Scotland, a match from the 2nd round of the UEFA Nations League. The two teams are in League A, Group 1, along with Poland and Croatia. The most recent direct confrontation took place six years ago, in a friendly match where many Portuguese stars were absent, led by Cristiano Ronaldo, which Portugal won 3-1.

Portugal:

Portugal started with a victory in this new edition of the UEFA Nations League, 2-1 at home against Croatia, a match in which Cristiano Ronaldo scored the 900th goal of his career. Portugal managed to win the very first edition of the UEFA Nations League after winning 1-0 against the Netherlands in the final. Portugal also participated in Euro 2024 this summer, but was eliminated by France in the quarter-finals after penalty kicks. Considering the opponents it has in this UEFA Nations League group, Portugal is the favorite for first place.

Scotland:

The Scottish national team is going through a bad period after in the last 13 games it recorded only one victory, 2-0 at home against Gibraltar, in a friendly match played before Euro 2024. Exactly one year has passed since Scotland’s last victory in – an official match, 3-0 away to Cyprus, in the Euro 2024 preliminaries. Scotland plays for the first time in League A of the UEFA Nations League and in the first match lost spectacularly 2-3 at home to Poland, managing to come back at a given moment in the second half from 0-2, but Poland gave the decisive blow in the 97th minute.
