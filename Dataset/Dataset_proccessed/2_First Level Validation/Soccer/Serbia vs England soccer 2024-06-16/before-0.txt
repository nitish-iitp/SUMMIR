Serbia vs England EURO 2024

Sunday brings another three games from the Euro 2024 schedule, and followers have some important games to watch. England reached the final of Euro 2020, losing to Italy at Wembley in a tense penalty shootout that was cruel to the Three Lions and its supporters. Manager Gareth Southgate has carefully assembled a team he believes is good enough to go one better this summer and finally lift the UEFA European Championship crown. Will they live up to expectations?

Serbia provides the opposition for England’s first game at Euro 2024 and knows they face a tough challenge in denying their rivals the three points. Team Serbia has flown under the radar with all the attention on England, allowing the Serbs to prepare in peace. The Serbs are underdogs, but football fans know they’re also dangerous and shouldn’t be taken lightly during the Group C campaign.

Serbia arrives in Germany following less-than-impressive preparation. They beat Lithuania, Montenegro, and Cyprus in recent games but were the favourites to beat those opponents and did little more than expected. Serbia also drew 2-2 with Bulgaria and lost to Austria, Russia, Belgium, and Hungary. Confidence is low in the camp, but they must dust themselves down and prepare for a crucial game against England.

Serbia warmed up with an impressive 3-0 win over Sweden last Saturday with goals from Savic, Mitrovic, and Tadic. That was their second clean sheet in three games, and they arrived with a clean bill of health.

England qualified for Euro 2024 from Group C with their stats showing six wins and two draws from eight outings, with 22 goals scored and only four conceded. It was an impressive effort from the Three Lions but everyone connected to the team knows the hard work starts now.

England has impressed many times in qualifying for major competitions but rarely lives up to expectations at the main event. Will they build on the success of Euro 2020 and finally get their hands on this trophy? Fans certainly hope so, and they’ll be eager to see their team get off to a winning start.

England lost 1-0 to Iceland last Friday and must improve. John Stones returns for England, meaning Southgate has a strong squad to choose from for their opening game.

Serbia vs England H2H Record and Key Numbers

The head-to-head stats show Serbia and England have never met in competitive action, meaning followers also enjoy a little slice of sporting history. The game gives both the Serbians and the English a golden opportunity to bag three points in their first group game and also edge in front of the head-to-head stats.

Possible Lineups
Serbia (4-2-3-1): V. Milinković-Savić – Milenković, Veljković, Pavlović; Živković – S. Milinković-Savić, Lukić – Kostić, Tadić, Mitrović – Vlahović
England (4-2-3-1): Pickford – Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier – Alexander-Arnold, Rice – Saka, Bellingham, Foden – Kane
Where to Watch Serbia vs England Euro 2024 – TV and Online Live Streaming

If you can’t make it to the venue or you weren’t one of the lucky ones to snag a ticket for England’s opening game of Euro 2024, you can watch the action live on television. The BBC will broadcast all the build-up, game, and post-match analysis, keeping fans up-to-speed on what’s happening in Germany. Fans in Serbia can watch the game live on Arena Sport.

Prediction

I have little to work off in the head-to-head stats, but the form of both teams suggests England should be good enough to win this game and get off to the perfect start. Most pundits expect the Three Lions to win the group, while many predict they’ll go on to lift the trophy for the first time. Their chances remain unclear, but England has the quality and strength to beat Serbia in style and take control of the pool.
