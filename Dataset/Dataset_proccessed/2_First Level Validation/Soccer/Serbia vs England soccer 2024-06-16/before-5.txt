Preview: England are undoubtedly the team to look forward to in Group C as the Euro 2024 takes place in Germany. They earned their best ever finish in the history of the continental competition last time around where they finished as runners up in Euro 2020. They were defeated by eventual champions Italy. They will hope to go one better this time around, and win the trophy for the first time ever in their history. This will also be a fitting trophy and the perfect sendoff for their manager Gareth Southgate whose contract is set to expire after the competition.
However, England have some stiff competition in their group. Denmark will be the favourite to finish in the second position behind the Three Lions. They finished as one of the semi-finalists in the Euro 2020, and have also won the competition back in 1992. Two-time finalists Serbia will also pose a threat, while Slovenia too can spring a surprise with some genuinely good players in their lineup.

Jude Bellingham (England)
Jude Bellingham is coming off a brilliant first season with Real Madrid, where he was one of the chief architects for their triumphs in the La Liga and the UEFA Champions League. He has scored 23 goals and made assists across all competitions, and is a contender for the Ballon d'Or.
