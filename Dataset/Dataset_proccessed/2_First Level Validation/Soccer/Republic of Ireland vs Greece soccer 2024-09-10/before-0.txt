Heimir Hallgrímsson's first international break as Republic of Ireland manager wraps up with the visit of Greece on Tuesday night.

The Icelandic coach is best known for his five-year spell in charge of his national team, which included qualifying for both Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup, and the Irish are hoping he can achieve a similar feat to end their wait for a major tournament.

The Nations League could offer a potential route to the 2026 World Cup, which means the pressure is on Hallgrímsson to make a strong start in the first set of fixtures this autumn.

He could make an early bit of Irish footballing history with a win on Tuesday, as they have never beaten Greece - losing four of their past five meetings.

The visitors are under new management themselves after Ivan Jovanović's summer appointment.
