Ireland 0 Greece 2 – Another bad night on Heimir Hallgrimsson’s second game in charge
Philip Quinn
10/09/2024

For the second time in three days a team in white shirts docked by the Dodder before departing with Nations League plunder.

Greece are not at England’s level but they arrived with more confidence billowing in their sails than a becalmed Ireland, and duly took advantage of sleepy defending to inflict a damaging defeat.

Two losses in two home games is a stinging start for Heimir Hallgrimsson who must somehow arrest a slide that sees Ireland slipping towards relegation.

Any talk of promotion is fanciful.
If Ireland were entitled to some slack for losing to England, who are a far superior unit, there is no reprieve for this defeat, which added to the litany of disasters in this competition.

In 18 games in League B, Ireland’s record is grim: two wins, six draws and ten defeats.

The outcome of games away to Finland next month and home in November will decide whether they avoid the trap-door into League C.

After the partisan passion of a Saturday showdown with top billing, this was an under-card scrap involving teams who ache to be a contender again.

Of late, Greece are headed the right way, having won promotion from the Nations League in 2022, before picking off Ireland twice, and drawing with France in the Euro 2024 qualifiers.

Their play-off slip-up to Georgia on penalties was an uppercut to the jaw they didn’t see coming but Georgia have since shown that was no fluke.

Ireland needed to be wary, but they were caught napping with a giveaway goaI in the 50th minute.
The second, with a few minutes to go was no more than Greece deserved.

They carried a greater attacking thereat while Ireland didn’t force the visiting ‘keeper to make a single save.

When Will Smallbone was announced as Man of the Match, those in the official attendance of 37,274 still in the ground shook their heads. I imagine Smallbone did too.

Ireland are in a bad place right now, devoid in confidence, lacking a goal threat and vulnerable to giving up silly goals as they did here.

Hallgrimsson has a huge job on his hands and the sooner he gets to know his players inside out the better. This weekend he must attend games across the Irish Sea.

While a return to a flat back four was anticipated, the positioning of Andy Omobamidele, a right-sided central defender, at right-back was unexpected.

Matt Doherty was dropped to the bench before replacing Omobamidele with 15 minutes to go
Sammie Szmodics was stationed his own in attack, although Smallbone looked to push up and support when possible. Again, Szmodics was lively but he needed someone with him.

Help arrived on the hour via Evan Ferguson, by which time the Greeks were one up and in control.
The absence of a recognised centre-forward was a first for Ireland for some time, as was the honour of captaincy to Nathan Collins.

At 23, he’s younger than most to be trusted with the responsibility – Robbie Keane was 25 when appointed by Steve Staunton in 2006.

With Coleman turning 36 next month, Collins could be in line to wear the white cloth for some years to come.

It was in this competition that he exploded on to the international stage with a goal of individual brilliance against Ukraine in neutral Lodz in the summer of 2022.

He was eager to show leadership, as he directed traffic, remonstrated with the referee and got forward when the occasion permitted but his role in the first Greek goal was questionable while he finished on his backside for the second.

At times, Ireland were better than they were on Saturday, moving the ball about slickly with Molumby displaying a hitherto unseen side to his game with a couple of superb diagonal balls to Chiedozie Ogbene.

Even so, Caoimhin Kelleher was the busier ‘keeper in the first half. He was relieved in the 11th minute when a free header from Konstantinos Koulierakis clipped the top of the crossbar amid poor Irish marking.

Kelleher then got down smartly to his right to paw away a free kick conceded by Smallbone on just outside the box.

Ireland settled and began to find the range with their passes, although the absence of a target man forced a different approach.

After Molumby found Ogbene o the right wing for the first time, the Irish got bodies into the box and Jason Knight teed up Alan Browne whose shot was defected into the arms of the ‘keeper.

Szmodics then tried an ambitious lob from 40 yards which is the sort of thing an in-form striker takes a gamble on. It didn’t come off but it illustrated his verve and confidence.

Three minutes before the break, Ireland were denied the lead goal by the linesman’s flag.
What a corker it would have been. Ogbene took a touch to cushion Molumby’s cross-field pass and then let rip with a left-foot snorter into the top corner.

The mood of optimism was burst five minutes into the second half. It was a soft goal to cough up.
Ionnadis is the Greek dangerman, fresh from scoring a brace against the Finns on Saturday. Yet, he was allowed pill away from the Irish defenders to receive the ball just outside the ‘D.’

Worse, no one closed him down as he calmly placed a left-footer beyond Kelleher into the top corner. Either Collins or Omobamidele should have rushed out to reduce the angle of attack.

It was the same end goal that Rice and Grealish scored into on Saturday. And the Greeks weren’t finished.

After a late flurry in which substitute Callum Robinson’s first touch saw a shot deflected narrowly wide, Ireland were mugged from a throw-in in the Greek half.

The quick ball to Christos Tzolis was perfect and the winger turned Collins inside out before arrowing a left-footer past Kelleher. It was a second gift for the Greeks who again had Ireland’s measure.

Republic of Ireland: Kelleher; Omobamidele (Doherty 74), Collins, O’Shea, Brady; Ogbene (Robinson 84), Smallbone, Molumby (Ferguson 63), Browne, Knight (McAteer 74); Szmodics (Idah 84)
Greece: Vlachodimos; Rota, Mavropanas, Koulierakis, Tsmiikas; Siopis (Ntoi 88), Bouchalakis (Pelkas 67); Chatzgiovannis (Zafeiris 67), Bakasetas, Tzolis (Vagiannidis 88); Ioannidis (Pavlidis 88). Scorers: Ioannadis 50, Tzolis 87.
Referee: E Eskas (Norway)
