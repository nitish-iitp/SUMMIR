Uruguay meet Paraguay in the World Cup qualifiers

Uruguay will invite Paraguay to Estadio Centenario in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers on Friday. The hosts have won four of their six games in the qualifiers thus far while La Albirroja have just one win in these games.

La Celeste have suffered just one loss in their last nine games in all competitions, with that loss coming against Colombia in the Copa America 2024 semifinals. They finished third in the competition, defeating Canada on penalties in the third-place playoff. They hosted Bolivia in their last World Cup qualifying match in November and a brace from Darwin Núñez helped them to a 3-0 win.

La Albirroja have just one win in six games across all competitions this year. They lost all three games in the group stage of the Copa America, scoring one goal in each loss. They suffered a 1-0 home loss to Colombia in their previous outing in the World Cup qualifiers.

Uruguay vs Paraguay Prediction

La Celeste have won eight of their last 10 games in the World Cup qualifiers, winning their last five home games in the competition, and are strong favorites. They have won four of their last five meetings against the visitors and will look to build on that form.

Marcelo Bielsa has a lengthy absentee list for this match as Matías Viña, Giorgian De Arrascaeta, Nicolás De La Cruz, and Ronald Araujo are injured. Darwin Núñez, Rodrigo Bentancur, Mathías Olivera, and José María Giménez are suspended, alongside Araujo. Luis Suarez will play his final international match of his career here and is expected to lead the lineup.

Los Guaraníes have won just one of their last eight games in all competition, suffering five losses. They have failed to score in their last 10 away games in the World Cup qualifiers, which is a cause for concern, but they will look to make the most of La Celeste's absentees.

Former Ecuador and Costa Rica coach Gustavo Alfaro has been appointed as the team's new manager and has called up a strong squad, headlined by Miguel Almirón.

While the hosts are missing key players in this match, considering their current form in the qualifiers and La Albirroja's poor away record in this fixture, La Celeste should be able to eke out a narrow win.
