Will there be a final performance of Luis?

While today's match is important, all the spotlight will be on Suarez in his last official match with the 'Celeste'. Should he score two goals, he will join Lionel Messi as the all-time top scorer in the South American qualifiers.

Luis Suárez bids farewell to the national team

The 'Pistolero' retires from the Charrua national team after a great career with the sky-blue jersey. He played a total of 142 games, scoring 69 goals and dishing out 29 assists. The best player in Uruguay's history achieved enormous things with his national team, such as that 2010 World Cup in South Africa when they reached the semifinals, as well as winning the 2011 Copa América. 
Suáarez is the second top scorer in the qualifying rounds with 29 goals. In all his World Cups, he participated in 12 goals, with 7 goals and 5 assists. The most memorable is the one he scored against England on June 19, 2014 to stay alive in that dramatic group.  This will be the last time that Luchito will wear the blue and blue jersey and receive the ovation of the Uruguayan people.
