Uganda Cranes moved a step closer to returning to the AFCON Final tournament after a scrappy 1-0 win over neighbors South Sudan under the floodlights of Mandela National Stadium on Friday.

Bevis Mugabi scored the all important goal as Uganda Cranes cruised to maximum points in the Group K of the 2025 Qualification campaign.

It was certainly not the convincing and commanding display Paul Put might have desired from his side.

Alfred Leku nearly punished the Cranes in the 26th minute but his effort was saved by goalkeeper Isima Watenga.

The Cranes did not register a single shot on target in the opening half of the contest.

Two minutes after the recess, Mugabi gave the Cranes the lead off a rebound after South Sudan goalkeeper Juma Jenaro Amuk had saved a header from Jude Semugabi.

Jude Semugabi came close to doubling the lead but was denied by Amuk.

In the final minutes of the game, South Sudan nearly levelled matters but Halid Lwaliwa cleared Paul Pal Puk Kun effort off the goal line.

Denis Omedi also forced the visitors goalkeeper into a save in the last minute of the game.

Results are what matter but performances will need to improve for Put’s side when the two sides face off again in Juba in three days.

Uganda Cranes are currently second in Group K with 7 points and can secure qualification with victory in Juba on Tuesday.

In the other game played in the Group, South Africa beat Congo Brazzaville 5-0 to go top.
