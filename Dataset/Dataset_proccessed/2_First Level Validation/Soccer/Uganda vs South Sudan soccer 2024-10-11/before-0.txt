Federation of Uganda Football Association (FUFA) has been cleared by CAF to use a special badge on the Uganda Cranes match day shirts as celebrations to mark hundred years of the local football governing body continue.

The Uganda Football mother body made a formal request to the continental body to use the logo that was unveiled by the FUFA President Hon. Magogo Moses Hassim during the 100th Ordinary General Assembly on 4th October 2024 at Maya Nature Resort in Wakiso.

The logo will be placed on the front part of the shirts just above the players’ numbers.


It will be between the two logos of FUFA and the kit manufactures Janzi.

According to FUFA Communications Director Ahmed Hussein, the players will wear these special edition jerseys for the entire ongoing qualification campaign of the TotalEnergies AFCON 2025 starting with the match against South Sudan on Friday 11th October 2024.
