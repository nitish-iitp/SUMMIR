Match Report: Bevis Mugabi guides Uganda past South Sudan

2025 AFCON Qualifiers | Result

Uganda 1-0 South Sudan

Bevis Mugabi scored the all-important goal as Uganda Cranes secured a 1-0 victory against South Sudan in the AFCON Qualifiers encounter at Mandela National Stadium, Namboole.

In the game that was played on Friday evening, Uganda Cranes had to dig deep to secure maximum points on the day.

Uganda kicked off on the front foot through the left flank, seeking an early opener, but South Sudan's backline stood firm.

In the 25th minute, Ronald Ssekiganda carelessly lost possession in the middle park, but Alfred Leku's effort went wide of the frame.

At the half-hour mark, Kenneth Ssemakula was fouled steps away from the box, but Rogers Mato skied his effort.

Four minutes later, Leku's powerful effort forced Uganda Cranes custodian Isima Watenga in a full stretch save.

At the beginning of the second stanza, Paul Put made two changes bringing on Allan Okello and Bobosi Byaruhanga for Travis Mutyaba and Ronald Ssekiganda.

Mugabi broke the deadlock in the 47th minute after guiding the ball into the back of the net from close range.

Jude Ssemugabi's header off Allan Okello's sweet delivery was saved by South Sudan's goalkeeper Juma Jenaro Amuk but Mugabi was close to poke it in.

Halidi Lwaliwa made a goalline clearance to deny South Sudan a late equaliser.

The victory takes Uganda Cranes to seven points in three games, which is sure a thrilling report card.

Starting XI: Isima Watenga, Kenneth Ssemakula, Abdu Aziizi Kayondo, Bevis Mugabi, Halidi Lwaliwa, Khalid Aucho, Ronald Ssekiganda, Travis Mutyaba, Denis Omedi, Jude Ssemugabi, Rogers Mato
