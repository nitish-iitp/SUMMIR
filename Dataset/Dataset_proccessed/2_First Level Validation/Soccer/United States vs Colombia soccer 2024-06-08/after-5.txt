Damaging result for USMNT

Suffering a 5-1 loss when all of North and South America are watching is humiliating for US Soccer.

These types of results can kill a player's international career.

Rising concern ahead of tough opposition at Copa America

The USMNT had far too many ugly mistakes, especially in the final stages, against Colombia today. The result was an ugly 5-1 loss that will only enhance concerns around this US team facing top opponents at the Copa America.

Turner apologizes for performance

Matt Turner also spoke to TNT after the USMNT's defeat: "Obviously this wasn't the way we play, the way I play. Everybody needs to look in the mirror after that game and figure it out because obviously that's not up to the level that's required to compete with these South American teams."

Asked about how the team can respond against Brazil on Wednesday, he rolled his eyes before responding: "I hate saying that we can't get too hung up, we have a game in another couple of days. It's important for us to be able to respond. When you look forward to tournaments it's not always going to be perfect and you have figure out the ways to get the job done.

"Today we didn't have any answers for the ways Colombia changed themselves, changed the way they pressed and they just had a different intensity about them that we didn't have for the game. It's really, really disappointing in front of such a great crowd to perform like that, so I want to apologize to the fans as well because that's not what we're about and we need to bounce back in a big way."

Balogun's assist a rare bright spot for USMNT

The most encouraging moment of the day for the US was Timothy Weah's goal, which was set up by a perfectly weighted through ball from Folarin Balogun.

Balogun has made a bright start to life with the USMNT. He has now been involved in a goal in six of his first 10 starts for the program, registering three goals and three assists.

Weah: 'Super disappointed'

Getty Images

Timothy Weah, the USMNT's lone goalscorer today, spoke to TNT after the defeat: "I think when we came out in the second half we started to show signs of positivity, but then it just started to fade from there, obviously with my mistake I take full accountability. It's a tough situation obviously but we just have to be professional and get back into it and work on some things.

"We had a lot of trouble through the middle. James (Rodriguez), Arias they were causing a lot of trouble. Obviously when you're chasing the ball you get tired so it's hard to build momentum. We're super disappointed today, it's just wasn't our day, I'll be the first to take accountability."

US let down by backline

Truly difficult to remember a worse collective performance by a USMNT backline than this one today. Just atrocious stuff.

Damaging result for USMNT

Getty Images

This is a very bad result for the USMNT. Colombia was so much better. An absolute momentum killer before a major tournament.

The USMNT's defensive awareness today was really poor. So naive from the US backline.
