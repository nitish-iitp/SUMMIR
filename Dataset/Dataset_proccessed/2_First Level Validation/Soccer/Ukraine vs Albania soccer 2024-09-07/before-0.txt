Ukraine and Albania will kick off their UEFA Nations League campaign at the neutral epet ARENA in Prague. Both teams exited Euro 2024 at the group stage, and they will be looking to bounce back with a strong showing in League B Group 1. With promotion on the line, this opening fixture holds significant importance for both nations as they aim to assert dominance over fellow group contenders Georgia and Czech Republic.

Backing Ukraine to win while both teams find the back of the net looks to be the strongest betting option for this fixture. A deeper look at the recent form and squad quality of these sides makes a compelling case for this outcome.

Ukraine, despite their struggles in Euro 2024, have proven themselves to be a resilient side under Serhiy Rebrov. Their attacking line, which is expected to feature the likes of Viktor Tsygankov, Mykhaylo Mudryk, and Artem Dovbyk, has shown an ability to create chances regularly. While they scored just two goals in three Euro 2024 group stage games, their Nations League record is more promising. In their last six games in this competition, they have scored in five of them, with the forward trio providing a consistent threat.

Defensively, however, Ukraine have looked vulnerable at times. They conceded four goals in Euro 2024, and with Albania showing signs of life in attack, Ukraine may struggle to keep a clean sheet. Albania’s midfield, marshalled by Qazim Laci and Kristjan Asllani, has been capable of driving forward and creating scoring opportunities. Myrto Uzuni’s inclusion in the attack also provides Albania with a pacey option who can exploit defensive lapses.

Although Albania have had difficulties on the road, their 2-2 draw with Croatia in Euro 2024 demonstrates they can score against formidable opponents. However, their defence remains a weak point, with five goals conceded in their three group stage games. Ukraine’s attacking firepower, combined with Albania’s tendency to concede, supports the expectation of goals from both teams.

BettingTips4You.com expert Graham Hartshorn shares his insight: “Ukraine’s attack is potent, and while Albania can frustrate, I expect both teams to get on the scoresheet. Ukraine’s stronger offensive unit should see them edge this encounter.”

Ukraine’s historical dominance over Albania, with five wins in their last six meetings, adds further weight to the prediction. Although Albania’s defence, led by Marash Kumbulla, will seek to contain the Blue and Yellow, Ukraine’s superior firepower is likely to breach their backline at least once. A close game is anticipated, but Ukraine’s ability to generate chances and capitalise on defensive mistakes should see them emerge victorious.

Correct Score Prediction: Ukraine 2-1 Albania

A 2-1 scoreline in favour of Ukraine appears to align with the betting tip of Ukraine winning with both teams scoring. While Ukraine are expected to dominate possession and create more opportunities, Albania have shown enough attacking quality to grab at least one goal.

Ukraine have kept only one clean sheet in their last six competitive fixtures, a trend that suggests Albania have the capacity to find the net. Myrto Uzuni, expected to lead the line for Albania, is a player with the potential to capitalise on Ukraine’s occasional defensive lapses. However, Ukraine’s superior squad depth and quality, particularly in the final third, should enable them to score twice and secure a narrow win.

Ukraine’s recent games in the Nations League, where they have averaged just under two goals per game, suggest that two goals is a realistic target for this contest. Meanwhile, Albania’s leaky defence, which conceded five goals in three Euro 2024 group stage matches, adds confidence to this prediction.
