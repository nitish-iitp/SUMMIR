UKRAINE VS ALBANIA: ALBANIA COMES TO PRAGUE TO MAKE A STATEMENT
Ukraine vs Albania: Albania Comes to Prague to Make a Statement

The UEFA Nations League match between Ukraine and Albania on 7th September 2024 promises to be an intriguing encounter between two attacking teams. Both sides are gearing up for their first matches in the new Nations League draw, with Ukraine hosting Albania at the Epet Arena in Prague. Despite recent struggles, Ukraine is still favoured, according to Ukraine vs Albania odds. However, Albania has shown substantial development in recent years and is ready to take on another challenge.

Ukraine Team News

Ukraine’s Euro 2024 campaign was disappointing, with one win, one loss, and one draw. Worse still, the team struggled to show quality across most areas of the pitch, with defensive flaws and underwhelming performances, particularly by goalkeeper Andriy Lunin, drawing plenty of criticism. The team has been preparing intensively for this match, arriving in Prague a few days earlier than Albania. Whether this will be enough to improve their inconsistent displays remains an open question.

Ukraine’s head coach, Sergey Rebrov, has announced a 26-man squad for the September matches, including Dynamo winger Vladyslav Kabayev, who receives his first call-up to the national team. The squad features experienced players in both defence and midfield, most of whom were part of the Euro squad. Key players in midfield include Andriy Yarmolenko, Mykola Shaparenko, and Oleksandr Zinchenko, supported up front by Roman Yaremchuk, as Artem Dovbyk misses out due to a minor injury.

Albania Team News

While Albania’s squad includes several players who feature in top European leagues, the team's main strength is their fearlessness, as they attempt to impose their game on any opponent. Despite being in a group with Spain, Italy, and Croatia at the Euros, Albania held their own and had chances to pick up more points. Head coach Sylvinho has emphasised that the team will continue to play in this manner, with the Nations League providing a chance for further breakthrough performances.

Albania will rely on the same key players as during the Euro. Marash Kumbulla and Elseid Hysaj will anchor the defence, while the creativity of Nedim Bajrami and Qazim Laci will be crucial in midfield. Armando Broja, who is currently considering his future after being left out of Chelsea’s squad, is likely to retain his place in attack.

Albania Handicap +1

It would be unwise to underestimate Albania after their solid performances during the Euros. Had Albania been in a different group, they could have easily reached the playoff stage. Ukraine, by contrast, was disjointed, and their defensive weaknesses were exploited by all of their group opponents. With Ukraine’s key players still not at their best — Mudryk struggling at Chelsea, and Zinchenko offering inconsistent displays compared to his performances at Arsenal — Albania has a good chance in this match. This Ukraine vs Albania prediction comes at 1.60 at HeySpin.

HANDICAP
Albania +1
1.60
Total Goals Over 2.5

Despite the importance of this match, with both teams aiming to start their campaign with a win, it is unlikely to be a purely defensive game. Ukraine, still searching for their optimal lineup, will probably experiment tactically, while Albania often adopts a simple approach — to score more than they concede. Furthermore, both teams have seen over 2 goals in 4 out of their last 5 matches across all competitions. This outcome is priced at 2.19 at MrPlay.

Both Teams to Score

Neither team can boast strong defences, as they have conceded in most of their recent matches. Ukraine, focused on maintaining balance in midfield, can rely on Mudryk, whose speed and dribbling are still at the highest level. Albania, as shown in their matches against Italy and Croatia, can find opportunities even in the smallest of situations. This Ukraine vs Albania tip comes at 2.02.
