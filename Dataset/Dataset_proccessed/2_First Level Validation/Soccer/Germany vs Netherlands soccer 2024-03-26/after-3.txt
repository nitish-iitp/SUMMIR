Germany 2-1 Netherlands
Goals: 0-1 Veerman 4' (assist: Depay), 1-1 Mittelstädt 11' (assist: Musiala), 2-1 Füllkrug 85' (assist: Kroos)

Germany's first home match since the death of world football legends Franz Beckenbauer and Andreas Brehme, both nations paid their respects with a minute's silence prior to kick-off. The Netherlands were quickest out of the blocks once the game got started, Joey Veerman scoring from close range after Memphis Depay had taken advantage of some uncertainty in the Germany defence. Maximilian Mittelstädt was one of the players caught wanting, but the VfB Stuttgart defender made amends with a thunderous equaliser. Borussia Dortmund's Donyell Malen tested Marc-André ter Stegen and had another effort blocked as the Oranje ended an energetic first half in the ascendancy.

Malen was at it again after the restart, the Netherlands forward stinging the palms of ter Stegen from the edge of the area. Tijjani Reijnders blazed over after more great build-up play by Malen and Depay, who combined to almost devastating effect on the hour. Depay failed to keep his shot down, though, after Malen had drawn ter Stegen out of position. Germany responded with a fierce Mittelstädt drive that Bart Verbruggen did well to keep out, before Jamal Musiala forced another strong save at the Netherlands stopper's near post. Verbruggen thwarted Thomas Müller, but was powerless to stop fellow substitute Füllkrug from forcing a Toni Kroos corner home for the win.

Scenes in Frankfurt! Toni Kroos sends a corner deep into the mixer. Niclas Füllkrug connects with a shoulder and the ball flies towards the corner.

Depay's golden moment
Memphis Depay really has to score after some tremendous work from Malen - who took ter Stegen on walkabout - set up the Netherlands No. 10. Depay slashes over the crossbar when right in front of goal. He just didn't catch that.

Plenty of entertainment for the fans to get excited about after a pulsating first half in Frankfurt. Joey Veerman gave the Dutch an early lead, only for Maximilian Mittelstädt to equalise with a worldie.

Kroos over
Toni Kross wallops a right-footed shot high over the bar. Moments later, Kai Havertz is saved by the offside flag after the Arsenal player had waltzed clean through on goal, only to see his low shot saved.
32'
Huge chance
Daley Blind flights a tantalising free kick towards the far post. Matthijs de Ligt is suddenly there but chooses to head across goal as opposed to at the target. Ilkay Gündogan just about nicks the ball away from Donyell Malen, who looked poised to score.
30'
Visitors counter
Dumfries races into space on the right and suddenly he is supported by half a dozen teammates on a lightning-quick counter. Dumfries' cross is headed away to safety by Tah.
23'
Deadly duo
Musiala and Wirtz just about fail to concoct a chance the home fans were baying for when the two strolled into the Netherlands' area. The Dutch are in a sweat trying to defend those two.
Top entertainment
There's been no let-up in Frankfurt, with both teams going in search of goals at every opportunity.

Back the other end
What an advert this is for EURO 2024! Germany are back on the front foot and when Robert Andrich gets on the ball just outside the box, the fans urge him to shoot. The Leverkusen man obliges, but his effort flies over.

Here come Holland
Malen races onto Depay's pass and looks to be clear of Tah, who recovers brilliantly. Malen's swipe across the face is finger-tipped away by ter Stegen.

What. A. Goal!
Maximilian Mittelstädt more than makes up for that earlier error with an absolute thunderbolt into the top corner from outside the Netherlands' box! Germany worked a short corner and when the ball made it's way to Musiala, he teed up Mittelstädt to score a goal he'll never forget.

Mistakes made
It was Mittelstädt and Tah out on the left who succumbed to that Dutch pressure in the build-up to the opening goal. Julian Nagelsmann, understandably, had a stern look on his face down on the bench.

Germany respond
The hosts look to hit back quickly, with Jamal Musiala menacing up top. The Netherlands eventually clear their lines.

Dutch take early lead
Disaster for Germany, who get themselves into all sorts of trouble out wide under Dutch pressure. Depay steals away with the ball and cuts back for Veerman, who slams into the corner to stun the home fans.

Team photos have been taken and we're ready to go in Frankfurt.
Teams out!
Both sides are on the pitch at the magnificent Deutsche Bank Park and we're all set for the national anthems.
More on those teams
Julian Nagelsmann suggested he would stick with the same starting XI that began Saturday's 2-0 win in France and the coach stays true to his word as the EURO 2024 hosts line out in a 4-2-3-1 formation. The injured Manuel Neuer is covered by Marc-André ter Stegen while Leroy Sané is suspended. Ronald Koeman, meanwhile, fields seven changes to the team that hammered Scotland 4-0 last Friday. Bayern Munich 's Matthijs de Ligt and BVB's Donyell Malen are among those changes.

Andrich's Alonso appreciation
In line for only his second start and third senior appearance with Germany later, Bayer Leverkusen's Robert Andrich said he delighted in playing alongside Toni Kroos in Saturday's victory against France and that he has taken on board plenty of advice from club coach Xabi Alonso this term. "[He's] on me a little more than other players," the B04 midfielder explained. "I've always been very emotional, but sometimes maybe a little too emotional. [Xabi] has definitely helped me to stay cool in certain situations, which has also helped my game."

Seven seconds and away
Florian Wirtz's stunning goal after just seven seconds in France on Saturday stunned the football world but perhaps came as less of a surprise to those who have seen him tear up defences in the Bundesliga all season for table-toppers Leverkusen. The playmaker's superb form saw him voted Bundesliga Player of the Month in February.
10:10
More Musiala magic
Having provided Kai Havertz with an assist for Germany's second goal against France on Saturday, Jamal Musiala proved once again why he is a player in top form for club and country. What better time, then, to sit back and enjoy all of the Bayern schemer's Bundesliga goals and assists so far in 2023/24.
No Neuer, Beste
Of the original call-ups to the Germany squad for this international break, Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and Heidenheim's Jan-Niklas Beste have succumbed to respective adductor problems and travelled back to their clubs. Bayern's Aleksandar Pavlović, meanwhile, was unable to join up with Nagelsmann's set-up as he is suffering with tonsillitis.
Kroos back with a bang
What a return to international duty Toni Kroos enjoyed against France, the Real Madrid man providing an immediate assist for Florian Wirtz to score in the game's opening seconds. "There has been a lot of change and there was the question of whether it would be possible to produce results so quickly," the ex-Bayern player said after the win. "We can be very pleased, he added."

Early team news
Nagelsmann has suggested he will begin Tuesday's game against the Netherlands with the same starting XI to that which took to the field in the victory against France last Saturday. That would see the four-time world champions lining up as follows: Ter Stegen - Kimmich, Tah, Rüdiger, Mittelstädt - Kroos, Andrich - Wirtz, Gündoğan (c), Musiala - Havertz.
© IMAGO/Gladys Chai von der Laage
Head-to-head
Germany could do with improving on their recent record in games against the Netherlands, with Tuesday's hosts only managing one win in the teams' previous six meetings. As many as three draws and two losses aside, Germany's sole victory against the Dutch of late came in a European Championship qualifier in 2019 (3-2). Leroy Sane, Serge Gnabry and Nico Schulz were on target for Joachim Löw's side in Amsterdam five years ago.
Thoughts turn to Dutch
No doubt Saturday's high-profile win in Lyon will send Germany bouncing into Tuesday's meeting with the Netherlands, who arrive in Frankfurt with plenty of familiar faces to Bundesliga fans. Leipzig's Xavi Simons, Matthijs de Ligt of Bayern, Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong, BVB's Donyell Malen and Hoffenheim's Wout Weghorst are all among the travelling contingent.

Nagelsmann delighted
The former Bayern Munich, Leipzig and Hoffenheim boss was understandably purring after that weekend win in France, saying, "At the end of the day, I’m really pleased with the way the team played. It was a really great game." Goalscorer Havertz added, "It was a lot of fun today. We’re delighted to win against such an opponent."

Solid start
Julian Nagelsmann's side enjoyed the perfect start to a year in which they will host this summer's EUROs with a high-profile victory against France in Lyon on Saturday. Florian Wirtz's strike inside the game's opening seven seconds and a Kai Havertz goal shortly after the restart offered a huge morale boost to the three-time European champions.
