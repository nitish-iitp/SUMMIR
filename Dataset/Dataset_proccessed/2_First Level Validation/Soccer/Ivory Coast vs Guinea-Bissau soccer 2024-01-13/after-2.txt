Ivory Coast vs Guinea-Bissau LIVE!

The 2023 Africa Cup of Nations has begun with the hosts in action at the impressive Alassane Ouattara Stadium in Abidjan. The two-times champions were very much expected to hit the ground running in front of their own fans against a side outside the top 100 of the world rankings.

A strong squad has been picked by Ivory Coast boss Jean-Louis Gasset, who could even afford to leave Wilfried Zaha out. Sebastien Haller missed out through injury with Jean-Philippe Krasso leading the Ivorian line. Guinea-Bissau, meanwhile, hoped Lyon forward Mama Balde can help cause an upset.

Les Elephants came out on top after an early strike by Seko Fofana, before a nervy showing was eased in the searing humidity by Krasso's second-half goal.

Ivory Coast 2-0 Guinea-Bissau | 90+2 mins

Half a chance for Nicolas Pepe, who dribbles into the box but opts for power over placement on his left foot and lashes an effort off target.

Idrissa Doumbia replaces Ibrahim Sangare as Ivory Coast wrap up their fifth and final substitute.

Four added minutes.

Ivory Coast 2-0 Guinea-Bissau | 89 mins

Really nice defending from Guinea-Bissau's Carlos Mendes Gomes to deny Serge Aurier's burst forward - first with a block, then a smart tackle.

Up the other end, Ze Turbo fancies himself for something special but drills a wayward effort wide.

Ivory Coast 2-0 Guinea-Bissau | 86 mins

Half a chance as Ze Turbo pops up at the back stick to head a really nice cross over.

The Guinea-Bissau substitute mistimed his header, in truth, and it pinged over off his shoulder.

Ivory Coast 2-0 Guinea-Bissau | 85 mins

FInal change from Guinea-Bissau and ex-Rangers man Dalcio Gomes replaces Mama Balde in attack.

Ivory Coast 2-0 Guinea-Bissau | 81 mins

The camera pans to Gianni Infantino, sat flicking through his phone in the executive box, which is behind a glass panel and therefore almost certainly air conditioned. It's good work, if you can get it.
