Ivory Coast begin their bid for a third Africa Cup of Nations crown when they take on Guinea-Bissau in the tournament's opening game at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium on Saturday.

The tournament hosts are favourites to top Group A, while the Djurtus seek group-stage progress for the first time.

The pressure is on Jean-Louis Gasset's Elephants when they take to the field on Saturday as AFCON 2023 commences, keen to impose themselves against Guinea-Bissau.

The West African side partook in qualifying despite being assured of a spot at the finals, finishing second after ending level with Zambia on 13 points, winning four of their six games (one loss).

Ivory Coast have group-stage history on their side, having progressed from that phase in eight of the previous nine times they have played at the Cup of Nations, and they seek to boost their prospects of making it nine in 10 with a strong showing against Guinea-Bissau.

Gasset's troops wiped the floor with Sierra Leone in their tune-up game, claiming a 5-1 victory over the Leone Stars last weekend, as they impressed with their decisive execution in the final third.

Carrying that form into Saturday's AFCON opener with the expectant home support is anyone's guess, but their goalscoring form at least gives the Elephants reason to be optimistic in the lead-up to facing Guinea-Bissau.

As for the Djurtus, they aim to progress from the group stage for the first time at the fourth time of asking, having failed to play a fourth game at the continental showpiece in the past three tournaments.

Part of that process includes winning their first game at the finals, a feat they have not managed despite playing nine times in 2017, 2019 and 2021.

Even though Baciro Cande's men ended second in their qualifying group, the Djurtus secured a shock victory over Nigeria in the latter's home, and they could pick up another positive result against the Super Eagles at AFCON 2023.

First, they must battle the host nation, hoping to frustrate the Elephants and take their counter-attacking opportunities and set-piece chances on Saturday.

However, it is easier said than done for Guinea-Bissau, who sit 54 places below the Ivory Coast in FIFA's rankings heading into the competition.

Simon Adingra and Sebastien Haller are in the wars and may not start the Elephants' first game of the competition.

Household names like Eric Bailly and Wilfried Zaha are not part of the Ivory Coast group aiming to win the nation's third African title.

Despite the absences, the hosts' midfield — comprising Franck Kessie, Seko Fofana and Ibrahim Sangare — should help to dominate the game against possibly passive opponents.

Cande typically utilises a 4-3-3 but tends to alter that approach for a back three against superior opponents, which is anticipated against Ivory Coast on Saturday.

Mama Balde is expected to lead the line, and the unfancied side's hopes rest on the forward if the Djurtus are to shock the home side.

Samsunspor defender Nanu is doubtful for Guinea-Bissau's opening fixture.


Ivory Coast possible starting lineup:
Fofana; Aurier, Diomande, Ndicka, Konan; Kessie, Fofana, Sangare; Krasso, Boga, Bamba

Guinea-Bissau possible starting lineup:
Mendes; Cande, Mane, Djalo; Mane, Semedo, Cassama, Rodrigues, Quizera; Gano, Balde



We say: Ivory Coast 2-0 Guinea-Bissau

Ivory Coast are expected to avoid Guinea-Bissau's traps and the pressure of the opening fixture to secure a routine victory in the tournament's first game on Saturday.

While the Djurtus should not be as open as they were in the 6-2 friendly defeat to Mali last week, they are unlikely to pull off a shock result.
