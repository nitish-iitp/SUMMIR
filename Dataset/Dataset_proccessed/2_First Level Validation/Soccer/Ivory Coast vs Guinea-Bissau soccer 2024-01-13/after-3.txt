IVORY COAST 2-0 GUINEA-BISSAU: HOSTS OPEN AFRICA CUP OF NATIONS WITH COMFORTABLE WIN AT STADE ALASSANE OUATTARA
BYEUROSPORT

UPDATED 13/01/2024 AT 23:03 GMT

Seko Fofana and Jean-Philippe Krasso scored the goals as hosts Ivory Coast claimed a comfortable 2-0 win over Guinea-Bissau to open the Africa Cup of Nations at the Stade Alassane Ouattara. Next up for Jean-Louis Gasset’s side is Nigeria while Guinea-Bissau will take on Equatorial Guinea next Thursday. Before that, Nigeria face Equatorial Guinea on Sunday at 14:00.

Hosts Ivory Coast opened the Africa Cup of Nations with a comfortable victory over Guinea-Bissau.
Although not always doing enough to entertain the home fans following the opening ceremony, the Ivorians won with something to spare.

They took the lead inside four minutes when Seko Fofana crafted some room for himself on the edge of the penalty area before unleashing an unstoppable shot.

He almost grabbed a second before half time when a perfect pull-back from Franck Kessie found him in space 15 yards out but his effort was tipped onto the bar by Ouparine Djoco.
The second goal came 13 minutes after the interval through Jean-Philippe Krasso, who brought down Jonathan Bamba's cross into his path before guiding the ball home.
Guinea-Bissau had one big chance to get back into the game but substitute Franculino Dju's effort was saved well by Yahia Fofana
In a match played in sweltering, humid conditions, which affected many of the players, the home players seemed satisfied with their opening efforts, though it was not a performance which will scare their next group opponents, Nigeria.

TALKING POINT - HOME CROWD COULD BE A MIXED BLESSING
Admittedly, this was a match against opposition which never were likely to threaten Ivory Coast (bookmakers had them at 15/1 before kick off) but the impatience of the home fans was clear to hear during the match. They seem to expect their side to win the tournament and as third favourites they are certainly a contender. However, if they are to make the Stade Alassane Ouattara a fortress they may need their fans to be more patient when, as will happen at some stage, things do not go to plan. They do not have a figurehead like Didier Drogba, who was given a hero's reception by home fans before the game, and the groans from supporters could have an adverse affect on the side. This will certainly be tested in Matchday 2 on Thursday when they face Nigeria at the same venue.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - FRANCK KESSIE (IVORY COAST)
The former Barcelona man was an energetic force for his side. Not letting Guinea-Bissau settle in possession and driving forward down the right flank when getting an opportunity. His perfect set up for what almost was Seko Fofana's second was indicative of the class he brings to the side.
PLAYER RATINGS
Ivory Coast: Y Fofana 7; Singo 6, Diomande 6, Ndicka 6, Konan 6; Kessie 8*, Sangare 6, S Fofana 7; Boga 7, Krasso 7, Bamba 6.
Subs: Aurier 6, Pepe 6, Konate 6, Boly 6.
Guinea-Bissau: Djoco 6; Encada 6, Sangante 5, Djalo 7, Cande 7; Cassama 6, Bikel 5, Semedo 6; Rodrigues 6, Balde 6, Mane 6.
Subs: Konate 6, Franculino 7, Gomes 6, Ze Turbo 6.
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS:
4' GOAL FOR IVORY COAST! And it was a howitzer! Fofana crafted space for himself on the edge of the box and then unleashed a rocket high into the corner leaving the keeper with no chance.
29' BALDE THROUGH ON GOAL! But he doesn't get any power on the shot and Diomande half blocked the effort as well.
35' OFF THE BAR! Fofana so close to a second. Kessie did brilliantly picking up a lose ball in the box and laying it back for the goalscorer and he was the width of the crossbar from adding a second. Actually replays show it was a fine stop from Djoco tipping it onto the woodwork.
41' IVORY COAST WANT A PENALTY! This will go to VAR. Krasso crossed inside for Bamba and he went down after soft contact in the back from Djalo. Quickly the referee's decision to not give the kick is upheld.
58' GOAL FOR IVORY COAST! That will settle the home fans. Bamba did well down the left flank putting a bouncing ball into the box and then Krasso, at the second attempt, managed to steer the ball away from his marker, before steering a left-footed half-volley inside the far post.
73' GREAT CHANCE FOR GUINEA-BISSAU An interception from Balde created an opening and he slid a ball through to substitute Francolino whose effort was well saved at his near post by Fofana.
KEY STAT
10 - Despite their apparent dominance, Guinea-Bissau had as many shots as Ivory Coast, but only once made the hosts' goalkeeper work.
