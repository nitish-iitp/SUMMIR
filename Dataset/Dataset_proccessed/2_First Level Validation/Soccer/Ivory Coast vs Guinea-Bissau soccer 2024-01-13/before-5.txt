How often is the AFCON played?

The Africa Cup of Nations is a competition organised by the Confederation of African Football and it is held every two years. The first two editions of the tournament were held at a difference of two years in 1957 and 1959 in Sudan and the United Arab Republic.

The third edition was held in 1962 in Ethiopia followed by 1963 in Ghana and 1965 in Tunisia. The tournament was next held in 1968 in Ethiopia once again and since then the AFCON was constantly organised at the interval of two years until 2012.

South Africa hosted the 29th edition of the tournament as it was switched to odd years which happened in 2013. Since then the AFCON has been held every two years with Ivory Coast preparing to host the 34th edition.

When will the 2023 AFCON start and end?

The AFCON will start on 13th January 2024 when the hosts Ivory Coast take on Guinea-Bissau at the Olympic Stadium of Ebimpe. Reigning champions Senegal will cross swords with Gambia on 15th January 2024 to start their campaign.
