Ivory Coast, China and the murky truth behind AFCON’s most high-tech stadium
Simon Hughes
Jan 13, 2024

Four men in uniform are studying the Stade Alassane Ouattara Ebimpe with their arms folded. 

They are locals and their uniform is a combination of floral-patterned shirt, jeans and flip-flops. Such is their fixation, it seems as though they are waiting for what has been called the most advanced football arena in Africa to express itself, maybe even take off and fly away.

The stadium certainly looks like a spaceship, one that was landed incongruously on the red earth of semi-rural Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s de-facto capital.

It is not a machine-beast, lumpen or identikit, but an architectural wonder with subtleties, such as a roof that curves and swoops around its giant bowl like an ocean wave or a skateboard rink. Below, enormous coliseum-style pillars support a fascia that includes latticing reflective of the Ivory Coast’s tricolour flag.

That flag appears most prominently in the poorest areas of the city, where the walls of homes in informal settlements are painted in its vertical panels of orange (representing the savannah), white (rivers), and green (forests).

Three days before the 34th edition of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) begins this weekend, the venue was effectively in lockdown mode in preparation for the opening ceremony later today (Saturday) when the host nation, who are one of the favourites to win the February 11 final, face Guinea-Bissau.

This explains why those uniformed local men were watching.

The most obvious route towards the vantage point east of the stadium would have been a 50-minute walk down the side of a dual carriageway which leads you back towards the northernmost reaches of Abidjan. Yet that time was cut in half because of their knowledge of the wooded terrain. 

In truth, Abidjan is so vast, it is difficult to tell where the city ends. Though the official population is 5.5million, it is thought to be far higher because it is hard to measure the people who live in sprawling temporary communities like those squeezed onto either side of the Abidjan Civil Prison Road that connects the centre with Ebimpe.

Through my taxi driver’s broken English, one of the men is explaining that he wanted to come here one last time before the football starts — just to be able to say he has experienced the tournament in some small way.

He says nobody from Ebimpe can afford to attend any of the matches that will take place here over the next month, though there are rumours organisers from the Confederation of African Football (CAF) have distributed free tickets for some fixtures where sales have been slow.

There is no sense of bitterness. Instead, there is a pride in living so close to arguably the most impressive sporting facility in the whole of Ivory Coast, and possibly the entire continent.

When I ask him how the project was funded, neither he nor any of his friends can offer an answer. They have heard of foreign investment, but there has been so much of that in Ivory Coast since the end of a second civil war in 2011 that GDP growth currently exceeds seven per cent. 

The truth, however, is that this stadium is here because of cash flowing directly from Beijing.

And so, for all the national fervour being stirred here on Africa’s west coast, this has become an AFCON for China as much as it is for Ivory Coast.

In the south of Abidjan, the western fringes of the Treichville district fall beneath an overpass that showcases some of the most wretched poverty in the city.

In the far distance, however, you can see the port, with its optimistic-looking blue cranes that stretch out into the Gulf of Guinea, welcoming some of the biggest ships in the world.

The port has doubled in size over the last 10 years, growing by 12 per cent year on year. That, too, is thanks to the influence of China, which established diplomatic relations with Ivory Coast 40 years ago.

A second terminal means the port is now the access point for 90 per cent of the country’s foreign trade, enabling it to rise to the rank of a sub-regional hub in shipping terms, acting as the primary reference point on the Atlantic coast of Africa, between Tangier in Morocco and Durban in South Africa.

This expansion has only been possible because of investment from China under the banner of its Belt-and-Road Initiative (BRI), launched a decade ago as part of a bid by President Xi Jinping, leader of the Chinese Communist Party, to establish new trade routes across the world and therefore broaden his country’s economic and political influence. It is a project many foreign policy analysts consider to be far from benevolent. 

Ivory Coast signed up to BRI in the early summer of 2017, a year or so after the first shovels were ploughed into the red earth of Ebimpe. The stadium would ultimately cost around £260million ($330m at current exchange rates), and was planned and built by the Beijing Construction Engineering group — one of 1,100 state subsidiaries in China.

In total, three of the six stadiums hosting games at this AFCON have either been designed or built by China. The other two, in Korhogo (China National Building Material) and San-Pedro (China Civil Engineering Construction Company), are smaller and were cheaper to build, but still stand as monuments to Beijing’s influence.

Ivory Coast is not the first place to engage with China through “stadium diplomacy”, which is used as economic leverage to get African countries to support China diplomatically, most notably in its policies towards Taiwan. At the 2010 AFCON, one stadium was built in host nation Angola free of charge, but on the condition the country signed up to two soft loans.

Critics have described such agreements as “neo-colonisation”, where China, in a rather more subtle fashion, fosters a dependence on it, because another nation’s government becomes indebted for an unknown period while its resources are heavily exploited.

An example of the potential consequences has been seen in Sri Lanka, where China helped build that country’s biggest port but only on the agreement that if it defaulted on any of its payments, the port would become Chinese-owned. When Sri Lanka duly failed to make a payment, China made its move.

Chinese influence was also present at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, where the stadium that hosted the final between Argentina and France was built with cash from China Railway Construction Corporation in partnership with Qatar’s HBK building group. 

“None of these decisions are made randomly,” Simon Chadwick, a professor in sport and geopolitical economy, tells The Athletic. Chadwick suggests the single thing that drives China is the stability of its domestic economy, which is aimed at six per cent growth a year. “As a consequence, the population is far less likely to question government or leadership,” he adds.

In Ivory Coast’s case, it now sends vast amounts of fish to China. Such deals have meant new significance for its trading status, giving the country access to a huge market that includes both the Chinese economy and its enormous population.

“Given favourable predispositions towards football, the sport has become an easy target for Chinese diplomacy,” Chadwick adds. “Africa is desperate for infrastructure and the global visibility that any sports tournament brings.”

This has encouraged China to sign bilateral deals.

Ivory Coast has not just got new stadiums, but roads and shopping malls too. There is also a new metro line connecting Abidjan’s Felix-Houphouet-Boigny International Airport with Anyama, to the north of the city, which was supposed to be finished for AFCON, but is now expected to be completed at the earliest by 2025.

“This also about Brand China,” Chadwick believes. He says it shows that the country can build incredible stadiums and sell that expertise across the world. “China is saying to other would-be constructors, ‘We can do this for you if you pay us, or establish a political relationship’.”

For Chadwick, football stadiums like the one in Ebimpe is “part of a much wider play”.

While children roam and men wearing bucket hats lie about in the shade, some of the more active locals try to figure out how to fix a deep ditch that runs alongside the road and acts as a drainage system when the rains fall.

Very few people in this town were asked to work on the nearby stadium when it was built. 

That has been another criticism of the huge infrastructure projects built by China, which has had a reputation for using Chinese personnel only — though the residents of Ebimpe aren’t convinced that happened in huge numbers on their doorstep.

“Africans hired from other countries,” says a barber at his shop, as he applies a razor to a customer. He has a suspicion: “Even lower wages than us…”

But for all the controversy, and shady geopolitical forces that may be at work in the background, the barber is excited about what might happen just down the road over the next month. 

“Ivory Coast will win,” he declares confidently. “And that is all that matters.”
