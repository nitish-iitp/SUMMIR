Preview: Kenya vs. Burundi - prediction, team news, lineups

Kenya will be hoping to build on their emphatic victory in the previous round of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers when they host Burundi on Friday afternoon.

Engin Firat's men head into the game unbeaten in their last five meetings with the Intamba and will welcome them to the Bingu National Stadium looking to extend this dominant run.

After starting the World Cup qualifying campaign with a 2-1 defeat to Gabon, Kenya responded immediately with a thumping 5-0 win over Seychelles - a statement victory.

Michael Olunga scored a brace within the first six minutes, while Masoud Juma Choka, Rooney Onyango, and Benson Omala all got on the scoresheet, leaving the East Africans with three points and third place in Group F.

The Harambee Stars have since found their scoring touch, netting seven goals in two matches - a 4-0 win against Malawi and a 3-1 victory over Zimbabwe - while conceding just once on their way to winning a four-team tournament in Malawi back in March.

Firat will hope his side can retain their scoring form for the clash with Burundi, as historically neither nation has managed more than one goal in any of their six meetings.

However, the East Africans have dominated this fixture, recording three wins and two draws, with their only defeat coming in their very first encounter.

Burundi were unable to build on their opening World Cup qualifiers win (3-2 over Gambia) as they fell 2-1 to Gabon at the Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium.

Jim Allevinah's first-half strike and Denis Bouanga's 83rd-minute goal put Etienne Ndayiragije's men behind by two goals with minutes remaining. Despite Abedi Bigirimana pulling one back in the 87th minute, the Intamba could not find the equaliser.

Consequently, Burundi dropped to fourth place in Group F, level on points with Friday's hosts, Kenya, but behind due to an inferior goal difference.

The visitors are winless in their last four matches, including three defeats, and have also struggled in their last seven away games.

Team News

Kenya will be without 27-year-old defender Eric Ouma, who has not passed a fitness test after suffering a muscle injury back in April.

However, Joseph Okumu is hoping to be involved, despite not featuring in any of the Reims' last three games of the season.

With Okumu a doubt for the game, Bristol City defender Zak Vyner could make his debut after earning a call up.

Bigirimana has found the back of the net in four of his last five matches for Burundi, and is one to watch in this clash.

The last time Fiston Abdul Razak started in attack was in the defeat to Gabon, but the Sur SC striker could be back in the XI for this one.


Kenya possible starting lineup:
Matasi; Omar, Vyner, Omurwa, Onyango; Muguna, Akumu, Odada, Nondi; Choka, Olunga

Burundi possible starting lineup:
Nahimana; Kanakimana, Mukombozi, Nsabiyumva, Ndayishimiye; Mvuyekure, Nduwarugira, Ntibazonkiza, Bigirimana; Razak



We say: Kenya 2-1 Burundi

Kenya seem to have attained new heights in their last couple of matches, scoring 12 goals in the last three while conceding just once. However, the reverse is the case for Burundi, who have struggled since their opening day victory.
