Africa Cup of Nations hosts Ivory Coast will bid to complete a madcap tournament when they face Nigeria in the final.

A dreary group stage performance prompted the home nation to sack manager Jean-Louis Gasset before sneaking through to the knockouts as one of the lucky losers - and they have not looked back since, thanks to a sequence of dramatic victories under caretaker boss Emerse Faé.

Ivory Coast, the AFCON winners in 2015, dispatched defending champions Senegal and Mali in thrilling fashion before former West Ham United striker Sébastien Haller, who returned from a cancer battle last year, fired the winning goal in their semi-final clash with DR Congo to progress to the showpiece.

Watch Nigeria v Ivory Coast on Sky Sports or BBC Three

While the hosts' journey has been a rollercoaster, three-time champions Nigeria can claim the honour of being the most consistent team at this tournament.

It was their turn to provide a bit of drama in the last four, however, as they conceded a last-minute goal to South Africa to send the game to extra time and a shootout, before goalkeeper Stanley Nwabali emerged as the hero by saving two spot kicks.
