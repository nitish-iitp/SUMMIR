Ivorian fans confident they can beat Nigeria in AFCON final

Ivory Coast win the Africa Cup of Nations after coming from behind to defeat Nigeria in the final at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium.

The hosts started as the better, more aggressive team, creating chances on goal and playing with a confidence that they’ve lacked throughout the rest of the tournament. The fans inside the stadium gave the match a lively and excitable atmosphere but Nigeria threatened to provide an upset.

In a rare attack up the pitch they won a corner that came curling onto the head of William Troost-Ekong who nodded it into the back of the net for the opener to give them the lead at half-time.

Ivory Coast didn’t give in. They came out for the second half with gusto and equalised through a set piece of their own. Franck Kessie drifting into space and powering a header into the deck before it bounced into the net. A sign of fate perhaps came at the end of the game. Sebastien Haller, who missed the start of the tournament through injury, stuck his foot onto a cross and turned it past Stanley Nwabali to decide the match.

Sebastien Haller’s late winner completes fairytale comeback as hosts Ivory Coast crowned Champions of Africa

Cancer survivor Sebastien Haller inspired hosts Ivory Coast to their third Africa Cup of Nations title with a late winner to seal a 2-1 comeback win over Nigeria in Abidjan.

Five of the last six host nations to reach the final had won the AFCON title, but the Ivory Coast’s appearance in this edition at one point looked unlikely, their 4-0 group-stage defeat to Equatorial Guinea leading to the mid-tournament sacking of Jean-Louis Gasset.

The resurgent Elephants, who under caretaker boss Emerse Fae earned the nickname ‘the Zombies’, fell behind when Nigeria captain William Troost-Ekong headed in a 38th-minute opener against the run of play, but it was cancelled out by Franck Kessie in the second half.

The Elephants, who under caretaker boss Emerse Fae earned the nickname ‘the Zombies’ after resurrecting their campaign, recovered to reach the final.

They fell behind in the showpiece when Nigeria captain William Troost-Ekong headed in a 38th-minute opener against the run of play.

However, that was cancelled out by Franck Kessie in the second half midway through the second half as the Ivory Coast drew level but Sebastien Haller’s heroics in the final 10 minutes won them the trophy.

Nigeria’s players head up to the stage to collect their runners-up medals. It’s the worst walk in football, to come so close and go away as the second best team.

Naturally they look deflated and dejected but on the night they were the second best team.

Nigeria is now tied with Ghana for the dubious honour of most Afcon final defeats. Each nation have been runners-up at this tournament five times.

Victor Osimhen took 24 shots in this tournament but scored only one goal.

Since 2010, only one player has taken as many shots and recorded as poor a conversion rate at this tournament, Ghana’s Asamoah Gyan with 25 shots and one goal in 2013.

We’re still waiting for the trophy presentation.

The stadium is heaving, it’s packed, there’s singing and dancing in the stands. The very partisan crowd want an Ivory Coast victory and they’re got it.
