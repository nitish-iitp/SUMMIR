Both Uzbekistan and Syria are strong contenders to secure qualification into the AFC Asian Cup knockouts.

Uzbekistan and Syria will meet on 13 January 2024 at the Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium in Doha, Qatar for their opening 2023 AFC Asian Cup fixture. Both countries will back themselves to join tournament favourites Australia in the knockout stages after securing one of the top two spots in Group B which also includes India. 

Uzbekistan and Syria will likely be direct competitors for the second and third spot in the group considering the quality of both their national teams. As a result, securing three points in the opening game against direct competitors goes a long way. Winning the game will hand a huge advantage to either team as they are expected to beat India unless the Blue Tigers cause an upset. 

Anticipation is high ahead of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup fixture between Uzbekistan and Syria. Here is what to expect as the kick-off nears:

Kick-off

Saturday, 13 January, 05:30 PM GMT at the Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium in Doha, Qatar

Form

Uzbekistan (in all competitions): W-W-W-D-W

Syria (in all competitions): L-W-L-D-D

Player to Watch

Abbosbek Fayzullaev is one of the most promising players in the Uzbekistan line-up. The 20-year-old plays for CSKA Moscow in Russia at the club level. He won the 2023 Uzbekistan Player of the Year award for his performances in the calendar year. The youngster will be one to watch out and will hope to have a positive impact on the side.

Omar Khribin (Syria)
Omar Khribin will be the main threat for any opposition in the AFC Asian Cup.

Omar Khribin leads the Syrian football team’s forward line. The 29-year-old plays his club football for Al-Wahda in the UAE Pro League. The forward has 12 goals and two assists in 15 overall appearances at the club level in the 2023-24 season (till now). It will be interesting to see how Uzbekistan limit Khribin’s influence on the upcoming game where the striker will hope to add to his 21 goal-tally for the national team.

Match Facts
Omar Khribin of Syria is the sixth-highest goal-scorer in the history of the national team.
Uzbekistan lost to Syria in the previous meeting between the two nations.
