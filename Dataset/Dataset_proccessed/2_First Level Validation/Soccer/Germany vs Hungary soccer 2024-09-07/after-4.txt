UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE
GERMANY 5-0 HUNGARY - JAMAL MUSIALA AND FLORIAN WIRTZ STAR AS HOSTS SHINE IN UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE CONTEST
BYBEN SOUTHBY

UPDATED 07/09/2024 AT 21:13 GMT

It ended up being a very one-sided encounter as Germany strolled past Hungary 5-0 in their UEFA Nations League contest in Dusseldorf on Saturday evening. Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz were at their dazzling best as the pair inspired the hosts to a comprehensive victory at the Merkur Spiel-Arena. Hungary simply had no answer to Germany's array of attacking talent.

Jamal Musiala scored a solo wonder goal as Germany thumped Hungary 5-0 to get their UEFA Nations League campaign off to a winning start in Dusseldorf.
Niclas Fullkrug, Florian Wirtz, Aleksandar Pavlovic and Kai Havertz were also on target on a ruthless night for Julien Nagelsmann’s side.

Germany put Hungary under pressure from the off, and after a goal-line clearance by Liverpool’s Dominik Szoboszlai and a missed Fullkrug one-on-one chance, the West Ham striker made amends to put the hosts in front with a tap-in inside the six-yard box.

Havertz had two chances to double Germany’s lead before the break. The first came when his fierce header thundered off the bar and bounced the wrong side of the goal-line, and then he sent a curled effort wide of the post on the stroke of half-time.
Germany finally added a second after an hour when Wirtz found Musiala on the halfway line, as the Bayern Munich superstar drove from his own half, holding off two defenders, before he excellently slotted the ball home.
The hosts began to purr at this stage and before long they had their third as Musiala returned the favour to set up Wirtz, who squeezed the ball past Peter Gulacsi.
Pavlovic added a fourth before Havertz’s persistence finally paid off, as he wrapped up the three points from the spot.
TALKING POINT - MUSIALA AND WIRTZ: THE DREAM DUO
It was another superb performance by Germany’s dynamic duo Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz, who combined to assist each other and add some gloss to the scoreline.
Both took their goals well after finding each other almost telepathically and as long as the pair are in this mood, Germany can beat anyone on their day.

PLAYER OF THE MATCH - JAMAL MUSIALA (GERMANY)
It is hard to find new words to describe the midfielder, who notched his sixth goal for Germany on his 35th appearance at the tender age of 21. He also registered his eighth international assist to set up team-mate Wirtz, who himself is beginning to rack up the goals after two strikes at the Euros.
But that was not all for Musiala, who made it a hat-trick of assists on the night as he ran the show, setting up Fullkrug and Pavlovic too.
Another sublime offensive performance from a sublime player, who also made sure he did the dirty work to win the most duals of anyone else on the pitch (9)

MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
8’ - SZOBOSZLAI OFF THE LINE! Germany force a corner which is whipped in from the right and Tah heads the ball towards goal, forcing the Hungary skipper to vitally clear with his head. It's not his usual job, but he showed brilliant defensive instinct there.
20’ GERMANY SHOULD BE AHEAD! It was a brilliant Germany move, all it needed was the finish! Wirtz takes a great touch to get past his defender and Musiala overlaps, but knows he's tight on the line so holds his run. Wirtz finds him and then the Bayern Munich player lays it off to Fullkrug on the right, whose one-on-one effort is straight at the goalkeeper's feet.
27’ - GOAL!!! - GERMANY 1-0 HUNGARY (FULLKUG): There's the opener! Another flowing Germany move sees Andrich play a deep cross from the right to David Raum at the back post, who lays the ball to Musiala who squares for Fullkrug to tap home. There was a concern he was offside, but the goal has been cleared by VAR. Germany lead!
33’ - HAVERTZ COMES SO CLOSE TO A GERMANY SECOND! The Arsenal striker meets a cross at the back post and sends a thumping header past the goalkeeper but is denied by the bar, before the ball drops just on the wrong side of the goal line. He thought it was in!
45’ - HAVERTZ BLASTS WIDE! Germany fly forward and Havertz receives the ball on the right, cuts inside onto his left and sends the ball flashing across the face of the goal! They really should have a second.
58’ - GOAL!!! - GERMANY 2-0 HUNGARY (MUSIALA): From one end to the other and Germany double their lead! It's simply wonderful from Musiala, who is played through on goal by Wirtz in his own half, drives through the Hungary half while holding off pressure from two defenders before slotting the ball into the bottom corner.
66’ - GOAL!!! - GERMANY 3-0 HUNGARY (WIRTZ): And there it is! Musiala finds Wirtz on the edge of the box, who takes a touch to get the ball out of his feet and then sneaks a low effort in at the near post. Game, set, match!
78’ - GOAL!!! - GERMANY 4-0 HUNGARY (PAVLOVIC): It's all too easy for Germany, who extend their lead through a scrappy strike from substitute Aleksandar Pavlovic which squeezes under the goalkeeper.
81’ - PENALTY TO GERMANY! Havertz is hauled down in the box and he has the chance to finally find the back of the net from the spot after a painfully unlucky night!
81’ - GOAL!!! - GERMANY 5-0 HUNGARY (HAVERTZ): Havertz rolls the penalty into the bottom right corner and Germany have a fifth!
