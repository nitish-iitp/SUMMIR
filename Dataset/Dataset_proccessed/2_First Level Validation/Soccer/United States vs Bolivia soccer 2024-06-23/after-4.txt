USMNT Beats Bolivia: Full Group Results Ahead of KO Bracket for 2024 Copa America

The United States Men's National Team wasted no time building early momentum at the 2024 Copa America.

The Americans defeated Bolivia 2-0 in Sunday's group stage game at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. They are in ideal position in Group C with an opening win, and failing to advance to the knockout stage at this point would be a massive disappointment.

Christian Pulisic buried the opening goal just three minutes into the contest, while Folarin Balogun also found the back of the net. Goalkeeper Matt Turner and the defense kept Bolivia off the score sheet, and it was a fairly straightforward win.

Here is a look at the full group standings after the United States' victory.

Group D

If there was any lingering doubt whether the United States would cruise against an overmatched Bolivia side, Pulisic quickly removed it.

He got the ball right back after a short corner kick and fired an incredible shot from the top left-hand corner of the box to put his side ahead in the third minute. It was an unbelievable shot that continued to rise all the way until it settled in the top corner of the net and made it fairly clear that Sunday would bring a favorable result for the Red, White and Blue.

Captain America was far from done.

He received a pass near midfield shortly before halftime and turned around to find nothing but space. He carried it through that space, forced the defense to collapse and then found Balogun on his left.

The forward capitalized on the opportunity and put the Americans ahead 2-0 before intermission.

Halftime did nothing to change the momentum, as the Americans continued to create the chances and dominate play.

They had what would have been a third goal taken off the board because of an offside call, and Pulisic then weaved his way through multiple defenders only for his shot to be turned away by goalkeeper Guillermo Viscarra.

It was a credit to Viscarra that it wasn't a complete blowout by the 70th minute, but the United States was still in full control.

PEPI DENIED OH NO 😅<br><br>Guillermo Viscarra with an impressive save for Bolivia 🧤 <a href="https://t.co/LFR9d7HKrV">pic.twitter.com/LFR9d7HKrV</a>

A third goal seemed inevitable throughout the second half, but Viscarra continued to turn the constant attack away. Ricardo Pepi had multiple opportunities right on the doorstep but was unable to convert.

A glass half-empty approach would say the Americans should have won by four or five goals given how much better they were than the competition, but they will surely take the three points and move forward.
