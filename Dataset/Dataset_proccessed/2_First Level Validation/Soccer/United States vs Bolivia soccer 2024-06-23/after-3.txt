Did the USMNT do enough to impress vs. Bolivia?

Christian Pulisic scored in the third minute and assisted on Folarin Balogun's goal in the 44th as the United States cruised past Bolivia 2-0 in its Copa América opener Sunday night in Arlington, Texas.

Pulisic joined Clint Dempsey as the only U.S. players with a goal and an assist in a Copa América match. Pulisic also reached 30 goals in 69 international appearances, the fewest games needed to make the mark among Americans.

"We came out flying with a lot of intensity. Obviously, that early goal helped us a lot," Pulisic said. "All around, a pretty dominant performance. I think we could have put it away and had more goals there."

Among six invited guests to South America's championship, the U.S. is expected to advance from Group C to the quarterfinals along with Uruguay.

"It's a start that's massive for us. Build the confidence," American defender Antonee Robinson said. "If we were being picky, we could have been a lot more clinical. We could have put another two, three goals away."

Bolivia lost its 13th straight Copa América match dating to 2015, and it has one win in its past 31.

The 11th-ranked U.S. will play Panama on Thursday in Atlanta and will close the group against Uruguay on July 1 in Kansas City, Missouri. No. 84 Bolivia will meet Uruguay on Thursday at East Rutherford, New Jersey, then will face Panama on July 1 in Orlando, Florida.

A crowd of 47,873 attended Sunday's match under the retractable roof at 80,000-seat AT&T Stadium, which will host a World Cup semifinal in two years. It was 97 degrees Fahrenheit outside the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys at kickoff but air-conditioned inside.

American goalkeeper Matt Turner, playing a day before his 30th birthday, had three saves in his 25th international shutout.

The U.S. improved to 6-0 at AT&T Stadium as the Americans opened their fifth Copa América appearance, the first since reaching the semifinals as co-host in 2016.

The U.S. had 18 touches inside the attacking penalty area in the first half, and Bolivia had none.

Pulisic put the U.S. ahead 2:23 in, the fastest American goal in 34 competitive matches against South American opponents. He played a short corner kick to Timothy Weah and ran toward the penalty area. Weah returned the ball to Pulisic, who took a touch and from just inside the area curled a right-foot shot off the outstretched fingertips of goalkeeper Guillermo Viscarra and into the far upper corner for his 30th international goal.

Balogun doubled the lead when he received a pass from Pulisic, took several touches and threaded a low, left-foot shot along the ground past defender Jesús Sagredo and inside Viscarra's far post for his fourth goal in 13 appearances.

Balogun put the ball in the net again in the 53rd minute off a pass from Weah, but the Juventus winger was whistled for offside when he received the ball from Weston McKennie in the buildup, a decision confirmed in a video review.

American midfielder Tyler Adams, regaining fitness after a back injury, played the first half in his first start for club or country since March 30. Adams and Balogun were inserted into the starting lineup in place of Yunus Musah and Ricardo Pepi in the two changes from the lineup designated for a 1-1 exhibition draw against Brazil on June 12.

Musah replaced Adams at the start of the second half, and Pepi entered in the 65th minute.

Viscarra pushed Pepi's 79th-minute shot over the crossbar then stopped Pepi in the 90th on a point-blank initial attempt and another off the rebound.
