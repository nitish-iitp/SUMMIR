Prediction: 1-1

	

Austria

Stadion Stozice will be the centre of attention when Slovenia and Austria lock horns in the UEFA Nations League encounter. Slovenia did well to book their place in the EURO 2024 last 16, but Portugal eventually proved to be a big catch for Jan Oblak and Co. Matjaz Kek’s troops now aim to kickstart their Nations League campaign in style and they are likely to go all guns blazing at Austria. A man to watch in the home team will be Leipzig attacker Benjamin Sesko, who is likely to prove a handful for the opposition back-line.

The Austrians, on the other hand, aim to recover from the EURO 2024 loss to Turkey. As Crvena Zvezda target Marko Arnautovic and Co. will go for a win as well, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score. Real Madrid defender David Alaba remains in the recovery room, but Borussia Dortmund midfielder Marcel Sabitzer made the cut.

HIGHLIGHTED PLAYER (MIHA ZAJC):

Born in Sempeter pri Gorici, Slovenia, Miha Zajc started his career in Interblock, recording only five appearances before moving to NK Olimpia on a loan deal. In season 2013/14, the attacking midfielder made 13 appearances in the Slovenian Prva Liga, netting 5 goas in the process.

After yet another loan deal, now with Celje, Miha Zajc moved to NK Olimpia on a permanent deal. The player can perform as an attacking midfielder and as a central midfielder. During his 81 appearances for NK Olimpia, Zajc scored 20 goals and recorded 12 assists, which was good enough for the Empoli officials to sign the 24-year-old for about €1.7 million.

In 2017/18, Zajc helped Empoli win Serie B with 8 goals and 14 assists. Thanks to his good performances, he made his debut for Slovenia national team in March 2016 and has played in 5 games so far, with one goal on his tally.

HIGHLIGHTED TEAM (AUSTRIA):

Austria is one of Europe’s oldest national football teams and they enjoyed plenty of success during the 1930’s, earning the nickname Wunderteam in the process. Das Team achieved a fourth-place finish at the second World Cup in 1934, before finishing in third place at the 1954 finals. However, Austria have since participated at another five World Cup finals, never getting past the first knockout stage.

Das Team were even more disappointing in the European Championship qualifying campaigns, failing to qualify for 12 straight tournaments before appearing at the 2008 finals as co-hosts. However, Austria made it to the Euro 2016 in style, winning nine of ten qualifiers to suggest the team may be on the path to return to old glory days.

Former Bayern Munich midfielder Andreas Herzog is the team’s most capped footballer with 103 appearances, whereas Toni Polster is the most prolific striker with 44 goals in 95 outings. Matthias Sinderlar, Ernst Ocwirk, Herbert Prohaska and Hans Krankl are some of the most notable players to have represented Austria over the years.
