Despite the domestic season being just a few weeks old, we’re already pausing for an international break. It’s time for the joys of the UEFA Nations League.

In Ljubljana on Friday evening, Slovenia and Austria go head-to-head in League B. Both teams will be looking to make a pleasing start to the campaign. Read on for our Slovenia vs Austria predictions.

Slovenia vs Austria prediction

For the Slovenia vs Austria match prediction, we believe the final score will be a 2-1 win for Austria based on our analysis.

The Slovenians performed with credit at the Euros in Germany a few months ago, but so did the Austrians, who appear to have a bit more firepower, which could make all the difference.

Our tips and predictions for this fixture are as follows:

Slovenia vs Austria head-to-head statistics

This will be the first time that the pair have ever met in the UEFA Nations League. When they faced off in Euro 2020 qualifying back in 2019, the Austrians won by a goal to nil at this venue, also winning 1-0 at home.

Slovenia vs Austria preview

This match will be played on 06/09/2024 at Stadion Stožice. Kick off will be at 19:45 GMT.

This will be the first time that either side has entered the pitch since both exited the European Championships at the Round of 16 stage.

The Slovenians very much held their own at Euro 2024, making it out of the groups without tasting defeat, while they pushed the Portuguese all the way to penalties, and could arguably have won the game before that.

The men managed by Matjaž Kek will now be looking to kick on and improve, which is exactly what this Nations League campaign gives them the opportunity to do.

For the Austrians, the Euros also went well, at least, it went well up to a point. During the groups, they impressed massively, stunning the Dutch in the final round of games to top a group that also contained the French.

After such exploits, they were fancied to go deep into the competition, though the Turks ended those hopes first time out in the knockouts. With that disappointment now behind them, this improving footballing nation will be looking to remind people that they’re looking for a seat at the table with the big boys.

Slovenia vs Austria Betting tips

As these two nations go head-to-head in the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana, I’m going with just a single stab in the betting.

Stefan Posch to be Booked

Austrian defender Stefan Posch was a fixture in the team at Euro 2024 and that’s not likely to change now.

The Bologna man is clearly a key part of Ralf Rangnick’s plans. His physical presence and ball-winning is integral to the way the Austrians play, that’s for sure. We also saw that all round, he's a pretty smart full back, delivering some of the best performances all those in his position at the tournament in Germany.

However, while his defensive and physical qualities certainly aid the side for the most part, his lack of discipline and eagerness to commit fouls can be a hindrance, while it also typically earns the 27-year-old plenty of attention from the man in the middle.

At the Euros, Posch was only booked once, but I think it’s fair to say that he walked a tightrope in most games and was fortunate not to receive further cards, committing ten fouls in four games, more than any other Austrian player.

Domestically, the wide defender is no stranger to collecting cards either. He’s already been booked for Bologna in Serie A this term, while he averaged 0.26 cards per game.

Defending from the right, Posch could have his hands full on Friday evening, as Slovenia’s best angle of attack came down the left hand side during the Euros, especially with marauding full-back Erik Janza overlapping at every opportunity, so don’t be surprised if he goes into the book after some typically overzealous and clumsy challenges.
