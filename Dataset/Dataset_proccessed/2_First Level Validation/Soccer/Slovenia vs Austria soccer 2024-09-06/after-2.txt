Slovenia vs Austria Preview
Tournament: UEFA Nations League
Date: Friday, 6ᵗʰ September
Kick-off time: 6:45 PM GMT
Venue: Stadion Stozice, Slovenia

Slovenia will be welcoming Austria for a UEFA Nations League B Group 3 contest. The match will begin the journey for the two nations in a bid to gain promotion to the first tier in 2025. Slovenia and Austria are joined by Kazakhstan and Norway in the group. Ralf Rangnick’s Austria is the favourite to top the group. While Slovenia has not scored in its last two matches, Austria has not kept a clean sheet in seven games. Both countries had an impressive run in the Euros and will look to back those displays in the UEFA Nations League.

Slovenia will have mixed feelings about its recent results. The nation has accumulated five draws and a solitary victory against Armenia in the last six matches. However, the analysis is not so simple regarding this form. Three of these draws were the reason Slovenia managed to qualify for the knockout stages of the UEFA Euro 2024. Coach Matjaz Kek was aware of his side’s limitations in front of the goal and hence devised a compact defensive plan. It will be difficult for Slovenia to replicate the same dedication in the Nations League with the players already tired after their club commitments.

Austria has undergone a complete transformation under Ralf Rangnick. The German coach rejected the likes of Bayern Munich to stay with the national team before the Euros. Austrian fans were grateful for the decision as their heroes topped a group containing France, the Netherlands, and Poland. His style of counter-pressing and vertical football has brought the best out of his players. Anything other than a first-place finish in the current edition of the Nations League will be considered a massive disappointment.

Slovenia vs Austria Team News
Slovenia National Football Team News
Matjaz Kek, the head coach of Slovenia

Matjaz Kek will once again set up his side in a 4-4-2 formation. The two lines of four provide him with extra defensive cover which is the ultimate key to his gameplan. Jan Oblak will be the captain looking to guide his backline against the Austrian attacking threat. Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko will lead the line and be the main focal point and goal threat for his country.

Ralf Rangnick, the head coach of Austria

Ralf Rangnick’s preferred 4-2-3-1 shape brought him great success at the European Championship. He will see no reason to divert from that plan. Gegenpressing is the ultimate principle in the 66-year-old’s book and the 4-2-3-1 allows him to do just that. Unfortunately, Florian Grillitsch of Hoffenheim will be out of the action due to a muscle injury. David Alaba is also on the sidelines with his return from ACL injury scheduled around November.

Predicted Line-Ups

Slovenia Predicted Line-Up (4-4-2): Oblak; Balkovec, Stojanovic, Drkusic, Janza; Sporar, Elsnik, Cerin, Bijol; Mlakar, Sesko

Austria Predicted Line-Up (4-2-3-1): Pentz; Posch, Danso, Lienhart, Mwene; Seiwald, Laimer, Baumgartner; Schmid, Sabitzer, Arnautovic

Head-to-Head Stats

Austria and Slovenia have faced each other three times in the past. The Austrians have maintained the upper hand on all occasions with an aggregate score of 5-0. Slovenia’s last official victory came all the way back in November 2023 which does not provide much hope to the fans for reversing the fortunes against Austria.

Last Three H2H Results:

Slovenia 0-1 Austria (2019, Euro Qualifiers)

Austria 1-0 Slovenia (2019, Euro Qualifiers)

Austria 3-0 Slovenia (2018, International Friendlies)

Key Players to Watch in Slovenia vs Austria
Jan Oblak (Slovenia)
Jan Oblak for Atletico Madrid

The Atletico Madrid legend will be playing in his 70ᵗʰ game for Slovenia against Austria. The 31-year-old has been a regular feature for the national teams since his debut in 2012. His performances in the Euros were one of the biggest reasons why Slovenia went past the group stages, conceding just one goal. Oblak’s start to the season has been a decent one, keeping two clean sheets in his three outings and he will look to carry on the form to the international stage.

Konrad Laimer (Austria)
Konrad Laimer for Bayern Munich

Konrad Laimer is the perfect holding midfielder for Ralf Rangnick’s system. Having worked at RB Leipzig under Rangnick’s principles, Laimer has adopted the techniques of German football perfectly. He is a pressing machine in the midfield, with a tremendous work rate. The 27-year-old can also slot in at right-back and has a sumptuous tackling ability. Konrad Laimer has 40 appearances to his name for Austria with four goals in his bag.

Slovenia vs Austria Prediction

Slovenia will face an uphill task to capture anything from the contest against Austria. Jan Oblak and his backline can expect to endure a busy night with several chances being created by the opposition. It will be a splendid spectacle for the viewers with the hosts adopting a pragmatic style of play while the visitors attempt to cause havoc owing to their high-pressing. In the end, Ralf Rangnick’s men should have enough to take the three points home.

Predicted Score: Slovenia 0-3 Austria
