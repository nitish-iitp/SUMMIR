Namibia set for crucial AFCON Group J qualifiers against Zimbabwe
 October 7, 2024
 Football Sierra Leone

Namibia set for crucial 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) Group J qualifying matches against Zimbabwe. The team will play two important games against Zimbabwe on October 10 and October 14, 2024, in South Africa.

Bottom of the group having lost their opening two matches against Cameroon and Kenya in the race to Morocco, Namibia looks to review their chances against Zimbabwe.

The squad announcement comes at a critical point in their AFCON campaign, and the technical team will be relying on key players to perform well during the two matches. Both matches against Zimbabwe will take place in South Africa on neutral ground and are expected to be closely contested due to the rivalry between the two nations.

Namibia’s squad and tactics are crucial as they aim to qualify for AFCON 2025. The team will train in South Africa to refine their strategy and prepare for the challenges ahead. Their campaign now depends on their performance against Zimbabwe. Victory could propel them into a strong position, while defeat would jeopardize their chances.

Namibia must win at least of this month’s ties to revive their qualification hopes.
