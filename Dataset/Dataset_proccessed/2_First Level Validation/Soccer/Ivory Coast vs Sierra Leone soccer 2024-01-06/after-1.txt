Jean-Louis Gasset‘s Elephant eased to a 5-1 victory over their visitors, Sierra Leone, at Laurent Pokou Stadium with three first-half goals on Saturday.

Diomand Othman opened the 2023 Cup of Nations host in the 18 minutes when headed home a Jeremie Boga cross before Franck Kessie doubled their lead just after the half-hour mark.

Three more goals were scored from Jonathan Bamba, Jeremie Boga and Amani Lazare in the 38, 48 and 84th minutes, respectively, which were enough for the home team.

Sierra Leone’s only goal came through Rodney Michael’s fine finish assisted by Abu Komeh in the 86th minute as consolation.

The tie was part of the Ivorian’s preparation for the 34th edition of the continent’s biggest footballing event to run from 13 January to 11 February 2024 in Abidjan, Yamoussoukro, Bouake, San Pedro, and Korhogo.

Sierra Leone’s next friendly is against Morocco next Thursday at the same venue.
