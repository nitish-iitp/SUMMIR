This is why Eritrea jumped ship.

This is not the first time that this African nation has been excluded from international competitions, as it frequently experiences the abandonment of players and its squad is always depleted. It is worth mentioning that the country has a very strict regime, considered one of the worst in the world, which has led several players to leave their national team in search of a better life.

They said no to the World Cup!

Although the 2026 World Cup, to be hosted by Mexico, the United States and Canada, is almost two years away, the World Cup qualifiers have already begun in different parts of the world to determine the qualifiers. The Eritrean team had the right to compete for a place in the tournament, but decided to quit for fear that its players would defect from the team.

Jane Thabantso, the voice of experience

Obviously the spotlight of this match will be focused on Jane Thabantso, the experienced player from Lesotho wants to be the missing piece in the formation of the winning key to get the three points to advance to the next round, also, his great physical condition allows him to be skillful and fast every time he touches the ball inside the box.

Macauley Bonne is the key goal scorer on the left side:

For a game where the Zimbabwe national team needs to take three points to climb up their group standings, players like Macauley Bonne will have to be called upon, Zimbabwe's left winger has been characterized as a decisive player inside the box, likewise, his vast experience in Danish soccer has allowed him to improve his individual skills to be an important element in the starting eleven.

This is where the three World Cup points will be at stake

The venue chosen to host a qualifying match for the 2026 World Cup will be the Orlando Stadium, a sports pavilion located in the city of Johannesburg in South Africa. This historic stadium of that country has a capacity to hold a total of 46,000 spectators in its seats. Also, this is one of the newest stadiums in that country since it was inaugurated on November 22, 2008 to host the 2010 World Cup and the 2009 Confederations Cup. This venue, when necessary, can host Rugby matches, having several game options throughout the year.

What can we expect from this game? Let me give you a hint...

Let's put ourselves in the context of this match, Zimbabwe receives Lesotho in the framework of matchday 3 of the World Cup qualifiers on the African continent, then, we must take into account that both teams are in Group C, where Zimbabwe and Lesotho are tied with 2 points, however, it is Rwanda who dominates in first place with two wins so far. The fact is that both Zimbabwe and Lesotho are in equal conditions as they have not lost so far in the qualifiers but neither have managed to win in the last 180 minutes played, however, the home advantage could weigh in favor of Zimbabwe so in matches like these where there is so much equality of conditions, the winner will be defined by the one who makes fewer mistakes in the defensive zone.

How are things going in Africa on the road to the 2026 World Cup?

For now, in the continent where man comes from, we are halfway through the World Cup qualifiers and although there is still a long way to go to know the representatives of this confederation, for now, there are already teams that are preparing to take the lead in their groups such as: Egypt in Group A, Senegal in Group B, Rwanda in Group C, in Group D Cameroon, in Group E Morocco, in Group F Ivory Coast or Gabon, in Group G Algeria and in Group H Namibia or Tunisia.

We have to give it our all because we want to go to the 2026 World Cup.

Another season in the world of soccer is over, however, that does not mean that the soccer activity in the world is over because it is time for several nations to continue their journey towards the next World Cup to be played in Mexico, United States and Canada, in addition, this will be the first World Cup competition that will have the presence of 48 countries instead of 32, 16 more slots compared to the last World Cup, so these qualifiers become much more important for each nation that wants to be present. Therefore, we will see many players give their best performance on the field with which they will try to help their national team to get three points and take a step closer to the next World Cup, since a defeat could jeopardize all the dreams of an entire country, for the moment, there is a long way to go to meet the lucky ones but there is little left to continue shouting international goals.
