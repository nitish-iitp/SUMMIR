Uruguay knock out Brazil in Copa quarterfinal shootout

Uruguay beat Brazil 4-2 in a penalty shootout on Saturday after a bruising 0-0 draw to march into the semifinals of the Copa América, where they will face Colombia.

Sergio Rochet saved Brazil's first penalty in the shootout from Éder Militão, and his teammate Douglas Luiz hit the post to give Uruguay the upper hand.

Although keeper Alisson Becker denied José María Giménez and Gabriel Martinelli scored to keep Brazil alive, Manuel Ugarte buried the decisive spot kick as Uruguay advanced.

With Vinícius Júnior suspended for Brazil and watching from the stands, Dorival Junior's side struggled to create opportunities despite having a man advantage late in the second half when Uruguay's Nahitan Nández was sent off.

"It was a very tense match, against a very tough opponent, suffering in the last minutes a man down. But we showed character despite our youth," Rochet said.

"To finish with penalties and winning, I was able to save one ... The truth is that it is a tremendous happiness that this group deserves, the country deserves it. We are very excited, so we are going for more."

In a bruising encounter with 41 fouls from both teams, players from both sides were involved in physical battles across the pitch.

Brazil forward Endrick, 17, was on the receiving end of brutal challenges as a high-pressing Uruguay refused to give him space to breathe.

On one occasion, Raphinha acted out when Endrick was pushed to the ground by Ronald Araújo as the Brazil skipper retaliated in anger by shoving back before the referee stepped in and had a stern word with both players, keeping his cards in his pocket.

But Araújo's night ended early when he was taken off with an injury after the half-hour mark, and the match suddenly burst into life moments later when Darwin Núñez missed a close-range header.

Within seconds, Raphinha saw his shot on a counterattack thwarted by keeper Rochet, Brazil's best chance of the half.

With Uruguay unable to find a way through, coach Marcelo Bielsa made three substitutions by the 67th minute, but his plans were foiled when Nández saw red following a VAR review for a painful tackle on Rodrygo.

Nández attempted to take the ball off the Brazilian with a studs-up challenge but only ended up catching his ankle. The Real Madrid winger escaped any serious injury and was able to continue.

However, Brazil could not score against 10 men as Uruguay sat back in numbers and shut shop, opting to try their luck in the penalty shootout with no extra time in the Copa América apart from the final.

The Seleção already were without Neymar, who hasn't played since tearing a knee ligament last fall during Brazil's loss to Uruguay in a World Cup qualifier.

That victory was Uruguay's first over Brazil in 13 meetings since 2001, but famed coach Bielsa's Uruguay have now beaten Brazil in back-to-back matches for the first time since 1992.

For Brazil, it is a second straight quarterfinal exit via penalties in a major tournament following their 2022 World Cup loss to Croatia.

"We want to put Brazil at the top, we will continue working and preparing for the World Cup [qualifiers]," Endrick said.

"We know that this is a difficult moment, but we hope to have the support of all Brazilians."
