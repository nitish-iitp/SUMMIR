Click here for Live Updates: India vs Qatar

After a thumping start to their 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup joint qualifiers, India will now shift their focus to the home game against the defending champions of Asia, Qatar.

Bhubaneswar will host the game on November 21 and it is expected to be a housefull contest as reportedly all the tickets have been sold out. Both teams come into this game with a win in their opening matches which makes the contest even more enticing.

On that note, let us take a look at how things stand ahead of the game.

The Stakes
India

The stakes are very high for the Blue Tigers as they are the home side. India have a tremendous home record this year and are unbeaten so far on their home soil. They come into this game on the back of a motivating 0-1 away win over Kuwait.

It was India’s first away win this year and they’ll want to capitalise on their newly found confidence. They have begun their qualifiers on the right note and will want to continue in the same fashion come Tuesday.

Qatar

The defending Asian Champions have made their first-ever trip to India and will want to make it a memorable one. Just like their counterparts India, they also began their campaign with a win over Afghanistan. 

The Maroons tore Afghanistan to shreds and handed them an embarrassing 8-1 defeat at home. They will also want to improve their already good-looking head-to-head record against India come Tuesday.

Injury & Team News

Both sides are expected to field the same line-up as they did in their first match. Brandon Fernandes (India) was injured for the previous game and is likely to make a comeback. Manvir Singh is injured and is expected to not feature in the game. He didn't attend training as well.

Indian Captain Sunil Chhetri is going to play a huge role in India's game against Qatar. His experience on the field and guidance for the young players will be the key for India's success. Moreover, he has been contributing regulary for the team with his time to time goals that keeps the Blue Tigers on the forefront in every game.

Almoez Ali is Qatar’s man in form at the moment. The 27-year-old comes into this game after scoring four goals against Afghanistan in the last encounter. The right winger is quick with his feet and can trouble anyone on his day. He will surely be a point of concern for the Indian backline given the kind of form he is in.

India has conceded just one goal against Qatar in their last two matches.
Both India and Qatar are level on points in Group A (3).
