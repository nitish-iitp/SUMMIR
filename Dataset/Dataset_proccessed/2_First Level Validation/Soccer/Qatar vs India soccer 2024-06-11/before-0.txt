India will attempt to secure their spot in the third round of 2026 World Cup qualifying when they travel to Doha for Tuesday's meeting with Qatar.

The hosts have already assured of a spot in the next qualifying stage after taking 13 points from their five matches.

Qatar may have appeared at the 2022 World Cup as hosts, but they have never achieved qualification for football's biggest tournament.

While there is still a long way to go in the current campaign, Qatar can be pleased with their efforts in the second stage, having outperformed India, Afghanistan and Kuwait.

They began their qualifying bid for the 2026 World Cup with four consecutive victories, securing their spot in the next round with two games to spare.

With little to play for in the current international window, a relatively inexperienced Qatar side had to settle for a goalless draw in Thursday's meeting with Afghanistan in Saudi Arabia.

The reigning Asia Cup champions will now turn their focus to Tuesday's fixture, where they will attempt to extend their unbeaten run to 10 matches in all competitions.

In contrast to their hopes, India still have work to do if they are to keep their hopes alive of reaching their first World Cup finals.

India are sitting in second position and level on five points with third-placed Afghanistan while having a slender one-point advantage over the group's bottom side Kuwait.

Igor Stimac's side had to settle for a goalless draw in Thursday's home game against Kuwait, leaving them without a win in seven competitive matches.

India's all-time appearance holder and record run scorer Sunil Chhetri made his final appearance for his country in the stalemate, having decided to call time on his 19-year international career.

While Chhetri heads off into the sunset, India will now go in search of a win that would secure them a place in the third stage, barring a significant swing in goal difference.

A draw would also be enough if the group's other game finishes all square, while a defeat would result in elimination.

Qatar forward Yusuf Abdurisag will serve a one-match suspension, having collected two yellow cards during the qualifying campaign.

Marquez could be tempted to freshen up his side, with Abdullah Al-Ahrak, Mahdi Al-Mejaba and Mohamed Khaled Gouda all pushing for starting spots after featuring as substitutes in Thursday's draw.

As for the visitors, they can no longer call upon Chhetri after India's talisman bid farewell to the international stage in Thursday's draw with Kuwait.

Mumbai City's Vikram Partrap will be available for selection after missing the draw with Kuwait due to suspension.


Qatar possible starting lineup:
Al-Sheeb; Yousif, Aiash, Marei, Al-Amin; Mashaal, Al-Ahrak; Gouda, Al-Mejaba, Al-Hassan; Al-Rawi

India possible starting lineup:
Singh Sandhu; Poojary, Bheke, Ali, Gupta; Colaco, S Singh, Thapa, Chhangte; Samad; M Singh



We say: Qatar 2-0 India

Qatar may have named a relatively inexperienced squad for the current international window, but we still think that they have the quality required to claim three points in Tuesday's clash with India.
