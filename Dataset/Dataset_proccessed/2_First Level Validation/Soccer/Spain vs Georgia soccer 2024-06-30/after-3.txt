Thanks for joining us!

Thanks for joining our coverage of the Spain and Georgia clash tonight. It promised goals and it certainly delievered. We'll be back with you tomorrow as the round of 16 continues in Germany.

Make sure you're tuning in to all Mail Sport's coverage of the Euros this summer.

22:01
Yamal looks ahead to Spain's date with Germany

Lamine Yamal, Football Espana:

I’m very happy to make the quarter finals. It was complicated against Georgia and we had to score before half time. We face Germany as we did with this match, it will be difficult, and we’ll prepare with a lot of desire.
21:54
Euro 2024 tournament bracket so far

21:42
Mark your calendars

Friday evening will see Spain and Germany meet in the quarter-final, in a rematch of the Euro 2008 final. Expect to see more than only one goal like there was in that game 16 years ago.

People are saying this could be the final. Maybe. Spain have looked far better but it's a tough task going up against the hosts. I doubt either team is looing forward to this one very much.

21:34
Joyous scenes among the Spanish in Cologne

Spain fans were weren't able to get a ticket for the game watched in delight as their side put Georgia to the sword on Sunday night.

21:27
Results from today's clashes...

I'm sure you're aware but England did manage to book their place in the quarter-finals of the Euros after a dramatic win over Slovakia.

21:22
Rodri scoops the player of the match award

It ended up being a really competitive race. Yamal, Williams and a few others could certainly make a case but the man who started the Spain scoring gets his hands on the player of the match prize.

Having Rodri in your line-up seems to be the key to winning trophies at club and international level these days.

21:18
Georgia bow out after a stunning campaign

Willy Sagnol has led his team of heroes to the last-16 in their first ever amjor tournament. We've seen so called minnows make an impact at the Euros before making it to the World Cup.

And that will be the aim for this team. With the individual quality their possess in attack, who would doubt them?

21:13
Luis de la Fuente's side come from behind to reach quarter-finals of Euro 2024, writes IAN HERBERT

A far greater challenge lies just up the road for Spain — Friday’s night last eight collision with Germany which looks like the de facto tournament final by any other name — so just as well that they go armed with prodigies on either flank.

The 16-year-old basking in limelight on the right, Lamine Yamal, has rather obscured the significance the talent of Nico Williams on the opposite flank, and in one moment of electricity last night, he revealed what the hosts are up against.

A precise long ball in his direction and the 21-year-old was sprinting away, leaving Georgia for dead with a ball into the roof the net which wrapped up a challenging night. The customary jig followed. That’s how you dispense with a defiant, indefatigable counter-attacking opponent.

Mail Online

21:06
More evidence of Williams' talent

There's a lot of chatter on social media that he is a shoo-in for the young player of the tournament award. But I'm struggling to think of a more impressive player in this tournament full stop.

At this rate he'll scoop both prizes.

21:03
Spain 4-1 Georgia MATCH FACTS

It paints the dominant picture we've just witnessed. Thirty-five shots, 75 per cent of the ball and an average rating of nearly 7.5. Impressive stuff from Spain.

As for Georgia, they managed to get on the scoresheet without having a shot on target. And they of course will be delighted with their efforts in this their maiden tournament.

21:01
Mamard­ashvili goes out with his head held high and his palms STINGING

The Valencia keeper has gained a lot of admirers in this tournament and he showed why, despite his country's thumping defeat.

The Georgian made 20 saves during the side's Euro campaign, a number only bettered by Russia's Akinfeev at Euro 2008.

20:51
FT: Spain 4-1 Georgia

Georgia's adventure is over. But they gave everything they had. Unfortunately for them, they may have played the side who will go on to win whole the tournament.

Despite going behind, De la Fuente's side kept their cool and scored four superb goals. Each with quality many teams in this competition will find hard to match.

Really impressive stuff. Next stop, Stuttgart on Friday to face the hosts Germany.

20:51
Spain put their faith in youth

Three of the six youngest players to score and assist in the Euros are Spanish. Williams added his name to that of Fabregas and Ferran Torres.

20:49,
90'
It's raining, well, rain, and SHOTS

Spain have had 32 shots tonight and counting. There's three additional minutes. Let's see if they can reach 40.

20:45
WATCH! Olmo add the finishing touches to a fine display

20:41,
83'
GOAL! Spain 4-1 Georgia (Olmo)

We've seen some unbelievable goals from this Spain team tonight and Olmo's effort is no different. The midfielder takes a stunning first touch before curling an effort into the corner past the keeper.

Beautiful stuff from this devestating side.

20:40,
80'
It won't go in Yamal! Spain 3-1 Georgia

The youngster is so close to breaking that major tournament record, which would probably stand for a long long time. The winger played a clever onw-two and was through on goal but wasn't able to divert his shot beyond the onrushing keeper.

20:37
WATCH! Williams' STUNNING goal

20:33,
75'
GOAL! Spain 3-1 Georgia (Williams)

Blimey. That was breathtaking by Williams. The youngster took on his man, skinned him with ease and then lashed a shot into the roof of the net.

That feels like game over. You do not want to play Spain in this tournament with Yamal and Williams on the wings.

20:33,
73'
BALL IN THE NET! Spain 2-1 Georgia

De le Fuente's side have the ball in the net after more great work from Yamal but Georgia receive a reprieve with the offside flag.

20:28,
69'
Big chance for the substitute! Spain 2-1 Georgia

Tsitaishvili has just come onto the pitch and he's squandered a great chance to draw his side level. The wing-back had acres of space on the edge of the box but rushed his attempt and saw the shot skew well wide of the mark.

20:26,
65'
Changes for La Roja! Spain 2-1 Georgia

Morata's ight is over, as is Cucurella's. In there place come Grimaldo and Oyarzabal.

20:24,
63'
Sagnol rings the changes! Spain 2-1 Georgia

And they're attacking. Giorgi Tsitaishvili and Zuriko Davitashvili come on for Luka Lochoshvili and Giorgi Chakvetadze.

A striker and midfielder on for a defender and midfielder.

20:21
Yamal joins an exclusive group

The Barcelona youngster has joined Cristiano Ronaldo in becoming a teenager to register multiple assists at the European Championship.

20:19
What will Willy do?

The Frenchman insisted that his team were just happy to be here but on the evidence of their first-half display, Georgia arrived with a clear gameplan to hurt Spain.

Now behind, what can they do? Difficult to see how they can change the plan. Sagnol will have to hope for a moment of magic from one of his star men.

20:13
WATCH! Fabian Ruiz give Spain the lead

20:13
WATCH! Kvarat­skhelia's OUTRAGEOUS attempt

20:09,
52'
GOAL! Spain 2-1 Georgia (Ruiz)

This is eerily similar to the first Spain goal in that moments after Mamard­ashvili makes a stunning save, Spain score.

Yamal, who forced a save from the Valencia keeper, puts in a perfect cross that the in-form midfielder nodded in from close range.

Yamal went close to adding to Spain's tally only minutes later. They've got to hang on here.

20:08,
49'
What an effort! Spain 1-1 Georgia

Khvicha Kvarat­skhelia on his weaker foot from well inside his own half just came so close to putting Georgia back in front. It was an insane attempt from the Napoliu star but it nearly came off.

His effort just faded wide, to the relief of Unai Simon.

20:04,
45'
No changes at the break! Spain 1-1 Georgia

Georgia get things back underway in Cologne. Can they get in front again?

20:01
A dominant first-half display from La Roja

De la Fuente's side had 17 shots to Georgia's two. That's a difference of 15 shots - the most on record, apparently.

19:56
Not a bad half of football from Williams

The youngster has been having his way with the Georgia defence so far this evening. He's been the catalyst for a lot of Spain's attacks. Expect that to conitnue after the break as the opposition get more and more tired.

19:48
HT: Spain 1-1 Georgia

It's been a fun one so far. Georgia going ahead certainly helped in that regard but Spain have shown why they are fancied. Rodri's goal just before the break was the least they deserved.

19:46,
45'
Two minutes added on! Spain 1-1 Georgia

Georgia can't wait to hear that whistle. Can they hold out for another couple of minutes?

19:45,
44'
Morata goes into the book! Spain 1-1 Georgia

The Spain captain is given the first yellow card of the game for a naughty little stamp on Georgia;s Kashia. Andros Townsend seems to think there was no malice but I think he's a tad fortunate to get away with just a caution.

19:43
WATCH! Rodri come up BIG yet again

19:39,
38'
GOAL! Spain 1-1 Georgia (Rodri)

It's gutting for Georgia. Mamard­ashvili had made anotehr great save only minutes prior to Rodri sweeping in an shot from the edge of the box with his weak foot.

VAR took a quick look to determine whether Morata - stood in an offside position - was impeding the keeper. But the goal stands and Spain are level.

19:36,
36'
Mamard­ashvili SAVES! Spain 0-1 Georgia

Spain keep knocking on the door and it's Cucurella with the effort from range. The Chelsea fullback fired in a shot that looked destined to find the bottom corner of the net.

But the Valencia stopper was on hand for his second huge save of the first-half. He'll probably need another three or four of those tonight.

19:31,
31'
Georgia carry a threat on counters! Spain 0-1 Georgia

Spain have put themselves into a little situation here. Georgia look dangerous when running at Spain's backline and their buoyed by the goal they already have in the bag.

I wouldn't be surprised to see them score again.

19:28,
27'
Pedri shaves the crossbar! Spain 0-1 Georgia

The little midfielder latches onto a loose ball on the edge of the area ans fires off a half volley with his left foot that goes agonisingly close to the corner. A couple of inches lower and it would be all square.

19:27
OG extends lead in the golden boot race

That's now eight times a player has put through their own net in this tournament. Looks like an unassailable lead for OG to me.

19:24
'Screams of delirium in Cologne'

Ian Herbert, Mail Sport:

Screams of delirium here. From absolutely nowhere, Spain had been suffocating Georgia, when they broke fast and Otar Kakabadze drills a cross from the right which Robin Le Norman diverts into his own net with Khvicha Kvaratskhelia lurking behind him.

19:21
WATCH! Georgia's historic effort against Spain

19:18,
18'
GOAL! Spain 0-1 Georgia (OG Normand)

WOW! After all of that! Georgia take the lead and it was from one of those counters.

Chakvetadze ran in behind and tried to find Khvicha Kvarat­skhelia in the centre but the cross was deflected into his own net from Spain defender Normand.

We've got a game on!

19:17,
16'
Laporte heads wide! Spain 0-0 Georgia

The former Manchester City defender is the one with the chance this time. He lept highest to meet an inswinging corner but could only nod his effort wide.

19:15,
14'
Backs to the wall stuff! Spain 0-0 Georgia

More superb approach play from the 2012 winners. Georgia players are putting their body on the line and are just hoping for that chance to catch the Spanish on the break.

19:12,
11'
SO CLOSE! Spain 0-0 Georgia

Georgia are living dangerously. A cross came in after a short corner and was flicked on by Rodri. Giorgi Mamardashvili was equal to the effort but only moments later Spain were on the attack again with Williams this time.

It's relentless. Feels like a matter of time.

19:10
'Georgia fans are doing their team proud,' says Herbert

Ian Herbert, Mail Sport:

Georgian fans are doing their team proud here and making all the noise but what a clinical start by the Spanish left wing pair of Neco Williams and Marc Cucurella who were so impressive against Italy. Williams is running the show for Spain so far as they camp in the half of the world 75th ranked nation
19:06
Pedri goes close! Spain 0-0 Georgia

It's great play from Spain and the passage nearly leads to a goal. Yamal strode through the Georgia defence and laid it off to Carvajal, who found a stretching Pedri with his low cross.

The Barcelona man wasn't able to get enough purchase on the effort.

19:04
La Roja getting in their groove! Spain 0-0 Georgia

It's the fast start many expected in this one. Spain have been greedy with the ball in the first few minutes and have already thrown a couple of balls into the box thanks to Williams.

Georgia will look to threaten on the counter but this doesn't look manageable for very long.

19:00
And we're underway! Spain 0-0 Georgia

Spain get the action underway. Let's hope we've got more action and drama in store tonight.

19:00
View from the Cologne Stadium

Ian Herbert, Mail Sport

After that bedlam in Gelchenkirchen, it seems rather sober here in Cologne, where the tournament’s lowest ranked team, Georgia, seek to continue to continue their journey against all odds.
Flags of St George resplendent here too – the Georgians take that patron saint too of course
18:54
Players are out onto the pitch

Kick-off only minutes away. I've been hyping this one up bu the last time they played in qualifying Spain won 7-1.

18:43
La Roja get ready for battle

18:42
Pedri set to make some history of his own

Bare with, because this is a slightly convoluted one. Barcelona midfielder Pedri is set to become the player with the most Euros knockout stage starts aged 21 or younger.

I know, not a great stat but he's breaking new ground all the same.

18:39
And breathe...

Don't worry, your Sunday evening has not been ruined. England have managed to squueze into the quarter-finals by the skin of their teeth.

18:33
Warm-ups underway

Players are out onto the pitch for their warm-ups ahead of the clash. We'll bring you some more pics of the stars getting in the zone for the game.

18:28
We're 30 minutes away from kick-off...

Not long left to go until the action gets underway in Cologne. For anyone not watching the England game, update is that the Three Lions are EIGHT minutes away from the quarter-finals.

18:25
Sagnol claims Georgia have already won the Euros

Willy Sagnol, Georgia manager:

Once they have the ball, they know they can do everything they want. Football is not mathematics. Football is not a chess game. You have to play also with your feelings," he told reporters on Saturday.
We will go into this game with a lot of confidence because we have absolutely nothing to lose. For me, we already won the European Championship 2024.
18:19
Laporte showing Saudi's not a problem

The former Manchester City defender looked to have waved goodbye to elite football when he moved to the Saudi Pro League last summer. But he has made the strongest case against those claiming players who went to the league have seen their abilities diminish.

Laporte comes back into the Spain defence this evening, a defence that is yet to concede a goal in this tournament. He's also the only player to have started all four of Spain's games in the Euros.

18:14
De la Fuente vows not to underestimate the European minnows

De la Fuente, Spain manager

We all have seen surprising things happen in football and I don't think that will stop happening. Georgia beat Portugal, we have to respect them as opponents, work hard and take the game with the importance that it has so it doesn't happen to us.
They are fast in the counter-attack and very good in the set-pieces. We need to be vigilant and aware so we don't ended up exposed to counter-attacks in speed.
18:10
A meeting of two elite dribblers

Sticking with Yamal, he is somehow outmatched in the dribbling category than Napoli star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. We could see some records broken tonight for successful take ons.

18:07
Lamine Yamal discovers his school exam results while on national team duty at Euro 2024

In case you somwhow haven't heard about Spain's prodigious talent Lamine Yamal, who is 16-years-old. He was seen earlier in the tournament doing his homework while away with the squad.

according to Cadena Cope, Yamal recently learned that he's passed the exams for his fourth year of ESO - which refers to the third stage of the Spanish education system, with this compulsory for students between the ages of 12 and 16.

The outlet claim that immediately after discovering the results, Yamal phoned up his mother to relay the good news.

Willy Sagnol is the perfect fit for Georgia's passion play as the inspirational coach prepares, writes CRAIG HOPE

Willy Sagnol spends six months of the year in Georgia. For a Frenchman who otherwise lives amid the sedate vineyards of Bordeaux, that is a long time on roads overcrowded by cars and cattle.

Does it drive him mad? Not at all. Rather, it is the manager’s inspiration behind a national team who have won hearts and minds and, against the odds, a place in the knockout rounds at their first major tournament here in Germany.

‘When I took the team three-and-a-half years ago, it took me a little while to understand the culture of the country,’ Sagnol tells me over the phone ahead of Sunday’s game versus Spain.

Excitement building in Cologne

17:45
Georgia in the house!

Here's footage of the players arriving at the ground a little earlier. We'll have some nice pics of them soaking up the atmosphere in the stradium pre-match.

17:41
Georgia fans in full voice

The European minnows have managed to make the knockout stages in their first major tournament and are looking to make even more history in Cologne tonight.

Whatever the outcome, these fans will have a wonderful night watchig their players.

17:40
A meeting of in-form sides

Just look at those average ratings. This is a meetig of two sides that have peformed very well in this tournament so far. Perhaps the most surprising name is Fabia Ruiz.

The central midfielder has been - according to average ratings - the best player in the tournament up until now. And he also has an unbelievable goal to his name as well.

17:36
What Spain side will we see?

The Spain manager made wholesale changes for their final group stage match against Albania. He is expected to return to the side that earned wins against Croatia and Italy.

That would see the deadly winger combination of Williams and Yamal. Can't wait!

17:33
We know you're distracted...

But there is another game taking place today as Euro 2024 swings into the business end of the tournament. While England have toiled, fellow pre-tournament favourites Spain have looked brilliant.

Luis de le Fuente's side have been the most impressive team in the tournament and were the only side to come through the group stages with a perfect record.

They're facing a Gerogia side, participating in their first major tornament, who upset Spain's Iberian neighbours Portugal in their last game.

Spain are heavily backed but don't count out Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Co. We'll have all the news ahead of the 8pm kick-off in Cologne. And make sure you follow us when the game gets underway.

Let's hope England are still in the competition by that point!
