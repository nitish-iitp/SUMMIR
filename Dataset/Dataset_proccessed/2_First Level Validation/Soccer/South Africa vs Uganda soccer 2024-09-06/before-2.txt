Themba Zwane will captain the Bafana Bafana team that will face Uganda and South Sudan in two 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers in the coming days.

Coach Hugo Broos made the announcement to the team after dinner on Tuesday night and the mercurial player will lead the South African senior national side against Uganda at home at Orlando Stadium on Friday, 06 September 2024 (6pm), and away against South Sudan in their second Afcon qualifier on Tuesday, 10 September 2024.

Regular captain and goalkeeper Ronwen Williams is recovering from an injury and is not part of this camp. The team has been hard at work since arriving in camp this week and is fired up to get the Afcon campaign on a positive note.

The Bafana Bafana coach has his full complement of players in camp after Elias Mokwana arrived on Monday night, with Siyabonga Ngezana and Sphephelo Sithole joining the rest of the group on Tuesday morning.

Gates will open at 15h00 on Friday, 06 September 2024 and tickets are priced at R30 (Children, Scholars and Student), R60 for Adults, and R140 for Family (2 adults + 2 children).

The tickets are available at TicketPro, all Spar supermarkets (QuickSpar and SuperSpar), SASOL, ENGEN, SHELL, PowerFashion and JAM Clothing.
