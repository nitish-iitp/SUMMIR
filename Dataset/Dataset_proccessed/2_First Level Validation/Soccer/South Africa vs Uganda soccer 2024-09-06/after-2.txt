South Africa needed a late equalizer deep in stoppage time to snatch a point off an industrious Uganda Cranes team as the two teams faced off on Friday.

In the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations Qualifier game played at Orlando Stadium, Thalente Mbatha scored to force the game into a two-all draw.

South Africa started on the front foot and dominated proceedings with Uganda at sixes and sevens.

Lyle Foster who plies his trade at Burnley fired the hosts into an early lead in the 14th minute, calmly slotting the ball past goalkeeper Isima Watenga.

South Africa had several chances moments later to stretch the lead but Uganda had goalkeeper Watenga to thank, pulling off save after save.

In the second half, Uganda returned a much-improved side with coach Paul Put making a change, introducing Allan Okello in place of Travis Mutyaba.

In the 51st minute, Denis Omedi had yards of space unmarked and decided to shoot from distance. His ferocious strike went straight into the back of the net to level matters.

Two minutes later, Roger Mato almost in a similar fashion shot from distance and this time, goalkeeper Mothwa fumbled with Mato’s effort to grant Uganda the lead.

From then onwards, Uganda absorbed pressure from the hosts and indeed looked like they were taking all three points.

However, substitute Mbatha found the equalizer in the fourth minute of the six added minutes, firing a low drive into the bottom corner.

The result means Congo who defeated South Sudan 1-0 leads Group K with Uganda and South Africa level on one point apiece.

Uganda will return to action on Monday at Mandela National Stadium against Congo.

Uganda Cranes Starting XI: Isima Watenga, Elvis Bwomono, Abdu Aziizi Kayondo, Bevis Mugabi, Elio Capradossi, Khalid Aucho, Ronald Ssekiganda, Travis Mutyaba, Steven Mukwala, Rogers Mato, Denis Omedi

See what happens when you shoot the ball? Congrats to the men especially the goalie and shooters. It’s good to see the team shooting from far and near again. The recent past teams were too timid in front of goal.

The lads need to learn how to close out games though. That will come with exposure and experience.
