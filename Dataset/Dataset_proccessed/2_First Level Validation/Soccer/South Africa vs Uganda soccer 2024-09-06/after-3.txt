Uganda will be aiming for a perfect start when they face off with South Africa at Orlando Stadium in the Group K contest of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.

South Africa come into the game as favourites following their impressive performances at the 2023 AFCON finals where they finished third after beating DR Congo 6-5 on penalties after a goalless stalemate in normal time. They are targeting a 12th continental tournament appearance.

Bafana Bafana also picked out positive results in their most recent World Cup qualifier fixtures with a 1-1 stalemate against Nigeria and their 3-1 win over Zimbabwe in June.

Uganda under the stewardship of Belgian Paul Joseph Put will be aiming to return the continental showpiece since their round of 16 exit to Senegal in 2019.

The Cranes failed to prevail to the 2023 edition in Ivory Coast after finishing third in their qualifying group, with Algeria and Tanzania advancing.

Uganda come into this match after a 2-1 home defeat to Algeria in the World Cup qualifiers in June. They had registered a narrow 1-0 victory over Botswana.

Put who has been at five AFCON finals believes he can guide Uganda to their ninth AFCON finals.

“I have been to 5 AFCON finals and I want to add to that number with this team. You are a group of young and undoubtedly very talented players. You have what it takes to qualify but you need to work hard for it because it will not be given to you just like that. You will have to fight for the right to be in Morocco next year and the fight starts this Friday against South Africa.” Said Put

Team News

The hosts will be without their skipper Ronwen Williams and winger Percy Tau due to injury and personal issues respectively.

Uganda will miss the services of defenders Halid Lwaliwa and Kenneth Semakula due to visa issues but will be available against Congo on Monday.

Head to Head

Both sides have previously met in five previous matches. Bafana Bafana are unbeaten against the Cranes with four wins, one draw and defeated the Cranes 3-2 when the teams last met, in an international friendly at Orlando Stadium in June 2021.
