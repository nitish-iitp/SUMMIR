Khalid Aucho Urges Fans to Rally Behind Team

Uganda Cranes captain Khalid Aucho has sent a strong message to the fans calling upon them to support the team.

On Friday, September 6, 2024, Uganda Cranes will face South Africa in the first game of the upcoming AFCON Qualifiers.

The two countries will lock horns in a highly anticipated game in Johannesburg at Orlando Stadium, and Aucho believes that the fans' support will have a positive impact on the performance.

"I call upon the fans that can make it to the stadiums so that they rally behind the boys (Uganda Cranes)," he stated.

"I know that the boys will be so proud and energetic thus throwing their bodies on the line," he added.

Aucho missed the previous two Uganda Cranes' games due to injury, but the Young Africans' midfielder is excited about his return to the fold.

"I am happy to be back to the team. When I reached the camp I discovered that everyone is fit and ready for the game,"

"I believe that they are focused and ready to offer Ugandans the best as we take on South Africa in a few days to come," he concluded.
