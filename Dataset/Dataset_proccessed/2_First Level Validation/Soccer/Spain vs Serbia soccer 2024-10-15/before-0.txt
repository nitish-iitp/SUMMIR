Showmax subscribers, while your beloved Premier League takes a break, get your fill of football action by streaming the UEFA Nations League on any compatible device from Thursday 10 to Tuesday 15 October 2024.

Showmax will feature no less than 12 UNL matches, starting on Thursday night with the trio of Israel v France, Italy v Belgium and England v Greece.

The Three Lions hosting Greece at Wembley Stadium is a top-of-the-table clash in Group 2 of League B, with Manchester City defender John Stones explaining that he has been impressed with the tweaks made to the team’s playing style by interim manager Lee Carsley.

“Building up from the back, trying to get the lads to show their qualities on the ball and have that patience and belief that they show at their clubs and bring it all together as a collective,” said Stones.

"Everyone has seen a familiar face [Carsley] when we're at St George’s Park. We've always been crossing paths and getting to work with him, for me personally and the lads feel the same, we're trying to make the most of it. Lee and his staff have as well, and we've got two great results out of it.”

Saturday 12 October features a potential thriller at the Narodowy Stadium in Warsaw, as Poland battle Portugal. The latter team racked up successive wins in the last international break in September – with each featuring a goal from Cristiano Ronaldo.

“Dependent on Ronaldo? He’s an incredible player. It’s not dependence, he’s an asset,” said coach Roberto Martinez of the 39-year-old forward. “In front of goal, he’s crucial. His intelligence to open spaces is important. Speaking of dependence doesn’t make sense.”

The pick of matches available on Showmax arrives on Monday night when Germany and the Netherlands clash in a League A, Group 3 meeting at the Allianz Arena in Munich, following on from the cracking 2-2 draw they played out in Amsterdam last month.

In that match, the Dutch opened the scoring early through Tijjani Reijnders, Germany surged ahead through the remainder of the first half thanks to strikes from Deniz Undav and Joshua Kimmich, but the hosts secured a share of the spoils thanks to an equaliser from Denzel Dumfries.

“All in all it was a very entertaining game. Both defences were vulnerable. We were stronger in attack and took more risks. We came back superbly and scored two goals. In the end, we came closest to taking the lead again,” said Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann of the 2-2 against the Dutch.

On Tuesday, Showmax will feature Switzerland v Denmark and Spain tackling Serbia at Nuevo Arcangel Stadium in Cordoba.

Serbia coach Dragan Stojkovic wants another ‘patriotic’ showing from his team after they held La Furia Roja 0-0 when the teams met in Belgrade last month.

“When you wear the jersey of your country, the first and most important thing, it doesn't matter if you play well or not, is to do your best. Everything in your power,” said Stojkovic.

“That's how patriotism is shown, that's how loyalty to the jersey is shown, that's how it is appreciated and loved by the anthem. My heart is full when I see that the players gave their all, it's a satisfaction for the coach. An approach that makes everyone happy.”
