Bakayoko, Issa Kallon start against Ivory Coast
 October 11, 2024

Striker Amadou Bakayoko and Issa Kallon from China are set to play against Ivory Coast. Kallon last played in Turkey in 2022, and midfielder Fornah from Salford City FC is back after receiving a red card against Egypt.

Bakayoko missed matches against Chad and Zambia but hopes to continue his good form for the national team. Sierra Leone will face Ivory Coast in a crucial Africa Cup of Nations Qualification match at the Stade Laurent Pokou in San Pedro.

Coach Amidu Karim’s team is aiming for their first win on the road to Morocco 2025. A win for Ivory Coast could hurt Sierra Leone’s chances.

Also, a debut for U20 right-back Nathanial Jalloh was part of the Sierra Leone team that reached the U20 AFCON for the next year.

Ivory Coast defeated the Leone Stars 5-1 in a friendly match in January 2024. The Leone Stars haven’t won against Ivory Coast in their last eight competitive matches.

Ivory Coast has a 70% win rate in their last ten outings. In Group G, Ivory Coast has secured two wins and is preparing to face winless Sierra Leone.

Group G Fixtures: 

Zambia 0-0 Chad

Cote d’Ivoire vs Sierra Leone
