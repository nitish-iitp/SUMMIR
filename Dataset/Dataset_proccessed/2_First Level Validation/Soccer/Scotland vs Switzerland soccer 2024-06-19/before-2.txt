Scotland have made it to Euro 2024! After the opening-day defeat, the Tartan Army are looking to bounce straight back against the Swiss, and you have to be there to watch all the Scotland vs Switzerland Screenings as they look to batter them like a Mars Bar and show the Euros what they're all about.  

From huge warehouse gatherings beneath even bigger screens to vibrant outdoor fan zones and pulsating indoor club atmospheres, Scotland is rife with events, soundtracked by the pipes, and primed for you to cheer on the boys in blue and white. 

So lace up your boots, grab your scarves, prepare your stomach for the pints, and cheer on Scottish as you do best (oh, and we suppose there are a few events for those of you who have moved down to England too.)

Scroll down and check them out!
