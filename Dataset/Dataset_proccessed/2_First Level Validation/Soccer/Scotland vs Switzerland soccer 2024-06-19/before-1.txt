How Scotland could line up against Switzerland
By Ben Knapton, Senior Reporter

Scotland head coach Steve Clarke will be without the services of the suspended Ryan Porteous for Wednesday's Euro 2024 Group A showdown with Switzerland in Cologne.

The Watford centre-back was deservedly sent off in Friday's 5-1 loss to Germany for a shocking challenge on Ilkay Gundogan inside the area, before Kai Havertz dispatched the resulting penalty.

Referee Clement Turpin initially waved play on before taking a very quick at the monitor and brandishing the red card for Porteous, who is now confirmed to be serving a two-game ban.

While Scott McKenna played his part in forcing an Antonio Rudiger own goal last week, Grant Hanley is the likeliest candidate to line up alongside Kieran Tierney and Jack Hendry in the Scots' back three.

Angus Gunn should have done better with Germany's first and final goals but will keep his place in between the sticks regardless, and the same can be said for Anthony Ralston and skipper Andrew Robertson out wide.

However, Clarke should consider recalling Billy Gilmour into the engine room alongside Manchester United's Scott McTominay, thereby demoting Callum McGregor down to the substitutes' bench.

Ryan Christie and John McGinn ought to be retained in the more advanced positions, but Che Adams - who had just 13 touches of the ball against Germany - could cede his spot to Lawrence Shankland.

Scotland possible starting lineup:
Gunn; Hendry, Hanley, Tierney; Ralston, Gilmour, McTominay, Robertson; McGinn, Christie; Shankland
