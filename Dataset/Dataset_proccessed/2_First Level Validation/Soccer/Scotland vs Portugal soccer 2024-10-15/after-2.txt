The sight of a ranting, raving, gesticulating Cristiano Ronaldo proved the most welcome of all for Scotland’s supporters. The occasion of the Portuguese icon’s 200th start for his country could not deliver either a 134th goal or an away victory at Hampden Park.

As the full-time whistle blew Ronaldo beat a hasty retreat, complaining vehemently as he did so. The apparent cause of his ire was the referee’s refusal to allow time for Portugal to take a corner. The bluntness displayed by Roberto Martínez’s team over the preceding 94 minutes rather suggested this act of officialdom was irrelevant.

Ronaldo’s huff as exhausted Scots took the acclaim of the Tartan Army only endorsed the theory the 39-year-old knows he is a fading force. Sportsmanship is free. “We deserved to win,” said Martínez later. “We kept a clean sheet, we were in control, but we lacked the final pass and the magic inside the area.”

Those with pitchforks pointing in the direction of Steve Clarke could barely have enjoyed this. There was no unwanted making of history, no fifth defeat in succession for Scotland. The run of form extended to one win in 16 games but the approach displayed by the hosts on Glasgow’s south side was one of a team fully committed to their manager.

Scotland will take great heart from the small step made here. Not only did they scrap in a form which was successful prior to recent turmoil but had they a level of organisation which owes plenty to effective coaching. Clarke’s detractors should take note. “It was a good shift,” said Clarke without any hint of understatement.

Ronaldo-mania had gripped Paisley – where Portugal trained on Monday – and their hotel on the banks of Loch Lomond. Ronaldo had looked content to accommodate the masses. The sight of Scottish youngsters in Ronaldo strips at Hampden Park emphasised the theory this was no ordinary fixture.

Ronaldo had never played at this venue before; the Nations League allowed him to follow in the footsteps of Pelé, Maradona, Puskas and Beckenbauer by taking to the Hampden pitch. Martínez spoke of managing Ronaldo’s minutes before this tie but picked him to spearhead the attack. Were the Scots not so desperately in need of an upward trajectory, they could have appreciated the moment.

Another former Manchester United player should have opened the scoring inside four minutes. Instead, Scott McTominay planted a free header from Andy Robertson’s cross straight into the hands of Diogo Costa.

Scotland’s issue in the opening half-hour was the concession of more free-kicks than would ordinarily be healthy within 30 yards of their own goal. Yet the visitors were wasteful until a dipping set play from Nuno Mendes forced Craig Gordon into action. This had quickly developed into a scrappy, tight affair. Hampden was reduced to laughter as Ronaldo and Mendes botched another free-kick between them. It was already that kind of evening.

McTominay’s chance proved the only clear one of the first period. For all Portugal’s dominance, Scotland could take heart that Ronaldo was dropping deeper and deeper to try to influence proceedings.

Ronaldo’s header cleared Gordon’s bar, two minutes into the second half, after the Portugal captain met Diogo Jota’s cross. Francisco Conceição’s shot suffered an identical fate. The sight of Bruno Fernandes shanking a corner against the near post and out of play was Martínez’s trigger for change.

Bernardo Silva, Rafael Leão and Rúben Neves entered the fray. Ronaldo, who had not been particularly effective at anything beyond remonstrations towards the referee, was spared. Portugal were banking on their talisman reverting to international type.

Scotland almost showed Ronaldo and co how to do it. Anthony Ralston’s cross narrowly evaded the marauding McTominay. Gordon, now 41, showed why he still deserves to be his country’s first choice courtesy of a wonderful save to prevent Fernandes from opening the scoring, three minutes from time, after build-up work from Leão.

The Tartan Army breathed. By full time they heralded Clarke and his exhausted players. It is only a point; the nature of how it was achieved just felt wholly significant. “It’s not about turning a corner, it’s about working hard and not letting the country down,” added the manager. “We know we are a good team.” A penny for the thoughts of Ronaldo.
