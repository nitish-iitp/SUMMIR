The Tartan Army will be out in force at Hampden as Scotland bid to dump Portugal and get that winning feeling back

It's that time again as Scotland bid to bring an end to a wretched run of results under the lights at Hampden.

The Tartan Army are desperate for that sweet taste of victory once again and after falling to Croatia on Saturday evening, Steve Clarke and his troops will be looking to cause an upset at Hampden Park when they face Portugal tonight. Luka Modric and Co showed their powers of recovery as they responded by going behind to run out 2-1 winners. Che Adams did have the ball in the net with the last kick of the ball but the celebrations didn't last with VAR ruling the goal out with the final whistle instantly following the decision.

Ross County vs Rangers: Live stream, TV channel and team news for Dingwall showdown

Cristiano Ronaldo and his colleagues pitched up in Glasgow with three wins from three in the section and they picked up a 2-1 win over Scotland last month. Scott McTominay had given the visitors an early lead but Bruno Fernandes levelled before Ronaldo pounced with just minutes to play in Lisbon to break Scottish hearts. With the Nations League campaign now over the half way point it is vital to put points and results together in a bid to maintain League A status and avoid finishing bottom and an automatic return to League B.

Here, Football Scotland tells you everything you need to know ahead of the showdown.

When is Scotland vs Portugal?

Scotland welcome Portugal to Hampden on Tuesday October 15. The Nations League clash kicks off at 7.45pm UK time.

Is Scotland vs Portugal on TV and can I live stream it?

Unfortunately, the game won't be shown live on TV. However, fans will be able to watch the game against Croatia for free on ViaPlay's YouTube channel. The official Scotland National Team YouTube channel will also carry the coverage.

Ref and VAR

The man in the middle will be Lawrence Visser from Belgium. He'll be assisted by Rien Vanyzere and Thibaud Nijsse. Simon Bourdeaud'hui has been named the fourth official. Bram Van Driessche is on VAR duties alongside assistant Jan Boterberg.

Team news

James Forrest has officially been ruled out of the match having stayed behind with the medical staff for checks ahead of Croatia. The Celtic veteran is now unavailable with Rangers midfielder Connor Barron taking his spot in the squad.

Goalkeepers: Craig Gordon, Jon McCracken, Robby McCrorie.
