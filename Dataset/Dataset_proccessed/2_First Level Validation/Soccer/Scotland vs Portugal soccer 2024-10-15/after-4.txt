WHAT HAPPENED?

Portugal did not take their chances at Hampden Park, ending their winning start to the new Nations League campaign. The Tartan Army stood firm and earned a 0-0 draw, prompting an on-field tantrum from Ronaldo, who felt the referee stopped the game too early. Ronaldo missed a number of chances throughout the match that he would usually expect to score. Had Scotland been more clinical, they could have snatched all three points in Glasgow. However, most fans are happy to settle for a point and have taken to social media to poke fun at Ronaldo.

WHAT THE FANS ARE SAYING

There was no love for the football icon on X, formerly Twitter, following the match, with user @FCBYamal17 saying: "Cristiano Ronaldo is holding Portugal back."

Another spectator, @_tekkerzwit, agreed with the first post, adding: "Cristiano Ronaldo should forget about the 2026 World Cup. He's done enough for football."

@AzzurroWolf pointed out that Portugal may play better football without their main man in the starting XI. He posted: "I love the man. He's the best in my opinion. But, imagine how much better Portugal would be these days without Cristiano Ronaldo."

@TonytheTim90, disapproved of Ronaldo's antics after the full-time whistle, saying: "Cristiano Ronaldo may well be a great footballer but by god his antics on a football pitch get more embarrassing every single time I watch him.

Finally, @Watson2711 said: "That Portugal side is going nowhere under Martinez. He's terrified to drop Ronaldo despite him being clearly past it and detrimental to the team."

THE BIGGER PICTURE

While Ronaldo did miss a lot of chances on Tuesday night, he was not the only man in a Portugal shirt who did not perform. Liverpool's Diogo Jota and Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes both had poor games, and it was not until Roberto Martinez made his substitutions in the second half did Portugal really dominate proceedings.

WHAT NEXT FOR RONALDO?

With their winning run now at an end, Portugal will take stock and regroup ahead of two more matches in November. They face Poland at home and Croatia away in the Nations League in November. Ronaldo will return to Al-Nassr where he will focus on the race for the Saudi Pro League title.
