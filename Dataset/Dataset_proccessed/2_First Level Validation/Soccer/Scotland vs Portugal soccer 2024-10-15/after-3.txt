UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE: CRISTIANO RONALDO AND PORTUGAL HELD TO GOALLESS DRAW IN SCOTLAND BUT REMAIN TOP OF GROUP
BYMATT JONES

UPDATED 15/10/2024 AT 21:00 GMT

Cristiano Ronaldo and his Portugal team-mates were held to a goalless draw on matchday four of the UEFA Nations League, with Scotland picking up their first point of the campaign. Scotland goalkeeper Craig Gordon made crucial late saves to deny the visitors, who dominated the play but were left frustrated.

Scotland are finally off the mark in UEFA Nations League Group A after holding a frustrated Portugal to a 0-0 draw at Hampden Park.
The visitors, who had won their three previous games in the competition, dominated possession throughout, but that did not stop their opponents creating some decent shooting opportunities, as Scott McTominay and Ryan Christie had strikes saved.

Roberto Martinez’s side, on the other hand, struggled to forge many openings against a resilient defence, with Cristiano Ronaldo uncharacteristically wasteful and Diogo Jota firing too close to Craig Gordon.

Ronaldo and Francisco Conceicao then wasted glorious chances after the break, both lifting over the bar when left unmarked in decent positions.
Their clear-cut chances were few and far between, though, with Bruno Fernandes having the last - although he was denied by Gordon - as Scotland defended resiliently, with Portugal largely kept at arm’s length.
TALKING POINT - SOMETHING TO BUILD ON FOR CLARKE?
There is no doubt that Scotland boss Steve Clarke is still under pressure, with this result extending his side’s recent form to just one win in 16.
Equally, though, this was an impressive display from the hosts, who showed great resilience against a threatening attacking outfit that desperately tried to break the deadlock.
Having said that Scotland were “on the right path” after their defeat to Croatia at the weekend, Clarke - and the supporters - can take heart from finally getting off the mark in the Nations League. They have set the benchmark for their performance level.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH
Grant Hanley (Scotland). Any of Scotland’s four starting defenders could have won this award, given how well they managed a Portugal side who carried a huge attacking threat.
However, Hanley just about pips fellow centre-back John Souttar for an outstanding display in which he did not put a foot wrong.
The 32-year-old Norwich player won plenty of headers as Portugal threw a hatful of crosses into the box, while he also made some key tackles and interceptions.
PLAYER RATINGS
SCOTLAND: Gordon 7; Ralston 6, Souttar 7, Hanley 7, Robertson 7; Christie 7, Gilmour 6, McTominay 7, McLean 7, Doak 6; Adams 6. Subs: Morgan 6, Gauld 7, Dykes n/a, Devlin n/a
PORTUGAL: Costa 6; Cancelo 6, Silva 6, Dias 6, Mendes 7; Vitinha 6, Palhinha 6, Fernandes 6; Conceicao 5, Ronaldo 6, Jota 6. Subs: Bernardo Silva 6, Leao 6, Ruben Neves 6, Semedo n/a, Felix n/a
KEY MOMENTS
4’ BIG CHANCE! A bright start for Scotland, who forge an early chance for McTominay. He's picked out by Robertson's whipped left wing cross, but heads too close to the goalkeeper.
48’ RONALDO SHOOTS OVER. That smile we saw from the forward earlier has well and truly gone. He is left in acres of space near the penalty spot, but heads well over the bar. That's a huge, huge let off for Scotland.
51’ WHAT A WASTE! Another huge chance for Portugal, as Ronaldo slips in Conceicao on the edge of the area, only for the winger to lean back and lift harmlessly over.
82’ RONALDO FLASHES WIDE. Another huge chance for Ronaldo. The ball falls his way in the box and he aims a right footed shot towards the far post, but it fizzes wide.
87’ GORDON SAVES. Excellent reactions from the goalkeeper, who somehow gets down to deny Fernandes from point-blank range.
KEY STATS
Scotland go eight games without a win for the first time since 1998
Portugal are now unbeaten in their last eight clashes with Scotland, winning five, a run dating back to 1980
