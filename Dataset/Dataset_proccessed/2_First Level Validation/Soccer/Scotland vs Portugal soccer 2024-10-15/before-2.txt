Scotland host Portugal at Hampden Park for their Nations League showdown on Tuesday night with Steve Clarke's side still searching for their first point of the campaign.

Scotland, who lost 2-1 in Portugal last month in the reverse meeting, have lost all three of their Nations League outings so far to leave them bottom of League A, Group 1.

Their latest defeat came against Croatia on Saturday. The Tartan Army lost 2-1 in Zagreb with Igor Matanovic and Andrej Kramaric netting to cancel out Ryan Christie's opener.

While Scotland need a major turnaround to get out of the group, Portugal, who won the first ever Nations League tournament in 2019, are close to confirming their spot in the quarter-finals after winning all three of their outings.

Roberto Martinez's side beat Poland 3-1 on Saturday as Cristiano Ronaldo got on the scoresheet for the 906th time in his career. The 39-year-old will fancy his chances of netting again as he looks to break the 1000 goal barrier before he decides to hang up his boots.

RadioTimes.com has rounded up everything you need to know about how to watch Scotland v Portugal on TV and online.
