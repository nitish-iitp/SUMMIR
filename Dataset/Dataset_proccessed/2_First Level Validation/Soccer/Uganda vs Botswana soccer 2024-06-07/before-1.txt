The Uganda Cranes coach, Paul Joseph Put, is confident that the team will put up a fight against Botswana during a 2026 World Cup qualifier match slated to take place on June 7, 2024, at Mandela National Stadium.

During a press conference that took place on June 6, 2024, at the FUFA headquarters, Coach Put assured the public that the team selected is capable of featuring in international games.

“Botswana is a good team, and it won’t be an easy game, but we have shown the players how to play them, and I believe in our players. We have a team of averagely 23-year-old players, while Botswana has a team of averagely 27-year-olds. They are more experienced than us, but young players should be given time and confidence to get the best out of them, and that is what we are doing. We call upon all fans to come and support the team,” Put said.

The Uganda Cranes captain Khalid Aucho, the young African SC star, said he will miss the match against Botswana due to a slight injury he picked up during a final match of Young Africans SC vs. Azam FC. He, however, assured the public of the high spirit and motivation that the team had for the Botswana match.

“I won’t be featuring in the Botswana match because I picked up a slight injury, but I will be available for the next match. I have confidence in the coach because of his experience and the play system that he uses, which we have witnessed working. The team is ready and motivated because we have the home advantage after a long time of not playing at home,” Aucho said.

The cranes were beaten 2-1 by Guinea in their opening qualifier but defeated Somalia 1-0 on match day to get their campaign up and running.

Uganda is fourth in Group G, locked in a tight race with Botswana, Guinea, and Mozambique.
