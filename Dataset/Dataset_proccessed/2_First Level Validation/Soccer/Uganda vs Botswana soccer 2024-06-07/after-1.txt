This is why Eritrea jumped ship.

This is not the first time that this African nation has been excluded from international competitions, as it frequently experiences the abandonment of players and its squad is always depleted. It is worth mentioning that the country has a very strict regime, considered one of the worst in the world, which has led several players to leave their national team in search of a better life.

They said no to the World Cup!

Although the 2026 World Cup, to be hosted by Mexico, the United States and Canada, is almost two years away, the World Cup qualifiers have already begun in different parts of the world to determine the qualifiers. The Eritrean team had the right to compete for a place in the tournament, but decided to quit for fear that its players would defect from the team.

Mogakolodi Ngele, the terror of gangs

Obviously the spotlight of this match will be focused on Mogakolodi Ngele, the experienced player from Botswana wants to be the missing piece in the formation of the key to victory to get the three points to advance to the next round, also, his great physical condition allows him to be skillful and fast every time he touches the ball inside the area.

Kenneth Semakula, the midfield artist:

For a game where the Uganda team needs to add three units to climb positions in their group, players like Kenneth Semakula will have to be called upon, Uganda's attacking midfielder has been characterized for being a determinant player inside the box, likewise, his vast experience in Danish soccer has allowed him to improve his individual skills to be an important element in the starting eleven.

Background:

Uganda and Botswana have only met on 5 occasions (4 Uganda wins and 1 draw) where the scales are tipped in favor of the home side. Their last meeting dates back to an international friendly match in 2013 where Uganda scored three goals away to Botswana. It is worth noting that the last time Uganda hosted Botswana they ended up with the same score on the final scoreboard. In goal scoring history, Uganda has scored against Botswana 7 times and Botswana 2 times against Uganda.

What can we expect from this game? Let me give you a hint...

Let's put ourselves in the context of this match, Uganda receives Botswana in the framework of matchday 3 of the World Cup qualifiers on the African continent, then, we must take into account that both teams are in Group G, where Uganda and Botswana are tied with 3 points, however, it is Algeria who dominates in first place with two wins so far. The fact is that both Uganda and Botswana, as well as the other members of the group, are in equal conditions as they have one win and one loss so far in the qualifiers, making the fight to advance to the next round and continue fighting for the ticket to the World Cup even closer, however, a loss would be a cold water bucket as it would mean being left behind in the fight to move up positions.

How are things going in Africa on the road to the 2026 World Cup?

For now, in the continent where man comes from, we are halfway through the World Cup qualifiers and although there is still a long way to go to know the representatives of this confederation, for now, there are already teams that are preparing to take the lead in their groups such as: Egypt in Group A, Senegal in Group B, Rwanda in Group C, in Group D Cameroon, in Group E Morocco, in Group F Ivory Coast or Gabon, in Group G Algeria and in Group H Namibia or Tunisia.

We have to give it our all because we want to go to the 2026 World Cup.

Another season in the world of soccer is over, however, that does not mean that the soccer activity in the world is over because it is time for several nations to continue their journey towards the next World Cup to be played in Mexico, United States and Canada, in addition, this will be the first World Cup competition that will have the presence of 48 countries instead of 32, 16 more slots compared to the last World Cup, so these qualifiers become much more important for each nation that wants to be present. Therefore, we will see many players give their best performance on the field with which they will try to help their national team to get three points and take a step closer to the next World Cup, since a defeat could jeopardize all the dreams of an entire country, for the moment, there is a long way to go to meet the lucky ones but there is little left to continue shouting international goals.
