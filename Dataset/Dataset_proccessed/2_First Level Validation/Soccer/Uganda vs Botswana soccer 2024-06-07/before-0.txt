Uganda Cranes training

Friday June 7, 2024

Mandela National stadium, Namboole 7pm

For the first time since 2019, Uganda Cranes return to Mandela National stadium, Namboole when they host Botswana in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers match in Group G.

The two sides come into the game on the back of wins with Uganda beating Somalia 1-0 while the Zebras of Botswana won 1-0 against Guinea, a side that beat The Cranes in the opener.

Head-to-Head

Uganda hold an advantage over the Zebras with three wins against none and the hosts will be favourites when they meet for the fourth time at Namboole.

Cranes last outing in an international game was in March when they drew 2-2 with Ghana’s Black Stars in a friendly, a few days after being demolished by Comoros – both matches played in Marrakech.

Steven Mukwala and Muhammad Shaban scored the goals for the Cranes and both are part of Paul Put’s squad in camp.

Botswana, on the other hand are winless in 2024 after being denied a win a goalless draw with Uganda’s neighbours Burundi at the Mahamasina Municipal Stadium on March 25.

The Zebras have now drawn each of their three friendly outings in 2024, with their last victory coming on November 21, when they beat Guinea 1-0 to record their first win of the World Cup qualifiers.

Team News

Following the earlier withdraw of Bevis Mugabi and Uche Ikpeazu from the squad for various reasons, injured Khalid Aucho and Rogers Mato – scorer of the winner against Somalia are also ruled out of the game against Botswana.

However, they could be available for the Monday clash against Algeria.

Botswana have named a solid squad for their upcoming games against Uganda and Somalia, with the likes of Tumisang Orebonye, Kabelo Seakanyeng and captain Thatayaone Ditlhokwe.

Ditlhokwe, who currently plies his trade with Kaizer Chief in the South African top flight, should marshall the Zebra’s defence once again.

Uganda Cranes Probable XI

Watenga (GK), Bwomono, Kayondo, Lwaliwa, Awany, Bobosi, Ssemakula, Mutyaba, Okello, Bayo, Muleme

Botswana Probable XI:
Phoko; Mangolo, Ditlhokwe, Kopelang, Velaphi; Mohutsiwa, Gaolaolwe; Orebonye, Seakanyeng, Ngele; Thalefang

Prediction

The two teams are tied on three points following a win and defeat and victory here will boost their campaign opportunities.

On paper and history, Uganda holds superiority and the fact they return to the fortress Namboole, they will edge it.

Uganda 2-0 Botswana
