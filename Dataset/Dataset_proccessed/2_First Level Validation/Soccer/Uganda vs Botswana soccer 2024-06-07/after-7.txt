Uganda Cranes Edge Botswana Zebras in Crucial World Cup Qualifier
BY ADMIN  JUNE 7, 2024  0 COMMENTS
   

In a high-stakes FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier at the historic Mandela National Stadium, Namboole, the Uganda Cranes have secured a narrow 1-0 victory over Botswana’s Zebras. The decisive moment came in the 73rd minute, courtesy of a goal by Shaban Mohammed, expertly assisted by Denis Omedi. This win extends the Cranes’ perfect head-to-head record against Botswana to 4-0.

The match began with both teams demonstrating strong defensive play, keeping the first half scoreless despite several promising opportunities. Uganda, playing in front of an enthusiastic home crowd, had the better chances. Right-back Elvis Bwomono, who plays for St Mirren in the Scottish Premier League, saw his two early shots saved by Botswana’s goalkeeper, Phoko Goitseone. Forward Fahad Azizi Bayo also came close, heading just wide off an inviting cross from Allan Okello in the 30th minute. Midfielder Ronald Ssekiganda tested Phoko from 30 yards, but the Zebras’ keeper stood firm.

On the defensive end, Uganda’s captain and goalkeeper Isima Watenga had a relatively quiet first half, thanks to a solid backline performance, though Botswana’s Gilbert Baruti and Kabelo Seakanyeng showed glimpses of threat. Uganda’s defender Halidi Lwaliwa received the only caution of the match.

The second half continued with the Cranes applying pressure. The breakthrough came in the 73rd minute when Denis Omedi delivered a precise assist to Shaban Mohammed, who made no mistake in finding the back of the net. This goal electrified the fans and ultimately proved to be the match-winner.

With this victory, Uganda moves up in the World Cup qualifying standings, now sitting in a more favorable position with six points from three games. Botswana, despite their resilient performance, remains second in the group due to goal difference.

Looking ahead, the Uganda Cranes are preparing for a pivotal clash against group leaders Algeria on Monday, June 11, 2024. The match will also take place at the Mandela National Stadium, kicking off at 7:00 PM. This fixture promises to be another thrilling encounter as Uganda aims to bolster their chances of qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The fans at Namboole will undoubtedly be looking forward to supporting their team, hoping for another memorable performance as the Cranes continue their journey towards World Cup qualification.
