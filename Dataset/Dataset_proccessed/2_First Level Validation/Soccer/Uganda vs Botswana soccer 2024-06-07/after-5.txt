Uganda returned to Mandela National stadium with victory after edging visitors Botswana 1-0 thanks to a second half winner from Muhammad Shaban.

It was a good performance from the team with dominance in possession but how did the individual players rate on the day.

Here is how Ismael Kiyonga rated the players that featured on the evening.

Isma Watenga 6.0: The day’s captain was hardly tested on the evening but nonetheless, will be happy with the clean sheet.

Elvis Bwomono 6.0: Had two good opportunities to break the deadlock saved. Replaced by Bobosi in a tactical change that sent Ssemakula to the right.

Isaac Muleme 6.0: Defensively solid and but his crosses not perfect when he went forward.

Elio Capradossi 8.0: An excellent debut for the Italian based defender. Calm and collected and orchestrated team plays with his ability to play from the back. A colossus in one vs one. Man of the Match.

Halid Lwaliwa 5.0: Looked shaky when attacked and got booked for a clumsy challenge in the first half.

Kenneth Ssemakula 6.0: Didn’t look the real part in the first half as he went for inaccurate long balls while in midfield but field in defensively well at right back after withdraw of Bwomono.

Ronald Ssekiganda 7.0: Played with confidence and belief manning the midfield like a Picasso. Had two attempts saved by the goalkeeper.

Travis Mutyaba 6.5: Kept the crowd on their feet with the ball but at times over elaborate.

Allan Okello 5.0: Replaced at halftime but was decent with and without the ball creating space for right back Bwomono.

Fahad Bayo 5.0: Missed a free header in the first half but overall, kept the Botswana backline busy with his physicality.

Steven Mukwala 6.5: He was decent the ball at his feet on the left and gave the right back a lot to do. Created a few goal scoring opportunities before he was taken off in the second half.

Substitutes

Rogers Mato 6.0: Shockingly given 45 minutes after his late arrival. His directness troubled the opponents.

Bobosi Byaruhanga 7.0: Brilliant pass to open up the Botswana compact defence in the lead up to the goal.

Muhammad Shaban 7.0: Won the game with a poacher’s goal. Typical Shaban

Denis Omedi 7.0: Set up the winner with his first touch after beating his opponent for pace.

I think sekiganda was my man of the match he was a threat whenever he reached the box and bossed the middle of the park as well
