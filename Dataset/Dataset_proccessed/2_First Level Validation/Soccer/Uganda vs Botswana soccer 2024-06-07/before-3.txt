The gaffer revealed that the preparations have been successful and hopes to get the best out of the team.

"We have had good preparations ahead of the upcoming games. I am blessed to work with such a talented group of players, and I hope to get the best out of them," he noted.

"We have to be a little bit patient with the process because the average age of the team is 23 years. I am confident that the team will grow so that we have a good name in the future," he added.
