Having clinched their initial three AFC Asian Cup titles, the latest triumph coming in 1976, Iran have since been unable to replicate that success, falling short of securing the continental championship on subsequent occasions.

Taremi gathered widespread recognition in the football community when he played a pivotal role in leading Portuguese club Porto to the league title last season, netting an impressive 22 goals, the highest in the league. He will be a key player for IR Iran in the upcoming contest.

In a span of eight years since making his professional debut with his hometown club Hilal Alquds, Oday Dabbagh has swiftly carved out a significant place for himself in discussions about Palestine’s most exceptional footballing talent.

Dabbagh transitioned from finding the back of the net in the AFC Cup to competing in prominent European leagues, shouldering the aspirations of his nation as they look ahead to the AFC Asian Cup Qatar 2023. He will be a huge threat to the opposition.
