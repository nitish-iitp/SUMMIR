Game Preview

 

Tanzania will face DR Congo in the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations match scheduled for Wednesday.

 

Tanzania enters this match after a 1-1 draw against Zambia in the same competition. In said game, Tanzania controlled possession with 55% including 6 shots at goal, out of which 2 were on target. The sole scorer for Tanzania was Simon Msuva, who found the back of the net in the 11th minute. As for their opponents, Zambia managed 11 shots at goal, with 4 of them being on target. Patson Daka sealed the draw for Zambia with a late goal in the 88th minute.

 

A common trend in Tanzania’s matches has been defensive shakiness, with their current AFCON record being a 0-3 loss versus Morocco and the latest 1-1 draw.

 

 

DR Congo and Morocco played to a 1-1 draw in their recent Africa Cup of Nations match. DR Congo had a possession rate of 46% and attempted 10 shots at goal, with 2 of them being on target. Silas Katompa Mvumpa (76′) was the sole goal scorer for DR Congo. On the other hand, Morocco had 11 shots on goal, with 4 of them being on target. Achraf Hakimi (6′) found the back of the net for Morocco.

 

During 5 out of the last 6 matches involving DR Congo, there has been a significant scarcity of goals scored between them and their opponents. The average number of goals per game throughout this period stands at a mere 1.67, with The Leopards managing to score an average of 0.83 goals.

 

We are expecting a close encounter from both sides, however we don’t foresee Tanzania’s defensive woes improving for this match. Realistically, DR Congo’s offensive frontline has the talent and speed to catch Tanzania in the counter, thus giving them the edge this time around.
