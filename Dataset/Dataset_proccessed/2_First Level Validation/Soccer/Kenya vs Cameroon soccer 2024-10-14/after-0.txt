Kenya Results

Kenya has shown a mix of results lately, struggling against stronger opposition but also pulling off a few significant victories. Let’s take a closer look at their recent performances.

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	W/L
11.10.24	ACN	Cameroon vs Kenya	4:1	L
10.09.24	ACN	Namibia vs Kenya	1:2	W
06.09.24	ACN	Kenya vs Zimbabwe	0:0	D
02.07.24	COP	Kenya vs Zimbabwe	2:0	W
30.06.24	COP	Kenya vs Comoros	0:2	L

Kenya has been inconsistent, with two wins, two losses, and a draw in their last five games. They managed a strong 2:0 win against Zimbabwe in July but suffered a heavy defeat to Cameroon in their latest outing. Their attack has been solid, scoring in three out of five games, but defensive frailties have been exposed, especially in matches against higher-ranked teams like Cameroon.

Cameroon Results

Cameroon has been more consistent in their recent performances, showcasing their strength as one of Africa’s top footballing nations. Here’s how they’ve fared in their last five games.

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	W/L
11.10.24	ACN	Cameroon vs Kenya	4:1	W
10.09.24	ACN	Zimbabwe vs Cameroon	0:0	D
07.09.24	ACN	Cameroon vs Namibia	1:0	W
11.06.24	WC	Angola vs Cameroon	1:1	D
08.06.24	WC	Cameroon vs Cape Verde	4:1	W

Cameroon’s form has been strong, with three wins and two draws in their last five matches. Their recent victory against Kenya was convincing, scoring four goals while maintaining dominance throughout the match. However, their inability to secure an away win in recent matches suggests that they might face challenges on neutral ground.

Kenya vs Cameroon Head-to-Head

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result
11.10.24	ACN	Cameroon vs Kenya	4:1

19.03.88	ACN	Cameroon vs Kenya	0:0
22.02.72	ACN	Cameroon vs Kenya	2:1

Cameroon has historically dominated Kenya, with four wins and a draw in their last five meetings. Their most recent encounter ended in a 4:1 victory for Cameroon, showcasing their attacking prowess and ability to control the game. Kenya will need to improve their defense to avoid another heavy defeat.

Player	Team	Reason
Christopher Wooh	Cameroon	Injury (Doubtful)
Richard Odada	Kenya	Injury (Out)

Free Tips on Kenya vs Cameroon

When preparing to place a bet on the Kenya vs Cameroon match, it’s crucial to take several factors into account to make informed decisions. Understanding the recent performance of both teams, their head-to-head statistics, and other external influences can help you predict how the game may unfold. Here are some essential tips to consider before placing your bets on this AFCON Qualifier.

Team Form: Always review the current form of both teams. Cameroon recently defeated Kenya 4:1, which could give them confidence, but Kenya may be determined to bounce back after such a loss.
Head-to-Head Statistics: Historically, Cameroon has outperformed Kenya in their encounters. This could indicate that Cameroon holds an advantage, especially after their recent win, but upsets can still happen.
Home vs. Away Performance: While this match is on neutral ground, Kenya typically struggles more outside of home, whereas Cameroon has faced challenges in away games recently. This balance may influence the match’s dynamics.
Team Motivation: Kenya needs points to keep their qualification hopes alive, which could push them to perform better. Cameroon, though already in a strong position, may still play to secure a dominant lead in the group.
Player Form: Both teams will rely on their key players. Cameroon’s top performers are in strong form, but Kenya’s ability to capitalize on individual brilliance could make a difference, especially if their striker can break through Cameroon’s defense.

These tips should help guide your predictions for the Kenya vs Cameroon match, ensuring that you’re making well-informed decisions when placing your bets.

Match Prediction Kenya vs Cameroon Prediction 2024

In this highly anticipated rematch, both teams have much to prove. While Cameroon’s dominance in the previous game gives them the edge, their poor away form cannot be ignored. Kenya, on the other hand, will look to regroup after their heavy loss and take advantage of the neutral venue. For this Kenya vs Cameroon odds, it is reasonable to expect a competitive game, but Cameroon’s overall quality and attack may be too much for Kenya to handle. Therefore, a Cameroon win is likely, but both teams have the potential to score, making the “both teams to score” market a valuable option.

Our Prediction: Kenya 1-3 Cameroon
Prediction Type	Prediction	Odds
