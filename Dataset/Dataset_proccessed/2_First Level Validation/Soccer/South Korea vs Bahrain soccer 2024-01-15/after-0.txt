South Korea made a winning start to their Asian Cup campaign as two goals from Kang-in Lee of Paris Saint-Germain helped them to a 3-1 victory over Bahrain.

Bahrain started well but Jurgen Klinsmann’s South Korea gradually grew in the first half and took the lead on 38 minutes when Jae-sung Lee squared and In-beom Hwang checked back to curl the ball into the top-left corner. South Korea started the second half well but were caught napping and conceded a shock leveller when Abdullah Al Hashash tapped home from close range.

But just five minutes after Bahrain had equalised, Lee fired a powerful curling effort into the bottom-left corner which nicked the post on the way in. It was a stunning goal which restored South Korea’s lead immediately. Soon after, the 22-year-old received the ball on the left with no one near him for company. He checked back onto his left foot and passed the ball calmly into the corner to put South Korea top of Group E.

Good start for South Korea

South Korea rightly see themselves as one of the favourites to win this tournament, and that was a good start from them.

Bahrain showed their technical ability, particularly in the first half, but the Koreans took control in the second half and were indebted to Paris Saint-Germain's Kang-in Lee for a magnificent individual performance, capping it off with two goals.

FT: South Korea 3-1 Bahrain

Full-time in Al Rayyan. Heung-min Son didn't have one of his better games but Kang-in Lee's double helps them to win their opener.

Bahrain began well but did fade, and eventually they were beaten 3-1 by Jurgen Klinsmann's South Korea.

90+4' Son goes into the book for a dive in the box, and it's absolutely the right call.

Silly to go down so easily there, and it just sums up his day!

87' Kang-in Lee puts Son in, but the Spurs striker can only curl it wide.

Surprising that he didn't score!

85' OUCH! Al Wali thuds an elbow into Heung-min Son's face, and initially there is a bit of concern for the Tottenham man.

But he is soon back up. Sore one.

79' Jae-sung Lee tries to bend the ball into the far corner on the left flank but doesn't get quite enough curl in it.

The move was started by Kang-in Lee, who has been excellent in this second half, scoring twice.
