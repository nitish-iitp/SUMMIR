BEIJING - China national team head coach Branko Ivankovic called for unity against South Korea against their FIFA 2026 World Cup qualifier in Seoul on Monday.

"As a strong team in Asia, South Korea has always been a regular participant in the World Cup who have several world-class players with outstanding abilities. In response, we will focus on collective defense and prioritize team collaboration," Ivankovic said.

China are currently dealing with injuries, with forward Alan not traveling to South Korea, and Wu Lei and Zhang Yuning also carrying injuries. In such a situation, Ivankovic said, the team should be more concentrated.
