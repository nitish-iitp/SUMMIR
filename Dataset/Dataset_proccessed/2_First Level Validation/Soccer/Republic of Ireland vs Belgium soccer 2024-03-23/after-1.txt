Former Manchester United player and Ireland assistant O'Shea was given the helm approaching these two friendly matches (Belgium on Saturday and Switzerland on Tuesday) as the FAI failed to secure the services of a permanent manager.

The vacancy arose after Stephen Kenny's term in charge was not renewed last November after a run of poor results. 

Ireland play Belgium in a friendly on Saturday evening and here's all you need to know.
