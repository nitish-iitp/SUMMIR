Bafana Bafana could qualify for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations(Afcon) should they beat Congo Brazzaville home and away.

Hugo Broos‘ men are second in Group K after playing two matches so far in the qualifiers. With two teams from each group guaranteed a spot in Morocco next year, South Africa looks destined to qualify for the tournament.

WHEN AND WHAT TIME IS BAFANA’S AFCON QUALIFIER AGAINST CONGO?

Bafana host Congo Brazzaville at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Gqeberha on Friday, 11 October 2024 (7pm), and then they travel to Congo to play the return match on Tuesday, 15 October 2024.

If Bafana wins both matches, they will sit with 10 points and be on the verge of qualifying for the Afcon. Should Uganda beat South Sudan home and away and Broos’ men also do the same against Congo, Bafana should qualify alongside Uganda.

Broos has called Luke le Roux to join the squad after the withdrawal of two players. The 24-year-old has urged Bafana fans to come in their number for the Afcon qualifier against Congo Brazzaville.

“I appeal to everybody in the Eastern Cape to come out in numbers and support us on Friday. Should I get a chance to play on Friday, I will do everything in my power to play very well so that I am called up again in the future,” he said.

CAN BAFANA SECURE SIX POINTS AGAINST CONGO?
