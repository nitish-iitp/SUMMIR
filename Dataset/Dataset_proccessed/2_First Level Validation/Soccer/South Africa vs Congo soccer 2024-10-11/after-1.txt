South Africa took a major step toward qualifying for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) with an emphatic 5-0 win over Congo at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Friday evening.

Bafana Bafana moved level with Uganda on seven points at the top of Group K, opening a four-point lead over the third-placed Red Devils (with South Sudan, on zero points, completing the group quartet) and putting themselves likely one win away from securing a place at the next Nations Cup.

South Africa got off to a strong start and claimed the lead in the 13th minute, as midfielder Teboho Mokoena scored with a downward header after being picked out from a corner kick by Oswin Appollis.

And Mokoena made it 2-0 in the 27th minute with an absolute beauty, turning on the edge of the penalty area and firing off an unstoppable shot that was well beyond the reach of goalkeeper Christoffer Mafoumbi.

Both goals featured home fans running onto the pitch to celebrate with the players, which forced the match officials to suspend the game temporarily until security was beefed up.

The stoppage made no difference to Bafana Bafana, who soon added a third goal: another excellent Appollis delivery from a corner kick in the 36th minute resulted in a header finding the back of the net – this time it was Bathusi Aubaas with his first goal for the national team.

On 44 minutes Congo missed out on a chance to get back in the game, as Vieljeux Mboungou whipped in a cross from the left to pick out Mons Bassouamina at the far post, but he sent his header wide of the mark.

INJURY CLOUD

South Africa added to their lead seven minutes into the second half, with Elias Mokwana beating the goalkeeper to a fine through ball and playing an intelligent, teasing pass into space in the box which ultimately allowed Lyle Foster a close-range finish for 4-0.

Foster’s match ultimately ended under an injury cloud, as he received significant on-field treatment after a collision with the goalkeeper before being replaced by Iqraam Rayners.

Rayners himself netted in the 78th minute, as he intercepted a poor pass out from Mafoumbi and was able to steer a shot into an unguarded net to put the cherry on top of a superb performance from Hugo Broos’s team.

The teams will face off again in a return match on Tuesday 15 October, set for the Alphonse Massamba-Debat Stadium in Brazzaville.
