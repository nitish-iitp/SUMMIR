Scotland are back at Hampden Park on Tuesday evening, as they wrap up the March international break at home to Northern Ireland.

Steve Clarke's side booked their place at Euro 2024 in impressive style, beating Norway and Erling Haaland to second behind Spain in Group A, and ramped up their preparations for this summer's tournament away against the Netherlands on Friday evening.

The visit of Northern Ireland will offer a different sort of challenge, with the Scots the favourites and a hefty home crowd expecting a result, but is likely to be just as useful for Clarke as he runs the rule over his players ahead of June's squad selection deadline.

The visitors are not heading to Euro 2024 thanks to a dismal qualifying campaign, but some bright young stars and a victory over Denmark in the final game in Group H means there is optimism about what the future holds.

It's the first meeting between the sides in nearly nine years, and history is certainly against Michael O'Neill's team - as Northern Ireland have not beaten their hosts since 1983, and not won against them in Scotland since 1974.
