September 8, 2024 – A free-kick goal by Luka Modrić brought Croatia the victory against Poland in the second round of the Nations League in Osijek.

After Croatia lost to Portugal on Thursday to open the new edition of the Nations League, their next test came just three days later against Poland in Osijek. In Poland’s first match, they beat Scotland 3-2.

Captain Luka Modrić made his 180th appearance for the national team against Poland, while Andrej Kramarić was not in tonight’s starting eleven due to an illness. Coach Zlatko Dalić made five changes from the starting line-up in Lisbon, giving the young Igor Matanović a chance from the first minute.

Lineups

CROATIA: Livaković – Šutalo, Ćaleta-Car, Guardiol – Pjaca, Kovačić, Sučić, Modrić, Sosa – Petković, Matanović

POLAND: Skorupski – Walukiewicz, Bednarek, Dawidowicz – Kaminski, Urbanski, Zielinski, Szymanski, Zalewski – Bogusz, Lewandowski

Match report

Croatia wholly dominated the first half, taking 58% of posession and 10 shots on goal to Poland’s one.

In the 4th minute, Matanovic shot over the goal. In the 7th minute, Pjaca shot for the far post. Another big chance happened seconds later, as Modrić crossed into the box and Ćaleta-Car headed to the keeper.

And that was only the first 10 minutes.

Modric shot from the edge of the penalty area in the 21st minute. Matanovic volleyed over the goal in the 28th, and and there minutes later, he shot at the keeper again.

There was chance after chance, and Croatia could not find the back of the net – but in this new formation with fresh blood, they looked good. The first half ended 0-0.

Dalic subbed off Petar Sucic for Luka Sucic to start the second half.

The goal Croatia had been waiting for did not take long to get, either. In the 51st minute, Petkovic was fouled, giving Croatia a free kick on the edge of the penalty area. Luka Modric, who turns 39 tomorrow, stepped up to take it and perfectly curved the ball into the near post for 1-0 Croatia! What a stunner.

Croatia continued having chances in the second half. Petkovic in the 58th, Kovacic in the 60th…

In the 69th minute, Petković and Matanović came off for Kramarić and Budimir. And one minute later, Lewandowski hit the post. Poland started picking up the pace from that moment on.

In the 79th minute, Kovačić was replaced by Mario Pašalić.

Budimir had a few chances, and a shot by Kramaric in the final seconds went to the keeper. Croatia was unable to get that second goal and the game ended 1-0.

Croatia continues their Nations League campaign in October against Scotland in Zagreb on October 12th and Poland away on October 15th.
