Antoine Semenyo in action against Sudan

Sudan hosts Ghana for the second-leg tie of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers at the Martyrs of February Stadium on Tuesday, October 15, 2024.

The East African side will need to avoid defeat to stay within touching distance of qualifying for the AFCON.

Ghana, on the other hand, need a win to get back on track as their chances of qualifying for the tournament currently look minimal.

The Black Stars are without a win after three games in the series, drawing two and losing one, while Sudan have won one, drawn one, and lost one in their respective games.

Ghana occupy the third position with two points in Group F. Angola lead the group with nine points, followed by Sudan in second position with four points, and Niger at rock bottom with one point.

A defeat or draw for the Black Stars will likely diminish their chances of qualifying for the 2025 AFCON.
