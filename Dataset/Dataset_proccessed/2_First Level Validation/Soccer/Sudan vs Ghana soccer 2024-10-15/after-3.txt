Sudan ended their latest 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying assignment on a positive note following an efficient 2-0 victory against Ghana in Group F on matchday four at the Martyrs of February Stadium in Benina on Tuesday.

The Black Stars dominated the opening stages of the match while Sudan were starved of the ball during the first 10 minutes.

Mohammed Kudus came close to opening the scoring on a couple of occasions during this period as Ghana pressed on.

Sudan began to ask questions going forward after 15 minutes on the clock and produced a couple nervy moments for the Ghana backline going forward.

At the other end of the pitch, Inaki Williams was Ghana’s main threat midway through the first half.

Following a tough first 45 minutes , the referee summoned both teams to the changing rooms with the scoreboard untouched.

Then, against the run of play, Sudan took the lead soon after the hour-mark after making way into the Ghana box, as Ahmed Al Tash carved out a right-footed shot on the edge of the six-yard area.

The Falcons of Jediane, doubled their advantage in the 65th minute of the match as Mohamed Abdelrahman joined Al Tash on the scoresheet after gathering steam from their opener.

In response to conceding two goals in rapid fashion, Ghana took the direct route to goal but failed at the final hurdle in doing so.

Following an efficient performance by Sudan, the star-studded Ghanaian outfit were left frustrated at the Martyrs of February Stadium after the final whistle.

Sudan: (0) 2 (Al Tash 62’, Abdelrahma 65’)

Sudan: Mustafa, Khidir, Saaed, Abuaagla, Koko, Mahmoud (Nouh 80’), Thierry (Hamouda 94’), Eisa, Yousif, Agab, Abdelrahman (Eisa 80’)
