The tournament’s best defensive units take on each other to book a place in the final

Nigeria have remained unbeaten throughout the tournament with four wins and one draw. Jose Peseiro’s men have conceded just one goal in the entire tournament and are the best defensive unit so far. A brace by Ademola Lookman led the Super Eagles to a round of 16 victory over Cameroon. To earn their way into the semifinals, they had to dig deep in the quarter-final against Angola and win by a narrow margin.

For the first time since 2000, South Africa has made history by reaching the finals at AFCON. Hugo Broos’ side stunned the world by knocking Morocco out in the Round of 16 and put in a superb performance. However, they must thank goalkeeper Ronwen Williams whose heroics put the Nation one step closer to winning the AFCON title in the quarter-final penalty shootout against Cape Verde.

Kick-Off:

Wednesday, 7 February 2024 at 10:30 PM IST

Location: Stade de Bouaké

Form:

Nigeria (in all competitions) : W-W-W-W-D

South Africa (in all competitions) : D-W-D-W-L

Player to Watch
Ademola Lookman (Nigeria) 

It has been great to see the Atalanta Man on fire for the Super Eagles this tournament, with his goals contributing to their success so far. In addition to his flair for trickery, the pacey forward has the ability to finish impressively. Three goals were scored in the last two matches, including a brace against Cameroon in the Round of 16 and one against Angola to send them into the semis. 

Ronwen Williams (South Africa) 

As the South African team pushed on to the semi finals, the SuperSport United goalkeeper has been in tremendous form with the gloves at his hand. A true star in this tournament, he has kept four clean sheets in five matches and was the hero against Cape Verde in the quarterfinal after saving South Africa from a penalty shootout.

Jose Peseiro is likely to stick to his 3-4-2-1 formation which has brought out the best performances from his players. The Super Eagles will be hoping that star striker Victor Osimhen will be fit enough to play on the big stage. 

On the other hand, South Africa will stick with the same eleven that made history by reaching the semi finals for the first time since 2000 in its last game.
