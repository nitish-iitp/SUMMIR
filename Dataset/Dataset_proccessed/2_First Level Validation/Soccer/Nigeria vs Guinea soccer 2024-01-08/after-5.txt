Friendly: Guinea beat Nigeria in pre-AFCON friendly

The Super Eagles of Nigeria were defeated 2-0 by Guinea in a friendly match ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON 2023.

Moses Simon missed a penalty earlier in the game as Nigeria suffered a disappointing loss in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on Monday January 8, 2024.

The Super Eagles of Nigeria had thumped Al Gharbia FC, a local team based in UAE, 12-0 in a test game on Sunday.

But the team failed to reproduce their high-flying performance against the Guineans, as Jose Peseiro, Super Eagles head coach, named Stanley Nwabali in goal.

After a brief spell of dominance from Nigeria, the Guineans struck the game’s first goal in the 14th minute through Aguibou Camara.

Six minutes later, Simon Moses failed to convert an opportunity to pull the Eagles level. Sadiq was brought down in the Guinean box, and the referee awarded a penalty for Nigeria. The resultant kick by Simon was saved by the Guinean goalkeeper.

Facinet Conte added another goal for Guinea in the 65th minute as Nigeria struggled to find the back of the net throughout the match.

The match ended the Super Eagles’ one-week training in Abu Dhabi, and the team will return to Lagos on January 9, 2024, before traveling to Cote D’Ivoire a day later.

The 34th edition of the AFCON kick offs on January 13 and end on February 11.

Nigeria will play their first match against Equatorial Guinea on January 14.
