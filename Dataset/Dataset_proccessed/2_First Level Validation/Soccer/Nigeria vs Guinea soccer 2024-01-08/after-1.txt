In a one-sided match, an energetic Super Eagles team assaulted their opponent's defense line, led by Calvin Bassey and featuring strong performances from Alex Iwobi and Bright Osayi-Samuel as substitutes.

A Nigerian midfielder was showcased by the third-division squad, Al Gharbia.

The Super Eagles won easily, according to a post on the team's official X account, and coach Jose Peseiro should be happy with his squad because they are playing well all around.

Check out details on how to watch the Super Eagles of Nigeria take on Guinea’s Syli Nationale in Abu Dhabi to prepare for the AFCON.

Before leaving for Lagos, the Eagles' biggest test would come on Monday in their final practice match, against another AFCON-bound team, Guinea.

This is in response to President Bola Tinubu's earlier approval of the release of N12 billion to pay all outstanding salaries for the Super Eagles.

Super Eagles AFCON target

After winning the AFCON in 1980, 1994, and 2013, Nigeria is aiming for a fourth championship, which would level them with Ghana, their fiercest rival in West Africa, and leave only Egypt (seven AFCON) and Cameroon (five AFCON) ahead of them.

The Super Eagles' next games are against Ivory Coast on January 18 and Guinea Bissau on January 22, following their initial game on January 14 against Equatorial Guinea.
