In their last qualifier, Australia secured a much-needed 3-1 victory against China PR at Adelaide Oval. Goals from Lewis Miller, a screamer from Craig Goodwin and a debut goal by Nishan Velupillay gave Tony Popovic a winning start in his first match as head coach.

That win could not have come at a better time for the Socceroos, who endured a disappointing defeat to Bahrain and a draw with Indonesia last month. While the game against China was not all smooth sailing, the victory put Australia’s qualification campaign back on track.
 

 

Next up, the biggest challenge so far. Japan has been in devastating form, hammering China 7-0, thrashing Bahrain 5-0, and comfortably beating Saudi Arabia 2-0 in their first three qualifiers. This dominant start has made the Blue Samurai the team to beat in Group C.

Japan, who have qualified for the last seven World Cups, sit atop the group with nine points from three games, while the Socceroos are joint-second on goal difference with four.

Historically, Australia and Japan have faced off 27 times, with Japan holding the advantage. The Socceroos have managed seven wins, while Japan has won 11 times, with nine matches ending in draws. 

The last time Australia defeated Japan was in 2009, during the qualification campaign for the 2010 World Cup, when Tim Cahill scored twice to secure a 2-1 come-from-behind win at the MCG. 

Prior to that, the Socceroos claimed victory over Japan in the group stage of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, with Cahill again starring in a 3-1 triumph. Since then, Japan have enjoyed the spoils more often than not, including a 2-1 win in Saitama during the 2022 World Cup qualifiers.

For his first game in charge, Popovic opted for a back three against China, with Joe Gauci in goal and a three-man central defence anchored by Harry Souttar. Jackson Irvine captained the side in midfield, while Craig Goodwin, Nestory Irankunda and Mitch Duke led the attack. 

The line-up for the Japan match remains to be seen, but the Socceroos will face a far tougher test against a side packed with top-level talent, including Crystal Palace's Daichi Kamada, Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma, and Liverpool's Wataru Endō.

Adding to the narrative, Popovic and Japan’s head coach Hajime Moriyasu are old friends from their time playing together at Sanfrecce Hiroshima, making this a special encounter on the touchline.

This match has all the hallmarks of a thrilling contest, with both teams striving for qualification to the FIFA World Cup 2026™ in the USA, Canada, and Mexico. Australia will look to build momentum under Popovic, while Japan remain the team to beat.

Only the top two in the six-team group secure direct passage to the 2026 World Cup, with the third- and fourth-placed teams facing an additional qualifying phase.

What They Said
Tony Popovic

“Tomorrow against a great opponent in a great stadium, I want us to have the confidence to build on that performance [against China] and show a better playing style - that’s key for us. 

"We feel if we can do that, we have a chance to definitely win the game.

"We have a long way to get to the World Cup still. For now our focus is this match. We’re not looking too far ahead - our mindset right now is to win tomorrow. 

"And I know that the players and staff have full belief in what we are trying to build and that we can get the three points tomorrow."

Kye Rowles

"Obviously, over the last few years, Japan have had our number, but we just need to focus on playing to the best of our ability, and that'll put us in good stead in the match. 

"I think that this game is massively important, especially, as we’re almost at the halfway point in the qualification process - we need to start getting the ball rolling and continue on from Thursday night. Hopefully, we can put in a better performance. 

"There were plenty of positives against China PR, but there's a lot of work to do as well. Hopefully, we can flip the script a little bit and put in a good performance. And get one back on them."

Joe Gauci

"I know that it is going to be a challenge but I think Australian football needs to be stepping in the direction that we have to be going head-to-head with these teams and really taking the game to them.

"Yes, we’re away and some people might be looking at it like we just want to get a point, but no, we’re here to win and that’s the mentality that we have to have.

"Whatever the result is on Tuesday night, we’ll be putting forward a performance that shows that we’re ready to take the game to Japan and to really face them and move forward in the style of football that we’re trying to play."

Mitch Duke

"There’s no reason why we can’t beat anyone on our day, and we need to have that belief, and that’s the approach. We’re not going into this with a point mentality just to not lose, we’re going there for the three points.

"I’ve done well there [Saitama Stadium 2002] - the last time I was there, I won with my club. So I've definitely got a good feeling there, which is good. 

"I’m very familiar, having been in Japan for so long, with the Japanese playing style in general. I’ve got a few teammates in the team as well, which will be nice, and I’m looking forward to it. 

"It’s a great stadium, a great atmosphere and a great chance for us to really shock the favourites."
