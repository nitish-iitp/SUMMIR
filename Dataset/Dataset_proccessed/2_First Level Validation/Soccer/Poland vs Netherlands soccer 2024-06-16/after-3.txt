Gareth Southgate calls Harry Kane 'old' ahead of England's first match of Euros

Netherlands beat Poland to begin day three at Euro 2024 in exciting fashion, with Wout Weghorst scoring the late winner after the Dutch were forced to come from behind.

Despite starting strongly, Ronald Koeman’s side conceded the opener through Adam Buksa’s header, before Cody Gakpo - the standout performer in the first half - equalised via a big deflection. The second 45 minutes was a more even affair until the strength in depth on Netherlands’ bench started to show, and Weghorst netted the winner a few minutes from full time.

Matches against Austria and France follow this clash for each nation, but the Dutch have taken a huge step forward, while Poland will hope Robert Lewandowski returns to full fitness soon. Follow the live blog below for the Poland vs Netherlands reaction - plus news ahead of Sunday’s other games:

Christian Eriksen does the impossible yet again in surreal full-circle moment at Euro 2024

You have to wonder what sort of thoughts were swirling around Christian Eriksen’s head, as the Denmark talisman waited for the first whistle to sound. It would be understandable if some of them were dark, frightening, or even traumatic. For the last time he began a European Championship campaign, three summers ago, Eriksen died for five minutes.

That day in Copenhagen, as Denmark faced Finland, Eriksen was not brought back from the brink – he had passed it. He was brought back from the beyond.

Naturally, after being resuscitated from his cardiac arrest, he could not leave the pitch under his own power. Instead, he was carefully lifted off the turf and carried off the field, as his wife and teammates tearfully feared the worst and hoped for the best – whatever that could possibly mean.

That moment, of course, could have marked the end of Eriksen’s career. Frankly, it could have marked the end. Full stop. Yet on a spring Sunday in Stuttgart, 1,100 days later, here he stood.

Slovenia strike to earn point against Denmark

That’s that from our coverage of Slovenia against Denmark, a point apiece leaving a real opportunity for Serbia or England to seize control of this group. The team news from Gelsenkirchen is in, with an anticipated bold call made by Gareth Southgate - you can follow all of the twists and turns across the evening with my colleague Chris Wilson here:

FT: Slovenia 1-1 Denmark

A disappointing result for Denmark, you’d say, having led for so long and spent so much of the encounter in control of ball and contest. But having taken a first-half lead through Christian Eriksen - a fitting scorer on his return to Euros football 1100 days from his on-pitch collapse - the Danes largely failed to trouble Jan Oblak, one sharp save from Rasmus Hojlund about all the Slovenian shot-stopper was forced into in the second half.

By contract, Marjas Kek’s side grew into it, Erik Janza’s deflected equaliser coming mere moments after Benjamin Sesko had rattled the woodwork. They’ll be rather more pleased to have pinched a point ahead of fixtures against Serbia and England to come.

Slovenia 1-1 Denmark, 90 + 3 minutes

Frustrated faces in the Danish sections of MHP Arena.

Slovenia remove both strikers: Andraz Sporar and Benjamin Sesko are replaced by the rather more defensively-minded Jasmin Kurtic and David Brekalo for the little that remains.

Denmark have six men in the box but to no avail. Erik Janza, whose been excellent at both ends of the pitch today, wins a key defensive header.

Yussuf Poulsen and Kasper Dolberg both go after a raking pass that pitches and curls past Jan Oblak’s goal. Neither is particularly close to it.

Kasper Hjulmand removes midfield namesake Morten (no relation) as his final change. Thomas Delaney is on.

Four minutes for either side to find a winner.

Slovenia 1-1 Denmark, 87 minutes

Denmark need to find a way to lift the energy again. Despite having nearly 70% of the ball, they’ve created just three shots on goal, the latest of which gently trims the grass on the way through to Jan Oblak.

A triple substitution for Denmark. Both strikers are removed - Yussuf Poulsen and Kasper Dolberg on for Rasmus Hojlund and Jonas Wind - while the fresh legs of Christian Norgaard are required in midfield. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg is the other man replaced.
