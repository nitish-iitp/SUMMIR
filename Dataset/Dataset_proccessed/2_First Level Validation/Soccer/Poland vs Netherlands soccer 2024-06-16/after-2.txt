EURO 2024
POLAND 1-2 NETHERLANDS: WOUT WEGHORST NETS LATE WINNER TO DENY DOGGED POLES AT EURO 2024 IN HAMBURG
BYDANIEL HARRIS

UPDATED 16/06/2024 AT 20:47 GMT

Netherlands had to come from behind to see off a resolute Poland side in Hamburg. Adam Buksa, in for the injured Robert Lewandowski, put Poland ahead from a corner with a fine flicked header, but Ronald Koeman's men replied shortly afterwards via Liverpool's Cody Gakpo. The game teetered thereafter before Wout Weghorst, on as a sub, converted to give his side victory in their Euro 2024 opener.

An 83rd-minute goal from supersub Wout Weghorst saw Netherlands to a narrow comeback win over Poland.
Though Netherlands started well enough, dominating possession, a game and organised Poland were solid at the back and dangerous in attack.

As such, it was no huge surprise when they went in front, Adam Buksa glancing home Piotr Zielinski’s near-post corner on 16 minutes.

Netherlands found a rapid leveller, though, as Bartosz Salamon deflected Cody Gakpo’s shot past Wojicech Szczesny.
There were fewer chances after the break but as Poland sat back, coach Michal Probierz took off Zielinski, his captain, while Ronald Koeman sent on Donyell Malen, Wout Weghorst and Jeremie Frimpong, all of whom made a difference.
And when the opportunity presented itself, Weghorst was clinical to send his side to all three points.
TALKING POINT - ARE 24 TEAMS TOO MANY?
In a way, it is nice to see a competition involving 24 nations - international football should be an inclusive celebration, and no one can argue that this is not that.

However, football is meritocratic not democratic, and 36 games to eliminate just eight teams feels like far too many. One win takes a team to the cusp of the knockout stages, and with no draws in the first five games, it feels relatively simple to predict which teams will progress from the groups we have already seen.

Moreover, each game has been won by the favourites so to do - in three cases, convincingly - all off which makes it hard not to wonder as to the precise sporting point of it all. Of course, the tournament will still be a lot of fun, and if we have learnt one thing these last couple of decades, it is that football always wins. But events such as this one should be the pinnacle of quality and competition, and that is a long way from the case here.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - WOUT WEGHORST (NETHERLANDS)
Nobody really stood out, so we will go for the man who scored the winner two minutes after coming on.

KEY MOMENTS
16’ - GOAL!! POLAND 1-0 NETHERLANDS (BUKSA) The Dutch mark zonally, Zielinkski's excellent near-post delivery picks out Buksa in between Dumfries and Van Dijk, and he times his leap nicely, glancing a header inside the far post!

22’ - HE'S MISSING IS MEMPHIS
Van Dijk wins a big header on halfway, Reijnders helps it on, and when Simons takes a touch inside, the ball escapes him and the tracking defenders, falling beautifully for Depay ... who cheerfully leathers it over the bar as if on purpose! That was a big chance.

29’ - GOAL!! POLAND 1-1 NETHERLANDS (GAKPO) A fluke, but you can't say Netherlands haven't earned it! They force a hopeful clearance from Bednarek, boxed in at right-back and Ake, marauding forward, takes into stride beautifully. Whereupon Gakpo takes over, lashing a low shot as Salomon extends a leg, taking the ball right as Szczesny dives left, powerless to prevent the equaliser.

42’ - OH CODY!
Schouten out to Simons, who slides down the line for the onrushing Ake, and his cut-back finds Gakpo in the middle! But from six yards, he pokes at it right-footed when he might sweep it left-footed, and the ball balloons over the bar! That is not good behaviour.

73’ - GOOD DELIVERY FROM MEMPHIS
And around the penalty spot, De Vrij is up! But he can only head over the top! That's the best chance of the half so far.

83’ - GOAL!! POLAND 1-2 NETHERLANDS (WEGHORST) AND THERE HE IS! This is so, so simple! Ake, allowed to run, slides a pass into the box and Bednarek extends a leg, the ball flicking off it and arriving perfectly into Weghorst's pass. And of course the arch finisher doesn't miss, turning a punchy-enough finish inside the near post and just under Szczesny's dive! The goal-machine has won it for Netherlands!
