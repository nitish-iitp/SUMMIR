Adam Buksa needed just 16 minutes to put Poland in the lead against the superior Netherlands, who were launching attacks in waves in Sunday's Euro 2024 contest. Robert Lewandowski was among the first to come jumping out of the Polish dugout as Buksa headed home from a Piotr Zielinski corner.  


Napoli's Zielinski received the captain's armband while Buksa was entrusted with leading the team's attack -- two responsibilities that were shouldered by Lewandowski.

The 27-year-old Buksa took his goal tally for the national side to seven in 19 appearances. But why was the talismanic Polish skipper, who has 82 goals in 150 appearances for Poland, watching from the dugout? Well, here is your answer.

Robert Lewandowski missed the Poland vs Netherlands Group D encounter owing to an injury. He was forced off with a right thigh injury against Turkey in a friendly last Monday. It was in the 32nd minute of the game that he suffered the blow.  Poland's team doctor Jacek Jaroszewski said in a statement the Barcelona star has a torn biceps femoris muscle.

He is expected to be back for Poland's outing against Austria. 

Arkadiusz Milik was to be up front with Lewandowski for the Euros until he damaged his left knee on Friday in the friendly against Ukraine. Milik returned to Juventus and had successful knee surgery on Monday.

Polish squad for Euro 2024 game against Netherlands: Wojciech Szczsny, Bartosz Salamon, Jan Bednarek, Piotr Zielinski (C), Taras Romanczuk, Jakub Kiwior, Adam Buksa, Przemysaw Frankowski, Sebastian Szymanski, Nicola Zalewski, Kacper Urbanski.
