Netherlands vs Germany predictions

The Netherlands vs Germany is one of the great rivalries of international football, and every edition of this fixture is an event to look forward to.

There have been some glorious clashes between this pair down the decades. The most famous, of course, was West Germany’s 2-1 victory over the Dutch in the final of the 1974 World Cup, a win they achieved despite falling behind in the second minute.

The Netherlands belatedly got their revenge in the semi-finals of Euro 1988, winning 2-1 to advance to a final from which they would also emerge triumphant.

This will be the 14th meeting between the pair since the turn of the century. It has been a pretty even contest since then, with four wins apiece and five draws.

Germany beat the Netherlands 2-1 in a friendly in March but plenty has happened in European football since then.

Most obviously, the Nationalelf restored their reputation at Euro 2024, reaching the quarter-finals and only narrowly suffering defeat by eventual winners Spain, who scored the winner in the penultimate minute of extra time.

The Netherlands also performed well over the summer, advancing to the semis before bowing out in dramatic circumstances at the hands of England, who scored through Ollie Watkins in the second minute of second-half stoppage time.

A top-two finish in their Nations League group is the objective now shared by these adversaries, both of whom got their campaign off to a successful start over the weekend.

Germany pumped Hungary 5-0 to rise to top spot, but the Netherlands are hot on their heels after a 5-2 victory over Bosnia-Herzegovina. 

With both expected to win all their other games, the two head-to-head contests between Germany and the Netherlands will be key to determining which side advances to the quarter-finals as group winners.

The Nations League is not as significant a prize as the World Cup or the European Championship, but the top teams in Europe are taking it increasingly seriously.

Matches between the Netherlands and Germany are always competitive. But with points on the line, Tuesday’s tussle should be particularly so.

Netherlands vs Germany betting tips

The Netherlands and Germany are ready to butt heads on matchday two of the Nations League.

Germany to win - 31/20 (BetMGM)

The Netherlands have home advantage on Tuesday and that could be a factor. However, we still find it hard to look past this Germany team.


The Nationalelf was in disarray just 12 months ago, but Julian Nagelsmann has whipped them into shape.

The presence in the dugout of the former Bayern Munich honcho shows the value of having a top-class coach in the international game.

Germany resemble a club side under Nagelsmann. You could argue they were the second-best team at Euro 2024 despite their early exit.

It is not necessarily that they have more individual quality in the ranks than the Netherlands, but they do have more cohesion and better balance.

The Netherlands were not completely convincing at the Euros and they could be second best in this one.

⚽ Tip Germany to win at 31/20 with BetMGM ⚽

Over 3.5 goals - 17/10 (BetMGM)

Both teams showcased their attacking potential at the weekend, as Germany and the Netherlands each hit five goals past hapless opponents.

This promises to be another entertaining encounter, although neither side is likely to score five times again.

Still, both the Netherlands and Germany will go on the attack in this one as they seek to take control of the group.

Nagelsmann has made Germany a front-footed, attack-minded team whose first objective is to hurt the opposition. They will not go gung-ho in Amsterdam, but nor will they sit back and adopt a passive approach, especially as their defence has been weakened with the absence of Antonio Rudiger.

And although the Netherlands have some excellent defenders, they are better going forward than they are at the back.

Jamal Musiala to score any time - 5/2 (BetMGM)

Neither Ronald Koeman nor Nagelsmann will make too many changes to their teams given the importance of the fixture.

That means Jamal Musiala is likely to continue as an attacking midfielder alongside Florian Wirtz and Kai Havertz.

Musiala and Wirtz are the future of the national team. They dovetailed neatly at Euro 2024 and have the intelligence and quality to make an impact against anyone.

Musiala found the back of the net against Hungary and, given his temperament, he will not shrink in front of what is sure to be a raucous atmosphere in Amsterdam.

The Bayern Munich man gets himself into dangerous positions in and around the penalty area, and he could take advantage of a Netherlands midfield which still looks a little unbalanced without Frenkie de Jong.

⚽ Choose Jamal Musiala as an anytime scorer at 5/2 with BetMGM ⚽
