FT
Netherlands and Germany play out an entertaining 2-2 draw in Amsterdam in the UEFA Nations League.
Ronald Koeman’s side made an electric start, scoring inside two minutes when Tijjani Reijnders latched on to a Ryan Graveberch through ball before firing past Marc Andre Ter Stegen.
Germany found an equaliser seven minutes from the break when Deniz Undav was on hand to rifle home a rebound following a Bart Verbruggen save and it only took Julian Nagelsmann’s side another eight minutes to take the lead. David Raum’s pass across the face of goal eventually ran to Joshua Kimmich at the back post who was able to slot home to make it 2-1.
Netherlands equalised six minutes into the second half, with Brian Brobbey finding Denzel Dumfries in the box who tapped home from close range.
Both sides remain unbeaten and on four points in their Nations League Group (3), with Nagelsmann’s side in top spot thanks to a superior goal difference. The two nations will square up again in the October international break.
