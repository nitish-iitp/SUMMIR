Netherlands lineup vs. Germany: Predicted XI for UEFA Nations League fixture

After making a stunning start to their latest UEFA Nations League campaign, the Netherlands will come up against one of their oldest rivals on Tuesday, as Germany pay a visit to Amsterdam.

The Oranje put five past opening opponents Bosnia-Herzegovina, so they may make few changes - if any - for a high-profile contest in League A Group 3.

As Memphis Depay is still seeking a new club after leaving Atletico Madrid, Joshua Zirkzee started up front at the weekend, notching his first international goal with an early header; the Manchester United striker is therefore favourite to lead the hosts' attack at Johan Cruijff Arena.

Cody Gakpo, Tijjani Reijnders and Xavi Simons were all on the scoresheet too, and that trio should be retained - fellow scorer Wout Weghorst will most likely be deployed from the bench.

Should coach Ronald Koeman opt for a more cautious lineup, then Gakpo could fill in as a false nine, perhaps opening the door for Donyell Malen to feature on the wing.

Two forwards certainly not in the picture are Steven Bergwijn - who Koeman criticised for his recent switch to the Saudi Pro League - and Depay, who has previously found the net 46 times for his nation.

At the back, captain Virgil van Dijk is set to start alongside Matthijs de Ligt, as Stefan de Vrij has been left out and Tottenham Hotspur defender Micky van de Ven had to withdraw from the squad due to injury.

Jan Paul van Hecke was called up as cover for the latter, while another Premier League player, Bournemouth's Justin Kluivert, should be on the bench after replacing the injured Joey Veerman.

Netherlands possible starting lineup: Verbruggen; Dumfries, De Ligt, Van Dijk, Ake; Schouten, Gravenberch, Reijnders; Simons, Gakpo; Zirkzee
