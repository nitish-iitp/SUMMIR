Four things we learnt from Netherlands' entertaining draw with Germany

Denzel Dumfries’ close range finish saw the Netherlands come from behind to draw 2-2 with old rivals Germany in a physical and engaging clash in the Nations League.

It was the Dutch who began the scoring on the night, Tijani Reijnders seizing onto a ball over the German defence to slot home after just two minutes. 

Germany equalised after 38 minutes when Deniz Undav made the most of some lapse defending to smash home a rebound and score his first goal for his country.

They then took the lead in first half added time when the two full-back combined; David Raum’s low cross found skipper Joshua Kimmich unmarked to score into the empty net.

The lead only lasted five minutes after the break, when Dumfries latched on to a cross to finish and seal a point for both sides.

Here are four things we learnt from tonight’s game.

Brobbey the leading man

The Netherlands have struggled to find a consistent striker to lead the line in recent years, but that problem may be solved if tonight is anything to go by. Brian Brobbey was immense as the lone striker. He ran non stop throughout the game, his hold up play was excellent and was a physically dominant presence all evening.

Both Jonathan Tah and Nico Schlotterbeck found themselves booked within a half an hour and will not want to face the Ajax man again in the near future having struggled mightily. 

Brobbey’s impact was no more pronounced for the opening goal, when a ball was fizzed into his chest, he manoeuvred well to lay it off to Ryan Gravenberch who sent Reijnders on his way to grab his second goal in successive games.

He got a proper assist for the second one, brilliantly holding off Schlotterbeck in the box, before finding Dumfries with a cross so he could tap in.

With The Dutch having relied on different striking options recently, Luuk De Jong and Wout Weghorst come to mind, it may be the 22-year-old has staked his claim to be the main number nine moving forward.

Undav off the mark

After netting 18 goals on loan for Stuttgart last season, the former Brighton man has finally opened his account for his country.

A mistake in the Dutch defence saw Germany bare down on the goal, and while Bart Verbruggen saved the initial effort, Undav was there to smash home a fine left-footed finish into the roof of the net, to grab his first goal in a German shirt.

There was also a wonderful moment in the second half, where he plucked the ball out of the sky to control and lay it off, a move that showed how much confidence he was playing with. 

While Kai Havertz seems to be Julian Nagelsmann’s preferred option to play up front, Undav is a more traditional style striker and will remain a decent option in the future.

De Ligt continues to struggle

Matthijs De Ligt’s tough start to the season continued in Amsterdam as he struggled mightily on the night of his 47th cap. The ex-Bayern defender has had an underwhelming start to his Manchester United career, following his summer transfer, with him being involved in two pretty humbling defeats to Brighton and Liverpool respectively. 

Things haven’t gotten any easier while on international duty either, as it could be argued he was at fault for two Bosnian goals on Saturday, while being the architect of the first German goal against his side tonight.

A loose pass out of defence from De Ligt was seized upon, and a second later ended up in the Dutch net. To make matters worse, he was hooked at half-time for Jan Paul van Hecke to end a miserable evening.

A player who was once seen as the next great young Netherlands player will need to turn his form around if he is to be part of this team under Ronald Koeman.

Andrich a brick wall

It is tough to be a stand out player in a team with technically gifted players like Florian Wirtz, Jamal Musiala and Kai Havertz, yet Robert Andrich was just that against the Netherlands.

Physically imperious in the middle of the pitch, he covered so much ground and kept things ticking over really well as Germany marauded forward in periods.

It wasn’t just the dig in and dirty stuff either, Germany’s second goal came as a result of a brilliant outside of the boot pass to find Raum, who flashed to the ball across for Kimmich to finish.

A key man in Bayer Leverkusen’s unbeaten double-winning campaign last season, Andrich has cemented himself as a key cog in this German midfield. And while he might not be the flashiest, it is his work that allows Die Mannschaft’s wunderkinds to shine.
