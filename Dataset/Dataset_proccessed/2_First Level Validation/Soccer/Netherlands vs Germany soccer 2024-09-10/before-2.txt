Both nations scored five goals on matchday 1.

Ultimately aiming to win the UEFA Nations League and end their long wait for a trophy, the Netherlands will welcome Germany to the Johan Cruyff Arena on Tuesday night. After a disappointing exit from the Euro 2024, the Dutch team will now look to get their hands on the Nations League. Even though they reached the semifinal of the Euro 2024, they were eventually knocked out by England. They did play some really good football last game, beating Bosnia and Herzegovina 5-2.

Julian Nagelsmann hopes to usher in a new era of German football, no longer reliant on the giants of the past. This is the first time that Germany have called up a squad without any of the players from the 2014 FIFA World Cup triumph. This match will be a good test for the German team for sure and fans can expect them to play an attacking brand of football. Last game they defeated Hungary 5-0.
