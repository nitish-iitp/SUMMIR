MOTD Live: UEFA Euro 2024 - France v Portugal

Live coverage of a blockbuster Euro 2024 quarter-final between Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal and Kylian Mbappe’s France, with the sides meeting in a repeat of the 2016 final.

France hosted this tournament eight years ago but it was Portugal who tore up the script by winning the final at the Stade de France - although that 1-0 victory is their only win against Les Bleus in 14 meetings since the 1970s.

The two nations last met in the group stage of Euro 2020 when Ronaldo netted two penalties in a 2-2 draw to equal the all-time record in men’s football of 109 goals. The 39-year-old is bidding to become the first man to score at six different European Championships but has failed to net in his first four appearances at this tournament.

Gary Lineker presents comprehensive live coverage, with commentary from Steve Wilson and Danny Murphy.
