Euro 2024: Portugal's Bernardo Silva makes bold claim ahead of France showdown

Bernardo Silva has said that it "would definitely be the most important trophy" of his career if he was able to help Portugal win this summer's European Championship.

Roberto Martinez's side overcame Slovenia on penalties in the last-16 stage of Euro 2024 to advance to the final eight, and they will battle France on Friday for a spot in the semi-finals.

Bernardo has won a host of trophies during his professional career, including six Premier League titles and the Champions League, but the Manchester City attacker has said that European glory this summer with Portugal would represent his best-ever title.

"It's not going to be an easy match; it's the quarter-finals. All the teams are here on merit because they're very strong national teams," Bernardo told UEFA's official website.

"They're the best eight teams in Europe. And we're going to play against a team which six years ago were world champions and who were in another World Cup final 18 months ago.

Bernardo talks-up European glory this summer

"They're a team accustomed to these things, accustomed to playing in the knockout stages, and they have a lot of experience. But we're going for it, with the aim of qualifying for the semi-finals, because we're a great team too.

"Our goal is to win and to get closer to the final until we win the trophy. When it comes to the possibility of getting that victory for Portugal, I have had the chance to win a lot of things. I won the Premier League six times.

"I won a UEFA Champions League. And a UEFA Nations League for Portugal. But if I won the UEFA EURO, then that would definitely be the most important trophy of my career, and it would have a special place in my heart."

Bernardo was not a part of the Portugal squad that won Euro 2016, missing the tournament due to injury, and he also opened up on missing the competition eight years ago.

Portugal will face France in Friday's quarter-final

"It was very sad. I got injured in the last training session – I tore my hamstring, and I missed the EURO. It was a very sad moment because it was going to be my first competition [with the national team]," he added.

"I don't have any resentment. I think the sadness I felt at not being there gave me the motivation to look for other things. That's where the motivation came from for the great season I had at Monaco. So that was part of my journey."

Portugal picked up six points from their three matches in the group stage of Euro 2024, beating Czech Republic and Turkey before losing 2-0 to Georgia.

The Iberian nation were far from their best against Slovenia in the round of 16, but they managed to progress to the quarter-finals on penalties.

Bernardo played the full 90 minutes against both Czech Republic and Turkey before being rested against Georgia, but he was then back in the side against Slovenia and scored the winning penalty in the shootout.
