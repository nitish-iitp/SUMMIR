Post-match postbag. “A lifetime of supporting Iceland has bred in me a deep sense of pessimism, not even really uprooted by the period of success. So I wasn’t expecting much tonight, but the team played well and deserved their victory. I’m not quite at the point of clapping my hands and shouting monosyllabically, but this has me feeling very mildly optimistic. Huh” – Kári Tulinius

“Luciano Spalletti has given Didier Deschamps a masterclass in counter-attacking football all’Italiano. His former pupil at Napoli, Raspadori, had a splendid second half, getting into all the right positions and scoring from a marvellous move. Dimarco was immense and scored a wondergoal, Tonali also very positive. Italy can hold their heads up high after a slump. France have been thoroughly outthought and outclassed” – Colum Fordham

“Plenty of reasons to be cheerful for the Azzurri tonight, Scott. Which is as good an excuse as any to shoehorn this song referencing everyone’s favourite Italian chanter Adriano Celentano into the MBM. Alright!” – Simon McMahon, who knows full well I can’t resist

Fine results for Belgium, Iceland and Romania. Wales and ten-man Turkey will be happy enough for different reasons. But the big news is Italy’s first win in France since 1954, 70 years and seven visits ago. That game had a similar rhythm: Roger Piantoni of Nancy gave the hosts an early lead, only for Italy to hit back hard, Roma’s Egisto Pandolfini equalising, his club team-mate Carlo Galli scoring two more to seal a 3-1 comeback win. This time round, Bradley Barcola’s 13-second jawdropper was wiped out by Federico Dimarco, Davide Frattesi and Giacomo Raspadori. Dimarco’s effort, a stunning end to a scintillating move, was worthy of winning the game by itself.

Wales 0-0 Turkey. Wales hope to launch one last attack, but Neco Williams miskicks in midfield, then Kieffer Moore skittles Hakan Çalhanoğlu, and it’ll be Turkey who have the last opportunity … but Çalhanoğlu’s free kick towards a crowded box is no good. That’ll be that.

Wales 0-0 Turkey. A huge chance for Wales to nick it, as substitute Lewis Koumas jigs his way down the left and pulls back for Brennan Johnson, who spins on the spot only for his effort to get deflected wide. Nothing comes of the resulting corner.

Wales 0-0 Turkey. The ten men nearly take the lead with four minutes remaining! A corner fizzed in from the left. Abdülkerim Bardakcı meets it with a powerful downward header but Danny Ward handles confidently on his goalline. Fine play all round.

21.32 BST

GOAL! Kosovo 0-3 Romania. Răzvan Marin wraps it up with his second of the evening. And soon after, if it wasn’t already over, Kosovo’s Mërgim Vojvoda is sent off for a not-particularly-early bath, having picked up a second yellow.

6 Sept 2024
21.30 BST

Wales 0-0 Turkey. Kieffer Moore is fine to continue, but he’s all bandaged up having had his forehead cut open. Turns out Çağlar Söyüncü studded him in the face before collapsing on him. Sounds bad, and was, but it looked accidental and none of the players, least of all Moore, are acting as though it was anything else. Everyone plays on, Moore particularly bravely.

6 Sept 2024

Wales 0-0 Turkey. A long break in play as Kieffer Moore gets some treatment, the full weight of Çağlar Söyüncü landing on his head as the pair fell to the ground.

Wales 0-0 Turkey. Brennan Johnson makes good down the right and whistles an extremely tempting ball through the six-yard box. But there’s nobody there in red to bundle home. Johnson yelps in frustration, as well he might.

GOAL! France 1-3 Italy (Raspadori 74)

This is happening, people. The Azzurri haven’t won in Paris since 1954, but now the long wait looks like ending at last. Destiny Udogie slips a ball in from the left for Giacomo Raspadori, who gets clear to double Italy’s advantage. What a response this has been to that absurd 13-second concession.

Belgium 3-1 Israel. To be fair to Openda, he’s won two penalties and set up Youri Tielemans for his goal, so despite the miss, he’s well in credit this evening.

21.15 BST

Belgium 3-1 Israel. It should be four, and Kevin De Bruyne should have his first-ever hat-trick for Belgium. But he gives Loïs Openda, who wins another penalty, the chance to score one himself … and Openda’s effort is saved by Yoav Gerafi.

6 Sept 2024
21.12 BST

Wales 0-0 Turkey. Well that’s got the crowd up. Wales are pinging it around nicely. But they’ve been doing that for most of the evening against XI, to be fair. “An interesting dynamic is playing out here,” observes David Bowen. “One team is playing progressive and cultured football, one team is somewhat direct and physically robust. You would not think the former team has a coach who was somewhat combative as a player and the latter as smooth as silk. A reversal of expectations you’d think. Anyway, Bellamy seems to have this Wales team doing some good things.”

RED CARD: Barış Alper Yılmaz (Turkey). Yılmaz was slightly unfortunate to get booked in the first half after a 50-50 kerfuffle with Joe Rodon. But he knows he’s on a booking, and going in late on Neco Williams isn’t the wisest move. Studs on top of boot. An argument that it could be a red by itself, though it’s probably more like an orange. But a second yellow is enough to send him packing.

Half-time postbag. “Italy going from strength to strength: after conceding the fastest-ever Euro finals goal (23 seconds v Albania), they’ve now conceded probably the fastest ever Nations League goal” – Andy (not that one) Flintoff

“Do the French team have a new and more adventurous trainer with the same name as Didier Deschamps and who looks exactly like him? This is fast, relentless stuff, not the usual plonking wait-for-Kylian-to-do-something quagmire. France are nippy and entertaining. May not last” – Charles Antaki (whose email arrived a couple of minutes before Italy’s equaliser)

“In reply to Andy Flintoff’s assertion that Erling Haaland should have chosen to play for England rather than Norway; maybe he would have if his dad’s football career didn’t end when it did. Maybe Haaland Jr would have gone to school here, developed greater affinity for the country of his birth and turned out for England. You can thank Roy Keane that none of this happened” – Cathal Chu

“I can heartily recommend the local beer, for those like Alun Pugh in Nikšić, specifically Nikšićko” – Laoi Ó Murchù

Wales 0-0 Turkey. Wales have the ball in the net but it won’t count. A simple punt down the middle does for Turkey, who are all over the place. Sorba Thomas tears clear and lobs Mert Günok, who gets a hand on the ball but can’t stop it looping into the unguarded net. Sadly Thomas went too soon, something both linesman and VAR aggree on.

GOAL! France 1-1 Italy (Dimarco 30)

Italy haven’t won in Paris for 70 years. But in the wake of that nightmare start, the dream is back on. And this is an absolute pearler! Andrea Cambiaso drifts in from the right and sprays a pass towards Federico Dimarco on the other flank. Dimarco rolls infield for Sandro Tonali, who strokes a defence-splitting backheeled return down the inside-left channel. Dimarco meets the dropping ball and sends an elegant volley across Mike Maignan and into the top right! There may not be a better goal all season.

Wales 0-0 Turkey. A spate of bookings in Cardiff. Kenan Yıldız is late on Connor Roberts. An in-flight Yıldız is then cynically pulled back by Harry Wilson. Then Yıldız is tugged back by Brennan Johnson; another yellow. And finally Barış Alper Yılmaz is booked, rather weirdly it has to be said, after being lightly brushed by Joe Rodon in the Wales penalty box, then taking exception to Rodon’s attempt at hauling him back to his feet. Rodon makes himself scarce, having got away with one there.

GOAL! Belgium 1-0 Israel (De Bruyne 21). Kevin De Bruyne does what his Manchester City team-mate Erling Haaland couldn’t manage earlier in Kazakhstan. A goal! Their fellow Citizen, Jérémy Doku, tees it up with a run down the left and cutback.

Wales 0-0 Turkey. Harry Wilson sends a free kick in from the left. Ben Davies tries to steer home an acrobatic shot at the far stick but his shot is deflected out for a corner. The set piece is half cleared, but Connor Roberts curls a sensational ball in from the right. It drops to Joe Rodon, six yards out and all alone. He’s been played onside, and has to score, but leans back and shanks his sidefooted effort yards over the bar. Oh dear. What fine play otherwise, though. What a ball in from Roberts.

Wales 0-0 Turkey. Wales are well on top here. Harry Wilson makes a nuisance of himself near the centre circle to spook Turkey into shipping possession. The ball breaks to Ethan Ampadu who strides forward and lashes a fierce shot well wide right of goal. The early signs suggest that Craig Bellamy’s new high-speed pass-and-move style could be fun.

Wales 0-0 Turkey. Another good chance for Aaron Ramsey, who meets Sorba Thomas’s right-wing corner but gets his feet in a tangle at the near post. The ball clanks wide. It might not have been easier to score, but it was probably just as easy to hit the target. Either way, chalk it up as another poor connection.

France 1-0 Italy. That was a nightmare start for Italy, and in particular Giovanni Di Lorenzo, who was snoozing and snoozing hard as Bradley Barcola waltzed off with his swag. What pressing by Barcola, though. If only Euro 2024 favourites France had been similarly proactive in Germany, huh.

Wales 0-0 Turkey. The hosts have started on the front foot in Cardiff. Connor Roberts storms down the right flank and crosses for Aaron Ramsey, who throws himself at the ball, eight yards out, and flashes a header over the bar. Actually on second glance, the ball hit his shoulder. A slightly scrappy end to an otherwise swashbuckling move.

France and Italy were both disappointing at Euro 2024, in their own distinct but not particularly eye-catching ways. The journey onwards and upwards begins tonight at the Parc des Princes, and despite everything that went on back there in Germany, it’s still a showdown to whet the appetite. Here are how the teams line up.

The new Wales boss Craig Bellamy speaks to S4C. “Sorba Thomas has energy and aggressiveness with pressing but also runs in behind … he deserves his place … there’s been a lot of work this week … it was definitely needed … the exciting part is to see how it comes out today … the combinations and the links … the understanding between the players … see how far they’ve come in such a short place of time.”

Pre-match postbag. “We appear to have arrived early in Nikšic - the hastily arranged venue for Monday’s game against Montenegro. I’m making some progress with getting my head around the polycentric and digraphic nature of the language formerly known as Serbo-Croat but cannot understand why Karl Darlow has bagged the number one shirt but doesn’t start. Any clues? And it’s a bit of a long shot but does anyone know of a bar here showing the Wales-Turkey game?” – Alun Pugh

“Maybe Erling Haaland should have picked the country of his birth (England) rather than the country of his father? He’d have been just as mobile as Harry Kane at Euro 2024, and might have scored a few more too” – Andy (not that one) Flintoff

Craig Bellamy names Aaron Ramsey as captain of his first selection as Wales manager. There’s no Dan James, who is hamstrung, but Brennan Johnson and Harry Wilson offer some threat up front. Neco Williams, whose goal against the Turks last November allowed Wales to dream of automatic qualification for 36 minutes, starts at the back, while Nantes winger Sorba Thomas earns a recall.

Turkey – pound for pound, the most entertaining team at the Euros (see below) – start without captain and Ballon d’Or nominee Hakan Çalhanoğlu, who has injury concerns and is wrapped in cotton wool on the bench. Edge-of-seat-bothering 19-year-old superstar-in-waiting Arda Güler starts.

Erling Haaland has scored seven goals in his first three matches this season for Manchester City, but tonight the big man played all 90 minutes for Norway in Almaty yet didn’t get a single shot on target.
