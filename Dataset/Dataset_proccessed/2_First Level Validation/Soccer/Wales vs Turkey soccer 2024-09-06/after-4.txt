Wales vs Turkey LIVE: Nations League result and reaction as hosts settle for draw despite strong performance

Referee Rohit Saggi speaks to Wales pair Aaron Ramsey and Ethan Ampadu in the goalless Nations League draw with Turkey (David Davies/PA) (PA Wire)

Craig Bellamy’s first match in charge of the Welsh national team was an exciting and promising affair that displayed how he wants them to play going forward. The Dragons hosted Turkey at the Cardiff City Stadium and drew 0-0 in a positive performance that had flair and style.

From the get-go Wales were the more aggressive team. They took charge of the ball and utilised the pace of forwards Brennan Johnson and Sorba Thomas who set up on either wing. In the middle Aaron Ramsey and Harry Wilson juggled playmaking duties admirably as Wales created the better chances over the first 45 minutes.

Ramsey nodded a chance over the top and Joe Rodon failed to convert from close range. The best chance fell to Thomas who broke through the lines and perfectly lobbed the goalkeeper only to be ruled offside.

In the second half there was hope of a famous win after Baris Yilmaz collected a second yellow card and Turkey went down to 10 men. Bellamy made substitutions to try and keep the energy levels high, but Wales couldn’t break the deadlock, and the match finished goalless.

Not the result the Welsh fans wanted but they were encouraged by the performance. Bellamy has Wales playing exciting football.

Good evening!

14:14 , Mike Jones

Welcome to The Independent’s coverage of tonight’s Nations League action as Wales face Turkey for the first match of their campaign.

It is the beginning of a new era for the Dragons as Craig Bellamy takes charge of his first game having replaced Rob Page as manager over the summer.

It is not an easy introduction for the Welshman as Turkey reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2024 and are in very fine form.

We’ll have all the team news, updates and more throughout the afternoon so stick with us as we build up to kick off at 7.45pm

Wales vs Turkey LIVE

17:00 , Mike Jones

Wales open their Nations League campaign against Turkey at the Cardiff City Stadium on Friday looking for the perfect start to Craig Bellamy’s reign.

Former Wales captain Bellamy was appointed manager in early July and has set about preparing Wales as they look to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, though the Nations League provides the first chances to shape his team and test themselves against similar opposition.

Nevertheless, their first test is against a Turkey side that many will feel are far superior to The Dragons, with players such as Real Madrid’s Arda Guler and Inter Milan’s Hakan Çalhanoğlu having helped them to the quarter-finals of Euro 2024.

Turkey left Germany disappointed after a narrow loss to the Netherlands, but their future is in safe hands and head coach Vincenzo Montella will look to build on an inspiring summer, starting with a win in Cardiff.

When is Wales vs Turkey?

Wales vs Turkey kicks off at 7.45pm BST on Friday 6 September at the Cardiff City Stadium in Cardiff, Wales.

Wales’ early team news

17:15 , Mike Jones

Craig Bellamy’s first Wales squad features many of the names that fans have become used to seeing, including Ethan Ampadu and Aaron Ramsey, who Bellamy announced will retain the captaincy.

Ipswich pair Nathan Broadhead and Wes Burns were not considered due to injury, and nor was Bournemouth midfielder David Brooks, while winger Dan James has been ruled out through injury.

Bellamy has added 33-year-old Karl Darlow as goalkeeping back-up, while recalling Mark Harris and Oli Cooper for the first time in over a year. Sorba Thomas has also been recalled, having left Huddersfield last summer to join Ligue 1 club Nantes on loan.

Turkey early team news

17:20 , Mike Jones

The Turkey squad is much the same as it was during Euro 2024, with new Brighton signing Ferdi Kadioglu the only notable absentee.

Former Leicester defender Çağlar Soyuncu returns to the squad after missing the summer tournament through injury, while stalwarts such as Hakan Calhanoglu, Orkun Kökçü, Arda Güler and Barış Alper Yılmaz all retain their places.

Wales vs Turkey predicted line-ups

17:25 , Mike Jones

Wales XI: Ward; Williams, Cabango, Rodon, Davies; Ampadu, James; Wilson, Ramsey, Johnson; Moore.

Turkey XI: Gunok; Muldur, Soyuncu, Akaydın, Bardakcı; Ozcan, Kokcu; Güler, Calhanoglu, Yildiz; Yilmaz.

Wales vs Turkey prediction

17:30 , Mike Jones

Wales begin a new era under Craig Bellamy and several players will be desperate to impress, so Wales should be able to find a result against a Turkey side who performed well at Euro 2024. Turkey have more quality in their ranks, but the nature of the match means Wales should be able to get at least a draw.

Wales 1-1 Turkey.

The return of the Nations League: Groups, favourites and what’s new in 2024/25 as Spain defend crown

17:35 , Mike Jones

An expanded Uefa Nations League is upon us as the first international break of the Premier League season ramps up.

The fourth edition of this competition adds an extra knockout round and maintains the jeopardy of promotion and relegation in its mini leagues – a fate England know too well after dropping to League B following a poor string of results in 2022.

Designed to eliminate meaningless international friendlies in favour of pitting similarly ranked nations against each other in a competitive environment, the Nations League has proven a springboard to success for previous winners Portugal, France and Spain.

England’s best result remains the third-place finish they achieved under Gareth Southgate in the 2018/19 inaugural edition. This time out, Lee Carsley’s men will aim for promotion back to the elite.

The return of the Nations League: Groups, favourites and what’s new in 2024/25

Bellamy hoping to introduce new style of play

17:40 , Mike Jones

Craig Bellamy will begin his much-anticipated reign as Wales head coach on Friday with a Nations League match against Turkey in Cardiff.

He has used his first training sessions with the squad to implement a progressive new style of play and tonight’s game will provide an insight into how the team are developing.

“It’s going to be a very proud moment. I’ve worked hard for this and I’m going to recognise that,” said Bellamy, “But that moment when the game gets going, I’m not paid to be emotional. I’m paid to make the best decisions possible on the side.

“That’s the business I’m in straight away. Of course I’m proud and I’m fully aware that the moment is going to catch me. But it has to leave very quickly because there’s a big responsibility and the players need me as well in that moment.

“When I look back on my career I wished I’d enjoyed it more. I’m fully aware of what it means representing your country. But I want to enjoy it by being calm and clear on every situation that can occur in the game.”

Bellamy on his Welsh squad

17:45 , Mike Jones

“I see a young team, see a lot of talent coming through but, if I’m honest, I see a very good team right now,” said the new manager when assessing his players.

“The way I’m looking to try and play with Wales is a little different to what they’ve done before. I need to be true to me but, with the talented players we have, if we can tweak and adapt one or two little bits it will give us a huge benefit going into future games.

“I’m conscious of a period in stamping on how we are going to play. It would be a little bit crazy for me to expect it straight away, but of course I will try.

“You talk about building blocks and future games, but this is your country, playing for Wales. Who’s to say you are going to have future games? Who is going to say you are good enough for that? Who’s to say I’m good enough for that? Every game is important, it’s your national team.”

The return of the Nations League

17:50 , Mike Jones

Wales’ return to Nations League action comes a day after Scotland suffered a heart-breaking defeat against Poland at Hampden Park.

Steve Clarke’s men were the more aggressive and prominent side but two penalties, one in the 97th minute, cost them dearly as they slumped to a 3-2 defeat.

England also get their new era started tomorrow as Lee Carsley’s first match takes place against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. T

he interim boss has selected mostly familiar names but there are a few surprises with the former U21 head coach rewarding some of his previous players with full international call ups.

Before that though is tonight’s action in Cardiff, how will Wales fare and can they kick off their new start with a win?

Brawls, boos and ‘plastic Paddys’: how the English and Irish football teams became eternally entwined

17:55 , Mike Jones

For some around the Irish squad, it’s still strange to be preparing for a match against Lee Carsley’s England. Ireland made a strong push for the admired coach, since he has 40 caps for the country. A solid Ireland midfielder is now the most important figure in English football culture, and will have a tricolour by his name if he takes England to the World Cup.

Carsley was born in Birmingham but qualified for Ireland through his Cork grandmother, and spoke last week of naturally feeling both nationalities. The same applies to many for Saturday’s game in Dublin, most notably Declan Rice and Jack Grealish, who make up at least nine England regulars over the last half-decade that could have also represented Ireland. It is almost an inevitable inversion of the fixture’s history, when it was Ireland that most benefited from the country’s diaspora to Britain.

How the English and Irish football teams became eternally entwined

5 talking points for Wales as the Craig Bellamy era gets under way

18:00 , Mike Jones

1) Bellamy bow

As a player, Craig Bellamy wore his heart on his sleeve. Often snarling and controversial, Bellamy made headlines on and off the pitch.

But no-one could dispute his ability or the passion he had playing for Wales.

Having lost out on the job to Ryan Giggs in 2018, Bellamy now gets the chance to manage his country and it promises to be an exciting ride.

Now 45, the former striker appears a calmer presence and is ready for management after cutting his coaching teeth alongside Vincent Kompany at Anderlecht and Burnley.

18:05 , Mike Jones

2) Ramsey role

Aaron Ramsey remains as Wales captain under Bellamy – but what will be the 33-year-old’s actual role?

Ramsey has not played for Wales in almost 12 months with injury plaguing the Cardiff midfielder.

He has completed Cardiff’s four Championship games this season, but the Bluebirds have yet to win and are bottom of the table.

Bellamy is a big fan and convinced his former teammate can be a threat in the final third, so the key might be finding the right system to maximise Ramsey’s attacking instincts.

18:10 , Mike Jones

3) Can Johnson shine?

Brennan Johnson has yet to impress for Wales on a consistent basis and the Tottenham forward’s numbers do not make great reading.

Johnson has scored only three times in 28 appearances, although many of his earlier caps came off the bench.

The fleet-footed Johnson – recorded as one of the fastest players in the Premier League – is now 23 and has a season under his belt at Spurs.

Bellamy says Johnson is worth far more than the £47.5million transfer fee Spurs paid Nottingham Forest for him and the winger seems set to play a major role in his new-look Wales.

18:15 , Mike Jones

4) Darlow option

Wales’ goalkeeping problems are well documented.

Page sometimes picked four – Danny Ward, Wayne Hennessey, Adam Davies and Tom King – in a squad but not one of them made a single league appearance last season.

Bellamy has got Karl Darlow on board, persuading the Northampton-born Leeds goalkeeper to commit to Wales when others have failed.

Darlow is behind Illan Meslier at Leeds, but the 33-year-old has played 250 career games for Newcastle and Nottingham Forest among others and his addition could be a masterstroke from Bellamy.

18:20 , Mike Jones

5) Revenge mission

Wales and Turkey clash again less than 10 months after meeting in Euro 2024 qualifying.

On that occasion Wales had to win and needed Croatia to drop points against Armenia to qualify automatically. Neither happened as Wales were held 1-1 in Cardiff and Croatia won.

Wales headed for the play-offs, which they failed to navigate.

Turkey went on to reach the quarter-finals at the Euros, but were fortunate to draw in Cardiff. Johnson had what looked a stonewall penalty turned down at 1-0 and the visitors levelled through a dubious spot-kick.

How Fifa’s lowest-ranked nation finally secured their first competitive win after 20 years of pain

18:25 , Mike Jones

It goes some way to illustrating the pain and patience that fans of San Marino have had to endure that their winning goalscorer on Thursday night wasn’t even born the last time the landlocked nation tasted international success. When Nicko Sensoli fired home the eventual winner against Liechtenstein, the 19-year-old snapped football’s longest winless run; two decades and 140 games after beating their fellow minnows, the Italian enclave could celebrate again.

Sensoli’s goal was scrappy, not that the crowd at the Stadio Olimpico di Serravalle remotely cared. A forward diagonal seemingly bound for goalkeeper Benjamin Buchel was headed errantly by a Liechtenstein player, taking it just about within prodding distance of the San Marino teenager. Seldom has a toe poke been so rapturously received.

Here’s some pre-match thoughts form Vicenzo Montella

18:30 , Mike Jones

Turkey’s head coach said: “As you know, national matches are played with very different emotions. We have won 3 of the 9 matches we have played with our opponent.

“It is an important detail for us that we have not won any away games. It is in our hands to overturn this. I trust you. We will go out and achieve our first victory.

“Let’s be aware of our strength. Especially the Wales match is very important. If we start with a win, the rest will follow. Whoever is the most ready should go out on the field and reflect on the field what we worked on in training. That’s all I want.”

Bellamy won’t dwell on special occasion

18:40 , Mike Jones

Asked at his pre-match press conference what walking out in front of the fans would feel like Criag Bellamy said: “Of course it goes over in your head. It’s going to be a very proud moment.

“I’ve worked hard for this and I’m going to recognise that. But that moment when the game gets going, I’m not paid to be emotional. I’m paid to make the best decisions possible on the side.

“That’s the business I’m in straightaway. Of course I’m proud and I’m fully aware that the moment is going to catch me.

“But it has to leave very quick because there’s a big responsibility and the players need me as well.

“Being prepared for different solutions that could occur and being calm to make the right decision at the right moment. That’s what I’m looking forward to.”

Ramsey remains Wales captain

18:45 , Mike Jones

Aaron Ramsey remains Wales captain after deciding to prolong his international career just four months from his 34th birthday.

The 84-times capped Ramsey has been blighted by injury and not played for Wales in almost 12 months, remaining on the bench during the Euro 2024 play-off final defeat to Poland in March.

“It was frustrating not to get over the line and qualify, and not to come on as well (against Poland) and not have an impact. I didn’t want to go out like that,” said Ramsey.

“I think there’s going to be a lot of success for this team and I definitely want to be part of that. I think I can add value to that as well ahead of the World Cup. I don’t see any value in just playing the Nations League.

“It’s all the way through now. I’m feeling good. I’m excited with the potential of this team.”

‘Wales have score to settle'

18:50 , Mike Jones

Harry Wilson believes Wales have a score to settle with Turkey after missing out on Euro 2024.

Wales finished behind group winners Turkey and Croatia in Euro 2024 qualifying, forcing them down the play-off route where they eventually succumbed to Poland on penalties.

Turkey are back in Cardiff on Friday for Wales’ Nations League game opener, and Fulham attacker Wilson said: “I’d say we definitely owe them one after the last campaign.

“We were hard done by in Cardiff. The game out there, they were the better team before the red card. We we were still it in then (at 0-0), but as soon as you go down to 10 men it’s tough away from home.”

Harry Wilson on Craig Bellamy

18:55 , Mike Jones

The international paths of Harry Wilson and Craig Bellamy crossed for a few brief minutes as the former came off the bench in a World Cup qualifier against Belgium in October 2013, becoming Wales’ youngest player at the age of 16 years and 207 days.

Bellamy brought the curtain down on his 78-cap Wales career following that Brussels draw, saying after the game Wilson was too young to be capped.

“We’ve not spoken about that. I feel like we’re focused on the here and now,” said Wilson, “He said in one of the meetings that he didn’t get to qualify as a player.

“But he’s watched as a fan and seen the older boys in the squad qualify for multiple major tournaments, and then myself and some of the younger ones that have been to two.

“He wasn’t able to get there as a player, but as a coach he really feels like he can lead us to another one. To see the standard he set as a player was great, and I feel like he’s taken that into his coaching.”

New Wales manager Craig Bellamy reveals why he jumped at ‘rare’ opportunity

19:00 , Mike Jones

Craig Bellamy has revealed that the opportunity to manage Wales was too rare an opportunity to turn down as he spoke for the first time since being appointed.

The former Manchester City, Liverpool and Newcastle forward was named as the new Wales manager earlier this week, replacing Rob Page, who was sacked after a poor run of results ended in Wales failing to qualify for Euro 2024.

Bellamy, who could have remained at Burnley as an assistant to Scott Parker, made 78 appearances for his country between 1998 and 2013, and is a former Wales captain.

Almost time for kick off at the Cardiff City Stadium.

Craig Bellamy will be hoping for a successful start to this era of Welsh football. He’s brought some early messages to the team about high intensity and dominating possession.

Turkey will be a tough team to control though and it’ll be interesting to see how Wales go tonight. Kick off is up next...

Kick off! Wales 0-0 Turkey

19:48 , Mike Jones

The anthems are played before kick off with the watching crowd in full voice as the Welsh national anthem is sung under the lights at the Cardiff City Stadium.

Wales get the ball rolling for this Nations League clash. They send it back to the defence where it gets booted over to the right wing with Brennan Johnson the target but the ball is chested out for a throw in.

We’re underway!

Wales 0-0 Turkey

19:50 , Mike Jones

3 mins: Johnson receives the ball out on the right side and slots it over to Ethan Ampadu. He slips the ball into the penalty area but Connor Roberts’ enterprising run doesn’t end with him in possession.

19:53 , Mike Jones

6 mins: Kenan Yildiz is clattered early on by Joe Rodon with that tackle bringing out a round a loud cheers from the Welsh crowd.

Sorba Thomas, positioned out on the left tonight, makes a nice run down the wing before slipping a pass into the feet of Aaron Ramsey.

He collects, spins and flicks a cross over to the other side of the box. Brennan Johnson recovers the loose ball and backheels it. A second cross comes into the box and Ramsey is there to head his chance over the crossbar!

Wales 0-0 Turkey

19:57 , Mike Jones

9 mins: This is nice play from Wales. They look confident and spritely with Thomas and Johnson looking sharp on either wing. Already there have been plenty of crosses sent into the box but Wales are also playing through the lines.

Johnson darts into the box and squares a pass but it gets cleared out for a corner. The first of the game.

Wales 0-0 Turkey

19:59 , Mike Jones

12 mins: Sorba Thomas’ corner finds Aaron Ramsey at the near post but he doesn’t quite catch the shot right and it sails wide of the target.

Craig Bellamy is an animated figure on the sidelines, barking orders and gesturing to his players.

Wales 0-0 Turkey

20:01 , Mike Jones

15 mins: Brennan Johnson wins a free kick near the right touchline but the set piece is cleared out for another corner. This one is defended well by the visitors too.

Wales are putting the pressure on Turkey here.

Former Wales striker Helen Ward is pleased with what she’s seeing. On BBC Radio Wales she says: “You can tell Wales are trying new things, they look inventive and full of ideas.

“A very exciting first 13 minutes.”

Wales 0-0 Turkey

20:06 , Mike Jones

18 mins: Wales win another free kick, this one over on the inside left side of the pitch. It gets swung into the box by Harry Wilson who finds Ben Davies all alone.

The ball is slightly behind him and he can only turn it wide of goal.

Close! From the corner the ball is played short then whipped into the box from Sorba Thomas. It drops to Joe Rodon who then lifts a half-volley over the crossbar!

Wales 0-0 Turkey

20:10 , Mike Jones

21 mins: It’s sharp, clever stuff from Wales who have repeatedly recovered possession whenever Turkey are on the ball. They’ve been electric to watch and deserve a goal for this start.

Wales 0-0 Turkey

20:12 , Mike Jones

24 mins: Harry Wilson is clipped by Kaan Ayhan but play goes on until Ben Davies commits a foul high up the pitch and gives away a free kick.

Wales’ pressing has been great but can they keep this level of pressure up for the full 90 minutes? Time will tell.

Wales 0-0 Turkey

20:14 , Mike Jones

27 mins: Oh that’s mean. Kenan Yildiz leaps towards a bouncing ball and flies straight into Connor Roberts leading with his elbow. The Welsh defender goes down and the referee comes across pulling out the yellow card.

There didn’t seem to be too much contact but the Turkey midfielder goes in the book.

Wales 0-0 Turkey

20:17 , Mike Jones

30 mins: Turkey exert a bit of pressure on Wales and Harry Wilson shuts it down with a heavy lunging tackle. He goes in the book too and the referee is starting to issue the cards a bit more regularly.

Brennan Johnson then joins his teammate after bungling Kenan Yildiz to the ground as well. There’s a bit of needle in this match now.

Wales 0-0 Turkey

20:19 , Mike Jones

33 mins: Baris Yilmaz goes down inside the Welsh box after a tackle from Joe Rodon and wants a penalty that doesn’t come. He then squares up to Ethan Ampadu and throws a bit of a hissy fit.

The referee has none of it and pulls out a yellow card. The Turkey forward is stewing here.

Wales 0-0 Turkey

20:24 , Mike Jones

36 mins: The Turkish players haven’t really created anything and as a result they’re getting very frustrated with the way the game is developing.

Wales will want to assert a bit more control.

DISALLOWED! Wales 0-0 Turkey

20:25 , Mike Jones

37 mins: It was almost the moment for Sorba Thomas.

Aaron Ramsey receives the ball from Harry Wilson and flicks a pass over the top as Thomas makes a run inside from the wing. He collects the ball and lobs the goalkeeper but the offside flag is raised immediately!

Half-time! Wales 0-0 Turkey

Coming up tomorrow: Brawls, boos and ‘plastic Paddys’: how the English and Irish football teams became eternally entwined

For some around the Irish squad, it’s still strange to be preparing for a match against Lee Carsley’s England. Ireland made a strong push for the admired coach, since he has 40 caps for the country. A solid Ireland midfielder is now the most important figure in English football culture, and will have a tricolour by his name if he takes England to the World Cup.

Carsley was born in Birmingham but qualified for Ireland through his Cork grandmother, and spoke last week of naturally feeling both nationalities. The same applies to many for Saturday’s game in Dublin, most notably Declan Rice and Jack Grealish, who make up at least nine England regulars over the last half-decade that could have also represented Ireland. It is almost an inevitable inversion of the fixture’s history, when it was Ireland that most benefited from the country’s diaspora to Britain.

How the English and Irish football teams became eternally entwined

Second half! Wales 0-0 Turkey

20:51 , Mike Jones

Turkey get the ball rolling for the second half in Cardiff. The first half was very positive and if Craig Bellamy’s men can replicate that in the next 45 minutes the fans will all go home pleased regardless of the result.

Wales 0-0 Turkey

20:53 , Mike Jones

48 mins: Oh here we go.

Sorba Thomas receives the ball and drives through the middle. He cuts back onto his right foot and shoots from range only for the ball to bobble wide of the left hand post.

Decent effort.

Wales 0-0 Turkey

20:56 , Mike Jones

51 mins: Harry Wilson threads a pass into the box and almost sneaks Brennan Johnson in behind from the right wing. The ball is intercepted and cleared by the visitors.

Wales have started this second half in much the same way they ended the first.

Wales 0-0 Turkey

63 mins: Free kick to Wales in a dangerous area. Harry Wilson and Neco Williams stand over the set piece. It’s Wilson who flicks the ball into the middle where Aaron Ramsey meets the ball and heads it high and wide.

Wales are getting closer to scoring.

RED CARD! Wales 0-0 Turkey

21:09 , Mike Jones

64 mins: Wow! Baris Yilmaz has been sent off for a tackle on Neco Williams. It’s a second yellow card offence for the Turkey forward which results in a red card.

Turkey are down to 10-men!

Wales 0-0 Turkey

21:11 , Mike Jones

66 mins: Hakan Calhanoglu is brought on to the pitch to replace Orkun Kokcu following the red card. Turkey will have to adapt now and the Welsh fans are loving this.

They’re in full swing, singing and cheering. Can their players take advantage?

Wales 0-0 Turkey

21:17 , Mike Jones

69 mins: The rain is hammering down in Cardiff now but Craig Bellamy doesn’t seem affected at all. He’s busy getting a couple of suubstitutions ready to ignite a spark into Wales’ play.

Wales 0-0 Turkey

21:18 , Mike Jones

72 mins: Aaron Ramsey and Sorba Thomas are taken off by Craig Bellamy with Kieffer Moore and Lewis Koumas introduced for the final 20 minutes or so.

21:20 , Mike Jones

75 mins: Koumas is into the action straight away with a darting run down the left wing. He attempts a couple of step overs but loses possession on the edge of the box trying to cut inside.

Energetic start from the teenager.

Wales 0-0 Turkey

21:23 , Mike Jones

78 mins: Kieffer Moore stays down after Caglar Soyuncu lands on him when going in for the tackle. Moore receives a kick to the face and needs a bit of treatment before this game can resume.

Wales 0-0 Turkey

21:27 , Mike Jones

81 mins: Moore is back on his feet and the game is back underway. Ben Davies nicks the ball in the middle of the pitch and tries to bomb forward but doesn’t get very far.

Wales work it over to the right wing then play it back inside and look to keep hold of possession.

Wales 0-0 Turkey

21:30 , Mike Jones

84 mins: Nearly! A floated pass comes into the box and gets headed down by Kieffer Moore. He picks out Harry Wilson who’s first time effort sails over the top.

Moore was offside anyway so it wouldn’t have counted.

Wales 0-0 Turkey

21:35 , Mike Jones

87 mins: Wales have found it tough since Turkey went down to 10 men. They substitutes have been decent but there hasn’t been as penetrating as threat since the likes of Ramsey and Thomas went off.

Time is running out for Craig Bellamy’s men. A goal now would surely see them win this game.

Wales 0-0 Turkey

21:36 , Mike Jones

90 mins: Ollie Cooper has been brought on by the Wales boss with Jordan James taken off for the final few minutes.

Oh, there’s eight minutes of added time to play yet!

Wales 0-0 Turkey

21:40 , Mike Jones

90+4 mins: The game is heading quickly towards its conclusion with neither side looking likely to break this deadlock. Four minutes or so to play in Cardiff.

Will there be a winning goal?

Full-time! Wales 0-0 Turkey

21:44 , Mike Jones

90+8 mins: There goes the full-time whistle. It’s not the result that Craig Bellamy would have dreamed about in his first match in charge but his players put in a wonderful performance and controlled the game.

They were the team pushing for a winner at the end of the match and they’ll take heart from a positive and aggressive display at home.

FT Wales 0-0 Turkey

21:50 , Mike Jones

Craig Bellamy’s first match in charge of the Welsh national team was an exciting and promising affair that displayed how he wants them to play going forward. The Dragons hosted Turkey at the Cardiff City Stadium and drew 0-0 in a positive performance that had flair and style.

From the get-go Wales were the more aggressive team. They took charge of the ball and utilised the pace of forwards Brennan Johnson and Sorba Thomas who set up on either wing. In the middle Aaron Ramsey and Harry Wilson juggled playmaking duties admirably as Wales created the better chances over the first 45 minutes.

Ramsey nodded a chance over the top and Joe Rodon failed to convert from close range. The best chance fell to Thomas who broke through the lines and perfectly lobbed the goalkeeper only to be ruled offside.

In the second half there was hope of a famous win after Baris Yilmaz collected a second yellow card and Turkey went down to 10 men. Bellamy made substitutions to try and keep the energy levels high, but Wales couldn’t break the deadlock, and the match finished goalless.

Not the result the Welsh fans wanted but they were encouraged by the performance. Bellamy has Wales playing exciting football.

FT Wales 0-0 Turkey

21:56 , Mike Jones

Luton Town defender Tom Lockyer speaking on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra: “The first half Wales were outstanding, that was the best Welsh performance I’ve seen in a long time.

“Obviously, football is about scoring when you’re on top and Wales didn’t do that, so that’s frustrating. However, the performance was spot on, Craig Bellamy will be pleased with what he’s seen.”

FT Wales 0-0 Turkey

22:02 , Mike Jones

The one area were Craig Bellamy will certainly want to improve is getting his team to find the target. Wales had 15 shots tonight but only one of them hit the target and that was in the first half.

Craig Bellamy brings excitement back to Wales as new era gets off to promising start

22:13 , Mike Jones

Wales began the Craig Bellamy era with a 0-0 Nations League draw against 10-man Turkey in Cardiff.

New boss Bellamy did not get the victory he would have craved at kick-off but it was a positive performance from Wales against opponents who reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2024 this summer.

Wales‘ task was made slightly easier by the 62nd-minute dismissal of Baris Alper Yilmaz, banished for treading on Neco Williams’ foot after unnecessarily confronting Joe Rodon before the break to merit a first yellow card.
