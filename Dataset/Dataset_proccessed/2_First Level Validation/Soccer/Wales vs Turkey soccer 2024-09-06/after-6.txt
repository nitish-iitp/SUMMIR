Wales player ratings vs Turkiye: ‘Solid’ 8/10s in Craig Bellamy’s first game
 Ben Thomas  Sep 6, 2024 0

Craig Bellamy began his Wales managerial career with a goalless 0-0 draw against Turkiye at The Cardiff City Stadium.

Türkiye forward Baris Alper Yilmaz was shown a second yellow card in the 63rd minute following a late challenge on Neco Williams. The Galatasaray man had been shown a card in the first half for an off-the-ball altercation.

Despite their dominance and man advantage, Wales were unable to find a winning goal as they began their Nations League campaign with a point. Here is a look at each player following the result.

Wales player ratings v Turkiye
Danny Ward – 6

It was a quiet night for Ward as he didn’t have any major moments to deal with in goal. His distribution overall was fine with some wayward passes including one early in the second-half that caused some panic but he was bailed out by his defence. He maintained his spot in net despite the addition of new man Karl Darlow, but there is still the glaring issue in the position of a lack of club football in the senior ranks.

Connor Roberts – 7

Roberts was a workhorse down the right-hand side as he usually is. He did give away some cheap fouls that led to unnecessary pressure at points but was never punished. He will play an important role in this new look Wales system with his relentless energy.

Joe Rodon – 8

A very good performance from the Leeds United man. He won everything that came near him and looked calm and composed playing out of defence. Rodon alongside his defensive pairing limited the visitors to any real efforts at goal.

Ben Davies – 8

Davies was solid at the back playing up against Real Madrid talent Arda Güler keeping him quiet through the game. He provided a crucial block following poor pass from Ward and made some key interceptions to deny the away side opportunities.

Neco Williams – 7

Williams was brilliant again offensively causing issues and drifting into midfield. His work-rate led to the sending off of Alper Yilmaz that gave Wales a big advantage heading into the final 25 minutes but they were unable to take advantage.

Ethan Ampadu – 7

Another strong performance from Ampadu in midfield who has now surpassed the 50 cap mark at the age of just 23 years old. Bellamy described him as a future captain of the national side and it’s easy to see why with the footballing brain he possesses. He looked to drop deeper as the link between defence and attack.

Jordan James – 5

It wasn’t the best game from James in a Wales shirt. He gave away possession on a few occasions with some wayward passes but did work hard along with the rest of the team. He looks to take up a more advanced role compared to Ampadu but didn’t provide much in terms of attacking threat.

Aaron Ramsey – 6

A new role for the Captain as he looked to lead the line in a false striker role. He linked up well going forward and had a few chances early on but was unable to find the killer touch. With the way Bellamy is looking to play I would be surprised to see Ramsey completing many full games with the amount of running required but he worked endlessly whilst on the field before being replaced.

Harry Wilson – 6

Wilson was risky with his passes but it’s the risk you’re willing to let him take with the technical quality he possesses as he can produce moments of magic. He couldn’t quite find it tonight but there is no doubt he’ll have many of those moments under Bellamy.

Brennan Johnson – 6

Johnson worked hard down the right-hand side causing issues for the opposition defence going forward and contributed defensively. He was wasteful with crossing opportunities at times, especially with the visitors down a man and there is a feeling that there is still a lot more to see from him in a Wales shirt, with the hopes that over time Bellamy can bring it out of him.

Sorba Thomas – 8

Thomas worked hard defensively and was causing issues all night with his pace down the left-hand side. He had the ball in the net with a very composed finish but was unlucky to find himself marginally offside. There is potential for him to have a big impact during Bellamy’s tenure.

Kieffer Moore – 4

The Sheffield United man replaced Ramsey looking to add a more physical and aerial presence in the box. He failed to offer much during his time on the field.

Lewis Koumas – 4

A first opportunity for Koumas to show his qualities following a strong start to the season with Stoke City. He had a handful of opportunities to run at the Türkiye defence but was unable to find the moment of magic the game needed. With plenty of time on his side there will be many of those moments over the coming years.

Ollie Cooper – 4

A late substitution in the game and didn’t have much of an opportunity to make an impact.
