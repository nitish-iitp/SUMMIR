Andre Onana has once again been left on the bench for Cameroon’s Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON 2024) last 16 game against Nigeria.

The Indomitable Lions are targeting revenge against their West African neighbours, having lost to the Super Eagles at this same stage in 2019.

While Rigobert Song has made some bold decisions in his line-up selection, the former centre-back has also kept faith with the players who produced the goods during the group phase.

Similar to the Super Eagles’ formation, Cameroon are also lining up in a 3-4-3 and will rely heavily on their full-backs.

Onana benched again, Aboubakar not fit to start vs Nigeria

The biggest story regarding the team news is Song’s decision to keep Manchester United goalkeeper Onana on the bench. In his stead, Fabrice Ondoa keeps his position as the starting goalkeeper for the game against Nigeria.

In defence, Jean-Charles Castelletto, Christopher Wooh and Oumar Gonzalez form a back-three, with Nouhou Tolo and Nicolas Moumi Ngamaleu tasked with operating as wing-backs.

Olivier Ntcham and Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa have also been given the nod in midfield, and will do battle against Nigeria’s Alex Iwobi and Frank Onyeka for supremacy in the middle of the park.

Despite returning to training last week, captain Vincent Aboubakar is only fit for a place on the bench, with Georges-Kevin N’Koudou, Karl Toko Ekambi and Frank Magri leading the attack.
