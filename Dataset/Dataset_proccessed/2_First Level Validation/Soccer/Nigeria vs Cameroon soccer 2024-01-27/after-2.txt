More from manager Jose Peseiro's remarks to the media following Nigeria's win: "Our football sometimes is incredible. We play well. Today we created less but we scored two goals."

Asked whether Nigeria's level might drop against a smaller side like Angola after appearing to play better against bigger nations, he responded: “See, I want to just win every game. I don’t know what Nigerians think about names in football but if we are to defeat Angola, we must play like today."

Speaking after Nigeria's win, manager Jose Peseiro issued an update on the status of Stanley Nwabali after the goalkeeper suffered an injury late in the second half: “We have to wait 24 or 48 hours to know what is wrong with him but I hope he will available for the next game."

Nigeria's opponents Angola will be without their starting goalkeeper in the quarter-final after Neblu was shown a straight red card against Namibia earlier today for handling the ball outside of the penalty area.

Ekambi: We were in control until mistake

(Getty Images)

Karl Toko Ekambi also pointed to mistakes when discussing Cameroon's loss: "(Nigeria) were a solid team. We made a mistake that cost us dearly because I think we were well into the game. We had the ball, we did some good things and we managed to get out well. We weren't dangerous, but we were in control. We made a mistake that cost us that first goal and in a knockout match, at 1-0, we know it's complicated.

"We're disappointed, we'll move on."

Aboubakar: 'Little mistakes cost us the match'

Vincent Aboubakar also spoke to the media after Cameroon's loss: "The feeling can only be negative. Today we found an even tougher opponent. As you know, Nigeria are our thorn in our side. Cameroon dominated possession, but little mistakes cost us the match. That's soccer and there's nothing we can do about it. We'll just have to pick ourselves up and prepare for the next matches.

"We can have regrets. Now we'll be spectators at the AFCON."

Song: 'We've still got a lot to learn'

(Getty Images)

Cameroon manager Rigobert Song spoke to the media after his country's elimination from the tournament: “We took on a young team into competition today. Some of the players are new to the game. We were the ones who gave our opponents the chance to cause us problems. Today, as I've said in the past, we're rebuilding. We're going to grow, that's soccer. The AFCON is a competition that's played out on all levels: technical, tactical, but also mental. With our youth today, we've shown that we've still got a lot to learn."

These were easily the most significant goals he has scored for his country, as the previous two came against minnows São Tomé and Príncipe, who currently ranked 191st out of 210 countries by FIFA.
