Spain are coming with the mission to secure a record-breaking fourth EURO triumph. How good Luis de la Fuente's side have prepared this time, was visible in their mauling of Andorra and Northern Ireland in the warm-up matches, winning by 5-0 and 5-1 score margins, respectively.

On the other hand, there is Croatia, a powerful force risinig in the football world. Zlatko Dalić's led by Luka Modric are appearing in EURO for the fifth time. They won their friendlies against Portugal 2-1 last week.

For Croatia defeating the Spaniards might prove to be a daunting task, given the disappointing results from their last two encounters, which ended in a 5-3 loss in 2020 and a 0-0 draw in 2023. The last time Croatia defeated Spain was in November, 2018 at the UEFA Nations League.

Here's all the details about the Spain Vs Croatia, UEFA European Championship 2024 Group B matchday 1 Live Streaming:
