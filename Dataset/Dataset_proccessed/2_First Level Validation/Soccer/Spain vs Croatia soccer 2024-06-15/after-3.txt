Luis de la Fuente: 'We are very happy'

Spain boss Luis de la Fuente said on La 1 TV after the match: “We are very happy, but very prudent, we know how football is. This is a good start, with good feelings, our football, our competitiveness. But this has just started, there is a long way to go. So happy but calm and prudent.

“It was a very complete game, in defence and attack, brilliant in our high pressing against one of the best technical teams in the world.

“I am happy with the attitude, how we read the game, doing what was needed, and obviously for the result. But we can still get a lot better, we have to be demanding, enjoy this result, but prepare for the next game.

“Italy will be very difficult, another of the best teams in Europe, we have to be at the same level as today, at least, to have a chance to win. We know how difficult it is to win. We want to take another big step forward, and be examples for the people in our country.”

Looking back: Hungary 1 Switzerland 3 – The Briefing

Getty Images

Earlier today, Switzerland got their Euro 2024 off to a winning start thanks to a hugely impressive first-half performance from Murat Yakin’s team — and a welcome late return from Breel Embolo.

Having gone 2-0 down in the first half, Hungary battled back after the break and halved the deficit through a Barnabas Varga header.

There were some nervy moments for the Swiss until Embolo punished Willi Orban for a misplaced header and lifted in a third on his first international appearance since the 2022 World Cup.

Below, The Athletic’s Jacob Whitehead and Nick Miller assess the key talking points…

Speaking of Lamine Yamal...

Spain forward Lamine Yamal today became the youngest player in European Championship history, after starting for Spain against Croatia aged 16 years and 338 days old in his eighth appearance for his country.

The Barcelona winger broke the previous record set by Brighton and Hove Albion’s Kacper Kozłowski, who played for Poland at Euro 2020 aged 17 years and 246 days.

Yamal, who became the youngest ever player to start a Champions League game at the start of 2023-24, is also already the youngest goalscorer in the history of La Liga, Copa del Rey and the Spanish Super Cup.

What a prospect.

Record-breaker Carvajal

Real Madrid's Dani Carvajal, who scored the third goal today, is the first defender ever to score in a European Cup/Champions League final and a European Championship game in the same year.

Remember, he netted for Real Madrid against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley in the Champions League final on June 1, too.

Fabian Ruiz: 'I'm so happy to have scored for my country'

Man-of-the-match Fabian Ruiz, speaking to Spanish TV after the match, said: “Happy for the great game we all played. We knew it would be very difficult, and we suffered until the end, but happy to have got the win against a tough team with great players.

“(Morata) always tells me to look for him with those balls in behind, I am used to his runs. I saw the space and his control and finish was great.

“(For the second goal) Pedri gave me a great pass, when I controlled it Luka covered me, and when I tried to shoot with my right, Brozovic came so I had to go left. I saw a gap between the legs and luckily it went in. So happy to have scored at a Euros, for my country Spain.”

No early Golden Boot contender

There have been 13 goals in the three Euro 2024 games so far. Going along at a decent lick.

But no one has scored more than once, meaning we're in a 12-way tie for the Golden Boot as things stand.

Not counting Antonio Rudiger's own goal for Germany against Scotland last night, of course.

(Does that put him on minus one? Probably not).

Alvaro Morata: 'I'll be ready' for the next game, despite knock

Getty Images

Spain captain Alvaro Morata, speaking to Spanish TV Station La 1 after the match, insisted the knock he picked up was not anything serious.

He said: “It was nothing, just a heavy bang, I knew it was 'loading' the rest of the leg. So it was better to come off, for another teammate to enter, who was better than me. I’ll be ready (for the next game).

“I felt good, the team were good, really motivated, we pressed a very good team very well. We have to go for the games from the start, as we did today, and now to think of the next game.”

Discussing how his first shot was saved, but his second found the net, he added: “With the first shot I wanted to surprise the keeper as the pitch was a bit dry.

“For the second chance, I knew the wingers would keep wide and open up the middle of the pitch. Fabian saw the space and he is so good. Then he scored a great goal himself.”

Spain's run of dominating possession... has ended!

Spain’s run of 136 competitive games with more possession than their rival, going back 16 years to Euro 2008 final, is over.

Croatia with 53% of the ball today - and Spain with the 3-0 win.

I reckon winning 3-0 against a very good team is some consolation, though, Dermot!

Fabian Ruiz named Man of the Match

Fabian Ruiz named UEFA's official man of the match - deserved for his impact when the game was in the balance, fantastic assist for the opener, and super finish for the 2-0 goal which really put Spain in control.

Croatia were never at the races from then.

UEFA's Technical Observer Panel praised the Paris midfielder's "really good game", adding he was "always supporting the build-up, assisted Morata for the opener and scored an amazing goal himself".

Big Basque influence for Spain

Four of the five Real Sociedad players in the Spain squad are on the pitch now.

While Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams and Unai Simon also played.

Coach Luis de la Fuente is a former Athletic Bilbao defender too. Big Basque influence within this Spanish set-up.
