Gli Azzurri pulled a massive win over Les Bleus in the last match.

Israel suffered a disappointing loss in their first match of the UEFA Nations League as Belgium pulled a routine win over them. They lost the game by a 3-1 score-line despite giving a tough fight in the first half which ended in a 1-1 draw. 

However, Ran Ben Shimon’s side got outclassed in the second half as Belgium registered a comfortable win. Israel will feel unlucky after being drawn with the likes of Belgium, France and Italy in League A Group 2. Next up for them is another tough outing against a side who dispatched France in their last match. 

Meanwhile, Italy pulled a surprise in their opening match of the Nations League after registering an impressive 3-1 win over France. Luciano Spalletti will be proud of his team. They bounced back in the match after conceding a goal in the first minute. 

Gli Azzurri displayed a wonderful attacking display against Les Bleus and deservedly won the match. The return of Sandro Tanoli from suspension has further improved the team with the midfielder delivering an eye-catching display in the middle of the park.

⁠Israel (in all competitions): W-L-L-W-L

Players to Watch
Manor Solomon (Israel)

Manor Solomon remains Israel’s big hope for scoring goals in this match. He is the country’s biggest star. Solomon made a name for himself at Shakhtar Donetsk which earned him a big move to Tottenham Hotspur.

Solomon is a versatile player who can operate in several positions up front with him being able to score from both feet as he is equally adept. He has already made 38 appearances for the national team scoring seven goals in the process. 

Sandro Tonali (Italy) 

Sandro Tonali delivered a fantastic performance for the team in the last Nations League game on his return from suspension. He was a constant rock in the midfield for his side, limiting the host with his timely interceptions and tackles.

Tonali also made sure he helped the team in the attacking phase after delivering a magical assist against France. Luciano Spalletti was a happy man after the match as he missed Tonali’s presence in the midfield during the Euros.
