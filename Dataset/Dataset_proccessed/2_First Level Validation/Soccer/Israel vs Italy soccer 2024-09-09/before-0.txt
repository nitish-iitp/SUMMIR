Preview: Israel vs. Italy - prediction, team news, lineups

Having kicked off their latest UEFA Nations League campaign with a stunning victory in Paris, Italy meet Israel in their second Group 2 fixture on Monday.

The Azzurri head to Hungary - where the game will be played for security reasons - with three points already in the bag; meanwhile, their opponents were beaten 3-1 by Belgium.

After setting a new record for their fastest-ever goal conceded, it seemed Italy were set to continue their struggles on Friday evening, following a dismal defence of their European title.

When Bradley Barcola stole the ball from Giovanni Di Lorenzo and fired past Azzurri captain Gianluigi Donnarumma after just 13 seconds, gloom could have descended on Luciano Spalletti's side; instead, they launched a stirring fightback.

First, Federico Dimarco combined with the recalled Sandro Tonali to score a sublime equaliser, then Davide Frattesi put them in front before substitute Giacomo Raspadori wrapped up the points on 74 minutes.

Beating France 3-1 at Parc des Princes brought Italy's first win in Paris for 70 years, and also gave credence to Spalletti's talk of a fresh start.

At Euro 2024, the Azzurri never really found their rhythm and ultimately limped out in the last 16, so some new blood has been brought in for their latest quest to claim a first Nations League title.

Spalletti's predecessor, Euro 2020-winner Roberto Mancini, departed after leading his country to the 2023 finals, and then to a third place finish in the four-team tournament.

In order to go at least one better this time around, Italy must claim a top-two placing in League A Group 2, which would see them qualify for the new quarter-final stage.

While the Italians are targeting a place in the finals, Israel may have a tough time avoiding relegation, as fourth-placed teams are automatically demoted and finishing third results in a playoff.

Drawn into a particularly difficult group, they were promoted from League B in 2022, having topped a group featuring Iceland, Albania and - initially - Russia.

However, the calibre of opponents has stepped up a notch this season, and despite pulling themselves level against Belgium on Friday evening, Ran Ben Shimon's side were eventually beaten 3-1 by a Kevin De Bruyne-inspired side in the Hungarian city of Debrecen.

The Sky Blue and Whites had previously missed out on Euro 2024 due to defeat in the playoffs, where they were beaten 4-1 by Iceland, and it has been more than 50 years since they last made a major tournament appearance.

With conflict in the Middle East making any prospect of hosting games on home turf all but impossible, Israel remain in exile: once again, they must play in Hungary on Monday evening.

Setting out his new tactical framework for the months ahead, against France, Luciano Spalletti made eight changes to the Italy XI that lost to Switzerland at Euro 2024 and switched to a three-man defence.

One member of that trio, Arsenal's Riccardo Calafiori, sustained a freak injury on Friday night, as Ousmane Dembele improbably landed on his leg. It is expected that the ex-Bologna defender will soon recover, though.

The Azzurri will definitely be without Gianluca Scamacca (ACL) and Nicolo Barella (sinus surgery), but international new boys Marco Brescianini and Caleb Okoli are both available, while Destiny Udogie, Moise Kean and Sandro Tonali have all returned to the squad.

After scoring the third goal in Paris, Giacomo Raspadori could force his way into the lineup, partnering either Kean or Mateo Retegui up front in a 3-5-2 formation.

Meanwhile, Israel were without captain Eli Dasa through injury last week, so Leeds United loanee Manor Solomon captained his nation for the first time.

Only four of their starters had reached double figures for senior appearances, and a similarly inexperienced side is likely to line up at Budapest's Bozsik Arena on Monday.

Against Belgium, Anan Khalaili featured up front, but Maccabi Haifa striker Dean David is an alternative option alongside Solomon and rising star Oscar Gloukh.


Israel possible starting lineup:
Gerafi; Shlomo, Nachmias, Gandelman; Jehezkel, Lavi, Peretz, Gropper; Solomon, Gloukh; Khalaili

Italy possible starting lineup:
Donnarumma; Di Lorenzo, Buongiorno, Bastoni; Bellanova, Ricci, Tonali, Frattesi, Dimarco; Raspadori, Retegui



We say: Israel 0-2 Italy

Buoyed by their feats in France, new-look Italy should take care of business against an Israel side short of international nous and experience.

Moving onto six points from a possible six would put the Azzurri in a strong position ahead of next month's clash with Belgium in Rome.
