UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE: REPUBLIC OF IRELAND BEATEN BY IN-FORM GREECE, ERLING HAALAND’S NORWAY THRASHED IN AUSTRIA
BYBEN SOUTHBY

UPDATED 13/10/2024 AT 22:06 GMT

The Republic of Ireland suffered a third UEFA Nations League defeat against Greece as Ivan Jovanovic's side maintained their 100% record in the competition. Anastasios Bakasetas and Petros Mantalos scored on another emotional night for Greece, who stay above England in Group B2. Elsewhere, Erling Haaland could not score in a third-successive match for Norway, who were heavily beaten by Austria.

The Republic of Ireland fell to their third UEFA Nations League defeat on Sunday after they were beaten 2-0 by Greece at the Georgios Karaiskaki Stadium.
Three days after claiming their first win of the campaign against Finland, Anastasios Bakasetas and Petros Mantalos scored in a second successive victory for Ivan Jovanovic’s side.

SCOTLAND TO FACE GREECE IN RELEGATION PLAY-OFF, REPUBLIC OF IRELAND DRAW BULGARIA

22/11/2024 AT 12:14

The Republic of Ireland stay in third place - a relegation qualification spot - with two games left to play, while England occupy the promotion qualification spot in second.
Brighton & Hove Albion’s Evan Fergurson squandered a golden opportunity in the early stages for Ireland, but it was Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher who helped the visitors survive a chaotic first half.
He was called into action on numerous occasions in the first half as the match reached the break with the score goalless, but his side could not hold on for much longer.
Three minutes into the second half, Greece broke the deadlock through Bakasetas, who combined with Christos Tzolis before his low effort deflected beyond Kelleher.
Despite his inspired first-half performance, Kelleher made a big error while trying to pass out from the back in the dying moments of the game, gifting Greece their second of the match as Mantalos made sure of the three points.
The Republic of Ireland face Finland in Dublin next before making the short trip to Wembley Stadium for a rematch against England.

Manchester City forward Erling Haaland has scored 15 goals for club and country so far this season, but he could not help his nation avoid a humbling defeat to Austria on Sunday.
Haaland has taken over captain duties for Norway in Martin Odegaard’s absence and bagged a brace in the 3-0 victory over Slovenia on Thursday.
But he came up short on Sunday, as Marko Arnautovic (two), Philipp Lienhart, Stefan Posch and Michael Gregoritsch handed Ralf Rangnick’s side a thumping 5-1 win.
Norway keep their place at the top of Group B3, but there are now three teams on seven points, including Austria and Slovenia, who beat winless Kazakhstan 1-0.
