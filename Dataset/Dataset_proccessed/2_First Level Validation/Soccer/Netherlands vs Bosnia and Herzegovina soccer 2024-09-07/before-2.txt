Preview: Netherlands vs. Bosnia-Herzegovina - prediction, team news, lineups

Ultimately aiming to win the UEFA Nations League and end their long wait for a trophy, the Netherlands kick off their latest campaign on Saturday, as they host Bosnia-Herzegovina in Eindhoven.

League A Group 3 also features Germany and Hungary, so neither side can afford to fall behind - particularly as finishing third or fourth could result in relegation.

After making their way through the 'weaker' half of the draw at this summer's Euro 2024 finals - having only emerged from Group D in third place - the Netherlands crushed Romania in the last 16 and then saw off Turkey to set up a semi-final against England.

However, they left Germany - where they were crowned European champions 36 years earlier - with a bitter taste in their mouths, as a late Ollie Watkins goal followed the Three Lions' controversial equaliser and sent them crashing out.

The Oranje also met England on the last occasion they came close to claiming some silverware, winning 3-1 after extra time in the inaugural Nations League semi-finals in 2019 - and current coach Ronald Koeman was in the dugout that time too.

However, a luckless Dutch side were ultimately runners-up, losing 1-0 to Portugal in the decider, and they finished fourth when hosting the finals tournament last time around.

To get that far, they had topped a relatively kind group containing Belgium, Poland and Wales, but this season even a top-two finish would be sufficient to secure a place in the Nations League's new quarter-final stage.

With Virgil van Dijk deciding to stay on as captain, Koeman's squad will have the same skipper for this month's games against Bosnia and old foes Germany, the latter of which will be played next Tuesday.

Bosnia-Herzegovina last met this week's hosts in the Nations League's pandemic-delayed second edition, suffering a 3-1 away defeat before holding out for a goalless home draw in late 2020.

They reconvene with the Oranje this season, having beaten Finland, Montenegro and Romania to first place in League B last time around, which saw them celebrate promotion to Europe's top tier.

However, the Dragons could not build on that momentum during Euro 2024 qualifying, finishing fifth in a six-team section, with two of their three wins coming against minnows Liechtenstein.

Though their Nations League performance still earned Bosnia a place in the playoffs, they were beaten 2-1 in a semi-final clash with Ukraine, leading to the departure of head coach Savo Milosevic.

Sergej Barbarez has since taken the reins and was on the touchline for June friendly defeats to Italy and England; now, he leads his team out against opponents of similar stature on Saturday.

As finishing third in Group 3 would result in a relegation playoff, and fourth means automatic demotion, Barbarez may hope to pick up a point in Eindhoven, before heading to Hungary next week.

Ronald Koeman has overhauled his squad since the Netherlands exited Euro 2024, as midfielders Marten de Roon and Georginio Wijnaldum have been told they will not be considered for selection, Daley Blind announced his international retirement, and two key attackers were not called up.

In addition to criticising Steven Bergwijn's recent switch to the Saudi Pro League, star striker Memphis Depay is still without a club and Koeman has also left the 46-goal forward out.

As a result, Brian Brobbey is now favourite to start up front, although Joshua Zirkzee and Wout Weghorst are also contenders - or another Premier League player, Liverpool's Cody Gakpo, could fill in as a false nine.

Micky van de Ven and Joey Veerman have both pulled out with injuries, so Jan Paul van Hecke and Justin Kluivert were called up as replacements.

Meanwhile, Bosnia can recall all-time top scorer Edin Dzeko (65 international goals), after the veteran striker missed their last match through injury.

Ajax midfielder Benjamin Tahirovic could start in midfield, alongside Rade Krunic, formerly of AC Milan but now at Red Star Belgrade.

Sead Kolasinac of Atalanta BC is the visitors' most experienced defender, and he may feature in a back five on Saturday evening.


Netherlands possible starting lineup:
Verbruggen; Dumfries, De Ligt, Van Dijk, Ake; Schouten, Gravenberch; Malen, Simons, Gakpo; Brobbey

Bosnia-Herzegovina possible starting lineup:
Piric; Radeljic, Ahmedhodzic, Katic, Bicakcic, Kolasinac; Gigovic, Krunic, Tahirovic, Hajradinovic; Dzeko



We say: Netherlands 3-0 Bosnia-Herzegovina

While the Netherlands came so close to reaching July's European Championship final, Bosnia came up short in the Euro 2024 playoffs amid a miserable run of results.

Therefore, the Oranje should sweep past their opening Group 3 opponents on home turf, setting them up nicely for next week's heavyweight contest with Germany.
