How Austria could line up against Poland

Austria coach Ralf Rangnick may be wary of making many alterations to his Austria XI for Friday's Euro 2024 fixture against Poland.

Rangnick watched his side lose a seven-match unbeaten streak on Monday as they succumbed to a 1-0 defeat to France in their Group D opener.

However, there were plenty of positives to take from the performance with Austria only losing out to an own goal scored by Max Wober.

Marko Arnautovic was introduced for the final half-hour against Les Bleus and the 35-year-old will hope to earn a recall ahead of Michael Gregoritsch.

Patrick Wimmer came on at the same time as the veteran, offering a more direct threat in the final than some of his other teammates.

While the Wolfsburg winger is in contention for a start, Rangnick may err on the side of caution from kickoff and keep Florian Grillitsch in his engine room.

That would see Marcel Sabitzer remain out on the left, but it is not beyond the realms of possibility that he will return to a central role.

Despite his own goal against France, Wober will hope to keep his spot in the middle of the backline.

Austria possible starting lineup:
Pentz; Posch, Danso, Wober, Mwene; Seiwald, Grillitsch; Laimer, Baumgartner, Sabitzer; Arnautovic
