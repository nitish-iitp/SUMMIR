EURO 2024
POLAND 1-3 AUSTRIA: MARKO ARNAUTOVIC ON TARGET AS RALF RANGNICK'S SIDE BOOST EURO 2024 KNOCKOUT CHANCES, POLES EXIT
BYPAUL HASSALL

UPDATED 21/06/2024 AT 21:51 GMT

Austria were praised following their first Euro 2024 group game, even though that ended in defeat to France. But this time their efforts went rewarded as they carved out a clinical 3-1 victory over Poland, who became the first team to exit this Euros. Robert Lewandowski came on in the second half for the Poles, but it was to no avail as Ralf Rangnick's outfit secured the points.

Christoph Baumgartner and Marko Arnautovic struck in the second half as Austria boosted their hopes of reaching the knockout stages of Euro 2024 with a 3-1 victory over Poland in Berlin.
In a Group D clash billed by both coaches as win or bust, Ralf Rangnick’s Austria roared out of the traps and took a ninth-minute lead courtesy of Gernot Trauner’s fine header from a Phillipp Mwene cross.

There was a relentless pace throughout an end-to-end contest with Poland hoping the introduction of talismanic forward Robert Lewandowski from the bench would help swing it their way in the second half.
However, it was Austria who took charge with Baumgartner brilliantly finishing off a slick move just past the hour, before Arnautovic made sure of the points with a penalty 12 minutes from time.
The result sees Austria move level on points with leaders France and Netherlands.
Poland are rock bottom and exit the tournament as even though a win in their last game would take them level with Austria, they cannot overhaul them given their inferior head-to-head record against Rangnick's side.
Next up, Austria face Netherlands on Tuesday, while Poland meet France as Group D comes to a climax.
TALKING POINT – AUSTRIA LIVE UP TO THE HYPE
Austria had secured some eye-catching results heading into the tournament but an impressive showing against much-fancied France ultimately went unrewarded.
Rangnick’s side needed a big performance here in what he had suggested was already like a knockout tie against Poland, and they delivered with a high-octane showing that Poland struggled to combat.
Indeed, not even the introduction of Lewandowski could help wrestle some initiative Poland's way and their hopes of extending their stay in Germany further now look somewhat forlorn.
In contrast, Austria have now lost just two of their previous 18 internationals and if they do manage to navigate their way out of Group D, few sides would relish the prospect of trying to get a handle on their aggressive press and fearless approach.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - CHRISTOPH BAUMGARTNER (AUSTRIA)
The 24-year-old RB Leipzig midfielder epitomises the style and tactical approach Rangnick has instilled and he capped another classy but high-energy display with his country’s all-important second goal.
