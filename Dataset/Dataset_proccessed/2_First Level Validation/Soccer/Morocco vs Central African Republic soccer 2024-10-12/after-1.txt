 Rabat - Morocco’s national football team will face the Central African Republic today in an African Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualification match, as they aim to solidify their lead in Group B. Moroccan cuisine

The game will kick off this evening at 8:00 pm GMT+1 at the Stade d’Honneur in Oujda.

The match will be broadcast live on Moroccan sports networks, including Arryadia. For those unable to watch on TV, the match will be available via streaming platforms, with possible coverage on BeIN Sports Connect or FuboTV, depending on your region.

The Atlas Lions have shown strong form in the ongoing qualifiers, securing key victories over Gabon and Lesotho. Now, they will look to continue their momentum against the Central African Republic.

Walid Regragui’s squad will enter the match with confidence, having scored 13 goals and conceded only three in their last five matches.

However, the team will be without several key players like Hakim Ziyech, Noussair Mazraoui, and Brahim Diaz due to injuries. In their absence, new talents like Youssef Belammari and Ismael Saibari will have the chance to shine.

Morocco is the clear favorite to win the game, but the Central African Republic will be determined to put up a fight.

Speaking at a pre-match conference on Friday, coach Regrading confirmed the team’s readiness for today’s clash.

Regragui said that all the players called up for the training camp in preparation for the match are ready, including the new additions, such as Youssef Belammari, a player from Raja Athletic Club, as well as Wydad Athletic Club’s Jamal Harkass.
