On Monday evening, Izmir will host a match in the second round of the Nations League, in which Turkey will test Iceland!

Turkey are quarter-finalists of Euro 2024, where they capitulated to the Netherlands in a worthy fight - 1:2. And in the first round of the Nations League, the Moon Stars, although they spent some time in the minority, still held on to an away draw 0:0 with Wales.

Iceland dealt with Montenegro (2:0), thanks to which they took sole charge of the B4 quartet. It should be noted that recently the Vikings came close to getting into the continental forum again, but after a 4:1 thrashing of Israel, they could not withstand the pressure of Ukraine - 1:2.

Both teams are very dependent on the support of their home crowd and in such comfortable conditions they demonstrate good results. In our opinion, Turkey will take full advantage of this circumstance and add three points to their credit.

Turkey to win 1.63
