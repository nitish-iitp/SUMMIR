Turkey host Iceland in the Nations League

Turkey will invite Iceland to the Gürsel Aksel Stadium in the UEFA Nations League on Monday. The hosts secured a draw in their campaign opener last week while Strákarnir okkar began their campaign with a win.

The Crescent-Stars were held to a goalless draw in their away meeting against Wales last week, with both teams registering just one shot on target. Barış Alper Yılmaz was sent off in the 62nd minute and is not available to head coach Vincenzo Montella in this match.

The visitors hosted Montenegro last week and registered a comfortable 2-0 win. Orri Óskarsson scored in the first half and Jón Dagur Þorsteinsson doubled their lead in the second half, thanks to Gylfi Sigurðsson's assist.

Turkey vs Iceland Prediction

The Crescent-Stars registered just one shot in their campaign opener and will look to improve their stats in that regard. They have scored at least two goals in their last five home games in the Nations League and will look to build on that record. They have suffered just one loss in their last five home meetings against the visitors.

Strákarnir okkar registered their first win in the Nations League history last week and will look to continue that momentum here. They also kept a clean sheet for the first time in the competition in that win.

While the Crescent-Stars have a poor recent record against Iceland, they play for the first time at home in 2024 and should be able to leave a good account of themselves. With that in mind, a draw is likely to ensue.

Prediction: Turkey 2-2 Iceland
