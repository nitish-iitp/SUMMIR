Will Turkey Make Their Home Advantage Count Against Iceland?
Turkey’s Offensive Resilience at Home Turkey have proven to be a formidable force when playing on home soil, having scored in 12 of their last 13 matches. Their ability to perform in front of their fans has been a key factor, with seven wins from their last nine home games. Even against tough opposition, Turkey often manage to find the back of the net.
Iceland’s Consistent Goal Threat Iceland have scored in six of their last seven matches, including an impressive 2-0 victory over Montenegro in their Nations League opener. Led by young forward Orri Oskarsson, Iceland have shown they can compete offensively, even when playing away from home, making them a consistent threat in front of goal.
Turkey’s Defensive Vulnerabilities Despite their attacking prowess, Turkey have kept just one clean sheet in their last seven matches, highlighting their defensive frailties. With Iceland also proving dangerous in attack, Turkey will need to improve their organisation at the back if they are to secure a comfortable result.
Best Bet


Both Teams to Score @ 8/11

Reasoning
The best bet for this encounter is backing both teams to score. Turkey’s strong home scoring record, combined with Iceland’s impressive attack and both sides' defensive vulnerabilities, makes a high-scoring match likely.

Turkey and Iceland face off in an enticing UEFA Nations League clash at the Gursel Aksel Stadium in Izmir on Monday. Both teams are aiming to build momentum in Group B4 following contrasting results in their opening games. Turkey, after a frustrating 0-0 draw against Wales, will look to secure their first win in this campaign, while Iceland enter the game with confidence following a commanding 2-0 victory over Montenegro.

Turkey, managed by Vincenzo Montella, will be eager to impress in front of their home fans. Their goalless draw against Wales was marred by Baris Alper Yilmaz’s red card, which saw them reduced to 10 men and struggling to create clear chances. Iceland, on the other hand, have their tails up after goals from Orri Oskarsson and Jon Dagur Thorsteinsson helped them secure a comfortable win against Montenegro, leaving them top of the group heading into this contest.

Both sides boast exciting young talent, and this fixture promises to be a tightly contested affair. Turkey will be looking to leverage their home advantage, but Iceland have shown resilience on the road, making it a fascinating match-up.

The most compelling bet for this encounter is backing both teams to score. Although Turkey were unable to break down Wales in their opener, this game offers a very different dynamic. Iceland’s attacking output, demonstrated in their 2-0 victory over Montenegro, highlights their ability to pose problems going forward. Oskarsson and Thorsteinsson, in particular, have been in impressive form, combining well to carve out chances.

Turkey, despite their recent struggles, have a formidable home record. They have scored in 12 of their last 13 games on Turkish soil, showcasing their attacking potency, especially when backed by a passionate home crowd. Iceland, meanwhile, have found the back of the net in six of their last seven matches. With both teams possessing dangerous attacking options, the chances of goals on both sides appear high.

Turkey’s key players, like Arda Guler and Hakan Calhanoglu, will be central to their offensive efforts. Guler, likely to assume a more advanced role in Yilmaz’s absence, could provide the creativity and firepower Turkey need to find the net. Iceland, buoyed by their strong Nations League start, will look to Oskarsson and Thorsteinsson to continue their goal-scoring form.

Turkey’s defence has been far from watertight recently, managing just one clean sheet in their last seven outings. Iceland, while impressive, also conceded goals in two of their last three away fixtures. Given both sides’ attacking threat and occasional defensive frailties, this game seems destined for goals at either end.

As BettingTips4You.com’s expert, Wolfgang Shotten, summarised: “Both teams are capable of finding the net in this encounter, and with Turkey’s attacking strength at home and Iceland’s recent form, we can expect goals on both sides.”

Correct Score Prediction: Turkey 2-1 Iceland

Following the rationale for both teams to score, a 2-1 win for Turkey seems the most likely outcome. Turkey’s attacking quality and home advantage should see them edge out Iceland, but their defence may once again struggle to keep a clean sheet, particularly against Iceland’s in-form forwards.

Despite their frustrations against Wales, Turkey tend to perform better in front of their home crowd, and with players like Guler and Calhanoglu stepping up, they should be able to find the back of the net more than once. Iceland, although resolute in their opening win, may find it harder to deal with the intensity Turkey bring when playing on their own turf.

Iceland have shown they can compete away from home, but their recent struggles on the road, including a heavy 4-0 defeat against the Netherlands, suggest they may fall just short here. However, with Oskarsson and Thorsteinsson in strong form, they should be able to at least breach Turkey’s defence once.

A 2-1 victory aligns with the both-teams-to-score rationale, offering a realistic outcome where Turkey can emerge with a hard-fought victory while still conceding a goal.
