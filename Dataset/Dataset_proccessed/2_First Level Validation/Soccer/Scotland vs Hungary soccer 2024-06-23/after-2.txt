Varga injury sees Scotland vs Hungary paused

Hungary striker Barnabas Varga received medical treatment for several minutes before departing on a stretcher following an aerial clash with Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn during their Euro 2024 match.

The game, which Hungary won 1-0, was held up for almost seven minutes as Varga, 29, was attended to by medical staff while surrounded by several protective sheets.

Varga left the field of play on a stretcher. His condition is not yet known.

Hungary went on to score a last-minute winner to eliminate Scotland from the tournament.

What next at Euro 2024?

Getty Images

10 more matches left of the group stage at Euro 2024 and two of them are being played tomorrow.

Group B will be concluded in the evening (9pm local time / 8pm BST / 3pm ET / 12pm PT) with these two matches:

Albania vs Spain
Croatia vs Italy

The current state of play in that group is that Spain have qualified for the last 16 while Italy are well placed in second to follow them through. Albania in third and Croatia in fourth will both need victories to secure a place in the next round.

What do Hungary need to make the last 16?

Getty Images

With Scotland out, the focus from this game will be on whether Hungary have done enough to make the last 16.

Having finished third in Group A, they need to finish above two of the other third-place finishers.

Currently, it is Slovenia, Albania and Czech republic below them in the third-place teams table and Hungary's -3 goal difference could work against them.

They will watch with real interest as the other five groups conclude over the next three days.

A disappointing tournament for McTominay

Getty Images

The Manchester United man was essential for Scotland in qualification, finding the back of the net for club and country with surprising regularity in the last couple of years.

When he limped off injured in the closing stages of the FA Cup final, the midfielder must have felt he might not get to play at Euro 2024 yet it was a different sort of disappointment in Germany.

Even had Scotland somehow progressed, his yellow card meant he would not be able to play in the potential last-16 clash.

It feels like a tournament to forget for a player who many felt could help the Scotland team make history, albeit his deflected strike did end up in the back of the net against Switzerland.

Gunn: The effort showed what it means to us

Getty Images

Gunn, like Robertson, struggled to find the words to describe how he was feeling after the match.

"It's hard to speak," he told the BBC. "Everyone gave their best out there and the goal at the end came because we were going for (the win). The effort we gave today showed the fans and the country what it means to us.

"When we look back, we created chances and we had opportunities. It didn't fall for us and we couldn't score. We're out and nothing really matters anymore."

Brilliant news

That is excellent to hear and a real relief.

There was clearly genuine concern among the rest of the Hungary players and the supporters in the crowd behind the goal.

To hear that Varga is in stable condition is great and will make his side's late victory even sweeter.

Barnabas Varga stable in hospital following second-half injury

Getty Images

Hungary striker Barnabas Varga is stable in hospital after being taken from the field on a stretcher during the Euro 2024 game against Scotland.

Varga, 29, challenged for an aerial ball with Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn in the second-half as he attempted to connect with Dominik Szoboszlai’s free kick. Gunn punched the ball with his right arm and Varga’s head appeared to collide with the goalkeeper’s trailing left arm.

The game was paused for six minutes while Varga received treatment on the field with screens erected surrounding him before he was taken off the pitch on a stretcher with sheets continuing to be held up.

The Hungarian football federation went on to confirm that Varga had been immediately taken to a local hospital in Stuttgart where his condition was described as stable.

Armstrong potential penalty is a subjective call

VAR might be flawed (and that is a discussion for another day), but that potential penalty is still a subjective call.

Yes, Orban made contact with Armstrong in the penalty area, but the Scotland substitute went looking for that contact by spreading his body across the recovering Hungary defender. Orban never altered his run and, in fact, I think it was more Armstrong making contact with him rather than vice versa.

Had it been awarded, I don't think it would have been overturned but Armstrong only had himself to blame after initially being clean through on goal.

Referee Tello will be questioned for his decision, but it is really poor from the Scotland man.

VAR still far from flawless

Getty Images

Armstrong was felled in the box by Orban and it looked like an absolute stonewall penalty, a clumsy challenge in the box that was clear and obvious to the naked eye. If the referee was going to somehow fail to point to the spot then surely VAR would intervene and amend what seemed a pretty basic mistake on the part of the man in the middle.

And yet, despite all of the drawbacks associated with VAR, it still didn’t manage to lead us to the correct decision in this case, a call that could have been the difference between a country reaching the knockouts for the first time or not.

Hungary players deserve credit for quick thinking

Getty Images

When Barnabas Varga went to ground and was clearly in serious trouble, he was placed in the recovery position and his visibly distressed teammates shielded him from view.

When the medical staff seemed slow to enter the field with a stretcher, those Hungarian players took matters into their own hands and ensured it was brought to their teammate with the utmost haste.

Bill Shankly was wrong about that one, it’s much less important than that and one can only hope Varga is OK.

Hungary players dedicate victory to Varga

The Hungary players involved in that victory deserve tremendous praise.

They went through a horrendous ordeal midway through that second half with the serious injury to Varga and somehow found the strength and energy to win the game in the most dramatic of circumstances.

They have just been pictured in front of their supporters holding a shirt with Varga's name on the back — a touching moment after the most emotional of matches.

We had possession but did nothing with it, says Robertson

Robertson continued.

"We had a lot of possession (in the) first half without really doing anything," he said. "But we were in control, we controlled the game, passed the ball really well but we had to find that cutting edge.

"We knew there was going to be a point in the game where we could go for it. Bring on the players we had on the bench to go for it that wee bit more, like Armstrong, Christie, Shankland, Morgan.

"We did go for it but we got sucker punched at the end. A draw wasn't going to be enough realistically and one team had to lose."

Robertson: 'It'll take a long time to get over this one'

Getty Images

Scotland captain Robertson spoke to the BBC at full time.

"There's nothing really to say, to be honest," he said. "We gave it everything, we knew we had to win this game, both teams had to win. And they've hit us on the counter attack after we had a chance.

"It could have gone either way but that's football, that's how it goes. It'll take a long time to get over this one."

Scotland just left it far too late

Scotland had just one shot on target in that match, and it came from centre-back Grant Hanley in the eighth minute of stoppage time.

For a team needing a win to progress at a major tournament, it was simply too little, too late for Steve Clarke's side.

And their lack of forward thinking in normal time left them short at the back in the final minute, extinguishing any feint hopes they had of making the last 16.

More goalmouth action in stoppage time than in the 90 minutes

Getty Images

I believe the phrase is "limbs". And that's just in the press box. The Hungarian journalist in the row in front of me just sent his monitor and chair flying as he leapt up to celebrate.

There was more action in the 10 minutes of stoppage time than in the preceding 90. Minutes after hitting the post, substitute Kevin Csoboth cooly slotted home after a fast break that started in Hungary's penalty area.

Scotland had been threatening a winner of their own but...ugh, you know the script.

Final Group A table

UEFA

The first group at Euro 2024 is complete.

Germany's late equaliser against Switzerland confirms their place as group winners, Switzerland have followed them through as runners up.

Hungary, meanwhile, will be confident of progressing as one of the best third-place teams and three points should enough to see them through.

Scotland finish fourth and will play no further part at this tournament.

Scotland are out of Euro 2024

FT Scotland 0-1 Hungary

There goes the full-time whistle and Hungary could still progress to the next round!

Scotland, meanwhile, are crestfallen as their elimination is confirmed.

A word for those Hungary players who kept going despite seeing a very serious injury to their team-mate, Varga, midway through that second half.

Unbelievable drama!

Getty Images

90+11' Scotland 0-1 Hungary

Wow. Wow. Wow.

Another chance from Scotland was blocked and Hungary broke at break-neck speed.

Csoboth led the counter attack and found Sallai on the right wing whose first touch was heavy. His second was much better, though as he directed a low ball across the Scotland penalty area.

Szoboszlai missed the ball, but Csoboth was behind him to fire an effort into the bottom corner!

Gulacsi saves from Hanley and Christie!

Getty Images

90+9' Scotland 0-0 Hungary

Another big chance for Scotland, but it couldn't have fallen to a less capable potential goalscorer.

Centre-back Hanley was the man who shot from the edge of the penalty area and his effort was on target, but far too easy for Gulacsi to save.

He then denied Christie from the rebound. Scotland are the team knocking on the door in the last couple of minutes...
