Scotland looking to end Hungary's 46-year streak in pivotal Euro 2024 fixture

Scotland will be hoping to inflict a 46-year first on Hungary when they meet at Euro 2024 on Sunday night.

Both teams have endured disappointing competitions thus far, failing to muster a victory between them in their respective two matches.

The Tartan Army responded to an opening-day thrashing by Germany by earning a draw against Switzerland on Wednesday, while Hungary have suffered defeats to both of the aforementioned sides.

As a result, it has left Steve Clarke and Marco Rossi both requiring victories at the Stuttgart Arena to have any realistic chance of progressing through to the last 16.

This fixture will run concurrently with the contest between Germany and Switzerland, although the latter earning at least a draw will render it irrelevant to Scotland and Hungary.

Scotland looking to end Hungary run

Hungary have certainly not been regulars at major competitions since 1978, featuring on the biggest stage on just four occasions during that period.

Nevertheless, the Magyars have managed to accumulate at least a point on each of those appearances, something which is at risk here.

Rossi will be looking to guide Hungary to just their second win in 10 European Championship fixtures, with their only success during that time coming against Austria in 2016.

Their dismal tournament record is extended by having prevailed in just one of their last 17 games at a Euros or World Cup, something which - historically at least - hands Scotland somewhat of an advantage.

Scotland bidding to better unusual Euros record

This is just Scotland's fourth-ever appearance at a European Championship and they have managed just two wins from their 11 games.

On both occasions, they were recorded on the final matchday of a group, against CIS in 1992 and Switzerland four years later at Euro 1996.

Incredibly, these two teams have never met in a competitive encounter, with just two matches taking place since 1988.

When the sides played each other in Budapest in March 2018, Matt Phillips scored the only goal of the game soon after the restart.
