Africa Cup of Nations hosts Ivory Coast overcame their own poor form and lack of a head coach to upset reigning champions Senegal and progress into the quarter-finals on penalties.

The outcome was all the more improbable given Senegal had emerged from their group phase with a perfect record, the only one in the tournament, while Ivory Coast only snuck through as the lowest-ranked qualifier of the third-placed teams, without a goal in their previous two fixtures.

And if initially the form guide looked to be providing a fairly routine outcome, it was Ivory Coast’s persistance and ability from the spot - particularly from subsitute Franck Kessie - which ultimately had the defining impact.

Follow the reaction below and check out the latest football odds here.

Kessie helps Ivory Coast knock out Afcon holders Senegal on penalties

Africa Cup of Nations hosts Ivory Coast overcame their own poor form and lack of a head coach to upset reigning champions Senegal and progress into the quarter-finals on penalties.

The outcome was all the more improbable given Senegal had emerged from their group phase with a perfect record, the only one in the tournament, while Ivory Coast only snuck through as the lowest-ranked qualifier of the third-placed teams, without a goal in their previous two fixtures.

And if initially the form guide looked to be providing a fairly routine outcome, it was Ivory Coast’s persistance and ability from the spot - particularly from subsitute Franck Kessie - which ultimately had the defining impact.

Cape Verde into Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals after beating Mauritania

Ryan Mendes converted a late penalty as Cape Verde beat Mauritania 1-0 in Abidjan to seal their place in the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations.

Cape Verde captain Mendes struck the decisive spot kick in the 88th minute and the Blue Sharks will now face either Morocco or South Africa in the quarter-finals.

Cape Verde, one of the surprise teams of the tournament after finishing unbeaten at the top of Group B ahead of Egypt and Ghana, were second best for most of the first half, but finished strongly to secure their passage.

FT - Senegal 1-1 Ivory Coast, 4-5 on penalties

For Senegal, the inquest starts now you would feel.

Three wins from three in the group stage and ahead here inside five minutes, they should have been confident and capable of wrapping up the match.

But they sat back too much, failed to seize the initiative at any point after that really and were eventually punished from the penalty spot - six times, in fact.

The holders exit without a knockout victory to their name.

FT - Senegal 1-1 Ivory Coast, 4-5 on penalties

Ivory Coast will now play either Mali or Burkina Faso in the quarter-finals and, suddenly, the route looks there for them to make a real run deep into the competition.

The winners of that quarter-final will play DR Congo or Guinea in the semi-finals - both you would feel are very winnable opponents if Ivory Coast can get their game together and perhaps get a bit more fitness into some of those impactful players off the bench tonight.

In Haller, Kouame, Pepe and Kessie they had real quality to use as subs - can they become starters and push the team on towards improbable glory?

FT - Senegal 1-1 Ivory Coast, 4-5 on penalties

Scenes as the players and coaches sprint onto the pitch, a quite incredible result for Ivory Coast considering they almost didn’t make it out of the groups.

And the champions are out! Senegal had it in their hands tonight, they led and should have really pressed on their advantage but exit in pretty tame fashion.

The hosts, however, roll on.

It’s Franck Kessie. He scored the penalty late in the 90 minutes to send the tie to extra time, and then onto penalties.

Now he can score to send the hosts to the last eight of the Afcon.

Up steps Kessie against Mendy once more...GOAL!

High, above the keeper, into the net and into the quarter-finals!!

FT - Senegal 1-1 Ivory Coast: Penalty shootout

Final taker and it’s Sadio Mane, the goalscorer two years ago to win it. He assisted tonight’s goal too...scores! Buried it, drilled down the middle. 4-4 and it’s down to Ivory Coast’s last penalty.

FT - Senegal 1-1 Ivory Coast: Penalty shootout

Serge Aurier now for Ivory Coast...goal! Side-footed high, just above the reach of Mendy! That’s 3-4 after four penalties each. Senegal must score their fifth or it’s all over.

Bamba Dieng up next, takes it quickly...and scores! Scuffed a little, but finds the corner. 3-3.
