Slovakia will face Azerbaijan at the Košická Futbalová Aréna on Sunday in another round of their 2024-25 UEFA Nations League campaign. The home side kicked off their group stage run on a winning note and now sit second in Group 1 with three points from an obtainable three.

They beat Estonia 1-0 at the A. Le Coq Arena on Thursday, dominating proceedings for the entirety of the first half before Hellas Verona man Tomas Suslov netted the game-winner 20 minutes from normal time.

Azerbaijan, meanwhile, faced Sweden in their group opener on Thursday, squandering a chance to take the lead from the spot in the first half and then conceding three times in a 15-minute second-half spell before Renat Dadasov headed home a late consolation goal.

The visitors now sit rock-bottom in their group and will be gutted to have come away with nothing last time out. They will be looking to bounce back from that and return to winning ways this weekend ahead of their return to action next month.

Slovakia vs Azerbaijan Prediction

Slovakia's latest result ended a three-game winless streak and they will be looking to build on that this weekend. They have won three of their last four games on home soil and will head into Sunday's game as overwhelming favorites.

Azerbaijan have lost two of their last three games and have won just two of their last six. The sheer gulf in class and quality between the two teams could see the visitors suffer defeat here.

Prediction: Slovakia 3-1 Azerbaijan
