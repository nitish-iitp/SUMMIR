Preview: Slovakia vs. Azerbaijan - prediction, team news, lineups

Aiming to record back-to-back competitive victories this month, Slovakia will welcome a new-look Azerbaijan side to Kosice on Sunday night for a UEFA Nations League C battle.

The Falcons managed a narrow success on the road during their opening match of the competition, whilst Milli Komanda were defeated by the section favourites on home soil.

After reaching the knockout stages of this summer's Euro 2024 in Germany - before losing in heartbreaking fashion to Gareth Southgate's England - Slovakia are looking to continue their upward trajectory at the end of the calendar year, with the goal of earning promotion to UEFA Nations League B.

The Falcons' quest for Group 1 supremacy started with a hard-fought victory on Thursday night, when Slovakia visited the home of Estonia in Tallinn and recorded a one-goal success, with 22-year-old Tomas Suslov taking advantage of a rare start to provide the game-winning strike in the second period.

Despite their respectable display at the European Championships being built on plenty of European knowhow from the likes of midfield generals Stanislav Lobotka and Ondrej Duda, Slovakia are using the Nations League as a chance to imbed some younger faces, including centre-back Adam Obert, who is exciting supporters regardless of his lack of playing time for Cagliari in Italy.

Previously the assistant coach of the aforementioned Serie A club during the 2020-21 campaign, Francesco Calzona racked up an 11th win during his 23rd game in charge of the Falcons on Thursday in Estonia, with the 55-year-old tasked with taking Sunday's hosts back to the heights of League B.

Slovakia will be striving for a repeat of their most recent fixture on home soil back in early June, when Calzona's troops recorded a convincing four-goal thumping of Rob Page's Wales in Trnava, with Juraj Kucka, Robert Bozenik and Laszlo Benes all breaching the net of Danny Ward.

Deep into added-on time at the end of the first period against Sweden on Thursday, Azerbaijan were handed a golden opportunity to take the lead against their Scandinavian visitors, but attacker Ramil Sheydaev was unable to hold his nerve from 12 yards, missing a penalty kick against Stoke City goalkeeper Viktor Johansson.

Milli Komanda were made to pay for their lack of ruthlessness in front of goal in the second period, when an Alexander Isak double and a strike from Sporting Lisbon marksman Victor Gyokeres put the contest beyond the hosts in Baku, emphatically deciding the destination of the Nations League points.

Despite a late consolation from former Wolverhampton Wanderers youngster Renat Dadashov, it was a sub-par performance from Azerbaijan during their first competitive action since a failed Euro 2024 qualification campaign at the end of 2023, when Giovanni De Biasi's side finished only above Estonia in a five-team section.

For a nation that has never managed to reach a major tournament, Milli Komanda have a very savvy international operator in the managerial hotseat in the form of 69-year-old Fernando Santos, who won Euro 2016 with Portugal before triumphing in the first edition of the Nations League in 2019.

Excluding a trip to European minnows Estonia in October 2023, Azerbaijan have lost their last three competitive away matches by an aggregate scoreline of 14-1, suffering heavy defeats in Austria, Sweden and Belgium during their ill-fated Euro 2024 qualifying journey.

Despite struggling at the start of the term for Boavista in Portugal, Bozenik was handed a start in the win over Estonia on Thursday night.

The decision was taken partly in order to rest 23-year-old David Strelec, who is fully expected to be promoted from the bench for this weekend's clash in Kosice.

Milan Skriniar's place in the starting XI is secure, although the Paris Saint-Germain defender could have a new partner in the backline, with Denis Vavro set to replace Obert.

After missing a decisive spot kick last time out, Sheydaev could be dropped from Azerbaijan's side to make room for fellow attacker Rustam Akhmedzade.

Regardless of conceding three against the Swedes, Santos should stick with an experienced centre-back pairing of Bahlul Mustafazade and Badavi Huseynov.


Slovakia possible starting lineup:
Dubravka; Pekarik, Skriniar, Vavro, Hancko; Duda, Lobotka, Benes; Suslov, Haraslin, Strelec

Azerbaijan possible starting lineup:
Dzhenetov; A Huseynov, Mustafazade, B Huseynov, Jafarquilyev; Isayev, Makhmudov, Diniyev; Akhmedzade, Bayramov; Dadashov



We say: Slovakia 1-0 Azerbaijan

Slovakia were dominant in Tallinn on Thursday night against Estonia, so the Falcons should be confident of easing past the attentions of Azerbaijan on home soil.

Milli Komanda have struggled significantly on the road over the past 12 months, and we expect that theme to continue in Kosice on Sunday night.
