Doha: Defending champions Qatar became the first side to advance to the Round of 16 of the AFC Asian Cup after beating Tajikistan 1-0 at Al Bayt Stadium on Wednesday.

Akram Afif, who scored a brace for the hosts in 3-0 opening victory against Lebanon on Friday, scored the all-important goal sending home fans into raptures after a brilliant assist from striker Almoez Ali in the 17th minute.

The victory also assured Qatar a top place in Group A after China were held to their second consecutive goalless draw by Lebanon earlier on Wednesday at Al Thumama Stadium. 

Tajikistan put up a good fight and created several scoring opportunities before they were down to 10 men, with Amadoni Kamolov being sent off following a VAR check for hitting substitute Ahmed Al Ganehi in 81st minute.                     

Marquez Lopez-coached Qatar will now look to maintain their perfect record when they will meet China in their last group match at Khalifa International Stadium on Monday while Tajikistan face Lebanon the same day at Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium hoping to advance to the last 16.
