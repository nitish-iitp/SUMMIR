How is Tajikistan coming?

The Tajikistan team has just drawn 0 goals against China. A very even game, apart from the fact that Tajikistan had the ball position despite the Chinese who were very consistent. This match can define their future within the competition as a defeat would send them to the last match seeking qualification and a victory would make them dream of a possible second place.

Qatar's latest roster

It was a 3-5-2 formation with Meshaal Bersham, Pedro Miguel, Almahdi Ali, Mendes, Abdurisag, Hassan Al Haydos, Ahmed Fathi, Abdulaziz Hatem, Mohammed Waad, Akram Afif and Almoez Ali.

How is Qatar doing?

Qatar comes from beating Lebanon by 3 goals to 0. With scores from Akram Afif with a double and Almoez Ali closed the victory. The Cataris against the Lebanon team showed one of their best games, having more shots on goal and possession of 62% of the ball. Something worth highlighting is that they were a group that took ownership of the fouls and one aspect that they must take care of are the yellow cards as a possible qualification to the next round could endanger some of their players not playing in the round of 16 or future games.
