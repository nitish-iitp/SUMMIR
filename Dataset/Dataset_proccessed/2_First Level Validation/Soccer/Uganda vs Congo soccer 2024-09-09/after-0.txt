Aziz Kayondo gives Uganda Cranes halftime lead

AFCON 2025 Qualifiers | Half Time

HT: Uganda 1-0 Congo Brazaville

Uganda secure a 1-0 half time lead against Congo Brazaville in the 2025 AFCON Qualifiers in the encounter played at Mandela National Stadium, Namboole on Monday.

Roving left back, Aziz Kayondo's effort is still the difference between the two sides after the 45 minutes in the ongoing entertaining game.

Paul Put made two changes as Kenneth Semakula and Muhammad Shaban came into the starting eleven to replace Elvis Bwomono and Steven Mukwala respectively.

Uganda started right away on the front foot seeking for an opener as well as the driving seat infront of a loud crowd.

Kayondo broke the deadlock with a deep effort that eluded the custodian into the back of the net.

The Cranes will seek to hang in and fight for maximum points so as to enlighten their path to the 2025 final AFCON tournament.

Uganda Cranes Starting XI

Isima Watenga (GK), Kenneth Semakula, Aziizi Kayondo, Bevis Mugabi, Elio Caprodossi, Ronald Ssekiganda, Rogers Mato, Khalid Aucho, Muhammad Shaban, Travis Mutyaba, Denis Omedi
