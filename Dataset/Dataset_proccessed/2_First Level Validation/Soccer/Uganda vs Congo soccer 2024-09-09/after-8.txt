AFCON 2025 Qualifiers (Group K):
Uganda Cranes 2-0 Congo

It has been celebrations at the Mandela National Stadium, Namboole as Uganda Cranes were victorious over Congo, winning 2-0 in the AFCON 2025 Qualifiers.

A goal in either half from defender Abdu Azizi Kayondo and late first-half substitute Jude Ssemugabi inspired Uganda to a remarkable victory.

The Cranes, playing their third game at home after over three years, were lively from the very first whistle until the game’s final stages.

The gaffer Paul Put named two changes to the team that drew 2-all away to South Africa with Kenneth Ssemakula replacing Elvis Bwomono at right back and Muhammad Shaban who passed a late fitness test taking over Steven Desse Mukwala’s slot at centre forward.

Uganda started the game on a high tempo and dominated the early proceedings of the game.

Congo’s Ryan Maxime Destin Bidounga got cautioned by the Tunisian referee Melki Mehrez for a foul on Travis Mutyaba in the 18th minute.

Two minutes later, Kayondo, Uganda’s left back now featuring at FC Slovan Liberec in the Czech Republic lit up the charged fans with a long-range flying cross over the goalkeeper Pavelh Ndzila who turns up for Rwanda’s APR.

It would have been 2 goals up for the hosts six minutes later had Rogers Kassim Mato converted from close range following a great through pass from midfielder Ronald Ssekiganda.

On the half-hour mark, goalkeeper Isima Watenga was well-stationed to save a powerful header from defender Destin after an inviting free-kick.

The game was temporarily halted as a section of the stadium lights got off, a breather that the players optimally utilized to quench their thirst as the coaches preached their tactics once again.

As the lights returned, Uganda’s captain Khalid Aucho blocked a goal-bound shot from Antoine Makoumbou, much to the delight of the ecstatic home crowd.

Congo nearly levelled the game heading to the break but striker Silvere Ganvoula Mboussy arrived late to meet a teasing by-line delivery from Merveil Valthy Streeker Ndockyt.

Towards the end of the opening stanza, Uganda lost forward Muhammad Shaban through injury and his place was taken by Kitara football club’s Jude Ssemugabi.

Congo had the last say in the opening half but goalkeeper Watenga was quicker off the blocks to thwart the danger.

The visitors restarted play with vigour, desperate to level the matters.

Defender Kristopher Mugabi had a great block off Ndockyt inside the goal area.

Kayondo continued to impress with a great through ball to Mato whose deft pass was quickly intervened by goalkeeper Ndzila.

Congo’s captain Mboussy headed over from a curling corner kick by Ndockyt on the hour mark.

Five minutes ahead, Ssemugabi slid where it mattered most as he attempted to shoot from the edge of the goal off his weaker foot.

Uganda repossessed with Travis Mutyaba releasing Mato on the left but the latter’s chip found Ssemugabi late.

With minutes tickling down the clock, Congo had a penalty appeal waved off by the referee after defender Kenneth Ssemakula had a slight touch onto Prestige Vieljeux Mboungou.

In the 73rd minute, Uganda called for a double change. Allan Okello and Halid Lwaliwa replaced Travis Mutyaba and Elio Capradossi respectively.

Meanwhile, Congo pulled off Morgan Paul Poaty for Prince Vinny Ibara Doniama.

Ndockyt hit the defensive wall from a tempting position off 35 yards with 10 minutes to play.

Omedi shot straight at goalkeeper Ndzila in the 82nd minute, his last contribution to the game before he paved way for Steven Desse Mukwala.

At the same time, Joel Sserunjogi replaced a limping Aucho as the Cranes’ armband was taken over by goalkeeper Watenga.

Okello assisted Ssemugabi with an explicit pass off the bootlaces as the stadium erupted with five minutes to play.

At this stage, it was done and dusted. The mission had been accomplished as the remaining time was well utilized to jealously protect the lead.

2-0 Uganda won at full time, a victory that takes the Cranes to four points in Group K which also has neighbours South Sudan and South Africa.

The final whistle was treated with wild chants from the home players, officials and fans alike.

The celebrations and party time continued until late night.

South Sudan hosts South Africa on Tuesday, 10th September 2024 at the Juba National Stadium.

Congratulations to the Cranes for taking care of business.

Congratulations to FUFA for providing the foundation our players need to flourish. Keep improving the logistics, planning and management, then everything else will fall into place.
The Cranes can fly high and go places.

“ The celebrations and party time continued until late night.”

Are the good times back? 🙂

It’s refreshing to see a Cranes team taking shots from far and wide. It has been decades since I saw senior team players take such shots.
The team is still playing within themselves but there is a swaga about some players reminiscent of the 70s teams.

The Cranes are clearly a work in progress but are on the right track. Got to give credit to FUFA too.

The Cranes team should work on ball management, passing the ball and confidence while on the ball. It wasn’t a great show.
