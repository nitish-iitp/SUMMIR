Uganda vs Congo Brazzaville - 7pm

Uganda Cranes is set to take on Congo Brazzaville in the AFCON Qualifiers encounter at Mandela National Stadium, Namboole, on Monday.

It will be Uganda's second game in the qualifiers, but the first played at home since their maiden outing was against South Africa in Johannesburg.

Uganda Cranes head coach Paul Put is confident ahead of Congo Brazzaville's game indicating they are going for maximum points.

"Our target is to pick maximum points. Congo has quality with very good players featuring in big leagues, so we definitely do not undermine them," Put stated.

"We are still a work in progress, but I am impressed with the progress, and I know we will get there soon. I believe the players have recovered well despite having limited time to rest," he added.

Paul Put's charges narrowly missed out on a victory on a victory after being held by South Africa in a 2-2 draw.

On the other hand, Congo Brazzaville secured a 1-0 victory against South Sudan, and they seek to extend their perfect run in the ongoing qualifiers.

Muhammad Shaban missed out on the previous encounter due to an injury, and he is still in doubt for today's game.

The camp has been boosted with the arrival of defenders Kenneth Ssemakula and Halidi Lwaliwa who missed South Africa's clash.

Uganda is in Group K alongside Congo Brazzaville, South Africa and South Sudan.
