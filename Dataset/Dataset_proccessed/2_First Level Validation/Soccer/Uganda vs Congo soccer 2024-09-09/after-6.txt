Uganda and Congo lock horns in Group K of the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers on Monday

Uganda and Congo return to action in Group K of the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers when they face off at the Nelson Mandela National Stadium on Monday. This will be the first meeting between the two nations since they played out a 1-1 stalemate in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers in November 2017.

Uganda were denied a dream start to the 2025 AFCON qualifiers as they played out a 2-2 draw against South Africa in the Group K opener on Wednesday.

After falling behind to Lyle Forster’s 14th-minute opener, Denis Omedi and Rogers Mato scored quick-fire goals to help Uganda turn the game on its head, but Thalente Mbatha netted in the 95th minute to hand Bafana Bafana a hard-fought point.

Uganda, whose last AFCON appearance came in Egypt back in 2019, will now look to build on their opening-day result as they aim to end a five-year absence from the continental showpiece.

Elswhere, Hatayspor midfielder Chandrel Massanga came up trumps for Congo as he netted in the 12th minute to inspire them to a 1-0 victory over South Sudan in the Group K curtain-raiser on Thursday.

Before that, Isaac Ngata’s men were on a five-game winless run across all competitions, losing three and claiming two draws since June 2023.

Congo are seeking their first AFCON appearance since their quarter-final finish in 2015 and will journey to the Nelson Mandela National Stadium aiming to pick up where they left off against South Sudan.

Uganda vs Congo Head-To-Head and Key Numbers
With four wins from the last eight meetings between the sides, Uganda hold a slightly superior record in the history of this fixture.
Congo have picked up one fewer win in that time, while the two nations have settled for a share of the spoils once.
Uganda have failed to win four of their last five matches across all competitions, losing twice and claiming two draws since kicking off the year with a 2-0 victory over Kuwait on January 19.
Congo have won just one of their last five competitive matches while losing three and picking up one draw since June 2023.
Uganda vs Congo Prediction

Buoyed by their opening-day victory over South Sudan, Congo will head into Monday’s clash with confidence as they look to maintain their solid start to the qualifying campaign.

However, Uganda showed their mettle against South Africa last time out and we predict they will hold out for another share of the spoils.

Prediction: Uganda 2-2 Congo
