Algeria vs Angola - LIVE!

Group D at the Africa Cup of Nations begins tonight as Algeria take on Angola at the Stade de la Paix in Bouake. The opening couple of days of AFCON have already brought some surprising results, with Nigeria held by Equatorial Guinea, Ghana beaten by Cape Verde, and Egypt needing a last-gasp penalty from Mohamed Salah to earn a point against Mozambique.

Algeria will be hoping for less drama here, in a match they are expected to win. They are looking to bounce back from their AFCON horror show two years ago when they crashed out in the group-stage, finishing bottom with just one point and one goal to their name.

It is 12 years since Angola last won an AFCON match, but come into this match on the back of four consecutive goalless draws, suggesting they are capable of making it a frustrating night for Algeria. Follow all the action with Standard Sport's LIVE blog below!

FT: Algeria 1-1 Angola

Angola hold on for a point!

More frustration at AFCON for Algeria, following on from their results two years ago.

Angola had to come from behind to get a result, really impressive from them. They'll be believing they can reach the knockout stages.

Algeria 1-1 Angola

90+7 mins: Angola survive!

Mahrez actually lays it off, before Cipriano is forced into a big save. Then a bit of a scramble, turned behind for a corner.

Back in it comes... for another corner!

Algeria 1-1 Angola

90+5 mins: Not done yet!

Mahrez inside, onto that left foot... shot is blocked. Defenders basically turned into goalkeepers there, charged down with an arm.

Free-kick on the edge of the area. Step up, Mahrez....

90+2 mins: Angola defending well, sitting deep in their shape. Five more minutes to survive.

Algeria looking a bit desperate - and they've looked really tired in the last 20 minutes or so.

Algeria 1-1 Angola

90 mins: SEVEN minutes added on!

Algeria not done yet, but they don't really look like creating anything.

That's probably jinxed it - apologies to Angola.

Algeria 1-1 Angola

87 mins: Clipped to the back post, Slimani is being closely watched but he wins the header.

Huge penalty appeals from Algeria, waved away by the referee. VAR not interested either.

Algeria 1-1 Angola

85 mins: Mahrez down riiiiiight on the edge of the area. He wanted a penalty - free-kick it is, despite a couple of extra rolls.

Algeria still have time.

Algeria 1-1 Angola

83 mins: Algeria continue to win plenty of corners - they're into double figures now. Haven't looked particularly dangerous from them though.

And the pattern continues, straight into Cipriano's gloves.

Algeria 1-1 Angola

79 mins: It's actually Angola who looking more dangerous, plenty of energy on the counter.

A fourth yellow card for Algeria, Atal the latest player into the book for pulling back his man.

Algeria 1-1 Angola

77 mins: Both sides seem to just be shooting on sight now. Hectic feel - there's still the best part of 15 minutes left.

Is this going to turn into another frustrating AFCON night for Algeria?
