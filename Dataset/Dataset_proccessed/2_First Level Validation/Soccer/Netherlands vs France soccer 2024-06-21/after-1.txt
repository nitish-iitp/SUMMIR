Netherlands 0-0 France Stats: Les Bleus Unable to Mask Issues Without Mbappé

The two big dogs in Group D played out the first 0-0 in the competition in over 50 games, and the first at Euro 2024. Check out the best facts, stats and Opta data with our Netherlands vs France stats page.

France are justifiably one of the favourites to win Euro 2024, but their 0-0 draw with the Netherlands perhaps showed how reliant they are on Kylian Mbappé.

With the Netherlands and the French both securing wins in their opening games at Euro 2024, this was set up as a battle for top spot in Group D. The table was laid for a statement win from either.

Instead, what followed was the first goalless draw at a European Championship since England drew with Scotland at Euro 2020, with the previous 50 games in the competition seeing at least one goal scored.

It was the Dutch who could consider themselves unlucky after seeing a debatable Xavi Simons goal disallowed in the second half.

Mbappé had to make do with a place on the bench after breaking his nose in France’s 1-0 win over Austria, with Aurélien Tchouaméni coming into the team and Antoine Griezmann moving into the forward line.

It was only the third time since the 2018 World Cup that Mbappé hadn’t started one of France’s games at a major tournament (World Cup/Euros), with Les Bleus not winning either of the previous two such matches (0-0 vs Denmark at the 2018 World Cup, 1-0 defeat vs Tunisia at the 2022 World Cup).

In fact, Didier Deschamps’ side had not won any of their last six games overall in which Mbappé had not started (four draws, two defeats).

Meanwhile, with an average age of 27 years and 39 days, the Netherlands fielded their second-youngest starting XI at the European Championship this century, after their side versus Romania at Euro 2008 (26y, 20d).

The Dutch were almost ahead in the opening minute when Jeremie Frimpong was set free down the right, but Théo Hernández’s challenge put the Bayer Leverkusen star off, and his shot was pushed wide by Mike Maignan.

Rapid starts have been a trend of Euro 2024 so far. There has been an opening-minute shot on target in five games already (Albania vs Italy, Hungary vs Germany, Denmark vs England, Austria vs Poland, Netherlands vs France), more than twice as many games as in any other edition of the competition on record (since 1980).

France will have wondered how they weren’t ahead in the 14th minute when Adrien Rabiot was in on goal, only for him to try to find Griezmann to the surprise of everyone, including Griezmann, who clearly wasn’t expecting it and he failed to turn the ball home despite his frantic attempts.

Moments later, Cody Gakpo cut inside from the left and produced a fine save from Maignan from outside the box, but the game didn’t really catch fire in the opening period.

Having moved into the attack and been given the captain’s armband, Griezmann was getting involved, having four of France’s five shots in the first half, the first time he had attempted at least four shots in an entire game in the European Championship since facing Germany at Euro 2016 (seven shots).

The second half began at a slow pace, summed up somewhat by Tchouameni’s shot from range that was sliced so badly that it went out for a throw-in just before the hour mark, though he went much closer four minutes later with a header just over the bar.

Griezmann had another glorious opportunity when he was fed by N’Golo Kanté, but again he struggled to get the ball out of his feet and Bart Verbruggen made the save with his left leg.

Just as it appeared France were taking control, the Netherlands thought they had taken the lead. Gakpo fed Memphis Depay, whose shot was saved by Maignan, only for Xavi Simons to send the rebound into the net. However, the flag was raised by the assistant referee due to Denzel Dumfries being stood to the side of Maignan, believing he had impeded the goalkeeper. After a lengthy VAR check, the goal was disallowed, to great Dutch annoyance.

Ronald Koeman turned to his hero from Matchday 1, Wout Weghorst, with 11 minutes remaining, while Deschamps had brought on his own target man in Olivier Giroud, rather than Mbappé.

Neither could make an impact, though, as the game finished goalless; a result that confirmed Poland as the first team eliminated from Euro 2024 after their 3-1 defeat to Austria earlier on Friday.

It was not a game that either side had to win, but they will certainly need to play better to go all the way. When Mbappé returns, France will be better positioned to sniff out the goals they will need.

Netherlands vs France Stats: Post-Match Facts
Excluding shootouts, Netherlands have lost just one of their last 18 games at major international tournaments (World Cup/Euros), via a 2-0 defeat to Czech Republic at Euro 2020 (W12 D4).
France failed to score despite mustering 14 shots in the game, their biggest haul without finding the back of the net in a major tournament game since the Euro 2016 final against Portugal (18 shots attempted).
This was only the fifth of the 31 meetings between the Netherlands and France to end in a draw (15 wins for France, 11 wins for the Netherlands).
This stalemate ended a run of 50 games at UEFA European Championships without a goalless draw, since Scotland and England played out at 0-0 draw in June 2021.
Netherlands posted their lowest possession figure in a European Championship game on record (since 1980) – 37%.
Antoine Griezmann has now started each of France’s last 11 games at the European Championship, with Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo (18) and Germany’s Toni Kroos (13) the only outfielders currently on a longer such streak for their nation.
In the last two years (since the start of June 2022), France have won none of their seven games when Kylian Mbappé hasn’t started or played at all, drawing five and losing two. 
France captain Antoine Griezmann made his 32nd appearance at a major tournament, the joint-most for Les Bleus by an outfield player (level with Lilian Thuram).
