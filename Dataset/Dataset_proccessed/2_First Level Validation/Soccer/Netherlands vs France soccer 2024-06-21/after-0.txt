Netherlands 0 France 0 – Why was Xavi Simons’ goal disallowed? Should Rabiot have shot?

The Netherlands and France played out the first 0-0 draw of Euro 2024 as both moved closer to qualification for the knockout stages.

The first-half was defined more by a strange decision than anything else. Adrien Rabiot was played through on goal courtesy of a flick from Marcus Thuram. Just yards away from the net, he chose to try and pass the ball to Antoine Griezmann rather than shoot. The ball was slightly behind Griezmann, and his attempt did not trouble Bart Verbruggen in the Netherlands goal.

The Netherlands looked to have taken the lead in the second-half courtesy of a strike by Xavi Simons. But referee Anthony Taylor believed Denzel Dumfries was obstructing Mike Maignan and stopped him from saving the shot while stood in an offside position — leading to the goal being ruled out. It was the only time the ball was put in the net during Friday’s game and, with Kylian Mbappe left on the bench after breaking his nose against Austria, the game finished as a draw.

Here, Amy Lawrence, Peter Rutzler and Liam Tharme analyse the Group D clash.

Why was Xavi Simons’ goal ruled out?

Of course, it would be the Premier League match officials who would find themselves embroiled in a VAR controversy — and the longest so far in this European Championship.

The controversy struck in the 69th minute. Simons rifled the ball into the net from the edge of the box. But standing next to goalkeeper Maignan, in an offside position, was Netherlands defender Dumfries.

The flag was raised and referee Taylor ruled the goal out. The officials judged Dumfries to be interfering with play and impeding Maignan’s ability to save the shot.

Then came the VAR check, followed by some Dutch fury. Simons, who was then ruthlessly subbed by coach Ronald Koeman immediately afterwards, looked crestfallen.

But was it the right call? Well, this was not going to be an easy, quick assessment like the other semi-automated calls we have seen during this tournament. It relied on a subjective decision about whether Dumfries was interfering with play, and therefore active.

The letter of the law deems a player to be “interfering with play” in four ways:

preventing an opponent from being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing the opponent’s line of vision
challenging an opponent for the ball
clearly attempting to play a ball which is close when this action impacts on an opponent
making an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball

Dumfries was not blocking Maignan’s vision. Nor, did it seem, was he trying to play the ball. The question is whether Dumfries prevented the France goalkeeper playing the ball before it whizzed past him into the net. He had barely got to his feet as the ball went by. It looked harsh.

Ultimately, the VAR — Stuart Attwell, a familiar face to Premier League fans — decided it was not a clear error. And that is likely why they belatedly stuck with the onfield decision. As a result, Taylor was not sent to the monitor.

So, good process? Well… The Dutch contingent were not happy. And that is understandable.

Why, oh why, didn’t Rabiot shoot?

Oh Adrien. What on earth was going on in your mind during that split second? You were in on goal with generous spaces on either side of the opposition goalkeeper. The vast majority of observers at that exact moment thought that the only choice on the line was whether to aim left or right. But Adrien Rabiot, having ambled so perfectly onto Marcus Thuram’s back-heeled pass, instead elected to square the ball for a frankly astonished Antoine Griezmann.

France’s effervescent schemer didn’t have enough time to adjust his body. Being generous, maybe the pitch, which looked bumpy and cut up inside the box, didn’t help. But the angle was off. The ball drifted behind. Griezmann frantically tried to recover but the chance was gone. It wasn’t the only chance he didn’t quite snaffle either, as another opportunity in the second half was squandered.

Decision-making, particularly in crunch moments, especially at speed, is one of the key factors that separates great players from the rest. Rabiot has a maddening tendency to fluctuate between super-smart decisions and bewildering ones.

It summed it up, though, back in the TV studio when three international strikers watching on for UK broadcaster BBC — Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Wayne Rooney — all lamented the lack of a shooting instinct. Then Lineker turned to Cesc Fabregas to ask the token midfielder what he would have done in Rabiot’s shoes. “I would have passed it but passed it well,” he quipped. Oooof.

So, was Mbappe a ruse all along?

Initially, after Kylian Mbappe broke his nose against Austria on Monday, all the talk in France has centred around who could replace him in the starting XI, and for how much of the group stage he might miss.

But then, on Thursday, he emerged wearing the mask.

Yes, most medical opinions initially suggested it was very unlikely that Mbappe might start against the Dutch but the tricolour mask offered promise. It suggested a quicker recovery. Could he really start?

France certainly played up the possibility. In his pre-match press conference, Deschamps then said Mbappe would be available. “Things are moving in the right direction so that he can be available tomorrow,” he said. “We’ll make sure he’s available, I repeat.”

The day before, Mbappe had dropped cryptic clues on social media: “Without risks, there are no victories,” he wrote on Instagram.

In training, Deschamps cycled through several different line-ups to keep the world guessing too.
In the end, it was too early for an Mbappe return. Aurelien Tchouameni was recalled, stepping into midfield and pushing Rabiot out to the left-hand side.

Did it fool the Dutch? It is hard to say and is probably unlikely. Koeman added another forward to his frontline, with Jeremie Frimpong replacing midfielder Joey Veerman, suggesting he felt his side may have a little less to worry about defensively.

But while the mask played no part in Friday’s encounter, it might still get a run out in the days to come.

Did the Netherlands’ strikerless system work?

For a forward with 45 goals in 94 international caps, Memphis Depay has a remarkably false role in the Netherlands’ 4-2-3-1. Donning a white headband, he spent most of the time shuttling between France centre-backs, trying to lock them in one side and play a role in receiving passes when the Dutch made midfield regains.

At the tip of a 4-2-3-1, Depay was given a task which most Premier League forwards failed at last season: play back-to-goal against William Saliba, win aerial duels and try to hold passes into your feet. He thought he had created the winner, indirectly. His shot on the spin, holding off Dayot Upamecano, forced Maignan to parry and Simons fired in the rebound — only for Dumfries to be offside and adjudged as in Maignan’s way.

It spoke to a complicated relationship between Dutch football and No 9s (and their role in build-up), with target man Wout Weghorst left on the bench until 78 minutes — he has four goals in 266 minutes at major tournaments. Koeman’s triple sub in the second-half changed Netherland’s right side (No 8, right winger, No 10) in attack, but left Depay up top. Injuries have contributed but Depay only has one international goal since March 2023.

Koeman might shuffle his pack next game — Weghorst would be the obvious choice but then they would miss his impact off the bench. Brian Brobbey or Joshua Zirkzee are wildcard options, contemporary No 9s who can do a bit of everything.

How did an Mbappe-less France attack?

With difficulty, it must be said. France were not exactly at their most exuberant in their opening match against Austria, but finding an attacking rhythm proved a complicated task with Mbappe restricted to self-consciously stroking his nose on the sidelines as he watched from the bench.

This is two games, now, without a great deal of fluency or efficiency around the opposition box. France lined up with Marcus Thuram as their attacking pivot, holding up play and acting as a focal point physically. Griezmann, with all his intelligent movement and bouncing runs, was the main hope but, unusually for him, a touch of composure was missing in key moments. Out wide, Ousmane Dembele floated around on the right flank without doing much damage.

The longer the game remained goalless, we waited to see whether Mbappe and his Zorro mask might make a dramatic appearance. When the call came to bring on Les Bleus’ paragon of goalscoring renown, on came Olivier Giroud.

When the ball came near to him, it skimmed him on the backside. That kind of night.

Where does this result leave France and the Netherlands?

The result was not damaging for either side. They now both just need a draw to secure a place in the last-16.

France have an easier route to top spot in Group D, as they have to take on and beat Poland, who have not picked up a single point in their two games. Poland are also now out, given their loss to Austria. A draw would also send France through, as both the Netherlands and Austria cannot win the same game.

The Netherlands, on the other hand, are basically in a straight shoot-out with Austria for one of the top two qualification spots. A win for either team would send them through to the last-16 — and the other team in third. A draw would put the Netherlands through. A loss could also see the Netherlands advance, with four points, in third — but avoiding that would be preferable as there is still a risk they could miss out.

What did Ronald Koeman say?

Koeman disagreed with the decision to disallow Simons’ goal: “I think the position of Dumfries is offside, that’s true but he isn’t disturbing the goalkeeper and when that doesn’t happen, then it’s a legal goal.

“You need five mins to check it because it’s so difficult? I don’t understand. He’s not disturbing the goalkeeper. I think the goal should have stood.”

What did Didier Deschamps say?

He disagreed with Koeman: “There was no goal. He must have had a meeting with the referees. From the moment a player disturbs the vision and prevents the goalkeeper from diving. It seemed obvious to me.”

On Mbappe, he added: “I don’t have to bluff. It’s getting better, every day that goes by is a day gained. If it had been a decisive match, I might have thought differently. It was important to get Kylian’s feeling. The fact of having a bruise that needs to go down and wearing a mask that disturbs your vision… There’s a risk, and every day we’re getting closer. It was wiser to keep him on the bench.”
