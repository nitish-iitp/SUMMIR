EURO 2024
NETHERLANDS 0-0 FRANCE: KYLIAN MBAPPE STAYS ON BENCH AS VAR CONTROVERSY SEES XAVI SIMONS GOAL RULED OUT
BYCHARLIE WEBSTER

UPDATED 21/06/2024 AT 21:28 GMT

Much of the talk before Netherlands took on France centred around Kylian Mbappe, but Les Bleus' star forward - and his mask - stayed on the bench as his team struggled to find their cutting edge in Leipzig. Antoine Griezmann was the biggest culprit, passing up two openings from close range, while Xavi Simons had a second-half goal ruled out for Ronald Koeman's side after a long VAR check.

Netherlands and France played out the first goalless draw of Euro 2024 in what was a tense and tight affair that neither side seemed to want to lose.
Both sides threatened on several occasions in the first half as the French side, missing their talisman in Kylian Mbappe, looked to play the game at their own pace, while the Dutch sought to utilise the guile of Xavi Simons, Memphis Depay and Jeremie Frimpong on the break.

Despite Antoine Griezmann fluffing his lines from six yards out after Adrian Rabiot unexpectedly squared him the ball, there were few big chances in a first half where neither side really got out of second gear.

The second half saw Griezmann again spurn France’s best opportunity of the half, while Xavi Simons had a goal harshly ruled out for Netherlands as Denzel Dumfries was judged to have blocked Mike Maignan from an offside position.
Although neither side will be too pleased with their performance, a point sees both reach four points and virtually guarantee progression to the knockouts.
Meanwhile, Poland are confirmed as the first side out of Euro 2024, and Group D goes to the final round of games to decide which of Austria, France and Netherlands will top the group.
TALKING POINT – ARE FRANCE A THREAT WITHOUT MBAPPE?
It was very much a case of no Mbappe no party for the tournament favourites who toiled away but created few chances. After an unconvincing win over Austria in the first game these two performances may well have exposed a few chinks in the French armour.
With mystery surrounding Mbappe’s fitness, this tournament may well have been blown wide open or this game could simply be the case of two sides settling for a results which effectively guarantees progression to the knockout stages for both.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH – DAYOT UPAMECANO (FRANCE)
Not the highest quality of games but Upamecano did his defensive duties well for France and provided some key moments in the first half where the Dutch played their more threatening football. He remained strong in the challenge and dealt well with the pace Depay, Simons and Frimpong throughout the game which limited Netherlands to minimal chances in the second half.
In a goalless draw like this it was clearly no fault of the defenders as to why his team only came away with a single point.
PLAYER RATINGS
Netherlands: Verbruggen 7, Dumfries 6, De Vrij 6, Van Dijk 6, Ake 5, Schouten 5, Reijnders 6, Frimpong 6, Simons 7, Gakpo 6, Depay 4. Subs: Geertruida 5, Wijnaldum 6, Veerman 5, Weghorst 5.
France: Maignan 7, Kounde 6, Upamecano 7, Saliba 6, Hernandez 5, Kante 7, Tchouameni 6, Rabiot 5, Dembele 5, Griezmann 6, Thuram 4. Subs: Coman 4, Giroud 5.
Match Highlights
14’ IT SHOULD BE 1-0 FRANCE - What an opportunity for France! After a patient bit of play Rabiot is slipped in behind but, six yards out, opts to square it to Griezmann who falls to feet and completely misses the ball!
65’ ANOTHER GOLDEN CHANCE FOR GRIEZMANN - France finally create a clear opening as Thuram spins his man, tees it off to Kante who slips Griezmann in on goal again. The captain, however, lunges at the ball and can't put it past Verbruggen.
69’ GOAL! - NETHERLANDS 1-0 FRANCE (SIMONS) - Just as the French were getting on top of this game Simons slams it home from a rebound! But will it stand there's a flag for offside on Dumfries who was stood by Maignan. Was he interfering with play?
71’ GOAL DISALLOWED! - Dumfries is ruled to have interfered from an offside position. It took an awful long time and seems awfully harsh against the Dutch. It remains goalless.
