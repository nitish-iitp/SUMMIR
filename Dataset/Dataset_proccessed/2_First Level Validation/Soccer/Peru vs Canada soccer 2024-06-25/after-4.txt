Canada beats 10-man Peru to boost Copa America knockout hopes

A second-half strike from forward Jonathan David helped Canada secure a 1-0 victory over 10-man Peru in their Copa America Group A match in Kansas City on Tuesday to raise hopes of a top-two finish and a spot in the knockout stages.

David's 74th-minute goal was Canada's first under new manager Jesse Marsch. Prior to Tuesday's victory the Canadians had failed to score in two international friendlies and their opening Copa America match against Argentina.

"We're going to enjoy the moment, but know the work isn't done," captain Alphonso Davies told Canadian broadcaster TSN.

While Canada had the majority of possession in the first half, Peru had the better chances, with Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau pulling off a sharp save to deny Piero Quispe, while Gianluca Lapadula had a goal ruled out for offside on a hot and humid night at Children's Mercy Park.

Assistant referee Humberto Panjoj collapsed during stoppage time in the first half, with Crépeau grabbing the attention of medical staff, who helped the linesman off the field on a stretcher.

The momentum swung in Canada's favour after the break, as Peru defender Miguel Araujo was sent off following a VAR check for a heavy challenge on Jacob Shaffelburg, before Lille attacker David coolly slotted home in the 74th minute to cap off a swift counter-attack.

Cyle Larin initiated the break from his own box before releasing Shaffelburg, who delivered a pinpoint cross for David to slot past advancing goalkeeper Pedro Gallese.

Crépeau came to Canada's rescue in stoppage time by twice denying efforts from substitute Paolo Guerrero as the North American side held on to seal their first-ever Copa America win and a first victory over a South American opponent since beating Colombia in the 2000 Concacaf Gold Cup final.

It was also a first win for head coach Jesse Marsch since he took over the Canada job in May.

"We were too naive in the first half, but played more direct in the second half," Canada's Stephen Eustaquio told TSN.
