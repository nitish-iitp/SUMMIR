An assistant referee keeled over and fainted in the first half of Peru's Copa América Group A match against Canada, being played in hot and humid conditions at Children's Mercy Park in Kansas City on Tuesday.

Humberto Panjoj collapsed during stoppage time in the first half, with Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau attracting the attention of medical staff.

The Guatemalan official was treated on the sidelines and briefly got back on his feet before being taken off on a stretcher.
