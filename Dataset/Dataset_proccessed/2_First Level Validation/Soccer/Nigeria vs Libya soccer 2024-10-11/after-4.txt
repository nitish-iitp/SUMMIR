“If dem bin travel for buses wey no get air-conditioner (AC) NFF hand no dey inside becos dem bin hire dia own buses. We bin provide security for dem, with men and vehicles for front and behind dia buses, so dia complaints and threats no dey shake us.” im conclude.

Di Libya Football Federation (LFF) don respond to claims say dem hold Nigeria national team hostage in di name of flight delay and diversion of flights.

"We dey deeply concerned about di recent reports wey surround di diversion of di Nigerian national team flight ahead of di Africa Cup of Nations qualifier for Libya.

"While we regret any inconvenience e don cause, e dey essential to note say such incidents fit occur due to routine air traffic control protocols, security checks, or logistical challenges wey dey affect international air travel."

"Dis na standard procedures for airports worldwide, and delays or rerouting (to divert), even though e dey unfortunate, na common tin."

"We get beta respect for our Nigerian counterparts and wan reassure dem say di diversion of dia flight no dey intentional."

Di statement add say, Nigeria no get any reason to accuse di Libyan security teams or di Libyan Football Federation say dem plan dis incident sake of say e no dey in line wit dia values and principles.

"We firmly reject any claims wey suggest foul play or sabotage for dis situation.

"E dey important to highlight say just last week, our own national team bin face significant challenges wen we land Nigeria for di third match of di Africa Cup of Nations qualification."

"Despite di difficulties we face, we no make public accusations or question di integrity of di Nigerian authorities. Football dey unite nations, and we dey committed to uphold di spirit of fairness and mutual respect both on and off di field."

Di LFF add say for Libya, dia pride na to take care and welcome pipo.

To treat all visiting teams, including our African brothers and oda international delegations, wit di respect and dignity wey dem deserve na our priority.
