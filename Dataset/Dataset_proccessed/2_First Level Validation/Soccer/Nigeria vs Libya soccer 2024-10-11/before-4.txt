Preview: Nigeria vs. Libya - prediction, team news, lineups

Nigeria will host Libya in a 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium in Uyo on Friday evening.

The Super Eagles will be aiming to extend their unbeaten start to the AFCON qualifiers, while the visitors are still seeking their first win of the qualifying campaign.

Nigeria followed up a 3-0 victory over Benin Republic in their opening match of the AFCON qualifiers with a goalless draw away at Rwanda a couple of days later.

The Super Eagles top Group D with four points and are the only team yet to concede a goal in the group, and a double header victory over Libya will see them move clear and edge closer to securing qualification.

This will be the fifth meeting between Nigeria and Libya, with the Super Eagles winning all four previous encounters, including two games in the AFCON qualifiers back in 2018.

Augustine Eguavoen, who was appointed on an interim basis to lead the team, has retained his position and has been tasked with guiding Nigeria to the 2025 AFCON in Morocco.

Nigeria finished as runners-up at the last AFCON edition and have lost just one of their last 14 AFCON qualifying matches – a run they will hope to extend on Saturday.

Libya were held to a 1-1 draw by Rwanda in their opening match of the AFCON qualifiers before losing 2-1 to Benin in their second match.

The Mediterranean Knights took the lead in the ninth minute from the spot via Faisal Al Badri, but a 12-minute spell in the second half saw them concede two goals that cost them the game.

Head coach Milutin Sredojevic will hope his side picks up valuable points against Nigeria as they look to end their 12-year AFCON absence.

Libya's last appearance in the continental showpiece came back in 2012, but they are currently bottom of Group D with one point and will have to quickly turn things around if they are to end this run.

Nigeria will enter this match without Galatasaray's new striker Victor Osimhen and defender Olisah Ndah, who plays his trade with Orlando Pirates in South Africa.

Sevilla's Chidera Ejuke returns to the team after several years away, while Bright-Osayi Samuel returns after missing out last month due to an injury.

Ademola Lookman will be the man to watch for the hosts, having scored a brace in their last home match against Benin.

Libya will be without Ahli Tripoli club defender Ahmed Al-Tarbi, Al-Nasr club's Mohammed Al-Tabbal and Ali Yousse of African Club of Tunisia, due to injuries.

The Mediterranean Knights' attack is expected to be led by Ahmed Kraouaa, who is yet to open his scoring account in the AFCON qualifiers.


Nigeria possible starting lineup:
Nwabali; Ekong, Ajayi, Bassey; Aina, Ndidi, Onyedika, Onyemaechi; Lookman, Boniface, Chukwueze

Libya possible starting lineup:
Al Wuhayshi; Elkouri, Yusuf, Erteiba, Al Mabrouk; Al Badri, Al Shreimy; Salama, Al Khoja, Al Gleib; Krawaa



We say: Nigeria 2-0 Libya

Nigeria appear to have found their footing under interim manager Eguaveon, which is a concerning development for most opponents in Africa, as the Super Eagles possess a wealth of talent in their ranks. We anticipate a victory for the hosts against a Libya side lacking confidence.
