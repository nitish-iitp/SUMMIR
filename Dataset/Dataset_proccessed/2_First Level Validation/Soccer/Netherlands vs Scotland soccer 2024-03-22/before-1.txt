Scotland step up their preparations for Euro 2024 on Friday evening as they face the Netherlands at the Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam.

Steve Clarke's side booked their place at this summer's tournament by beating out Norway and Erling Haaland to finish second behind Spain in Group A.

It was a qualifying campaign that is likely to live long in the memory, with Scott McTominay scoring seven times in eight games and a famous victory over the Spanish last year, but they'll be determined to follow it up in Germany after failing to get past the group stages at Euro 2020.

Watch Netherlands v Scotland on Viaplay Sports 1

Travelling to face the Netherlands, who finished second only to France in their qualifying group and are hardly short on star power, will be a good test of where the Scots are right now.

They wrap up the international break at home to Northern Ireland next week but a result against the Dutch, who are the joint-sixth favourites to win Euro 2024, would really show the rest of Europe that they mean business.
