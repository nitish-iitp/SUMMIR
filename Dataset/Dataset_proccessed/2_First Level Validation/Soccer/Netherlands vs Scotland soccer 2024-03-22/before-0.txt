NETHERLANDS V SCOTLAND - FRIENDLY MATCH PREVIEW

The famous Tartan Army are on the road to Germany - but there are still some games to go before the tournament.

For the Scotland boys the first hurdle is a glamour friendly with the Netherlands in Amsterdam - which could be an early sign if Steve Clarke is the man to take us where no manager ever has before at Euro 2024 and reach the knockout round. He's been clear the key to constant improvement is testing ourselves against the very best - and they don't come much tougher than Ronald Koeman's Dutch side that are bursting with talent.
