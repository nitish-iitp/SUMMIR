Slovakia take on Wales in a friendly on Sunday

Slovakia will welcome Wales to Štadión Antona Malatinského in a friendly on Sunday. The hosts will head to Germany after this match to continue their UEFA Euro 2024 preparations while the visitors will conclude their ongoing international window after this match, as they have not qualified for the competition.

The hosts played San Marino in a friendly on Tuesday in Austria and registered a 4-0 win. Tomáš Rigo, Tomáš Suslov, and Lukáš Haraslín scored in the first half while David Strelec added the fourth goal in the 58th minute.

The visitors played Gibraltar in a friendly earlier this week and were held to a goalless draw. Key players including Wayne Hennessey and Aaron Ramsey did not make it to the final squad, which impacted their performance.

Slovakia vs Wales Prediction

Sokoli registered their first win of the year in their friendly meeting against San Marino and will look to sign off with a win before heading to the UEFA Euro 2024. Head coach Francesco Calzona has named his final 26-man squad and might opt to rest key players here.

The Dragons have drawn four of their last five games in all competitions, failing to score in two games in that period. They have just one win in their last nine away games and are likely to struggle for form.

There's nothing much at stake for either side in this match and both managers are expected to experiment with their squads here. Nonetheless, considering the visitors' poor form, the hosts are expected to eke out a narrow win.
