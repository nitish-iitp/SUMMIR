Slovakia will finalise their Euro 2024 preparations when they welcome Wales to Trnava for Sunday's friendly encounter.

Meanwhile, the visitors will be looking to produce a positive response after being held to a goalless draw by lowly-ranked Gibraltar on Thursday.

Slovakia are set to make their third consecutive European Championship appearance after successfully negotiating their way through qualifying.

The Falcons finished in second spot in Group J after winning seven, drawing one and losing just two of their 10 matches.

After wrapping up their qualifying campaign in November, Slovakia were unable to win either of their two friendlies in the March international window, losing 2-0 to Austria before playing out a 1-1 draw against Norway.

They ultimately returned to winning ways in Wednesday's clash with San Marino, claiming a commanding 4-0 win over FIFA's lowest-ranked side thanks to goals from Tomas Rigo, Tomas Suslov, Lukas Haraslin and David Strelec.

Although they will face a tougher test on Sunday, the Falcons will be targeting another victory as they look to carry momentum into their Euro 2024 group against Belgium, Ukraine and Romania.

In contrast to their hosts, Wales do not have a major tournament to look forward to after their Euro 2024 hopes ended in a penalty-shootout defeat in March's playoff final against Poland.

Wales experienced a disappointing return to action as an inexperienced side failed to find a way past a stubborn Gibraltar backline on Thursday.

The Dragons were ultimately left a little embarrassed by the goalless draw which represented the first time that Gibraltar had avoided defeat since beating Andorra in November 2022.

As a result of the stalemate, Wales have now seen four of their last five matches finish all square after regulation time.

While wins have proven to be hard to come by, Wales have put together a nine-game unbeaten run since losing to Turkey in June 2023.

They will fancy their chances of continuing that run, having avoided defeat in each of their previous four games against Slovakia, including a 1-1 draw in the most recent meeting in October 2019.

Wales are without defenders Connor Roberts and Joe Rodon after the pair withdrew from the squad ahead of the draw with Gibraltar.

There are several other key names missing from the squad including Wayne Hennessey, Ben Davies, Aaron Ramsey and Harry Wilson.

Page is expected to make several changes to Thursday's lineup, with Danny Ward, Jordan James, Dan James and Brennan Johnson among those who may come into the starting XI.

As for Slovakia, Calzona could be tempted to make a few changes to the side that beat San Marino as he looks to strike a balance between giving his players valuable game time and adequate rest ahead of the finals in Germany.

Newcastle United goalkeeper Martin Dubravka is set to replace Marek Rodak, while there could be spots in the backline for Adam Obert and David Hancko.

Stanislav Lobotka, Ondrej Duda, Juraj Kucka and Robert Bozenik are also likely to start in Slovakia's final outing before Euro 2024.


Slovakia possible starting lineup:
Ward; Low, Cabango, Ampadu; Stevens, J James, Sheehan, Dasilva; Johnson, D James, Moore

Wales possible starting lineup:
Dubravka; Pekarik, Skriniar, Obert, Hancko; Duda, Lobotka, Kucka; Suslov, Haraslin, Bozenik



We say: Slovakia 1-1 Wales

Slovakia will be hoping to claim a confidence-boosting victory in their final outing ahead of Euro 2024, but we think the hosts may have to be content with a draw when they face a Wales side that has avoided defeat in their previous nine matches.
