Getty Images

I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there are two more games at Euro 2024 as we are all getting used to these three-game days.

Slovenia and Serbia's Group C rivals England and Denmark are in action next — kick-off in Frankfurt is coming in a little over half an hour.

You can follow our live coverage of England vs Denmark here.

And then later (at 8pm BST), it is Spain vs Italy in Group B.

Unbridled late drama at Euro 2024

Getty Images

Another late goal at Euro 2024 and the sixth scored in stoppage time across just 16 matches.

For reference, there were only five stoppage-time goals scored in the entirety of Euro 2020.

Player of the Match: Zan Karnicnik

It was Karnicnik who scored the goal that almost gave Slovenia a famous win in Munich.

Despite the late equaliser, the 29-year-old is the recipient of UEFA's Player of the Match award and he looks chuffed with it.

Jovic and Serbia have lift off at Euro 2024

Getty Images

Mitrovic missed a host of chances, Vlahovic was substituted after hardly having a kick, so it was up to Luka Jovic to the rescue the game off the bench.

And that is exactly what he did in the most dramatic of circumstances.

How does that late equaliser leave Group C?

UEFA

As I mentioned, a point will still be seen as a disappointment for Serbia but it keeps their hopes of progression alive.

A draw is a good result for England who will guarantee top spot if they beat Denmark in just under an hour's time.

All to play for beneath them in the group...

Jovic keeps Serbia alive... just

Defeat for Serbia here would have made it impossible for them to finish in the top two places in Group C.

Although they would have been able to make the knockouts as a third-place qualifier, they would have been staring elimination in the face — and they still are a bit.

But they are off the mark at Euro 2024 and victory against Denmark on Tuesday will likely send them through.

Another brilliant ending at Euro 2024!

Getty Images

What is with this tournament and chaotic endings?

Klaus Gjasula broke the record for the latest equaliser in European Championship history when he scored Albania's second goal against Croatia yesterday, but that lasted almost exactly 24 hours.

A massive contribution from Luka Jovic after taking the armband from Tadic when he entered the action in the 64th minute.

Heartbreak for Slovenia; ecstacy for Serbia!

FT Slovenia 1-1 Serbia

The quality in the final third had not been there for Serbia in this second half, until now.

They earned a corner in the final few seconds and they made it count. The delivery into the box was brilliant from Ilic and Jovic — who was being pushed and pulled in the penalty area — somehow directed a superb header into the bottom.

A huge goal with the very last touch of the ball in Munich.

Gacinovic now shown a yellow card

90+4' Slovenia 1-0 Serbia

The Serbian frustration is clear on the pitch and in the stands.

On the pitch, Gacinovic shoves Janza to the ground and is shown a yellow card. Meanwhile, a shower of plastic cups rains down from the end of the stadium housing the Serbian fans.

Jovic attempts an unsuccessful overhead kick

90+2' Slovenia 1-0 Serbia

Serbia are desperate and their latest cross into the penalty area was a yard behind Jovic — just booked for some off-the-ball handbags — who reacts by attempting the most speculative of all overhead kicks.

But he hardly made any contact and actually caught Karnicnik who took the opportunity to waste some time.

Those Slovenia defenders have five more minutes to defend their 1-0 lead.

Meanwhile, they have made a change: David Brekalo is on for Elsnik, who was superb.

Slovenia defending resolutely

90' Slovenia 1-0 Serbia

When talking about Serbia being poor in front of goal, you have to praise the Slovenia defence, led by goalkeeper Oblak.

Their commitment to defending their goal like their lives depend on it has been excellent and they will be full value for their victory if they can hang on.

Serbia far too wasteful in front of goal

88' Slovenia 1-0 Serbia

Serbia have been really poor in the final third. Their overall play has improved but they have either lacked composure in front of goal — notably Mitrovic who has missed six opportunities this afternoon — or with the final pass.

Since the substitution of Tadic, and with the clock ticking, they have lacked quality and a cool head when it matters.

Slovenian fans willing their team over the line

86' Slovenia 1-0 Serbia

Slovenia's fans have been so loud.

Granted, I'm towards the end closest to them, but they have a properly organised ultra section right behind the goal — they have a drummer and a capo, and those two have been leading the rest through chants which have not stopped since the game began. It's very German actually.

Oblak tips Birmancevic's free kick wide

85' Slovenia 1-0 Serbia

And the other substitute, Birmancevic, takes aim for Oblak's far corner.

It was from a free kick out on the left wing and curled dangerously towards the top corner. Oblak, deciding to take no chances, turned it behind for a corner.

Slovenia under increasing pressure now.

Samardzic shoots wide after purposeful run

83' Slovenia 1-0 Serbia

And Samardzic is straight into the action.

He took on one, two and three Slovenia midfielders with the intention of shooting clearly in his mind the whole time. He was finally able to work the space for a shot, but his angle had narrowed and his low effort rolled wide of the bottom corner.

Final two changes for Serbia

82' Slovenia 1-0 Serbia

A last roll of the dice for Serbia as they make their two final changes.

Veljko Birmancevic and Lazar Samardzic are on for Zivkovic and captain Tadic.

Karnicnik shoots narrowly wide from distance

79' Slovenia 1-0 Serbia

Having scored the opener, Karnicnik fancied his chances again.

Afforded a yard of space 25 yards from goal on the right-hand side, the Slovenia right-back took aim for the bottom corner. The effort left Rajkovic scrambling across his goal line, but the ball rolled a yard wide of the far post and behind for a goal kick.
