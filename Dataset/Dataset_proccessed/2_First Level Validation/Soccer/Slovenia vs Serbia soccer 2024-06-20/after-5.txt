SLOVENIA 1-1 SERBIA - SERBIA STAY ALIVE AFTER LUKA JOVIC SCORES LAST-SECOND EQUALISER AGAINST SLOVENIA
BYWILL CONROY

UPDATED 20/06/2024 AT 17:44 GMT

Serbia are still alive at Euro 2024 after AC Milan striker Luka Jovic scored a dramatic last-minute equaliser for his team against Slovenia to earn what could be a crucial point. Slovenia had taken the lead through Zan Karnicnik in the second half as Serbia looked destined for a second defeat. But in the last minute Jovic headed home an equaliser for Serbia.

Luka Jovic's late equaliser snatched a point for Serbia in their Euro 2024 Group C clash as they came from behind to draw 1-1 with Slovenia in Munich.
Zan Karnicnik had opened the scoring for Slovenia midway through the second period as he arrived at the back post to tuck home and round off an excellent team move.

Matjaz Kek's side looked like they were going to cling on for a crucial three points but Luka Jovic's remarkable header from a corner in the 96th minute equalised for Serbia in the final action of the game.

It was another thrilling contest with both sides hitting the woodwork throughout the match and playing pulsating end-to-end football.
This result now leaves Slovenia on two points and Serbia just one point behind them as they head into their final group games where they will face England and Denmark respectively.
Slovenia came closest to breaking the deadlock in the opening period as Timi Max Elsnik's thunderous effort from just outside the box struck the right post.
Aleksandar Mitrovic went closest for Serbia in the first half but it was shortly after the break when the former Fulham man found himself with a clear opening as Dusan Tadic played him in on goal, but Jan Oblak did excellently to smother his chipped effort.
It was in the 69th minute when Slovenia eventually broke the deadlock as right-back Karnicnik's half-volleyed effort at the back post finished the move he started with a driving run from deep.
Dragan Stojkovic's side nearly found an instant equaliser as Mitrovic rattled the crossbar with an effort from close range but they left it until the 96th minute to finally break Slovenia down through Jovic's superb header directed into the bottom left corner.
The former Real Madrid man's goal means Serbia can still finish in the top two of the group with a positive result against Denmark while Slovenia will now need a good result against England after being on the brink of qualification.

TALKING POINT - JOVIC BREAKS SLOVENIAN HEARTS
Coming into this fixture, Jovic was perhaps an unlikely source of Serbia's opening goal of Euro 2024 given the talent they possess up front.
But it was a frustrating afternoon for Mitrovic who hit the woodwork, missed from close range and was denied well by Oblak.
As for Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic, he had a couple of sighters in the opening period but it was largely a performance spent on the periphery of proceedings.
For Jovic, whose career has not gone the way it was once expected when he was snapped up by Madrid, he will perhaps be hoping for a place in the starting XI against Denmark after effectively keeping Serbia's hopes of qualification alive.
With Stojkovic once again opting for two centre forwards, the Serbia manager may consider his options ahead of Tuesday's clash.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - ZAN KARNICNIK (SLOVENIA)
Despite Jovic's heroics, Karnicnik's goal, which he started and finished, was the cherry on top of a wonderful performance. The right-back was resolute in his defending and crucially intervened moments after breaking the deadlock to divert Mitrovic's goal-bound effort onto the crossbar. His marauding run drew a foul and yellow card for Filip Mladenovic who was withdrawn at half-time.

49' - SERBIA'S BEST CHANCE: Mitrovic plays an excellent one-two with Tadic who slips the big striker in on goal but as he looks to chip it over the onrushing Oblak, the Slovenian keeper saves well
69' - GOAL! SLOVENIA 1-0 SERBIA (Karnicnik): Karnicnik switches the ball out to Elsnik on the left hand-side who delivers the cross to the back post where the right-back is arriving to strike home on the half-volley.
72' - MITROVIC HITS THE BAR: Mitrovic holds off Karnicnik to meet the ball on the half-volley but the Slovenian defender gets the smallest of touches on it to send it crashing onto the crossbar.
