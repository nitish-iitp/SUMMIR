Japan are hot favourites to win this AFC Asian Cup tie.

Japan will begin their 2023 AFC Asian Cup campaign with a fixture against Vietnam on 14 January 2024 at the Al-Thumama Stadium. The four-time winners of the AFC Asian Cup are looking to end a wait of 13 years and finally lift the trophy after finishing as runners-up in the previous edition.

Vietnam are a huge underdog heading into the fixture and will hope to cause a major upset in their opening game of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. There is a gap of 77 places in terms of FIFA rankings between Japan and Vietnam, which shows how the odds are in favour of the Samurai Blue.

Japan are an extremely entertaining attacking team that has sensational players who can hurt any opposition. One of the players to watch out for is Takefusa Kubo. The Real Sociedad midfielder has scored six times and provided four assists at the club level already this season. He often plays in the No.10 role for the Samurai Blue and creates opportunities aplenty for his teammates. His speed and dribbling quality also make him a tricky operator to contain. Vietnam defenders would ideally like to keep him silent in the upcoming fixture.
