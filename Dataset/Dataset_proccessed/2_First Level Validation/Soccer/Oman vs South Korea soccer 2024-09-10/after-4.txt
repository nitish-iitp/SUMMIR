MUSCAT: It was another heartbreak for Oman as they went down fighting to South Korea 3-1 in their Group B third round match of Asian Qualifiers-Road to 2026 at the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex on Tuesday evening. 

Days after narrowly losing to Iraq in Basra [1-0], the Red Warriors put up another brave display in front of their home fans but the experienced South Koreans managed to eke out a thrilling win with two late goals coming through Son Heung-Min and Joo Min-Kyu.

The scoreline certainly doesn't reflect the gallant performance of the hosts.

Earlier, Oman, coached by Jaroslav Silhavy rallied from an early goal to find the equaliser minutes before halftime.

The visitors drew first blood in the 10th minute when Hwang Hee-Chan beat Oman custodian Ibrahim Al Mukhaini. 

Minutes before interval, Oman drew parity as under pressure Jung Seung-Hyun slotted an own goal, deflecting a shot from Ahmed Al Khamisi.

Spurred by the equaliser, the hosts went for the elusive winner only to be thwarted by Korean defenders.

South Korea then managed to pierce the hosts defense twice late into the match as Red Warriors looked for equaliser.

First it was experienced Son finding the target in the 82nd minute and then Joo made it 3-1 in the dying minutes of the injury time.

The win meant South Korea picked their first full three points in the group after their earlier opening match draw against Palestine while Oman are yet to open their account.
