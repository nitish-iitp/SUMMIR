Oman and South Korea will both be looking for their first wins in the third round of AFC qualification for the 2026 World Cup when they lock horns on Tuesday.

South Korea opened their Group B campaign with a goalless draw against Palestine, while Oman suffered a 1-0 defeat to Iraq, with Aymen Hussein netting the only goal of the contest.

Oman have never competed in the finals of a World Cup, but they enjoyed their best qualification campaign for the 2022 competition, winning 10 of their 18 matches.

Jaroslav Silhavy's side finished top of Group D in the second round, picking up 13 points from their six matches courtesy of a record of four wins, one draw and one defeat.

However, Oman could not make a winning start to Group B, with Aymen Hussein's goal seeing them suffer a 1-0 defeat to Iraq, so there is pressure on the home side to pick up a positive result in this match.

Oman have tackled South Korea on six previous occasions, losing five of those matches, with their only victory coming in the Asian Cup back in October 2003.

South Korea have competed in the finals of 11 World Cups, including the last six, with their best-ever finish coming in 2002, when they secured fourth.

In 2022, the national side reached the round of 16, losing 4-1 to Brazil, and they will be expecting to be present in the finals of the 2026 competition.

Hong Myung-bo's side were held to a goalless draw by Palestine in their first match in Group B last time out, but they had been on a three-game winning run ahead of that clash, including a 7-0 success over Singapore.

South Korea finished top of Group C in the second round of qualification, claiming 16 points from their six matches courtesy of a record of five wins and one draw.

Myung-bo, who played 137 times for South Korea during his playing career, is in charge of the national team for the second time, having previously been at the helm between 2013 and 2014.

Oman will be without the services of Arshad Al Alawi for Tuesday's contest, as the midfielder was sent off in the latter stages of the team's 1-0 defeat to Iraq last time out.

No injury problems have been reported, though, so it is expected to be close to the same XI for this game, with Zahir Al Aghbari potentially the only introduction.

As for South Korea, the legendary Son Heung-min will again captain the side, with the Tottenham Hotspur attacker preparing to represent his country for the 129th time.

Joo Min-kyu featured in the final third of the field against Palestine, and he is set to retain his spot for this match, with the 34-year-old bidding to add to his one international goal.

Bayern Munich's Kim Min-jae will also be a notable inclusion for South Korea in a defensive area, while Feyenoord's Hwang In-beom is set to feature in the middle of midfield.


Oman possible starting lineup:
Al Mukhaini; Aziz Khalfan, Al Khamis, Al Musalami, Al Busaidi; Al Saadi, Al Aghbari; Al Sabha, Al Yahmadi, Al Mushaifri; Al Ghafri

South Korea possible starting lineup:
Hyeon-woo; Mun-ki, Min-jae, Young-gwon, Young-woo; In-beom, Woo-young; Kang-in, Jae-sung, Heung-min; Min-kyu



We say: Oman 0-2 South Korea

South Korea could not find a route past Palestine last time out, but we are expecting them to claim all three points on Tuesday in order to move onto four points from their two games in the section.
