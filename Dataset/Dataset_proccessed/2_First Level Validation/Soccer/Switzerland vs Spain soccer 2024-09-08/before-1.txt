SWITZERLAND PREVIEW: FINDING THE REAL SWISS

It was an impressive UEFA EURO 2024 campaign for Switzerland as they held Germany to a draw, knocked reigning champions Italy out in the Round of 16 before losing on penalties to eventual runners’ up England in the quarter-finals.

The Swiss have a strong squad but there does appear to be a lack of balance and after going down to nine-men against Denmark the other day, late goals from Patrick Dorgu and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg separated the two sides.

SPAIN PREVIEW: THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS

Under the management of Luis de la Fuente, who took charge after Spain’s Round of 16 exit to Morocco on penalties at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Spain have already won two trophies with the 2022/23 UEFA Nations League as well as UEFA EURO 2024.

La Roja were exceptional throughout that tournament this summer with the star attractions being Nico Williams and Lamine Yamal. Both starlets started against Serbia the other day but Spain couldn’t break a depleted Serbia side down.

SWITZERLAND TEAM NEWS: SUSPENSION ISSUES

As mentioned, Hakan Yakin will have to deal with a couple of suspensions for this one after defender Nico Elvedi and captain Granit Xhaka were both sent off in the second-half of their 2-0 defeat against Denmark.

PREDICTED XI (3-4-3): Kobel; Omeragic, Akanji, Rodriguez; Widmer, Freuler, Zakaria, Aebischer; Rieder, Embolo, Vargas

UNAVAILABLE: Elvedi (Suspended), Xhaka (Suspended)

SPAIN TEAM NEWS: STILL NO RODRI

Despite the inclusion of Manchester City midfielder Rodri in the Spain squad for this week, he has still not played in the Premier League this season and was left out against Serbia so is expected to be left out once again.

PREDICTED XI (4-2-3-1): David Raya; Dani Carvajal, Le Normand, Laporte, Cucurella; Martin Zubimendi, Fabian Ruiz; Lamine Yamal, Dani Olmo, Nico Williams; Ayoze Perez

SWITZERLAND VS SPAIN PREDICTION

Switzerland have often been a team that keep things tight and then eventually suffocate the opposition but their performance against Italy at UEFA EURO 2024 suggested there was a lot more to them. However, without Granit Xhaka in particular, there is a chance they not only get overrun in midfield but struggle to see any of the ball against a smart and efficient Spanish side that are firm favourites for this one.
