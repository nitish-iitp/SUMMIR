Spain lineup vs. Switzerland: Predicted XI for Nations League contest

Spain head coach Luis de la Fuente is expected to introduce Pedri into his starting side for Sunday's UEFA Nations League fixture against Switzerland.

Pedri, 21, missed the latter stages of Euro 2024 with a knee injury, but he was fit for the start of Barcelona's 2024-25 La Liga campaign.

The midfielder was withdrawn just past the hour of Barcelona's 7-0 win over Real Valladolid last weekend due to a slight knock, and he was not in the Spain XI for Thursday's clash against Serbia.

Pedri was introduced in the 76th minute of what proved to be a goalless draw, though, and he is now likely to come into the XI for La Roja's second match of the 2024-25 competition.

The midfielder could take the place of Ayoze Perez, while Joselu may come in at centre-forward, as Dani Olmo is a major doubt due to a knock which he suffered against Serbia.

There could also be a change at left-back against Switzerland, with Alejandro Grimaldo likely to be introduced in place of Marc Cucurella, with that change occurring early in the second half against Serbia.

Unai Simon is not in the squad due to injury, which should mean another start between the sticks for David Raya.

Rodri is in the squad and could be involved, although the 28-year-old is unlikely to start, having not played a single minute of football for Manchester City during the 2024-25 campaign.

Spain possible starting lineup: Raya; Carvajal, Le Normand, Laporte, Grimaldo; Pedri, Zubimendi, Ruiz; Yamal, Joselu, N Williams
