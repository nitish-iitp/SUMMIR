Both these teams will be aiming to return to winning ways.

Switzerland will be disappointed with how they lost their last match against Denmark. They even lost two experienced players. Granit Xhaka and Nico Elvedi were sent off following a red card. 

Murat Yakin will have a lot of decisions to make as they take on the champions of Europe in their next match. A loss here can make things difficult for them. They currently occupy the bottom spot in League A Group 4 after match day 1. 

Meanwhile, Spain started their run in the competition with a goalless draw against Serbia. This is despite dominating the match with 74% possession and attempting a whopping 21 shots. However, La Roja lacked the finishing touch after failing to convert their chances. 

Nevertheless, Luis de la Fuente knows his side can do more as they take on a Swiss side that will be without several key players for this match. This match against Switzerland remains a crucial one as it will change the dynamics in the group with the next set of games taking place in October. 

Kick-Off:

Sunday, 8 September 2024 at 7:45 PM UK

Monday, 9 September at 12:15 AM IST

Location: Stade de Genève

Form:

⁠Switzerland (in all competitions): D-D-W-D-L

Spain (in all competitions): W-W-W-W-D

Players to Watch
Manuel Akanji (⁠Switzerland)

Manuel Akanji has emerged into a complete player under the guidance of Pep Guardiola who has managed to bring the best out of him. After guiding Manchester City to the Premier League title in the last game of the 2023-24 season, Akanji was rewarded with a starring role this new season. His ability to play out from the back and to make timely challenges has seen him turn into a leader for both his club and country.

Nico Williams (Spain)

Nico Williams has emerged as a future star after enduring an impressive 2023-24 season with his club and country in the Euro 2024. Williams was the star of the show for Spain in the Euro final, netting the opening goal with a fine strike. His contributions with Athletic Bilbao included eight goals and 16 assists which was among the best in the league. William’s breathtaking speed and dribbling skills make him a threat to the Swiss in this UEFA Nations League match. 

Match Facts
Switzerland are unbeaten in their last ten home games
Spain are unbeaten in their last 11 matches
Switzerland and Spain have not drawn any of their last three matches against each other
⁠Switzerland vs Spain: Betting tips and odds

Tip 2: Spain to win this game – 7/10 with bet365
Tip 3: Both the teams to score in this game– 1/1 with William HILL
Injury & Team News

Switzerland will be without the services of Nico Elvedi and Granit Xhaka after the pair received a red card against Denmark. Fabian Schar also misses out on this match after signalling his intention to build fitness for the new season with his club Newcastle United. Murat Yakin has some tough choices to make to replace them in this match. 

Meanwhile, Spain will miss the services of first-choice goalkeeper Unai Simon, Alvaro Morata, Mikel Merino, and recent setback Fermin Lopez through injuries. Luis de la Fuente will likely make a change up front after Ayoze Perez failed to make an impression against Serbia. 

Head to Head

Total Matches – 6

⁠Switzerland – 1

Spain – 2

Draws – 3

Predicted Lineup
⁠Switzerland predicted lineup (3-4-3):

Kobel (GK); Akanji, Wüthrich, Rodriguez; Widmer, Zakaria, Freuler, Aebischer; Vargas, Embolo, Rieder

Spain predicted lineup (4-2-3-1):

Raya (GK); Carvajal, Le Normand, Laporte, Cucurella; Rodri, Fabian; Yamal, Olmo, Williams; Perez

Match Prediction for ⁠Switzerland vs Spain

Switzerland raised plenty of eyebrows when they recorded a 2-1 away win over La Roja last time out in 2022 in the same phase of the Nations League. They will aim to repeat a similar outcome this time but will have to be at their best after Spain improved dramatically since the Euro 2024. We expect the visitors to secure a close win here with the home team missing several key players. 

Prediction: ⁠Switzerland 1-2 Spain
