UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE
SWITZERLAND 1-4 SPAIN - JOSELU, FABIAN RUIZ AND FERRAN TORRES FIRE 10-MAN ROJA TO NATIONS LEAGUE WIN
BYCIARAN BAYNES

UPDATED 10/09/2024 AT 10:20 GMT

After drawing 0-0 with Serbia in their UEFA Nations League opener, Euro 2024 winners Spain resumed normal service with victory at Switzerland on Sunday. Joselu set Luis de la Fuente's side on their way to three points with an early goal. Fabian Ruiz added a second on 13 minutes as Spain beat Switzerland in Geneva despite playing for 70 minutes with 10 men due to Robin Le Normand's red card.

Fabian Ruiz netted twice as Spain beat Switzerland 4-1 in the Nations League, despite playing 70 minutes with 10 men following Robin Le Normand's sending off.
The Euro 2024 winners came out in an explosive manner with Lamine Yamal playing key roles in both their early goals through Joselu's header and Ruiz following up Nico Williams' parried effort.

Switzerland were unlucky to be two down, with an earlier handball denying Becir Omeragic an equaliser between those strikes, but came back into the game when Le Normand was penalised for bringing down Breel Embolo when the striker was bearing down on goal.

The home side dominated much of the possession from this point onwards but threatened most from set pieces with Zeki Amdouni turning home a flicked-on corner before half-time and had the ball in the net again after the break - only for the goal to be disallowed due to Ruben Vargas' corner curling out of play.
As Switzerland grew more desperate to equalise they left holes at the back and substitute Ferran Torres first cut back for Ruiz to net his second in the 77nd minute before running onto Joselu's ball three minutes later and netting himself.
TALKING POINT - COULD THIS PAIR END UP THE BEST WINGERS COMBINATION EVER?
It is easily foreseeable to imagine Nico Williams and Lamine Yamal playing together for Spain for most of the next decade.
It is not as easy as you might think to come up with two great wingers in a side. I do not think you can count two in a front three so Ronaldo and Bale, nor Sadio Mane and Mo Salah, Lionel Messi and Neymar. I suppose the crux for qualification must be both players primarily creators rather than goalscorers.
'Robbery', the Bayern Munich pair of Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery are the gold standard, the key reason for FC Hollywood winning so much silverware at home and abroad during their 10 years of excellence in Bavaria.
Ryan Giggs and David Beckham played for almost as long at Old Trafford and won a similar number of trophies - though it might be argued Andrei Kanchelskis and a teenage Giggs were the most lethal just before the future England skipper made his bow. For a time Gento and Raymond Kopa played on either wing in Real Madrid's first golden era.
Internationally there are fewer examples. The most famous pair in history are probably Tom Finney and Stanley Matthews, but most often England selectors opted to play one or the other, rather than the two in combination.
Whether this Spanish generation can replicate the success of their predecessors, who won three successive major trophies, remains to be seen but Williams and Yamal make them a more exciting watch and may put their own stamp on football history as they attempt to do so.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - FABIAN RUIZ (SPAIN)
The PSG midfielder has been a one-in-10 match goalscorer through his career, but after scoring twice in Euro 2024 he showed a lethal touch to slam home chances in either half.
A classy midfielder who was under-appreciated before his pivotal role in Spain's victory in the summer, he is looking like the complete midfielder now. He was a key figure as his country defended their lead with a man down, then burst forward to score the goal which settled the match.
PLAYER RATINGS
Switzerland: Kobel 6; Omeragic 7, Wuthrich 6, Akanji 6, Rodriguez 5; Freuler 6, Zakaria 7, Aebischer 5, Vargas 7; Amdouni 7, Embolo 7.
Subs: Rieder 6, Sierro 6, Monteiro 6, Duah 6, Steffen 6.
Spain: Raya 6; Carvajal 6, Le Normand 4, Laporte 7, Alex Grimaldo 6; Rodri 6, Fabian Ruiz 9*; Pedri 7; Nico Williams 7, Lamine Yamal 8, Joselu 8.
Subs: Vivian 7, Torres 8, Zubimendi 6, Yeremy 6, Garcia 6.
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
4' GOAL! Switzerland 0-1 Spain (Joselu) A Yamal right-footed cross from the by-line picked out the striker who headed towards goal and, although it seemed a brilliant save from Kobel, the ball was ruled over the line.
7' GOAL! Switzerland (Omeragic) 1-1 Spain! A great run down the left wing from Embolo who crossed with the outside of his right foot for the late inclusion, full-back Omeragic, who tapped into the empty net at the back post.
9' GOAL DISALLOWED! A real disappointment as the goal is disallowed for a handball way back in the build up before the goal from Freuler.
13' GOAL! Switzerland 0-2 Spain (Ruiz) Yamal with a fine through-ball for Williams, he cut inside the defender but saw his effort blocked by Kobel, only for Ruiz to slam home the rebound.
20' LE NORMAND IS SENT OFF! Embolo got the wrong side of him and the Spanish centre back pulled him down. They are checking it but it seems unlikely there will be a reprieve.
25' OFF THE BAR! Amdouni with a fantastic strike which had Raya beaten but came back off the crossbar.
41' GOAL! Switzerland (Amdouni) 1-2 Spain! Embolo flicked on Vargas' corner and Amdouni turned home at the back post.
49' AMDOUNI HAS BALL IN THE NET! But it is ruled Vargas' corner went out of play first. Amdouni's fairly tame header was deflected into his own net by Vivian - but it counts for nothing.
77' GOAL! Switzerland 1-3 Spain (Ruiz) Spain with a sucker punch! Torres races down the right flank behind the Swiss defence and crosses low for Ruiz who sidefoots home for his second goal of the night.
80' GOAL! Switzerland 1-4 Spain (Torres) Once more Switzerland are caught cold on the break. A long ball from Joselu plays through Torres who runs through on goal then calmly guides the ball wide of Kobel.
