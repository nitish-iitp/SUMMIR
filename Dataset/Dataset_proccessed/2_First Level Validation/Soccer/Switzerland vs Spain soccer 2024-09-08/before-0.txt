The UEFA Nations League clash between Switzerland and Spain on September 8, 2024, promises to be a thrilling encounter as both teams look to bounce back from disappointing starts in the tournament. Switzerland’s recent performances have shown flashes of brilliance, particularly during their impressive run at Euro 2024, while Spain, fresh from their European Championship triumph, will aim to demonstrate their status as one of the continent’s elite teams. Given the strength of the Spanish side and Switzerland’s weakened squad, Spain enters the upcoming match as the favourite, according to the Switzerland vs Spain odds.

Switzerland Team News

After a strong showing at Euro 2024, where they reached the quarter-finals, Switzerland has struggled to find consistency in their recent games. Their opening Nations League match ended in a 2-0 defeat to Denmark, during which they faced significant challenges, including the dismissal of two players. As a result, Murat Yakin will approach the match without captain Granit Xhaka and defender Nico Elvedi, both of whom are suspended.

Despite these setbacks, Switzerland boasts a talented squad featuring players like goalkeeper Gregor Kobel and forward Breel Embolo, who have the potential to make a significant impact. The team has shown resilience, remaining unbeaten in their last nine games at Stade de Genève, with their last defeat occurring against Spain in 2022.

Spain Team News

Spain arrives in Geneva looking to recover from a frustrating goalless draw against Serbia in their opening Nations League match. This performance highlighted some issues, particularly in breaking down organised defences. The Spanish side will need to improve their finishing and creativity in the final third to secure a win against Switzerland.

The squad remains largely unchanged from their Euro-winning lineup, featuring young stars like Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams, who have been making headlines with their performances. With experienced players such as Álvaro Morata and Joselu also in the squad, Spain has the opportunity to challenge Switzerland's weakened defence more effectively than they did against Serbia.

Spain Handicap -1

Spain arrives in Geneva with a clear motivation, having looked frustrated in their match against Serbia, where they unsuccessfully tried to break down the Balkan defence. However, it is fair to acknowledge that La Furia Roja had its chances, and if not for poor finishing and an excellent performance from Predrag Rajković, the result could have been different. Switzerland, in its current configuration, will provide more space for Spanish attacking players, which could be detrimental, given how well Spanish wingers utilise space in the penalty area. This Switzerland vs Spain prediction comes at 2.44 at HeySpin.

HANDICAP
Spain -1

Total Goals Under 2.5

Switzerland will likely adopt a defensive approach in the upcoming match, given the absence of key figures in their squad. In this scenario, Spain is expected to dominate the game, attempting to break through Switzerland's defensive lines. The match against Serbia highlighted some of the team's issues, but de la Fuente is confident that the team will not repeat its mistakes against Switzerland. Such a scenario does not suggest many goals in the game, and recent matches between the two teams support this — only one match out of the last five had more than two goals scored. This outcome can be picked up at 1.76 at MrPlay.

Both Teams to Score — No

After a successful performance at Euro 2024, Switzerland seems to have lost its attacking edge. The team appeared lacklustre in their match against Denmark and created nothing in front of the Danish goal before the first red card. In their match against Spain, Switzerland will likely focus more on defence, hoping for occasional counter-attacks, mainly through Breel Embolo, who has yet to show his best form. At the same time, Spain could fall into the same trap as they did in their previous match. This Switzerland vs Spain tip comes at 1.80 at MrPlay.
