American Samoa will welcome Samoa to FFS Football Stadium in the OFC World Cup qualifiers on Friday. Can the hosts finally break the visitors’ jinx with a win?

American Samoa vs Samoa Preview

American Samoa have been struggling for form and it’s unclear if the team will show some improvement in the upcoming World Cup qualifiers. They have not won a match since September 2015 when they defeated Tonga and Cook Islands in the 2018 OFC World Cup qualifiers. Their best result since then has been a 1-1 draw against Tuvalu in the Pacific Games.

The Boys from the Territory will enter this meeting on the back of a five-game losing streak, in which they conceded 39 goals against five scored. They were whitewashed at home 10-0 in their last meeting with Samoa. The hosts last tasted victory at the FFS Football Stadium in September 2015 – their chances of victory are not very good.

Samoa will head into the game on the back of three consecutive defeats. They participated in the 2024 OFC Nations Cup but crashed out in the group stage without winning any match. However, they are hoping to kick off the World Cup qualifiers on a positive note by winning against American Samoa this weekend.

Both teams are competing in the first round of the qualifiers, alongside Tonga and Cook Islands. The winners of both matches will face off to determine the overall winner of the first round, with that nation advancing to the second round. The visitors are yet to lose to American Samoa in all competitions.
