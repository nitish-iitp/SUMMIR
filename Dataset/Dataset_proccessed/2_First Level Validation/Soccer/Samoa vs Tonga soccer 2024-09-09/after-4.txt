Kaleb De Groot-Green, Samoa's player to watch!

The Christchurch midfielder is one of the orchestrators of the attack and comes into this match after being the main reference in the Samoa national team's forward line. De Groot-Green arrives as one of the New Zealand team's recent signings and will look to contribute offensively to the team. During this season with the team he has played 15 games where he scored 10 goals and gave 2 assists. He is one of the few professional players that Samoa has and his role is fundamental for the team. The most important thing for him is to start having more regularity on the field and to fit in better with players like Faitalia Hamilton-Pama to form a lethal forward line.

Samoa, looking for the World Cup dream!

The Samoa team goes to the J.S. Blatter Football Complex, to face the Tonga team and continue its path within this phase of the OFC World Cup 2026 Qualifiers. They were part of the qualifiers prior to this cup, where they left American Samoa and the Cook Islands out undefeated with victories against both teams. The Samoa team has a good base of players led by Kaleb De Groot-Green, Faitalia Hamilton-Pama, Dauntae Mariner, Niko Steinmetz, Harry Chote and Andrew Stefano. The Samoa team is a majority representative of semi-professional players and only a few of them play professionally in the area. They are part of Group B along with Tonga, Fiji and Samoa, the team is not one of the favorites of the group but will seek to continue developing little by little to begin to show improvements in football in the region.

Ata Inia, Tonga's figure to follow!

The Chanthaburi winger has become one of the great leaders of the Tonga team and was a starter in all the matches in the process towards the Qatar 2022 World Cup. Now, after managing to be back with his national team, Inia is a candidate to be the maximum reference in the offense that Tonga needs and his contribution will be very important for the future and the search to continue improving with this group of players. He is one of the figures of his team and arrives with 14 goals scored in 30 games and being key for this subsidiary of the Thai team.

Tonga, World Cup hopes continue!

The Tongans come into this match as part of the OFC Qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup, where they are one of the teams that could make it to the grand final of the championship. The Tongans have a list with interesting players such as Ata Inia, DJ Tuamojeloa, Kamaliele Papani, Hermatolo Polovilim Semesi Otukolo and Vai Lutu. Tonga is not a powerhouse in the OFC zone and will seek to keep up the football pace, hoping to get into the fight for a place among the representatives of the zone for the next World Cup. They come after qualifying for the second round after eliminating the Cook Islands and, now, they will compete against Samoa for the last place for the World Cup qualifiers. The Tongans will seek to get into the OFC Qualifiers and fight to be closer than ever to a World Cup.
