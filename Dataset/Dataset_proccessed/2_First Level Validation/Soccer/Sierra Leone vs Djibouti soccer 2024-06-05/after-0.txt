Curtis Davies nets as Sierra Leone register first win
 June 5, 2024
 Alie Bittar @bittar32

Curtis Davies made history as the oldest international debutant to score for a national team in the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers. This happened after a tense 2-1 victory against Djibouti at Stade El Abdi on Wednesday night.

The Leone Stars started the brightest as they took the lead in the 12th minute, capitalizing on their early pressure with a goal scored by 39-year-old Curtis Davies, marking his competitive national team debut.

Following a defensive blunder by coach Amidu Karim’s side, Djibouti was awarded a penalty just after the half-hour mark when Emmanuel Samadia was handballed inside his penalty area. Gabriel Dadzie stepped up to take the penalty and successfully sent the goalkeeper the wrong way.

The game entered a scrappy period towards the end of the first half, with neither side creating clear goal-scoring chances.

In the 51st minute of the match, the Leone Stars increased their lead when Augustus Kargbo successfully found the back of the net.

Despite this, Djibouti persisted in their efforts to score a second goal, while Sierra Leone responded by making defensive substitutions in an attempt to control the game.

Sierra Leone managed to maintain their lead and achieved a much-needed 2-1 victory in Morocco, confidently navigating the remaining minutes of the game.

Sierra Leone: Kamara, Davies, Kabia, Kakay, Alusine Koroma, Samadia, Kaikai (D Kanu 67’), Bakayoko (A Conteh 67’), Bundu (Dumbuya 79’), Alhassan Koroma (Sillah 88’), Kargbo (Michael 79’)

Djibouti: Luyima, Farada, Siad, Abdi (Omar 72’), Hamadou, Mohamed, Elabeh (Elmi 90’), Aden (Ramadan Abillahi 73’), Akinbinu, Dadzie, Abdillahi

Sierra Leone managed to maintain their lead and achieved a much-needed 2-1 victory in Morocco, confidently navigating the remaining minutes of the game.
