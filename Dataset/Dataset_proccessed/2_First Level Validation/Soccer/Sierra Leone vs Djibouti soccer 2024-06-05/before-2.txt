Coach Karim speaks on Sierra Leone and Djibouti qualifier
 June 4, 2024
 Alie Bittar @bittar32

Sierra Leone’s head coach, Amidu Karim, is confident about his team’s chances as they gear up for the World Cup qualifier against Djibouti.

Karim’s 24-man team is currently in Morocco, undergoing intensive training and preparation for their crucial match on June 5th against Djibouti. This match holds immense significance as it is a crucial step in their journey to qualify for the FIFA World Cup 2026.

Their ambition is to secure a spot in this prestigious global tournament, and they are leaving no stone unturned in their efforts to achieve this goal.

Karim has opted for consistency by maintaining the same squad for the upcoming matches against Djibouti and Burkina Faso. He is relying on the experience of players like Steven Caulker and Curtis Davies to guide the younger members of the team.

Expressing his optimism, Karim stated, “I am confident that we will achieve the desired results. The players are highly motivated and ready to give their best on the field.”

“We need their experience and expertise in guiding the younger players because they have gone through that stage at some point in their career.”

He emphasized the importance of winning for qualification and highlighted the players’ readiness to deliver their best performance.

The coach also noted that many players have had a successful season with their respective clubs, which adds to the team’s strength from a technical standpoint.

In the latest standings, Egypt is leading Group A, followed by Burkina Faso and Guinea-Bissau. Both Sierra Leone and Ethiopia have managed to secure one point each. Regrettably, Djibouti hasn’t yet earned any points after losing their first two games.

Group A – Djibouti is ranked 192, 66 places below the Leone Stars. After losing their first two Group A matches, Djibouti is currently at the bottom of the standings.

They suffered a 6-1 defeat to Egypt and a 1-0 home loss to Guinea-Bissau in November 2023.

In their preliminary AFCON qualifier against Liberia in March, Lone Star captain Murphy Dorley scored one of two first-half goals as the Lone Stars defeated hosts Djibouti 2-0 in the opening leg in Marrakech.

Mohammed Sangare opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 23rd minute, followed by Dorley calmly converting Sebastian Teclar’s cross 12 minutes later. The match ended in a goalless draw in Liberia, leading to their elimination.
