How Denmark could line up against Serbia

Denmark manager Kasper Hjulmand is expecting to have all 26 players at his disposal for Tuesday's Euro 2024 Group C finale against Serbia at the Allianz Arena.

The Scandinavian side sit second in the section with two points to their name and will be guaranteed a last-16 place - and potentially top spot - if they win, while a draw will also suffice if Slovenia lose to England.

Twenty-five of Hjulmand's troops were available for the recent 1-1 draw with England, which midfielder Thomas Delaney was unavailable for due to illness, but he should be part of the squad in Munich.

However, Delaney will no doubt take his seat on the bench, as Morten Hjulmand and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg excelled against England; the former produced a 25-yard stunner while the Tottenham Hotspur man ran the show throughout the 90 minutes.

As a result, the duo will reprise their roles behind Christian Eriksen, who is set to make an unrivalled 133rd appearance for the Danish men's team, although centre-back Simon Kjaer - who is yet to appear at the Euros so far - is currently level with him on 132.

Eriksen should act as the supplier for Rasmus Hojlund and Jonas Wind once more, but as Victor Kristiansen struggled against Bukayo Saka all afternoon on June 20, Joakim Maehle could now start on the left as Alexander Bah takes up right wing-back duties.

Jannik Vestergaard is one of a handful of players one yellow card away from a ban, but the Leicester City man should be in no danger of losing his spot alongside Joachim Andersen and Andreas Christensen in front of Kasper Schmeichel.

Denmark possible starting lineup:
Schmeichel; Andersen, Christensen, Vestergaard; Bah, Hojbjerg, Hjulmand, Maehle; Eriksen; Hojlund, Wind
