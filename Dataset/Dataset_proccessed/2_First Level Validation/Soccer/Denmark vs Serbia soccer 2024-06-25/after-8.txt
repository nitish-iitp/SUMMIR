TELL ME MORE

The Danes were the most imposing team for most of the game and they thought they had taken the lead just after 20 minutes when Jonas Wind knocked a corner into the net. However, it was flagged by VAR as the ball had gone out of play before even finding Wind, while the Denmark star was also in a grapple with the Serbia goalkeeper.

For the first 70 minutes, Denmark had had 10 shots to Serbia's zero, but it was the latter who thought they had taken the lead when they found the net in the second-half through a Joachim Andersen own goal, but it too was disallowed.

Denmark were close next, though, when Jannik Vestergaard got a lot of power behind a header as he met a corner but it was straight at the goalkeeper. Serbia then had the chance to steal the points in the 81st minute when Mitrovic pounced on the ball and lashed it towards goal but missed the target.

Serbia really took control of the game towards the end and had a few close calls but were unable to break the deadlock and lift themselves above the group's bottom spot.

THE MVP

Serbia might have crashed out of the competition, but they have Predrag Rajkovic to thank for not finishing with a defeat. The goalkeeper pulled off three saves to keep his team in the game and, up until the final minute, in with a chance of going through to the next round.

THE BIG LOSER

His team may have been chasing the game for much of the 90 minutes, but Aleksandar Mitrovic had more attempts on goal than anyone else and failed to hit the target with any of them. Had he managed to sneak one over the line, his team would have been through.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Denmark go through to the next round where they will take on tournament hosts Germany, while Serbia head home with two points from their three matches in the tournament. Incredibly, they only clinched second spot over Slovenia due to their superior performance in qualification, with the two teams registering identical records in the tournament.
