Euro 2024 Betting Picks and Prop Bets for Tuesday 6/18/24

The 2024 UEFA European Football Championship -- also known as Euro 2024 -- is here, and it should be a fun tournament.

FanDuel Sportsbook's Euro 2024 odds offer a variety of ways to get in on the action, including betting lines for each match.

Let's take a look at the best bets for Tuesday's matches.

All Euro 2024 odds come from FanDuel Sportsbook and may change after this article is published.

Euro 2024 Betting Picks
Turkey vs. Georgia (12 p.m. ET)
Turkey Moneyline (-140)

Tuesday's two-match slate kicks off with a clash between Turkey (40th in FIFA's World Rankings) and Georgia (75th).

Since qualifying ended, Turkey has struggled in their friendlies leading up to Euro 2024 with losses to Hungary (1-0), Austria (6-1), and Poland (2-1) and a draw against Italy (0-0).

In qualifying, they were excellent -- winning Group D which included Croatia (10th) and Wales (29th). They only suffered one defeat, a 2-0 loss to Croatia, across their eight matches, earning wins over both Croatia (1-0) and Wales (2-0). Their 1.75 goals per 90 minutes tied for 15th-best while their 0.75 goals allowed/90 tied for 10th-best.

Georgia are in the field for Euro 2024 despite finishing fourth in Group A, behind Spain (8th), Scotland (39th), and Norway (47th). Both their wins in qualifying came against Group A's fifth-placed finisher -- Cyprus (124th). In their six matches against the trio that finished ahead of them, they combined for two draws and four losses with a scoreline of 6 goals for and 17 goals against.

Georgia earned their place in Euro 2024 with 2-0 win over Luxembourg (87th) in the playoff semi-finals before defeating Greece (50th) in the finals on penalty kicks after a 0-0 draw in regulation plus overtime.

Georgia's path to the tournament inspires little confidence in their ability to earn a result as an underdog on Tuesday. Turkey aren't an elite side, but their recent results included wins over better opposition and they should have the lion's share of chances in this one.

Portugal vs. Czechia (3 p.m. ET)
Over 2.5 Goals (-136)

The highlight of Tuesday's Group F action is a showdown between Portugal (6th) and Czechia (36th).

Portugal were perfect in qualifying with 10 wins from 10 matches against a weaker Group J that only included one other side ranked inside the top 70 -- Slovakia (48th). Still, you can only play the team in front of you, and Portugal did that to near perfection: they led all teams in qualifying in both goals/90 (3.60) and goals allowed/90 (0.20).

They boast an experienced and talented attack that includes Cristiano Ronaldo, Bernardo Silva, Rafael Leao, and Bruno Fernandes. Czechia are a better side than any team they faced in qualifying, but the reverse is also true: Czechia hasn't faced an attack this strong since the UEFA Nations League in 2022.

In that tournament, Czechia recorded one win and five losses in six fixtures against Spain, Portugal, and Switzerland with five goals for and 13 goals against. Their one win came against Switzerland and they lost 2-0 and 4-0 in their fixtures against Portugal.

If there is one area of concern for Portugal entering Euro 2024, it's the performance of their defense in recent friendlies. In their five friendlies since March, they have allowed at least two goals in four of them (vs. Sweden, Slovenia, Finland, and Croatia). Czechia haven't played a difficult slate of opponents, but they have scored in 10 of 12 matches this year including four goals against Poland (28th).

Given both team's recent goalscoring form, I like over 2.5 goals in this one.

Prop Bets

Bruno Fernandes To Score or Assist (+100): Cristiano Ronaldo's 10 goals in qualifying led Portugal, but Fernandes is the engine of their attack. He finished qualifying with the second-most goals (six) and most assists (eight) on Portugal -- his 14 goals plus assists led the team and doubled the contributions of anyone not named Ronaldo. In his last game against Czechia in the UEFA Nations League in 2022, Fernandes recorded a goal and an assist in 76 minutes played.

Cristiano Ronaldo To Have 1 Or More Shots on Target In 1st Half (-135): In qualifying, Portugal ranked second in shots/90 (19.0) and shots on target/90 (8.10). Ronaldo accounted for a huge portion of that, averaging 5.75 shots/90 and 2.38 shots on target/90. Ronaldo averaged 80.1 minutes per game in qualifying, but at age 39, the potential for him to be replaced in the second half is always there. I like focusing on the first half and expect Ronaldo to come out firing.
