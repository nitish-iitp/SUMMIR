Preview: Nigeria vs. Angola - prediction, team news, lineups

Nigeria hope to avoid the poisoned chalice of the Africa Cup of Nations favourites tag when they face Angola in Friday's quarter-final at the Felix Houphouet Boigny Stadium.

The Super Eagles defeated age-old rivals Cameroon in the round of 16 to outdo their AFCON 2021 performance, while the Palancas Negras eliminated inexperienced Namibia to make history by recording a first victory in the tournament's knockout stage.

Expectations were low before Jose Peseiro's team played their Cup of Nations opener a fortnight ago, but the three-time champions are beginning to dream of a fourth title, with a 2-0 victory over Cameroon in the last round winning the hearts of doubting fans in the West African nation.

Ademola Lookman netted twice in the game, but Victor Osimhen's battling traits were equally important despite not adding to the one goal scored at AFCON 2023 against Equatorial Guinea.

Peseiro's men have been beneficiaries of a watertight rearguard that has seen them concede insignificant shots on goal, with the last clear-cut chance created against them coming in the 1-0 success over Cote d'Ivoire in their second game of the finals.

With the bracket opening up after South Africa stunned World Cup 2022 semi-finalists Morocco on Tuesday, Nigeria are being backed to secure the results against Angola and either Cape Verde or South Africa to progress to the decider on February 11.

They cannot rest on their laurels, with this competition proving the gap between the heavyweights and emerging nations is closing, underscored by the unanticipated outcomes hitherto witnessed.

Angola stand in the Super Eagles' path to another semi-final, and the southern African nation are not expected to be straightforward opponents against the highest-ranked side left in the competition.

Pedro Goncalves's men surprisingly topped Group B, comprising 2019 champions Algeria, with seven points and have not looked back since that 1-1 draw with the Fennecs, defeating fearless Mauritania (3-2), Burkina Faso (2-0) and Namibia (3-0).

The recent win continued the free-scoring side's AFCON 2023, aided by Gelson Dala and Mabululu, who have combined to notch seven of the nine netted by the Palancas Negras.

That accounts for 77.8% of Angola's goals at the continental showpiece, and the pair's influence would undoubtedly be pivotal to potentially stunning Peseiro's men in Abidjan on Friday.

The Palancas Negras have a history of ruining the West African nation's ambition, with the South African nation denying the Super Eagles a place at the 2006 World Cup.

Producing a top showing to deny Nigeria a spot at the AFCON 2023 semis would be only their second-ever success at the Cup of Nations knockouts — adding to the first triumph against Namibia last Saturday.

Nigeria are sweating over the availability of Stanley Nwabali — deputising for the erratic Francis Uzoho at the finals — with the goalkeeper withdrawn after sustaining an injury against Cameroon, although the Chippa United shot-stopper trained on Tuesday.

However, the Super Eagles trained without William Troost-Ekong on Monday and Tuesday, with the vice-captain troubled by the thigh problem that kept him out of the final Group A game against Guinea-Bissau.

Osimhen, Lookman and Moses Simon should play up top, as Peseiro is not expected to change tack in the competition's quarters.

Apart from Mabululu and Dala, Fredy's three assists have been pivotal for the Palancas Negras, while Gilberto poses a threat with his unpredictability.

Angola must do without the suspended Neblu, sent off after 17 minutes against Namibia for handling the ball outside his penalty area.


Nigeria possible starting lineup:
Nwabali; Ajayi, Troost-Ekong, Bassey; Aina, Iwobi, Onyeka, Sanusi; Lookman, Simon; Osimhen

Angola possible starting lineup:
Signori; Afonso, Gaspar, Buatu-Mananga, Carneiro; Fredy, Snow, Estrela; Gilberto, Mabululu, Dala



We say: Nigeria 2-1 Angola

Friday should pose the sternest test to Nigeria's watertight backline, with Angola capable of hurting the West African nation in different ways.

Peseiro's men are expected to concede, but they should have enough at the other end to defeat the exciting Palancas Negras.
