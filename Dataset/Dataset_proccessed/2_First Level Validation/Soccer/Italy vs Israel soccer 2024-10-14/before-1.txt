After a moment of madness saw them settle for a point last time out, Italy aim to extend their reign at the top of League A Group 2 on Monday evening, when they host UEFA Nations League foes Israel to Udine.

The Azzurri were apparently coasting to victory before going down to 10 men against Belgium in Rome, while their rock-bottom visitors were well beaten by France.

Having conceded the first goal of their new Nations League campaign inside 13 seconds against France last month, this time Italy burst out of the blocks, scoring within a minute of the first whistle in Thursday night's 2-2 draw with Belgium.

Luciano Spalletti's side put together 18 consecutive passes to set up Andrea Cambiaso's opener at Stadio Olimpico, before Mateo Retegui put them in control by converting from close range midway through the first half.

However, the VAR then intervened to suggest a straight red card for Lorenzo Pellegrini, and the Roma captain's reckless dismissal on home turf cost his team dearly: Belgium scored from the resulting free kick and then went on to secure a draw.

Italy's mood remains upbeat, though, as picking up another point kept them top of Group 2, and they will now look to make it three wins from four in this season's Nations League.

Turning the page after a dismal defence of their European Championship title, the Azzurri made a superb start in September, beating France in Paris before taking care of business against Israel.

Now, ahead of November's finale - when La Nazionale will hope to secure a top-two finish and qualify for the new quarter-final stage - they seek a repeat of their recent 2-1 win over Monday's opponents.

Israel have taken up residence in Hungary for their 'home' fixtures this year, due to ongoing conflict in the Middle East, and all three games held there so far have resulted in defeat.

First, they met Belgium on neutral soil because of security concerns, losing 3-1, before being beaten by Italy and then suffering a third straight setback at the hands of France last time out.

The Sky-Blue and Whites were thumped 4-1 at Bozsik Arena, with Eduardo Camavinga and Omri Gandelman trading goals before Christopher Nkunku put Les Bleus back in front; Matteo Guendouzi and Bradley Barcola added two more later on.

Having risen from League C to the Nations League's top tier over the past few years, it seems that Israel's stay among Europe's elite will be brief: they languish four points behind third-placed Belgium at the halfway stage and are on course for automatic demotion.

Without a point on the board in Group 2, Ran Ben Shimon's side will surely travel to northern Italy in hope rather than expectation, particularly having won just two of their last 10 matches - against Andorra and Belarus.

After settling on a favoured formation and putting a stop to his tactical tinkering, Italy coach Luciano Spalletti must make at least one change to a winning team on Monday, due to Lorenzo Pellegrini's suspension.

The latter's former Roma teammate, Atalanta BC forward Nicolo Zaniolo, has been called up as cover, but having struggled for fitness this season he is most likely to start on the bench.

Fellow forward Federico Chiesa is absent for similar reasons, while Zaniolo's club colleagues Gianluca Scamacca and Giorgio Scalvini also feature on a long absence list, alongside key midfielder Nicolo Barella and Fiorentina striker Moise Kean.

Spalletti could therefore hand a first cap to Daniel Maldini - now following in the footsteps of Azzurri legends Paolo Maldini and Cesare Maldini - but Giacomo Raspadori is favourite to join Mateo Retegui up front.

Meanwhile, Israel are missing captain Eli Dasa and young forward Dor Turgeman, plus Leeds United winger Manor Solomon, the latter of whom is sidelined by a hamstring problem.

With Solomon unavailable, Oscar Gloukh and Omri Gandelman could support the visitors' lone striker, Philadelphia Union star Tai Baribo.


Italy possible starting lineup:
Vicario; Di Lorenzo, Bastoni, Calafiori; Cambiaso, Fagioli, Ricci, Tonali, Dimarco; Raspadori, Retegui

Israel possible starting lineup:
Glazer; Feingold, Nachimas, Shlomo; Abada, Abu Fani, Jaber, Leidner; Gloukh, Gandelman; Baribo



We say: Italy 2-1 Israel

While their winning run ended on Thursday, it looks like Italy have re-found their rhythm since the Euros, so they should be too good for limited opponents in Udine.

Israel have scored in each game so far, though, and they could find the net despite suffering a fourth straight defeat in Group 2.
