Group Review

Group C of EURO 2024 promises intense competition with England, Denmark, Serbia, and Slovenia all vying for progression. England, the group’s favorite, boasts a star-studded lineup featuring Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham, and Phil Foden, all in top form. Gareth Southgate’s squad is determined to go one step further than their runner-up finish in EURO 2020. However, defensive concerns persist, with key players like Luke Shaw and Harry Maguire facing fitness issues​. England’s depth and quality make them strong contenders to top the group, but Denmark could pose a significant challenge.

Denmark, led by Kasper Hjulmand, aims to build on their impressive run to the semi-finals in EURO 2020. With a solid defense and midfield, the Danes are reinforced by the emergence of Rasmus Hojlund, who has had a stellar season with Manchester United. Denmark’s blend of experience and young talent makes them formidable opponents​. Serbia and Slovenia, both returning to the EURO stage after long absences, bring their own threats. Serbia’s attacking prowess, led by Dusan Vlahovic and Aleksandar Mitrovic, could surprise, while Slovenia will rely on the goal-scoring abilities of Benjamin Sesko and the defensive reliability of Jan Oblak to challenge for a knockout spot​.

Predictions

England and Denmark are expected to compete for the top spot in Group C, with England’s depth and recent form giving them an edge. Denmark, with a solid squad and strong team play, will likely secure the second spot. Serbia’s potent attack could challenge the top teams, while Slovenia, despite being underdogs, might pull off surprises if their key players perform well.

Slovenia vs Denmark (June 16, Stuttgart): Denmark to win, leveraging their stronger squad.

England vs Serbia (June 16, Gelsenkirchen): England to secure a win due to their superior talent.

Slovenia vs Serbia (June 20, Munich): Serbia to win, utilizing their attacking strengths.

England vs Slovenia (June 25, Cologne): England to win, given their overall quality.

Denmark vs Serbia (June 25, Munich): Denmark to edge out a win in a closely fought match.
