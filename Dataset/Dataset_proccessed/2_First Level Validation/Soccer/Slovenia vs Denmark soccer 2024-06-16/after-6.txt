EURO 2024
SLOVENIA 1-1 DENMARK: CHRISTIAN ERIKSEN STRIKE IN VAIN AS DANES PEGGED BACK IN EURO 2024 OPENER IN STUTTGART
BYPAUL HASSALL

UPDATED 16/06/2024 AT 21:33 GMT

It looked for a long time as if Christian Eriksen’s goal would be enough to net Denmark victory in their opening Group C encounter at Euro 2024, but Erik Janza’s deflected effort saw Slovenia peg back their opponents late on. Denmark controlled large swathes of the game but faded late on as they failed to take the initiative in their group containing England and Serbia, who play later on Sunday.

‘We have a good chance of going through’ - Eriksen confident about Denmark’s Euro 2024 chances

Christian Eriksen capped a fairytale return to the European Championship stage with a sublime goal but Denmark were held to a 1-1 draw by Slovenia in their Group C opener in Stuttgart.
The Manchester United midfielder marked 1,100 days since suffering a cardiac arrest on the pitch at Euro 2020 by opening the scoring with a smart finish on 17 minutes.

The Danes dominated for long spells with both Eriksen and Rasmus Hojlund going close to extending their advantage.

Slovenia eventually grew as an attacking force and after highly rated Benjamin Sesko hit the woodwork, they drew level 13 minutes from time through Erik Janza’s deflected drive.
Next up for these two sides in Group C, Serbia face Slovenia on Thursday evening followed by Denmark’s clash with England.
TALKING POINT - THE CHRISTIAN ERIKSEN STORY IS ONE TO MAKE EVERY FOOTBALL FAN SMILE
This was almost a case of fate. It just had to be him, as Eriksen’s journey from cardiac arrest in Denmark's Euro 2020 opener against Finland came full circle with both a majestic appearance and a fine goal three years on.
The 32-year-old has played at the World Cup since recovering to resume his professional career thanks to his implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), but there was a poignancy to him returning to this particular tournament and taking centre stage for his country once again.
In his homeland, the previous Euro tournament was being dubbed as the one where an Eriksen in his prime would lead Denmark to something special. Sadly for him, it was far from that and he had to watch on, thinking his career was over, as his team-mates battled to the semi-finals and an extra-time defeat to England.
The Danes, who also upset football aristocracy when they won the Euros in 1992, remain an unlikely bet to go that far again and this result could yet damage their hopes. However, they have scraped out of groups before and with Eriksen finding another gear or two for his country, you can never truly rule out another deep run.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - CHRISTIAN ERIKSEN (DENMARK)
It would be easy to hand the Man United playmaker the award for scoring in such emotional circumstances. The reality is that he was the game’s most inventive force and was at the centre of his country’s best moments, particularly in the first 45.

Matchcast and commentary
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
17’ - GOAL! – Denmark 1-0 Slovenia: (Eriksen). Jonas Wind flicks a long throw from the right into the path of Eriksen who chests it down before firing a half volley into the far corner.
43’ - DENMARK CHANCE! Wind works his way down the left and slides a lovely cut back to the unmarked Eriksen who contrives to blaze a 15-yard effort way over the bar.
65’ - DENMARK CHANCE! Oblak makes a point-blank save to deny Hojlund from close-in after Victor Kristiansen had teased a wonderful ball into the six-yard box from the left.
67’ - SLOVENIA CHANCE! Cerin arrives late to meet Sporar's lovely cross from the left but can only guide his header wide of the far post.
76’ - SLOVENIA CHANCE! Sesko picks up a loose ball and thumps a stunning 25-yard shot against the far post.
77’ - GOAL! – Denmark 1-1 Slovenia: (Janza). A right-wing corner falls for Erik Janza who lets rip from 25 yards with a stinging effort that takes a deflection and flies past Schmeichel.
