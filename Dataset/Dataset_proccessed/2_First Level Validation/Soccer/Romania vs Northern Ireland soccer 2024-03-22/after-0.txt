Jamie Reid’s debut goal helps Northern Ireland battle to draw against Romania

Romania 1 Northern Ireland 1

Northern Ireland striker Jamie Reid celebrates his debut goal against Romania

Put this down as a highly promising and encouraging start to Michael O’Neill’s ‘rebirth’ for Northern Ireland.

A draw away to Euro 2024-bound Romania is no mean feat these days.

And for debutant Jamie Reid, what a dream night, scoring just seven minutes into his first appearance at this level.

Stevenage striker Reid, eligible through his grandmother, has had quite the journey to this point, starting out at Exeter City and having loan spells at Dorchester Town and Truro City before going on to play for Torquay and Mansfield.

He’s been in blistering form this season for his League One club, netting 21 goals, and clearly impressed in training for O’Neill to give him this opportunity against a nation who, in topping their Euro 2024 qualifying group, only conceded five goals in 10 matches.

Reid took his chance and his goal with a touch of class.

He was not the only impressive performer for Michael O’Neill’s inexperienced side in the friendly in Bucharest’s National Arena.

Conor Bradley was brilliant, bringing his outstanding Liverpool form to the international scene, and fellow wing back Brodie Spencer can also feel proud of his efforts.

Ditto the defensive trio of Paddy McNair, Trai Hume and Eoin Toal, who kept the Romanians at arm’s length for most of the match.

Credit to the manager too. Tactically the team was set up correctly and, but for a goalkeeping error from Conor Hazard allowing Dennis Man to equalise, the visitors might have won the contest.

Before the game, O’Neill talked about his side building an identity. Playing in a well-organised and structured manner, looking dangerous in attack and not losing a tricky tie on the road is a decent foundation to work on.

O’Neill’s first team of 2024, playing in their new ‘vivid’ green shirts, saw Hazard given the nod in goal with Hume, Toal and McNair, captaining the side in his 68th appearance, operating in a three man back line.

Bradley, in his first international since becoming a regular and global star with the Reds, and Huddersfield teenager Spencer were the wing-backs while Shea Charles, Jordan Thompson and Paddy Lane made up the midfield.

In attack, Isaac Price was joined by new cap Reid.

It was a glorious international bow for the 29-year-old, who played for the Northern Ireland Under-21 side over a decade ago and nothing since on the international scene until now.

It told you everything you needed to know about the starting XI that Reid was the oldest player in it, with six of O’Neill’s players aged 23 or under.

Tottenham’s Radu Dragusin started in defence for Romania with the Italian based trio Razvan Marin (Empoli), Man (Parma) and George Puscas (Bari) key figures in their side.

These days, Romania are coached by Edward Iordanescu, the son of Anghel who was in charge of the country when Northern Ireland played them during the Euro 2016 qualifiers.

In that successful campaign in O’Neill’s first spell in charge, the only defeat witnessed by the Green and White Army was in Bucharest losing 2-0.

The last time Northern Ireland played here was in Ian Baraclough’s first match as boss in 2020 when the teams played out a 1-1 draw in the Nations League.

Without question the country’s most famous match in the city known as ‘little Paris’ for its French influence in the architecture was in 1985 when Jimmy Quinn scored in a 1-0 victory which helped take Billy Bingham’s boys to the World Cup finals in Mexico a year later.

The great Gheorghe Hagi played in that match and before kick-off he was one of a number of former Romanian heroes presented to the crowd in the 55,000 capacity stadium which was just over half full for the friendly, with around 300 Northern Ireland fans making the journey.

Various places such as Lisburn and Newcastle were represented on flags in the away end. There was also one labelled Dubai GAWA and the now obligatory ‘No Casement’ banner.

Like many a friendly it was a quiet start. Enter Bradley to change that in the seventh minute, surging down the right flank like he has done so expertly for Liverpool this year.

The Tyrone man showed presence of mind and composure to play the ball inside to Charles, who displayed the same qualities when finding Reid bearing down on goal. With the Romania goalkeeper Florin Nita out to narrow the angle, the Stevenage front man was as cool as ice lifting the ball over Romania’s number one and into the net.

What a fantastic team goal created by 20-year-olds Bradley and Charles and scored by new man Reid. Talk about a stunning start to your international career and in front of the jubilant Northern Ireland fans for good measure.

The Romanians, like a number of Premier League sides, were struggling to deal with Bradley’s pace and power when he attacked. Shortly after playing a significant role in Reid’s goal he raced forward thinking he might get one himself only to be crowded out inside the area.

O’Neill would have been overjoyed by the start because Romania had not laid a glove on his team. Then came a leveller on 23 minutes which will have frustrated the former Stoke City boss.

From deep the running Man was alert to a long diagonal ball into the box and despite the attention of Spencer and Toal worked space for himself to shoot. The strike was powerful but straight down Hazard’s throat and it went through his hands when he should have kept it out.

Late in the first half to rub salt into the wound, Hazard was booked for time wasting. Moments later a superb intervention from Spencer stopped Vasile Mogos from giving the home side an undeserved lead in what, bar the soft Romania goal, was an encouraging first 45 for Northern Ireland, with Bradley excellent.

For the second period, Bailey Peacock-Farrell, playing in a specially moulded mask after breaking his nose on club duty, replaced Hazard.

Romania had plenty of the ball but Northern Ireland’s shape and discipline limited them to wasted efforts from long distance.

In a flat spell, typical of friendlies, Conor McMenamin came on for Lane, Ali McCann for Thompson and Josh Magennis for Reid who, in his first match for Northern Ireland, put in a strong shift and grabbed himself a goal. Bravo.

Late on, Northern Ireland showed ambition through McNair and Price to win but a draw was fair enough.

Next stop Hampden Park and Scotland on Tuesday. More of the same please.

A nice jinking run from Shea Charles through the midfield and he is fouled by Nicolae Stanciu about 30 yards from goal to earn the free-kick. It might be too far out for a shot but it's still in a dangerous position.

But it comes to naught as Paddy McNair's chipped delivery is easily headed away.

The stats

Romania have commanded 65% of possession in the first half and have out-chanced Northern Ireland by three shots to one but, crucially, on the scoreboard it's level. In fairness, despite having most of the ball, Romania have done very little with it.
