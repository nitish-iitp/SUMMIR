In just his second official game coaching the Philippine men’s national football team, coach Tom Saintfient was dealt with his biggest setback after succumbing to a 5-0 decision against Iraq in the second round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup preliminary joint qualifiers on Tuesday, March 26, at the Rizal Memorial Stadium.

Speaking to the press after the game, Saintfiet immediately apologized to the thousands of fans who trooped to the Rizal Memorial Stadium only to see the national team get demolished by Iraq.

“My apologies to the 10,000 fans who were in the stadium, but also to people who were watching at home. My apologies for the big defeat, and also my thanks for the big support from the fan side,” said Saintfiet. “I’m very disappointed, but I’m also very sorry.”

Still, the Belgian tactician saw some positives from the game despite the lopsided loss, which included the performances of some of the young players in the team.

“I think we tried to play more football than in [Basra], Iraq. We had more ball possession, we created chances for ourselves,” said Saintfiet. “I saw a lot of good players, Santi [Rublico] is one of them, but also later Pocholo [Bugas], and Mark Swainston coming very good in."

“I think it’s very good that our homegrown players or local-based players play in the local league like Swainston and Gayoso, who played, also in my eyes again a very good game,” he added.

Even with the 5-0 defeat, the Philippines remain alive in Group F, but they will need to defeat Indonesia and Vietnam away from home turf in June.

The Philippines currently sit with just a point in four games and a goal difference of -8., while Indonesia currently holds the second spot with 7 points and a neutral goal difference.

Vietnam, on the other hand, is just above the Philippines with 3 points and a goal difference of -3.

Only the top two teams from each group will progress to the third round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers, securing an automatic berth in the AFC Asian Cup 2027.

Teams placed third and fourth, meanwhile, will forfeit their chances for the World Cup but will remain contenders for a place in the AFC Asian Cup.

“We can get seven points and if we get seven points, it would mean that we beat Indonesia away, and from my knowledge, the head-to-head counts in advance of the goal difference so if we beat Indonesia and they drew here, that means that we would be ahead of Indonesia,” said Saintfiet.

“As long as we have hope, as long as we are alive, we are not dead,” he emphasized.
