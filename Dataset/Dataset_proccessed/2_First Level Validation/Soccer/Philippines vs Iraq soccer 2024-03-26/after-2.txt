The sides meet for only the second time in history

The Philippines host Iraq at the Rizal Memorial Stadium in Manila on Tuesday for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, looking to avenge their loss from last week.

The Street Dogs were beaten 1-0 by the Lions of Mesopotamia in Basra last Thursday as talismanic forward Mohanad Ali struck in the 84th minute to break their resistence.

It maintained Iraq's perfect start to the second round of the qualifiers, as the Middle Eastern outfit consolidated their position atop Group F with nine points from three matches. The Philippines, though, remained stuck at the bottom without a win and just a point in the bag.

Trending

As only three points separate them from the second-placed Indonesia, all's not lost yet for the south-east Asian side, who are still within reach of qualifying for the third round.

Iraq have truly been impressive in these qualifiers. It's also worth noting that in January, the side were involved in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, where they powered into the round of 16 after winning all three group matches. Jordan, however, brought their run to a juddering halt with a 3-2 victory.
