Somalia and Botswana will battle for three points in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier on Monday. The 'hosts' are coming into the game on the back of a 2-1 defeat away to Mozambique in the qualifiers on Friday.

Alfons Amade and Stanley Ratifo scored first-half goals for the Mambas while Ismail Shirwa halved the deficit midway through the second half.

Botswana, meanwhile, fell to a 1-0 defeat away to Uganda on the same day. Muhammad Shaban's 74th-minute strike proved to be the difference between the two sides.

The loss left the Zebras in fifth spot in Group G, having garnered three points from as many games. Somalia are bottom of the standings on zero points.

Somalia vs Botswana Prediction

Somalia appeared to be the strugglers of the group on paper when the draws were made and that has proven to be the case so far. The Ocean Stars are yet to register their first points on the board after three games and they are already six points off the top. This is designated as a home game for Rachid Lousteque's side but the game is taking place in Mozambique.

Botswana's three games in the qualifiers have been keenly contested. They will be expected to register their second win in the group to keep their hopes of qualifying for a maiden World Cup alive. Didier Gomes Da Rosa's side are the favorites on paper and the game being played on neutral ground gives them an extra edge.

The game is likely to be cagey, with goalscoring chances coming at a premium. We are backing Botswana to claim a narrow win in addition to a clean sheet.

Prediction: Somalia 0-1 Botswana
