SECOND-HALF RALLY COMES UP SHORT AS U.S. MEN’S NATIONAL TEAM FALLS 2-1 TO CANADA IN INTERNATIONAL FRIENDLY
LUCA DE LA TORRE SCORED HIS FIRST INTERNATIONAL GOAL FOR THE USMNT; U.S. WILL NEXT FACE NEW ZEALAND ON SEPT. 10 AT TQL STADIUM IN CINCINNATI, OHIO (7 P.M. ET; TNT, UNIVERSO, TRUTV, MAX, PEACOCK, FÚTBOL DE PRIMERA RADIO)
SEPTEMBER 7, 2024

KANSAS CITY (Sept. 7, 2024) - The U.S. Men’s National Team opened the September international window on Saturday afternoon with a 2-1 friendly defeat to Canada at Children’s Mercy Park in Kansas City, Kan. The Canadians started well, but a much-improved second half by the hosts—along with the first U.S. goal from midfielder Luca de la Torre—weren’t enough to overturn a two-goal deficit.

The setback marks just the second time the U.S. has fallen to Canada on home soil (the first came in 1957), although the Americans still have a 17-11-13 advantage in the all- time series.

With the gradual buildup toward the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup and 2026 World Cup now underway, interim U.S. coach Mikey Varas chose a lineup that featured eight starters age 23 or younger. At 25, captain Christian Pulisic was the second-oldest American on the field at kickoff after 36-year-old center back Tim Ream.

Among that youthful cohort was goalkeeper Patrick Schulte, 23, who earned his second senior cap. It’s been an eventful stretch for the St. Louis-area native, who backstopped the Columbus Crew to an MLS title last December, made his USMNT debut in January’s friendly against Slovenia, helped Columbus reach the Concacaf Champions Cup final in June, and then anchored the U.S. Olympic team’s run to the quarterfinals in Paris.

Playing behind a back four of Ream, Chris Richards, Joe Scally and Kristoffer Lund, Schulte had an outstanding opening half. He helped the Americans weather the visitors’ initial surge with an exceptional save in the fourth minute. Canada striker Jonathan David unleashed a short-range volley from the left channel that Schulte reacted to brilliantly.

The 40th-ranked Canadians remained on the front foot, however, and took the lead in the 17th minute. Their press forced a heavy touch from U.S. midfielder Johnny Cardoso, and Canada’s Stephen Eustáquio won the ball and found David inside the penalty area. Instead of shooting, the Lille marksman sent a cross left to Jacob Shaffelburg, and the Nashville SC winger netted his fourth international goal with a low, well-placed shot to Schulte’s left.

The U.S. responded to the deficit with a couple attacking forays and nearly equalized on a twisting half volley from Pulisic in the 22nd. Schulte was called upon again 10 minutes later as David battled with Richards on a run through the right channel. The Canadian hit a robust shot toward the near post that Schulte acrobatically parried away. In the 43rd, Schulte denied David again, this time on the doorstep after a Canadian cross from the left made its way through.

The Americans, outshot 11-1 in the opening half, needed a solution to Canada’s press and opened the second period looking to get forward more quickly. That resolve showed promise early. A U.S. corner kick in the 49th minute set up an on-target shot from striker Folarin Balogun. A couple minutes later, a strong run through midfield from Lund, the left back, led to a through ball and blast from Balogun that forced another save from Canada’s Maxime Crépeau.

The hosts’ momentum stalled in the 58th, as David started then finished the play that doubled Canada’s lead. He stepped smartly into a passing lane, latched on to a ball from Ream and muscled past a couple U.S. defenders before finding teammate Cyle Larin. The ball bounced back to David, and he scored with a high, six-yard shot over the charging Schulte.

Varas immediately overhauled the U.S. midfield, sending on De la Torre and Aidan Morris. A few minutes later, the Americans were back in it thanks in large part to the two substitutes. Some patient U.S. possession led to a dangerous cross from Pulisic, a cut-back ball from Scally, a couple of deft touches from Morris, and then a calm, curling finish from De la Torre. The 66th-minute strike was the Celta Vigo midfielder’s first international goal in his 23rd USMNT appearance.

Attackers Haji Wright, Cade Cowell, and Ricardo Pepi joined the fray late as the U.S. pushed for the equalizer. The Americans maintained the more energetic and direct approach that changed the game in the second half. The best U.S. chance came in the 86th minute, as Wright went on a run and found Pepi with a through ball. Pepi did well to hold off Canada captain Alphonso Davies, but Crépeau raced out to the six-yard line and got a hand to Pepi’s shot.

Despite outshooting Canada 7-4 after halftime and holding nearly 60% of possession, the USA couldn’t find a second goal. Schulte finished with five saves.

The USA will conclude the September window with a friendly against Oceania champion New Zealand on Sept. 10 at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati (7 p.m. ET; TNT, Universo, TruTV, Max, Peacock, Fútbol de Primera). The USMNT is 2-0-1 at FC Cincinnati’s home ground and holds an identical 2-0-1 advantage in the all-time series against the All Whites. New Zealand is preparing for the start of its 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign, which kicks off next month.

GOAL SCORING RUNDOWN

CAN - Jacob Shaffelburg (Jonathan David), 17th minute: A pass from Tim Ream was retrieved by Canada’s Stephen Eustáquio, who knocked it forward to David. The striker cut a pass toward the left side of the penalty area, where Shaffelburg was able to send a shot back to the right and past goalie Patrick Schulte. USA 0, CAN 1

CAN - Jonathan David, 58th minute: David’s smart step to his left allowed him to pick off a pass from Tim Ream and drive toward the U.S. net. David slipped a pass to Cyle Larin, who was tackled by Kristoffer Lund. The ball popped back to David. He was in alone and able to finish cleanly from six yards. USA 0, CAN 2

USA - Luca de la Torre (Aidan Morris), 66th minute: The U.S. had a welcome spell of sustained possession and made it pay off. Joe Scally reached a cross from Christian Pulisic and cut the ball back to Morris at the top of Canada’s penalty area. The Middlesbrough signee beat a couple of defenders on the dribble and found De la Torre, who had time to settle the ball and then calmly curl a 10-yard, left-footed shot past Maxime Crépeau.
