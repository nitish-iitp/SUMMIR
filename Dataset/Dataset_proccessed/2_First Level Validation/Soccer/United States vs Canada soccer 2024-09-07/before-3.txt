Preview: USA vs. Canada - prediction, team news, lineups

Another chapter in the rivalry between the USA and Canada will occur on Saturday when the two sides square off in a friendly at Children's Mercy Park in Kansas City.

The Yanks are coming off a disappointing Copa America campaign this past summer, falling in the group stage, while the Canucks made the semi-finals of that competition, ultimately finishing fourth.

A series of disappointing showings by his players at the Copa America proved to be the final nail in the coffin of Gregg Berhalter as American head coach, as the man who guided them to two CONCACAF Nations League titles and a Gold Cup was sacked shortly after that tournament.

It has yet to be confirmed, but all reports indicate that former Tottenham and Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino will be entrusted with taking this golden generation into the next World Cup, which they will co-host along with Canada and Mexico.

For now, though, Mikey Varas will be in charge on an interim basis, and he has chosen a youthful squad with an overall average age of just over 24 years, though 18 of his selections were on the Copa America roster.

Children's Mercy Park has been good to the Americans through the years, with the Yanks claiming eight wins and two draws in 10 international matches played there, scoring 20 goals, while conceding only two.

Since the beginning of June, this side have won just one of their previous five matches across all competitions, defeating Bolivia 2-1 on matchday one of the 2024 Copa America.

The US have won two of their previous three competitive fixtures versus CONCACAF opponents, though they lost their previous one at the Copa America against Panama (2-1).

This weekend, they are in danger of losing three consecutive competitive fixtures for the first time in nearly nine years, suffering three defeats in 2015.

Jesse Marsch's first tournament as the Canadian head coach was a smashing success, with the former American assistant guiding this team to the penultimate hurdle at the Copa America in their debut appearance.

Their only defeat in normal time at that tournament came against the eventual champions, Argentina, with the Canadians losing to them in the opening match and semi-final by a 2-0 score.

This upcoming encounter will be the first for Marsch as manager against a CONCACAF nation, with Les Rouges winning two of their previous three meetings versus teams in their own region.

Maintaining an advantage under the high-energy brand of football that Marsch likes to employ has been a chore for this team, who have failed to win their last two matches in normal time when leading in the second half.

Nine of their 11 goals conceded in 2024 have occurred in the second half, while they have lost their last six matches when allowing the opening goal.

Ahead of this match, the ex-Leeds United boss is showing plenty of confidence in his side, predicting a 2-1 victory on Saturday.

That would end a lengthy away drought for the Canadian men against the US, as the Canucks have not beaten the Yanks on American soil since 1957 (3-2).

There are two uncapped players for the US seeking their first selections with the senior side, Marlon Fossey and Diego Kochen, while Patrick Schulte has one appearance to his name.

Varas chose 13 players under 23 years of ago for this window, including Brenden Aaronson, Ricardo Pepi, Gio Reyna and Caleb Wiley, with the latter currently on loan at Strasbourg in Ligue 1 after signing with Chelsea during the summer transfer window.

At the Copa America, Folarin Balogun netted twice, while captain Christian Pulisic scored once, putting him at 30 with the national team, even with former US international Brian McBride.

Inter Milan winger Tajon Buchanan will miss this match for Canada as he is still recovering from a serious leg injury that he sustained in training during the Copa America this past summer.

Marsch named four uncapped players to the Canadian side for this friendly, including Stephen Afrifa, Nathan Saliba, Niko Sigur, and Jonathan Sirois.

Captain Alphonso Davies can surpass Ali Gerba for 10th in all-time goals for Canada with his next one, while Jonathan David has 28 for Les Rouges, one fewer than Cyle Larin for the most in the history of the men's program.

USA possible starting lineup:
Turner; Scally, Trusty, Richards, Lund; Tillman, Morris, Musah; Pulisic, Balogun, Wright

Canada possible starting lineup:
Crepeau; Johnston, Cornelius, Bombito, Davies; Laryea, Choiniere, Eustaquio, Shaffelburg; David, Larin



We say: USA 2-0 Canada

Canada have shown they can compete with the best sides in the world, but still lack that ruthlessness against those top teams, which can make a good team great.

After such a disappointing display at the Copa America, we believe the US will be fired up for this one as they eagerly await the anticipated arrival of Pochettino, whose name alone has created plenty of enthusiasm around the team.
