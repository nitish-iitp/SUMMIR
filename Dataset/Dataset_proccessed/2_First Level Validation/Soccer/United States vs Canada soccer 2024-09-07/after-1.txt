USMNT suffers 1st home loss to Canada in 67 years

Varas blasts USMNT mentality after loss

USMNT interim coach Mikey Varas questions team's mentality following defeat to Canada.

The United States men's national team suffered its first home loss to Canada in 67 years, as it continued its struggles from this summer's Copa América in Saturday's friendly in Kansas City, Kansas.

In its first game since exiting the Copa América at the group stage and the subsequent removal of Gregg Berhalter as head coach, the U.S. was well beaten by its neighbors to the north.

The 2-1 win was Canada's second victory over the USMNT on U.S. soil in 27 games, and first since 1957 in St. Louis.

While Mauricio Pochettino is expected to imminently be announced as Berhalter's high-profile replacement, the U.S. was under the interim charge of former assistant Mikey Varas. Canada, meanwhile, continued to display its upward trajectory under another former U.S. assistant coach, and onetime candidate for U.S. head coach, Jesse Marsch.

Canada, which reached the semifinals of its first Copa in July, was particularly dominant in the first half. Jacob Shaffelburg scored the opening goal in the 17th minute and Canada could have been more than one goal up on its listless opponents by half-time.

A deserved second goal arrived for Canada through forward Jonathan David just before the hour-mark. Though the Americans were improved after halftime and Luca de la Torre's first international goal halved its deficit in the 66th minute, it was not enough to avoid the USMNT sinking to a third straight loss.

The U.S. will next face New Zealand in Cincinnati on Tuesday.

The USMNT's 23-game home unbeaten streak against Canada had been its longest such run against any opponent. But there was little evidence of that history as Canada outshot a static U.S. 11-1 in the first half.

Columbus goalkeeper Patrick Schulte made his second international start and displaced Matt Turner, who hasn't played a club match since April 2. Tim Ream started following his transfer from Fulham to Charlotte.

No MLS players had started in the prior six matches and just eight of 198 starting positions have been been filled with MLS players in the 18 matches in which the full pool has been available since the 2022 World Cup.

Canada went ahead when Schulte lingered on the ball after a backpass and played it wide to Ream, whose pass upfield to Johnny Cardoso bounced away from the midfielder and was picked up by Stephen Eustáquio. He played the ball to David, who played a first-time pass to Shaffelburg. He took a touch and slid the ball past Schulte's left hand for his fourth goal in 17 international appearances.

Canada scored the first goal against the Americans in the U.S. for the first time in 19 games since 1985.

David scored after taking Ream's giveaway and centering to Cyle Larin. Kristoffer Lund's challenge knocked the ball to David, who beat Schulte to the near post from 7 yards. David's 29 goals matched Larin for the Canadian all-time scoring record.

Six U.S. players were held over from the Copa América loss to Uruguay: Ream, fellow defenders Chris Richards and Joe Scally, midfielder Yunus Musah and forwards Folarin Balogun and Christian Pulisic.
