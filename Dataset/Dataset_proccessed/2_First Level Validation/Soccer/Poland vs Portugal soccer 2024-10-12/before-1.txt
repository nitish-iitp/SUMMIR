Preview: Poland vs. Portugal - prediction, team news, lineups

Following back-to-back UEFA Nations League wins last month, Portugal are setting the pace in League A Group 1, and they will aim to continue in that vein when visiting Poland on Saturday.

The Selecao turned to their talisman in both games in September, when Cristiano Ronaldo reached his latest career landmark, leaving them three points clear of their hosts before heading to Warsaw.

Securing maximum points from their first two Group 1 matches, Portugal were indebted to their longest-serving player against both Croatia and Scotland, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring the second goal in a 2-1 win over the former before making an explosive cameo appearance against the latter.

Quickly overcoming the disappointment of their penalty-shootout exit from Euro 2024, Ronaldo's 900th goal in senior football put Portugal in control against Croatia; three days later, he emerged from the bench to strike the woodwork twice before snatching a late winner versus the Scots.

While questions remain about an over-reliance on his 39-year-old striker, head coach Roberto Martinez has staunchly defended a much criticised selection policy and looks set to lead his team towards the 2026 World Cup.

Martinez is first aiming to go all the way in a tournament the Selecao memorably won back in 2019, having more recently missed out on a place in the 2023 Nations League finals by finishing second to Spain in their group.

A top-two finish is now sufficient to book a berth in the quarter-finals, so Portugal can secure progress to the knockout phase of this season's edition by beating both Poland and Scotland on the road.

Dating back to 2006, they are unbeaten in six meetings with Saturday's hosts - most notably taking four points from their Polish counterparts during the inaugural Nations League - so history will be on their side this weekend.

Portugal are not the only Group 1 team reliant on an ageing goalscorer, as Poland captain Robert Lewandowski rattled in his 84th international strike last month, during a five-goal thriller in Scotland.

Despite blowing a two-goal lead at Hampden Park, the Eagles still took maximum points home thanks to a last-gasp spot kick from Nicola Zalewski, which wrapped up a dramatic 3-2 victory.

However, they were subsequently beaten 1-0 by Croatia in Osijek, leaving the pair locked together in the standings, three points above Scotland.

Before tamely going out of Euro 2024 at the group stage, Poland survived relegation in the previous Nations League, and head coach Michal Probierz has now been tasked with keeping his country afloat at Europe's top level while refreshing a stale squad.

Of course, the priority is building towards the World Cup, but continuing to pick up points will also be important - an unprecedented place in the Nations League's knockout phase is still at stake.

On the other hand, finishing third in Group 1 would mean a relegation playoff; fourth results in an automatic drop down to League B.

Portugal boss Roberto Martinez has called up some fresh faces for this month's get-together, naming Farense goalkeeper Ricardo Velho and Mallorca midfielder Samu Costa in his 26-man squad.

After scoring a superb solo goal against RB Leipzig in the Champions League, Juventus winger Francisco Conceicao is recalled, having missed September's games due to injury; however, Sporting Lisbon pair Geovany Quenda and Pedro Goncalves are both sidelined.

Rarely predictable in terms of tactics or personnel, Martinez may opt for a 4-3-3 setup on Saturday, with Ronaldo being flanked by Rafael Leao and any one of several other attacking options.

Meanwhile, Poland's new boys include include Legia Warsaw midfielder Maxi Oyedele and Rakow Czestochowa winger Michael Ameyaw, but the hosts' backbone will still look familiar.

Jan Bednarek helms the back three, Inter Milan star Piotr Zielinski features in central midfield, while all-time top scorer Robert Lewandowski leads the line up front.

Once again, the latter will be without injured strike partner Arkadiusz Milik, so either Karol Swiderski or Krzysztof Piatek could support their skipper in attack.


Poland possible starting lineup:
Skorupski; Dawidowicz, Bednarek, Walukiewicz; Frankowski, Szymanski, Zielinski, Urbanski, Zalewski; Swiderski, Lewandowski

Portugal possible starting lineup:
Costa; Dalot, Dias, A. Silva, Mendes; B. Silva, Vitinha, Fernandes; Neto, Ronaldo, Leao



We say: Poland 1-2 Portugal

While Portugal may not be defensively sound, they pose a threat from several angles when going forward and are more than capable of outscoring their hosts.

Despite bringing through some new talent of late, Poland are also vulnerable at the back and will not be able to resist Ronaldo and co this weekend.
