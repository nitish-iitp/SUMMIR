The full slate of Euro 2024 quarter-finals has been confirmed following the results of Tuesday's last-16 ties.

Wins for the Netherlands and Turkey mean those two nations will square off on Sunday at the Olympiadstadion in Berlin in the last of the quarter-finals.

One of arguably the two form teams of the tournament so far will be eliminated when Spain and Germany get the next round underway in Friday's 17:00 BST kick-off at the MHPArena in Stuttgart.

La Roja comfortably overwhelmed Georgia 4-1 in the last 16 with Rodri and Nico Williams among the scorers, while Germany beat Denmark 2-0 in a game that was interrupted by a lightning storm.

Neither Portugal or France were convincing in their first victories of the knockout stage. Cristiano Ronaldo missed a penalty but the Selecao held their nerve in a spot-kick shootout as Diogo Costa saved all three of Slovenia's efforts to send Roberto Martinez's side through.

Les Bleus, meanwhile, once again needed a slice of luck to see off Belgium as Jan Vertonghen's own goal proved the difference between the two countries.

England spluttered once again in their tie with Slovakia but Jude Bellingham's overhead kick forced extra-time before Harry Kane won it with a header.

The Netherlands eventually ran away with their clash with Romania as two late goals from Donyell Malen capped a 3-0 triumph before Turkey became the final team to book their place in the last eight by downing Austria 2-1.
