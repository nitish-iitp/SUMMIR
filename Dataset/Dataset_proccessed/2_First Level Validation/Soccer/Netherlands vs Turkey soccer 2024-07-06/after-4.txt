Netherlands vs Turkey, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: How NED blew away Romania

It was gorgeously simple football — the hardest thing there is, to reproduce Johan Cruyff. From the Dutch side of the centre circle, Jerdy Schouten rolled a pass to Xavi Simons. A pass with neither power nor pace, but it immaculately split two Romanian shirts, the referee and found Xavi Simons in the space.

The playmaker cushioned the ball on his left instep, spun to his right, took a couple touches, and released Cody Gakpo, ferreting on the left flank. He cut away, then cut in, leaving his marker in the wake, took a touch to gather himself and slammed the ball net-wards, a low and ferocious shot inside goalkeeper Florin Nita’s near post.

It was a throwback goal from a throwback display, bursting with a blend of flair and finesse (except in front of the goal), pace and precision, transporting for a moment or two to the heady 90s of Dutch football, with those highly-skilled artistes of self-destruction. At first, the goal was a three-man orchestra. But the replays would insist that more men were involved. While the men on the left made the goal happen, the ones on the right helped make the goal happen with delightful movement off the ball and scattering the defenders’ attention. (READ MORE)

Netherlands vs Turkey, UEFA Euro 2024 Live: Demiral controversy

Turkey centre-back Merih Demiral has coped flak from German Interior Minister Nancy Faesar over his goal celebration in his team’s win over Austria in the Euro 2024 Round of 16 fixture on Tuesday.

Demiral’s gesturing the shape of a wolf’s head is linked to ‘Grey Wolves’, an ultra-nationalist youth branch of Turkey’s Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), an ally of President Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling AK Party.

“The symbols of Turkish right-wing extremists have no place in our stadiums,” the German minister Faeser wrote in a post on X. “Using the European Football Championship as a platform for racism is completely unacceptable.”
