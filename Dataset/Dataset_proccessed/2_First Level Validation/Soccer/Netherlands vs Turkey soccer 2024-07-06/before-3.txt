Turkey lineup vs. Netherlands: Predicted XI for Euro 2024 quarter-final

With a place in the Euro 2024 semi-finals at stake, Turkey's biggest game since 2008 takes place on Saturday night, when they meet the Netherlands at Berlin's Olympiastadion.

The Crescent-Stars will welcome back captain Hakan Calhanoglu - one of several Germany-born stars in the squad this summer - from suspension, but his replacement in Tuesday's last-16 tie must now serve a one-match ban.

Former Feyenoord playmaker Orkun Kokcu will miss out on playing against the country of his birth, having been booked for a second time in the tournament, while fellow midfielder Ismail Yuksek is also ruled out for the same reason.

Furthermore, two-goal hero Merih Demiral has been sanctioned by UEFA for controversially celebrating his second strike against Austria, and as many as eight other players are one yellow card away from missing a potential semi-final versus England or Switzerland.

With Okay Yokuslu likely to replace Yuksek in the Turkish engine room, Samet Akaydin - only just back from suspension himself - fronts the queue to cover for Demiral in defence.

Full-backs Mert Muldur and, in particular, Ferdi Kadioglu have impressed so far and should start again, adding plenty of width to Vincenzo Montella's 4-2-3-1 formation.

Teenage pair Kenan Yildiz and Arda Guler are among those at risk of a semi-final suspension, but both are poised to join Baris Alper Yilmaz in a youthful attacking trio - Yilmaz and Guler often interchange between the right flank and centre-forward.

Finally, goalkeeping hero Mert Gunok starts between the posts, having gained worldwide acclaim for his heroics last time out.

Turkey possible starting lineup: Gunok; Muldur, Demiral, Bardakci, Kadioglu; Yokuslu, Ayhan; Yildiz, Calhanoglu, Yilmaz; Guler
