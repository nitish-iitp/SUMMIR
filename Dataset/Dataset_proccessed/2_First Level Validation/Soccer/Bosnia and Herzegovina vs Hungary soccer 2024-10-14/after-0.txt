UEFA Nations League

Bosnia hosted Hungary for a home game in the UEFA Nations League on 14th October 2024. The game started slow as players were passing the ball around. Bendeguz Bolla and Benjamin Tahirovic both tested their strike early in the game. It was Hungary who drew the first blood, Zsolt Nagy passed the ball to Dominik Szoboszlai inside the box where he didn’t make any mistake and shot into the bottom right corner to make it 1-0 before half time.

Four minutes into the second half Nail Omerovic dragged down his opponent, the referee awarded a penalty kick to Hungary, and was shown a yellow card for a reckless challenge. Dominik Szoboszlai didn’t make a mistake this time as well, he shot an unstoppable penalty past the goalkeeper. Edin Dzeko came close twice but was unlucky to didn’t score.

Let’s have a look at the Bosnia vs Hungary player ratings.
