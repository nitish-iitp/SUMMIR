England's Jude Bellingham at risk of Euro 2024 quarter-final ban?

England could reportedly be without Jude Bellingham for their Euro 2024 quarter-final against Switzerland.

The 21-year-old has been a key figure for the Three Lions during the tournament so far, netting two of his side's four goals as they gun for continental glory.

His latest strike was one of the most dramatic in the recent history of the England nation team, who looked on the verge of an embarrassing exit on Sunday against Slovakia.

Scoring his third goal of the competition, Ivan Schranz fired the Slovakians into a first-half lead, and it remained that way until the closing stage of normal time, when the boy from Birmingham had a deciding say.

Perhaps reverting to a special "plan B" that Southgate had referred to earlier in the week, England sent in a long-throw which was headed on behind Bellingham, who produced an overhead kick to beat Martin Dubravka in net.

Bellingham's celebration to result in ban?

The Three Lions went on to advance to the quarter-finals courtesy of Harry Kane's extra-time winner, however the availability of last-gasp hero Bellingham has been thrown into doubt.

After netting the equaliser in stunning fashion, part of the 21-year-old's celebration involved an X-rated gesture towards the crowd, near the direction of the Slovakian bench.

Now according to Portuguese outlet A Bola, Bellingham could be in hot water for his celebrations and miss the Switzerland clash as a result.

It is said that the Real Madrid star could be handed a one-match ban for his gesture, meaning that he would sit out of the match in Dusseldorf on Saturday evening.

UEFA have released a statement confirmed that an "Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector will conduct a disciplinary investigation regarding a potential violation of the basic rules of decent conduct by the English Football Association player, Jude Bellingham, having allegedly occurred in the scope of this match."

Filling a Bellingham-shaped hole?

Even with a side packed full of world-leading talents, hardly any players in England's preferred XI have been spared from calls for them to drop to the bench.

Los Blancos superstar Bellingham is no exception, however Southgate might need to look elsewhere ahead of the weekend due to a possible suspension.

The 21-year-old's absence could open the door for Cole Palmer to start his first-ever match in a major tournament after impressing massively off the bench so far.

Phil Foden could be brought into the advanced-midfield role that he operates expertly in for Manchester City, allowing either Anthony Gordon or Eberechi Eze to begin on the left flank.
