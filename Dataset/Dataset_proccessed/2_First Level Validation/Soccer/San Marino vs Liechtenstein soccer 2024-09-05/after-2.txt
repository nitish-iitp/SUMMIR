FIFA's lowest-ranked team

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Prior to this momentous triumph, San Marino - who are the lowest ranked football team in the world (210th) - had only ever beaten one team in their history: Liechtenstein. They won that friendly match back in 2004 by the same scoreline but now they have ended the longest winless run in international football history (140 games) by beating the same opposition, who are ranked 199th in the world, for a historic victory.

DID YOU KNOW?

San Marino's team is predominantly made up of amateur players. Incidentally, in their friendly win over Liechtenstein in April 2004, an early goal from Andy Selva settled the game. He is the country's all-time leading scorer with eight goals to his name.

WHAT NEXT?

San Marino, who are in League D of the Nations League, sit top of Group D1 after one match. On Tuesday evening, they face Moldova - who are ranked 152nd in the world. Gibraltar are also in San Marino's group.
