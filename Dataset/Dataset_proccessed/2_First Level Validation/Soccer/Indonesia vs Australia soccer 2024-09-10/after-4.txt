That’s it from me this evening after another frustrating – and all too familiar – night for the Socceroos, though Indonesia will surely be pleased with hanging on for a draw.

Next up for the Socceroos are China at Adelaide Oval on 10 October, after they suffered a last-gasp 2-1 defeat to Saudi Arabia today. That match looms as a must-win especially with Japan to follow at Saitama Stadium on 15 October.

Socceroos coach Graham Arnold is trying to dissect what he’s just seen:

“Vastly improved performance and the boys showed that. But very disappointed. How many chances do we create? How many chances do we get? It has been a common theme for over a year.

“The boys did quite well but at the end of the day, you come here, hostile crowd, I counted how many fans we had here – 14 – the boys tried, they’re filthy about the result.

“There are eight games to go and second is on four [points], so it’s not a disaster, but I’ll go home and have a lot to think about, analyse these games first.

Nestory Irankunda is speaking on Channel 10 after his second start for the Socceroos:

“It was our game all along, we had our chances but we should’ve put them away in the first half. We just didn’t. We were dominating the whole game, they got lucky with their counter-attacks. It was just unlucky [with his shot], just one centimetre away, but that’s football.

“I feel like a better player compared to my first start, I was a bit unlucky to be subbed off early.”

Full-time: Indonesia 0-0 Australia

The referee blows for full-time and Indonesia celebrate their draw. It ends as another disappointing night for the Socceroos, now with one point from a possible six against two of the lower-ranked sides in the group, and just as worryingly still with no goals scored.

It was at least an improved performance from Australia compared to last week, with much more energy in their general play as well as more chances and shots on goal, but the result is barely better as Indonesia hold on for a 0-0 draw.

There were enough chances and half-chances for the Socceroos to find the net, but the lack of a ruthless goalscorer again rears its ugly head. The 20 shots, six on target, 15 corners and 63% possession suggest there is something to work with but we look set to have more opportunities to figure that out with the long route to the World Cup seeming more likely with every match.

10.03 EDT

95 mins: Both sides are hurrying with time running out but suddenly Indonesia look just as likely to score. Silvera wins a free kick with a darting run down the left and will take the free kick with Australia loading up on their options in the box.

10.00 EDT

93 mins: Half way through the allocated stoppage time and Indonesia have decided to play out the back. It almost opens up an opportunity for Baccus but his forward pass into the box is blocked. The hosts look to break away from the rebound but Silvera isn’t taking any risks and tugs a shirt to accept a late yellow card.

Share
10 Sept 2024
09.58 EDT

90 mins: That’s the end of regulation time and the chances are drying up. But there will be a minimum of six minutes of stoppage time for one of these sides to find a breakthrough.

09.57 EDT

88 mins: Indonesia are defending deep and Australia are running out of ideas. Left-back Behich is removed and Kye Rowles is called on. The Socceroos look to be resorting to long bombs into the box, but times are getting desperate.

09.55 EDT

84 mins: Silvera drives into the box but can’t find enough space between a pair of Indonesia defenders as the ball trickles out for yet another corner. Silvera takes it, with Goodwin subbed off some time ago, and predictably finds Souttar at the far post. The centre-back’s header falls into a melee of players, while Circati can only blast the rebound into the same packed mass.

79 mins: Indonesia have made two more changes, with Thom Haye on for Jenner a little while back, and now Pratama Arhan joins in place of Ferdinan. The hosts are defending desperately now, as Australia start whipping in cross after cross. Mabil gets on the end of one but heads it wide.

76 mins: The better chances are falling to Awer Mabil at the moment as he drifts in from the right. On another night he might have found the net by now with a touch more composure, but he has certainly been a livewire across just 10 minutes of play.

09.45 EDT

72 mins: The clock is ticking and time is running out for Australia to find a much-needed breakthrough. It’s important that they remain composed even as the pressure mounts, especially as the game is becoming more and more stretched.

Rob Haigh wonders where the attacking threat might come from: “What’s on the bench? 0-0 here and they can kiss an chance of automatic qualification goodbye, because their next 3 opponents will shut them out.”

John Iredale is available, after getting a call up in place of Kusini Yengi, while Martin Boyle might well replace Silvera if only for an energy boost.

09.39 EDT

69 mins: This has suddenly turned into a see-sawing affair and the raucous crowd have joined the ride. Indonesia scream for a penalty for a challenge in their box that is rightly waved away. Almost immediately at the other end, Souttar nods down from a corner and there are appeals for handball – but it had in fact crashed into an Indonesia defender’s face with can only be described as a classic “falcon”.

09.37 EDT

66 mins: Adam Taggart is brought on for Mitch Duke and almost has the most critical of immediate impacts. After some clever play between Silvera and Mabil, the striker has two bites at the ball as it bounces around the box but the best of them, the second, flies straight at keeper Paes. What an opportunity that was!

At the same time, Josh Nisbet as replaced Goodwin.

59 mins: First change for the Socceroos and Irankunda is taken out of the action with Awer Mabil coming on in his place. Mabil looks to be taking Irankunda’s place alongside Duke in a 4-4-2, as the game seems to be stretching out a little now.

54 mins: Irankunda gives the ball away too easily in the midfield and it is soon with Oratmangoen who carries it into the box with only Souttar standing in his way. But the Indonesia striker can’t find a way around the long-legged defender and a shot is easily blocked.

While the dark patches are growing across the surface in Jakarta, Chris Paraskevas seems to be suggesting that the Socceroos should be at least somewhat used to it:

“Complaining about the pitch condition? We live in an AFL / NRL purgatory - when have football pitches ever been the jewel in our crown? How about admitting that we couldn’t break down a significantly lower ranked nation in that first half. Outside of Irankunda’s speculator, exactly when did we start playing Total Football? Never looked like scoring.”

46 mins: We’re back underway at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta and the home side have made a change. Striker Rafael Struick has been removed while Witan Sulaeman enters the fray. Australia with the kick-off.

Australia still have much to do against Indonesia, especially with the score stuck on 0-0, but both sides are being helped by China’s efforts at home to Saudi Arabia. That Group C clash is all tied up at 1-1 at half-time although the higher ranked Saudis have been reduced to 10 men.

That represents some mildly positive news in China after their FA banned 38 players for life in a crackdown on match-fixing and gambling:

While the Socceroos have been able to knock the ball around, at times with apparent ease in part to silence the crowd, the field has hardly helped with dark, roughed up patches. It was no doubt not helped by 100,000 attendees trample on it as the Pope visited Jakarta last week.

Nicholas Murphy has written in to question the standard of the surface, which admittedly does seem to be an issue that Australia often face when playing away from home:

“This pitch is a lumpy disgrace. Surely fifa needs to come up with stricter guidelines for what’s acceptable in wcqs.”

09.03 EDT

Graham Arnold should be pleased with how his additions to the starting XI are stepping up, with Silvera busy on the right and showing glimpses of his obvious talents while Irankunda should frankly never be considered as merely a “game-changer” from here on in.

Matthew Stephens is back with a fair comment on Silvera’s impact and what it might mean for a Socceroos stalwart:

“It’s been sadly obvious that Boyle hasn’t been the same since returning from injury for either club or country. Arnie has finally seen the light with the selection of Silvera. Hope he can make the position his own tonight.”

Half-time: Indonesia 0-0 Australia

Australia have responded to their defeat to Bahrain with almost everything they could have hoped for – that is, everything except for an ever elusive goal.

Indonesia came storming out of the blocks as 78,000 fans willed them on, having a shot in the first minute then three corners in quick succession. Australia have been on top almost since that opening frenzy, have 63% possession with four shots including two on target.

Irankunda came the closest when beating Indonesia gloveman Paes but not the right upright, while Goodwin had perhaps the best of the chances less than a minute later when put through by a Baccus pass but blasting the ball into the keeper.

Australia had one last chance in first-half stoppage time as Silvera was pulled back for a foul well short of the box. Goodwin found Souttar with the free kick who headed it across goal but just out of reach of Circati.

The Socceroos might be frustrated not to get the breakthrough, but it has been a much improved showing from what they produced on the Gold Coast last week and the test will now be to keep their heads.

44 mins: Yellow for Baccus as the ball strikes his forearm just as Indonesia are looking to counter. Australia had it covered at the back so that was an unnecessary intervention from the midfielder.

08.47 EDT

41 mins: The referee set the tone with an early card for Goodwin, which was probably there, but he lets Struick get away with dragging Souttar down unnecessarily. There are signs of panic setting in now for the hosts as Australia look to maintain their momentum after a frantic five minutes or so.

38 mins: The ball is living in Australia’s front half but Indonesia threaten to counter after clearing a corner. Irankunda tracks back to shut it down any looming threat with a tackle in the centre of the pitch.

35 mins: Goodwin is through on goal after gathering a scything pass from Baccus but with only the keeper to beat he slams the ball straight at Paes standing tall. The winger needed to do better there but Australia are in the ascendancy.

33 mins: Irankunda strikes from distance and very nearly scores. Indonesia keeper Paes was beaten but the ball rumbles into the bottom of post, then bounces off Paes’ back and dribbles across the goalface before it is cleared. This has been an exciting start from Australia but they are still to make the hosts pay.

A threat on both sides of the ball 😤

23 mins: Australia keep the foot on the throat as they push forward again while Indonesia can only scramble the ball away for another corner. This one is much better from Goodwin and he picks out Souttar at the far post, but the towering defender can only head the ball down as Paes knocks it away on the bounce.

20 mins: Three chances in a matter of seconds for Australia and somehow Indonesia keep the ball out of the net. The best fell to Circati with a volley that was heading towards the open side of the goal before a fortunate block by a defender. Souttar followed up with a low rocket that Paes was able to knock down then parry away. Positive signs!

12 mins: Australia earn a corner and Indonesia seem to well aware of the looming threat as there is plenty of jostling in the box before Goodwin shuffles in and sends a cross too flat. The Socceroos appear to have weathered the storm, at least for the time being, and are starting to play with more confidence as they move the ball around quickly.

9 mins: A little bit of the sting goes out of the match, which is just what the Socceroos would have wanted, but the crowd are quick to call for a yellow card to Goodwin for a late challenge on Jenner.

Martin Stephens has written in to say there might be much more to come from the 78,000 fans at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium:

“I read that the Aussies said they would not be intimated by the crowd at Gelora Bung Karno. I’ve been to several matches there and I can tell you the crowd is seriously intimidating. The noise is crazy and the vibe is edgy. But they can also very quickly turn on their own team if things go badly.”

And just as the captains come together for the toss of the coin, Rob Haigh has given the Socceroos the hair dryer treatment with a last-minute rev up over email:

“After that disastrous result, the Socceroos OWE the nation BIG TIME!....pull yer socks up guys and GRAFT, lets see who steps up to the plate and says ‘I’m gonna score goals’.....NO EXCUSES NOW.....WIN AND WIN BIG!!”

It’s hard to disagree.

A reminder, if you’re just checking, that Socceroos coach Graham Arnold has swung five changes to the starting XI with Nestory Irankunda and Sammy Silvera among those added to the line-up. Teenage sensation Irankunda might well be starting alongside Mitch Duke in a 4-4-2 formation – all will be confirmed in a minute or two, as the national anthems are winding down.

The last clash was at the Asian Cup earlier this year as the Socceroos made their way into the last 16 with a 4-0 victory after an early own goal forced Indonesia to change how they were set up to play. Martin Boyle, starting as a substitute today, headed home just before half-time, while Craig Goodwin added a third and Harry Souttar sealed the win in stoppage time.

Socceroos coach Graham Arnold has demanded a response to the tame defeat to Bahrain, when Australia only had four shots on goal from 70% possession, even as his side faces Indonesia in front of 78,000 fans.

“We know their strengths, we know their system that they play and their style that they play,” Arnold said. “It’s just about getting our game right and making sure our mentality [is good]. We obviously didn’t have the right result the first game but for me it’s about seeing the reaction from the players in this game.”

Indonesia will be far from the easy beats that their Fifa ranking of 133 might suggest, even if Australia were able to brush them aside with a resounding 4-0 triumph at the Asian Cup just seven months ago. Indonesia’s performance in Saudi Arabia would have been welcomed by the Socceroos, as it prevented their rivals from opening up a three-point gap over them in the race for a top-two spot, but that is where the degree of comfort should end.

As John Duerden explains, this is a vastly different side to the one that Australia faced earlier this year, especially as “nine of the 11 who took the field at the King Abdullah Sports City were born in Europe and, due to Indonesian heritage, naturalised.”

It is not only the XI on the pitch that the Socceroos will have to contend with, but also the 78,000 fans in the stands at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium.

A quick reminder of how we got here. Australia coasted through the initial two phases of 2026 World Cup qualification, looking most impressive in the second round as they piled on 22 goals while conceding zero is six commanding victories from as many matches.

But a lacklustre display that ended in a disappointing defeat to Bahrain last week leaves this as almost a must-win game against Indonesia. Bahrain frustrated the highly fancied Australia before their belated smash ‘n grab, but you would hope coach Graham Arnold took some harsh lessons from the loss rather than just reaffirmation that Asian teams know how to niggle the Socceroos.

“You could see physically they were ready for us,” Arnold said after the match. “It was just one of those nights ... if there’s any learning curve it’s the frustration around play-acting. They parked the bus, six at the back, had numbers ... these types of things happen in football, it’s how you get over it.”

Australia XI

Graham Arnold has made clear that he’s looking for a reaction in Jakarta and the Australia coach is the first to respond to the troubling defeat to Bahrain by naming a lively starting XI.

Wunderkind Nestory Irankunda starts against Indonesia after showing promising signs when coming off the bench against Bahrain, while Sammy Silvera has a huge opportunity to impress and should offer a spark with his blistering pace. It isn’t quite all-out attack but Australia need to test the opposition more than they did against Bahrain, and have again named Craig Goodwin – one of the better performers last week – with a recall for veteran forward Mitch Duke.

Keanu Baccus returns to bolster the midfield alongside Jackson Irvine, while the defence has a familiar look although many had hoped Alessandro Circati would be given time to settle next to Harry Souttar at centre-back. Cam Burgess is also back.

Kye Rowles, Aiden O’Neill, Connor Metcalfe, Martin Boyle and the suspended Kusini Yengi are the five to make way from the starting XI against Bahrain.

Socceroos XI: Maty Ryan (GK, capt), Alessandro Circati, Harry Souttar, Cam Burgess, Aziz Behich, Keanu Baccus, Jackson Irvine, Sammy Silvera, Craig Goodwin, Nestory Irankunda, Mitch Duke

Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Socceroos’ clash with Indonesia as part of the Asian third round qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup. Australia will be out to kickstart their campaign in this qualification phase in Jakarta, after they could hardly have got off to a worse start with a shock 1-0 defeat to Bahrain on home soil last week.

The Socceroos enjoyed 70% possession in that match on the Gold Coast but it was an all too familiar story as the hosts lacked enough creative ideas let alone a cutting edge, even if it was still something of a surprise when Bahrain wrote their own fairytale finish with an 89th-minute own goal off Harry Souttar’s outstretched boot. Forward Kusini Yengi was shown a straight red for a high foot earlier in the second half against Bahrain and will be missing from this encounter with Indonesia, perhaps forcing coach Graham Arnold’s hand to introduce fresh blood to his starting XI (more on that shortly).

Australia need an instant reaction with little room for further error after Japan walloped China 7-0 in their opener to take pole position in Group C, while Indonesia impressed with a 1-1 draw in Saudi Arabia. The top two teams in the group will automatically qualify for the 2026 World Cup, while the third, fourth and perhaps even fifth-place finishers will take a much longer, nervy route.

Teams are in and will be listed here post haste, with some exciting news for Socceroos fans.

Kick off is 10pm AEST / 7pm local time at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta. Let’s get into it!
