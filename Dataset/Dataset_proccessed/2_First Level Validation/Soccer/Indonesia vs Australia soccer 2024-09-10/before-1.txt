Socceroos coach Graham Arnold is demanding a positive reaction from his players against Indonesia after a horror start to their World Cup qualifying campaign.

Australia's bid to directly qualify for football's grandest stage in 2026 hit an early speed bump with a dire 1-0 home loss to Bahrain on the Gold Coast last Thursday.

The Socceroos also came under fire for their lack of creativity against the world number 80, after having 70 per cent of the ball but firing just four tame shots on goal.

When asked about Indonesia's players, Arnold was quick to turn the focus onto his charges ahead of Tuesday night's game at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta.

"We know their strengths, we know their system that they play and their style that they play," he said.

"It's just about getting our game right and making sure our mentality (is good).

"We obviously didn't have the right result the first game but for me it's about seeing the reaction from the players in this game."

Veteran left-back Aziz Behich echoed Arnold's sentiments and stressed the players had got back to work with a positive attitude.

"Obviously we were all disappointed. Not the way we wanted to start this phase," he said.

"We know as a group we were below par, there's no doubt about it, but it's all about how we react and how we respond mentally.

"Obviously leading into this game we've got to put this game behind us, it's only one game. We've got a lot of games ahead of us but we've just got to focus on this Indonesia game now.

"The group's been great. We've had a good few sessions here. The boys have recovered well and it's more about just being positive, obviously knowing that we can be better and we will be better.

"That's been the main messaging, especially to the younger boys as well. Everyone's excited and no doubt the atmosphere's going to be great — so as a footballer there's nothing better than playing in front of a full stadium."

The sellout crowd at the 78,000-capacity stadium is expected to be fiercely parochial.

Arnold indicated that could pile pressure on Indonesia to perform, and expected the Socceroos to handle the heat.

The Socceroos's official pre-match training session was called off due to torrential rain at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium, with organisers wanting to preserve the pitch.

Australia instead had to return to their training base for their final session.

Kusini Yengi (suspension) won't play, with John Iredale a late call-up to the squad, while midfielder Keanu Baccus should return.
