On the other hand, Ghana suffered a 2-1 loss to Cape Verde after conceding a late goal by Garry Rodrigues in the 92nd minute.

Egypt vs Ghana key players to watch

Egypt's lineup is expected to include key players like Mohamed Salah, who is in excellent form this season, playing a crucial role in Liverpool's lineup. Other notable players in the Egyptian team are Trezeguet and Elneny.

For Ghana, Mohammed Kudus is a player to watch, bringing creativity and goal-scoring ability to the team. The return of Kudus, who missed the opening match due to an injury, is a significant boost for Ghana.

Egypt vs Ghana recent form and possible lineups

Egypt's recent form has been relatively stable with a draw and three wins in their last five matches across all competitions. Their predicted lineup in a 4-3-3 formation includes El Shenawy; Gabr, Hegazi, Abdelmonem, Hamdy; Elneny, Fathy, Zizo; Salah, Mohamed, Trezeguet.

The two teams have faced each other 23 times, with Egypt winning 12, Ghana winning 5, and 6 matches ending in draws.

Egypt vs Ghana injuries and suspensions

Egypt has had to manage without players like Osama Galal and Ahmed Nabil Koita due to pre-tournament injuries, and there's also a concern over Mohamad Hany who was substituted in their opener against Mozambique due to an injury.

Ghana, meanwhile has a fully fit squad with no new major injury concerns. They are expected to include Inaki Williams and Andre Ayew in their starting lineup.

Egypt vs Ghana match analysis and prediction

The match between these two African football powerhouses is anticipated to be closely contested. Egypt's recent form suggests a stronger position, especially with Salah's presence. Ghana, despite their recent struggles, cannot be underestimated, particularly with the potential inclusion of Kudus in their lineup.

Given both teams' performances in their opening matches and overall recent form, Egypt appears to be slightly favoured. However, football often defies predictions, and Ghana's talent and potential for improvement could lead to a competitive match.

Egypt vs Ghana betting tips and possible outcomes

Considering the factors above, a common betting tip could be to bet on Egypt to win, given their stronger recent form and historical dominance over Ghana.
