In what is one of the more competitive match-ups taking place in the UEFA Nations League group stage tonight, Denmark and Switzerland go head-to-head at Parken Stadium in Copenhagen.

With it being at home, Denmark are marginal favourites at 11/8 to come away with the win, while the visitors are 19/10 to cause an upset.

For those predicting a draw, that is priced at odds of 21/10.
