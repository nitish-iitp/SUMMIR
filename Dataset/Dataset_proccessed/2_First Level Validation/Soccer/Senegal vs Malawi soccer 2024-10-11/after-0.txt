Zitheka? Malawi’s Flames face uphill battle against Senegal in Afcon qualifiers today
 October 11, 2024  Our reporter Be the first to comment

As the Malawi National Football Team prepares to clash with Africa’s highest-ranked side today, Senegal’s Lions of Teranga, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Scheduled for a crucial 2025 TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier at the Diamniadio Olympic Stadium in Dakar, this match is pivotal for the Flames, who find themselves in a precarious position after two disappointing losses.

The Flames opened their Group L campaign with a heartbreaking 3-2 defeat to Burundi Swallows, followed by a 3-1 loss to Burkina Faso in Bamako, leaving them at the bottom of the group without a point. With four matches remaining, Malawi’s path to qualification is fraught with challenges, necessitating victories in all their upcoming games, starting with back-to-back matches against Senegal.

Coach Patrick Mabedi, despite the odds stacked against his team, remains optimistic. “There’s a lot at stake to play for,” he stated in a pre-match interview. “We need to dig deep so that we can have at least some points. Good results are very important for us.” Mabedi’s confidence is commendable, but it will be put to the test against a formidable Senegalese squad brimming with talent.

Senegal boasts a lineup filled with Europe-based superstars, including Chelsea’s Nicholas Jackson, Crystal Palace’s Ismaïla Sarr, and Al Nassr’s Sadio Mane, the nation’s all-time top scorer. This roster represents not just individual skill, but also a cohesive team that recently showcased its quality on the international stage, making them a daunting opponent for any side, particularly one struggling like Malawi.

Mabedi acknowledged the challenge, but also framed it as a source of motivation: “We all know Senegal has big players, big names, but at the end of the day, it’s 11 against 11.”

While Senegal’s depth of talent is impressive, Malawi’s squad is less seasoned, with only seven foreign-based players. The return of first-choice goalkeeper Brighton Munthali and the inclusion of Isaac Kaliati and Lloyd Njaliwa are positive developments, but Mabedi is not spoiled for choice. His likely starting XI will see Munthali in goal, supported by a defense anchored by Stanley Sanudi, Dennis Chembezi, and Lawrence Chaziya, with Timothy Silwimba potentially making his debut at left-back.

In midfield, the Flames will likely adopt a combative approach with ball-winners like Lloyd Aaron and captain John CJ Banda, while Chimwemwe Idana takes on an attacking role. The forward line will be spearheaded by Chawanangwa Kaonga, supported by wingers Yamikani Chester and Lanjesi Nkhoma.

For the Flames, today’s match is more than just a game; it represents a defining moment in their campaign. A win could reinvigorate their hopes of qualifying for Afcon, providing a much-needed boost in confidence as they return to Lilongwe for the second leg on Tuesday.

However, should they falter once more, it could spell disaster for their aspirations, leaving them with little more than an uphill battle to salvage their campaign. As the Flames take to the field in Dakar, all eyes will be on them—not just to witness a match, but to see if they can rise to the occasion against one of Africa’s elite teams. The resilience and character they display will determine their fate in this crucial qualifier.
