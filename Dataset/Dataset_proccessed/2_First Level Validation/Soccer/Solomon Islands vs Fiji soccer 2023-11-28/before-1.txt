Solomon Islands national team head coach Felipe Vega-Arango says the Sol2023 XVII Pacific Games semi-final against Fiji will be their hardest test of the year.

Both teams respectively came out winners of their groups.

This year the Solomon Islands team played seven (7) International test matches before the games. In the March and June International windows and winning the 2023 Melanesian Cup in New Caledonia – won five (5), draw one (1) and lost one (1).

“It is an international tournament semi-final, a harder game of the year it will be so far for us,” Felipe told SIFF Media.

“We must be humble and competitive. We need to compete really well and be smart.

Fiji pulled of a nail-biting nil all draw with Tahiti in Group B and 10-0 win against Northern Mariana to see them through on goal difference.

“No mistakes in the back and be aggressive off the ball because we have to work really hard and play as team,” Felipe said with anticipation.

The crucial clash is set for Tuesday 28th November 2023, 3pm at the Lawson Tama stadium.

About SIFF
Football is officially recognised as the national sport in the Solomon Islands. With numerous competitions running year-round, the Solomon Islands Football Federation (SIFF) has a busy time ensuring the game continues to grow and develop. SIFF was founded in 1978 and became a full FIFA member in 1988 largely thanks to the late Alan Boso who saw the potential of Solomon Islands football. Since then the association has grown from strength to strength.
