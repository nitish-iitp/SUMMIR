Goals tend to be sparse for Gibraltar, but their strike against Liechtenstein on Sunday in the Nations League was one to remember.

The 198th-ranked side grabbed an early lead at home when Liam Walker scored an Olimpico from the corner flag.

It goes down as Gibraltar’s first competitive goal in 713 days, scored against Georgia in September 2022.

Walker, who is also the country’s record appearance maker, now holds the all-time goal record (six).

That was not the only goal in this crazy match, though, as things went on to finish 2-2.

Liechtenstein equalized via Ferhat Saglam and Walker later missed a penalty to retake the lead with only eight minutes to go. And the drama didn’t end there!

The visitors found the back of the net in the 92nd minute, but the goal was wiped off due to offside.

Gibraltar then finally scored their second of the night in the 97th minute via Manchester United academy star James Scanlon.

Their historic victory was not to be, however, as a Nicolas Hasler penalty in the 104th minute saw things end all square.

What a game!
