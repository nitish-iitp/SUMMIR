The United States escaped defeat with an own goal in the sixth minute of second-half stoppage time, Haji Wright scored twice in extra time and the Americans rallied past Jamaica 3-1 on Thursday night to reach the Concacaf Nations League final.

Greg Leigh scored just 30 seconds into the game for the Reggae Boyz, and the Americans were on the verge of losing their third straight match, after successive defeats to Trinidad and Tobago, and Slovenia. Instead, Wright scored in the sixth and 19th minutes of extra time and the US will try to win the Nations League for the third straight time on Sunday.

Both of Wright’s goals were set up by Gio Reyna, who entered at the start of the second half after being limited to 42 minutes over four substitute appearances for Nottingham Forest since he was loaned from Borussia Dortmund in January.

Four minutes of second-half stoppage time originally were signaled and later five, and the clock was at 95:25 when Christian Pulisic’s corner kick to the near post was headed on by Miles Robinson. The ball deflected off Jamaican forward Corey Burke and past goalkeeper Andre Blake. It was the latest goal for the Americans since Ricardo Clark scored in the seventh minute of stoppage time to beat Venezuela 1-0 in 2012.

Wright, whose stoppage-time goal last weekend lifted Coventry City to an FA Cup quarter-final, was a late injury replacement on the roster and had not played for the US since the 2022 World Cup. His first goal came six minutes into extra-time. Reyna picked up the ball just past the center circle and he side-footed a through ball to Wright, who cut left to create space and slotted past Blake.

Then, in the 109th minute, Reyna won a ball from Keroy Anderson and made another incisive pass through the defense. Wright spun to control the ball and scored from eight yards for his fourth goal in eight international appearances.

Leigh put Jamaica ahead after a throw-in deflected off Antonee Robinson to Fulham teammate Bobby De Cordova-Reid, who lofted the ball past Chris Richards and across goal. Leigh was left unmarked by Joe Scally and headed the ball past Matt Turner for his first goal in 13 international appearances.

Scally started at right-back in place of Sergiño Dest, who was suspended after he was sent off for arguing with the referee against Trinidad and Tobago in November.

There was a sparse crowd for the first half at AT&T Stadium, where Mexico were due to play in the second game of the doubleheader. With the US in new red, white and blue uniforms, Miles Robinson was the only American starter from Major League Soccer.

Jamaica were missing many of their top players. Michail Antonio, Leon Bailey and Trivante Stewart were not with the team and Demarai Gray and Shamari Nicholson were suspended.
