Tonight’s Starting XI has an average age of 24 years, 186 days. The lineup also averages 29 caps and 19 in official competition.
With all 22 players dressed age 21 or older, tonight’s match marks the first time that zero players under 21 will appear for the USMNT since the Gold Cup Final against Jamaica on July 26, 2017 in Santa Clara, Calif.
Ten of 11 starters were part of the 2023 Nations League winning squad last June in Las Vegas. Only Malik Tillman did not take part in the tournament.
Weston McKennie earns his 50th cap tonight. The Little Elm, Texas product becomes the 61st USMNT player to reach the half-century mark in appearances. McKennie also makes his team-leading 13th Concacaf Nations League appearance.
Christian Pulisic captains the team for the 20th time tonight, tying former teammate Clint Dempsey for ninth on the USMNT captains list. The USA is 14-2-3 when Pulisic wears the armband.
With the start, Pulisic will be the only player to appear in all five of the USA’s matches at the CNL Final Four since the inaugural tournament in 2021.
Having debuted in last year’s CNL Final against Mexico, striker Folarin Balogun makes his ninth-straight start for the USMNT in matches where he has been on the roster. Balogun has three goals and two assists in his previous eight caps.
Chris Richards and Miles Robinson partner in central defense for the sixth time tonight. The USMNT is 4-1-0 when the two pair together on the backline.
Both Miles Robinson and Matt Turner started the USA’s last match at AT&T Stadium, helping keep the clean sheet in the 1-0 win against Jamaica in the Gold Cup quarterfinal on July 25, 2021.
Defender Antonee Robinson has scored in each of his last two appearances for the USMNT, tallying in both legs of the CNL quarterfinals against Trinidad and Tobago.
Winger Tim Weah makes his third career appearance against the country of his mother’s birth. Weah played in both qualifying matches against Jamaica during the 2022 cycle, scoring the U.S. goal in the 1-1 draw with the Reggae Boyz on Nov. 16, 2021 in Kingston.
Defender Joe Scally starts his second-straight match at the CNL Final Four, after putting in a strong performance in the 2-0 win against Canada at the 2023 Final in Las Vegas.
Defender Sergiño Dest is serving a one-match suspension tonight after receiving a red card in the team’s last CNL match at Trinidad and Tobago on Nov. 20, 2023. 
Substitutes Tyler Adams and Haji Wright dress for their first USMNT matches since the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
Gregg Berhalter is 41-14-12 in 67 matches as USMNT head coach. The USA is 26-7-7 in competitive matches under Berhalter, with his .738 winning percentage the highest among USMNT head coaches with a minimum of eight matches in official competition.
Five substitutions are allowed in three different moments. Halftime does not count as a substitution moment. Teams will be allowed an additional substitute if the match goes to extra time.
Tonight’s match will be refereed by Selvin Brown of Honduras. This is the first USMNT match that Mr. Brown has officiated as the center referee.
