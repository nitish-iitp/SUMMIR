Japan and Thailand begin their Asian Cup preparation with a tune-up game at the Japan National Stadium on New Year's Day.

The Samurai Blue's first game at the finals comes against Vietnam on January 14, while Changsuek have two days extra before facing Kyrgyzstan on January 16.

Despite the absence of Premier League or LaLiga stars, Japan's Asian Cup preparations begin with a friendly against Thailand on January 1, with the Samurai Blue keen to extend their winning streak heading into the competition.

Hajime Moriyasu's men have claimed eight consecutive victories since losing to Colombia in a March 2023 friendly, and the sequence of results since that loss must please fans of the East Asian nation.

Pleasing about the country's impressive run is the free-scoring nature of the side, with two goals in a 2-0 success over Tunisia in October, the lowest margin of victory recorded by Moriyasu's team.

Victories over Germany (4-1), Canada (4-1) and Peru (4-1) have been admirable, while there was a commendable 4-2 triumph over Turkey in October, pointing to a side that has goals in them heading into the finals in Qatar.

Japan have home advantage on New Year's Day, and they seek to assert their superiority over Thailand with another resounding performance and result.

While their opponents would be keen to put up a fight, it is unlikely this will result in a positive outcome for the War Elephants owing to their below-par form in competitive and non-competitive games.

Masatada Ishii's men did claim a 3-1 win over Singapore in AFC World Cup qualifying in November, ending a four-game run without a victory in all competitions.

Three games in that run ended in losses, with the 8-0 beatdown against Georgia, the most striking result in a sequence that emphasised the limitations of the Southeast Asian nation.

Finding the back of the net three times against Singapore was an anomaly, as it was the first time since January 2023 that the War Elephants had netted as many.

Repeating that may not materialise against Japan, but Thailand will give everything in search of a positive result at the Japan National Stadium.

With Premier League stars like Liverpool's Wataru Endo still absent and Brighton & Hove Albion wide attacker Kaoru Mitoma sidelined, Moriyasu's squad comprises a few younger players, even if Monaco star Takumi Minamino may play a part on Monday.

Sanfrecce Hiroshima midfielder Takumu Kawamura could make his Japan debut, while Kaishu Sano, who played for the national team for the first time in November, should be involved again.

Thailand's veteran captain, Theerathon Bunmathan, is part of the group, and the 33-year-old should lead the underdogs on Monday.

Suphanat Mueanta netted twice for the War Elephants in that 3-1 WCQ win over Singapore but is unavailable; Supachok Sarachart also netted in that success, and the attacking midfielder could start against the Japanese.


Japan possible starting lineup:
Suzuki; Sugawara, Taniguchi, Machida, Ito; Tanaka, Sano; Doan, Minamino, Asano; Ueda

Thailand possible starting lineup:
Tedsungnoen; Praisuwan, Thongsong, Dolah, Bunmathan; Yooyen, Sookjitthammakul, Panya; Phala, Poeiphimai, Sarachart



We say: Japan 4-1 Thailand

Despite the absence of some Japanese stars — Endo, Mitoma and Takefusa Kubo — the Samurai Blue should dispatch Thailand on home turf on New Year's Day.
