HOMENEWSTHE THAOJAPAN WANTS TO WIN AGAINST THAILAND TO CREATE A RECORD
Japan wants to win against Thailand to create a record
VnExpress
December 31, 2023




JapaneseIf Japan beat Thailand tomorrow January 1, 2024, they will set a record of winning nine consecutive matches for the first time.

Japan’s winning streak has been going on since June 2023, with six friendlies won by a score of 6-0 against El Salvador, 4-1 against Peru, 4-1 against Germany, 4-2 against Turkey, 4-1 against Canada and 2-0 against Tunisia. In November, Japan defeated Myanmar and Syria by the same score of 11-5 in the second round of the 0 World Cup qualifiers – Asian zone.

If Japan wins against Thailand at home, it will not only set a record of nine consecutive wins but also start the new year on a good note. “The first win of the new year will motivate the players,” coach Hajime Moriyasu said at the press conference on the afternoon of 31/12. “We want good results leading to the Asian Cup and World Cup.”

Japan and Thailand have faced 29 matches, in which the team from the land of the rising sun won 20, drew six and lost three. The most recent loss was 1-3 in a friendly in 1997. In the last six matches, Japan won all, scoring 20 and conceding only two goals.

In this rematch, Thailand has just appointed Japanese coach Masatada Ishii to replace Mano Polking. Coach Moriyasu assessed that his compatriots' tactics were very accurate. “He has studied Japan more than anyone else,” the 55-year-old military leader said. “I think this will be a difficult match.”

Japan brings together talents from the best football backgrounds in Europe, except England with Takehiro Tomiyasu (Arsenal), Kaoru Mitoma (Brighton) and Wataru Endo (Liverpool). Notable stars are midfielder Takumi Minamino (Monaco), Ritsu Doan (SC Freiburg), Junya Ito (Reims) or striker Takuma Asano (VfL Bochum).

Japan chose Thailand to play a friendly because there are two Southeast Asian teams in Group D of the 2023 Asian Cup: Vietnam and Indonesia. The remaining opponent is Iraq.

Coach Moriyasu aims to help Japan win the Asian Cup in Qatar, since the last time he was crowned in 2011. In addition, he has the ambition to help Japan win the World Cup for the first time. "The dream I want to come true the most is to help Japan win the World Cup," he said.

Thailand's best performance at the World Cup is reaching the 1/8 round four times in 2002, 2010, 2018 and 2022. However, the team finished in 17 world are playing better and better under coach Hajime Moriyasu, notably defeating Spain and Germany with the same score of 2-1 in the group stage of the 2022 World Cup.
