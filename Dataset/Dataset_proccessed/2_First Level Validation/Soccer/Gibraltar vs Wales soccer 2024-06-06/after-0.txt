Wales begin their preparations for the upcoming UEFA Nations League campaign by travelling to Portugal to face minnows Gibraltar in a friendly.

The Dragons had hoped to be building towards this summer's European Championship, but the heartbreaking penalty shootout defeat to Poland in March's play-off final put paid to those dreams.

Wales boss Rob Page is unable to call upon a number of regulars for this international break, as defensive duo Connor Roberts and Joe Rodon have withdrawn from the squad and attacking midfielder David Brooks suffered an injury in the Championship play-off final.

Watch Gibraltar v Wales on Premier Sports

A Welsh victory is to be expected regardless because Gibraltar have lost their last 13 games without scoring - the latest being a 2-0 defeat to Scotland at the Estádio Algarve on Monday.

Wales should be provided with the challenge of trying to break down a stubborn defence, however, as the Scots managed just five shots on target and took nearly an hour to breach Gibraltar's backline.
