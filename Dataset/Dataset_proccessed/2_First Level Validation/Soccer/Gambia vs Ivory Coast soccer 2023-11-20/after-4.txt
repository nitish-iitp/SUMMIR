The Gambia must beat Ivory Coast in their second qualifier match today, Monday, 20th November 2023 at the Dar-es-Salam stadium at 4pm to fancy their 2026 World Cup qualification aspirations.

The Scorpions slipped to Burundi 3-2 in their global biggest football showpiece qualifier opening match played at the Dar-es-Salam stadium on Thursday 16th November 2023.

The Gambia is currently without a point in Group G of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers after one group match.

Coach Tom Saintfiet and his charges must overcome Ivory Coast in their second group match to maintain their ambitions of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup.
