Marcolini says Malta ready for tough Moldova challenge in UEFA Nations League

The Malta national football team’s ambition of winning promotion in the UEFA Nations League is facing a major test in Chisinau when they open their UEFA Nations League campaign against Moldova at the Stadionul Zimbru on Saturday evening (kick-off: 18.00).

When Michele Marcolini replaced Devis Mangia as the new Malta coach in December 2022, MFA president Bjorn Vassallo made it clear that the Italian mentor’s main task was that of leading the national team to their first-ever promotion in the UEFA Nations League.

So far, Malta has failed to reach this objective in both editions held in 2020 and 2022, as on each occasion the team had to settle for second place in the group behind first the Faroe Islands and then Estonia.

This time round, Malta have no margin for error, even though the draw was anything but favourable as they were drawn against arguably one the strongest sides in League D in Moldova.

However, encouraging performances in the World Cup qualifying campaigns against the likes of Ukraine, England as well as Greece and Slovenia at home in friendly matches show that this team can have their say against countries of more or less the same level.

Speaking during a news conference on the eve of the match, coach Marcolini admitted that promotion in the UEFA Nations League was the team’s primary objective.

“When I arrived in Malta I immediately understood that the UEFA Nations League was always going to be the primary target of my tenure,” Marcolini said.

“Now that the competition is here, I am eager to embark on this new chapter. Our ultimate goal is to win games and secure promotion to League C.

“No doubt, this campaign is a major focus for the national team.”

Major test

An opening match against Moldova on away turf, poses a major challenge for Marcolini and his charges.

“There is no doubt in my mind that on paper Moldova are the strongest team in our group,” Marcolini said.

“They enjoyed a very solid Euro 2024 qualifying campaign in which they secured a very impressive victory against Poland, a team that eventually progressed to the tournament finals. So that is testament of the strength of this team.

“It’s going to be a very difficult challenge for us but we are up for it and we will take the pitch determined to give everything we have and try to return home with the best possible result.”

Asked on his team’s major challenges today, Marcolini admitted that Moldova enjoy the edge as they are playing in front of their fans.

“Facing Moldova in Chisinau is a very tough challenge as they will be playing in front of the home fans,” Marcolini said.

“I am expecting Moldova to be very aggressive and we need to keep an eye on their experienced players, and in particular to midfielder Artur Ionita who has gained a lot of experience during his playing spell in Italy.

“But there are other young players who are very talented and who are making a name for themselves abroad so it’s going to be a great test for us.

“The fact that they have so many players who are plying their trade abroad is surely a great advantage for a team like Moldova when playing key matches on the international scene.”

Marcolini is without three experienced players for today’s match as defensive duo Steve Borg and Enrico Pepe as well as midfielder Bjorn Kristensen were all ruled out of the game due to injury.

Goalkeeper Henry Bonello said that the absence of

his Ħamrun Spartans team-mate Steve Borg was a major miss.

“Having a player of the quality of Steve Borg, who boasts so much experience in key matches for the national team is always a big miss,” Bonello said.

“However, we still have a lot of quality in the team to try and fill the void of those players who didn’t make it for this match.

“We are all looking forward to this match and we are determined to get the best possible result.

“Our goal has not changed. We want to win the group and win promotion to League C.”
