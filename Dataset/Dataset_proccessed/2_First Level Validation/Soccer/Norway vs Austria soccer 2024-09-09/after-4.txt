MARTIN ODEGAARD SUFFERS ANKLE SPRAIN AGAINST AUSTRIA, NORWAY MANAGER STALE SOLBAKKEN CONFIRMS - 'IT LOOKED PAINFUL'
BYJONNY BRAY

PUBLISHED 10/09/2024 AT 07:29 GMT

Arsenal's Martin Odegaard is a doubt for Sunday's north London derby at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium after limping off the pitch during Norway's Nations League triumph over Austria. The midfielder was replaced in the 67th minute, but Norway still managed to capture all three points thanks to another goal from Manchester City striker Erling Haaland. The 2-1 win leaves them second in their group.

Norway manager Stale Solbakken has revealed that Martin Odegaard suffered an "ankle sprain" in Norway's 2-1 win against Austria in the Nations League.
The Arsenal midfielder limped off the pitch in the 67th minute with the score level at 1-1 after former Manchester United midfielder Marcel Sabitzer cancelled out Felix Horn Myhre's opener.

Manchester City striker Erling Haaland won it for Norway with 10 minutes remaining, but captain and Gunners star Odegaard is now a doubt for the Premier League side's clash with arch rivals Tottenham on Sunday.

Solbakken admitted that Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta will not be his biggest fan in an interview with TV2.
"It looked painful in the locker room," he said.
"We know it was an ankle sprain.
"With luck, it can turn out okay, if the ligaments aren't torn, but I'm not really sure [Mikel] Arteta will call me tonight to praise me.”

The Gunners will travel to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this weekend hoping to continue their unbeaten start to the Premier League season.
Arteta's side recorded 2-0 wins over Wolves and Aston Villa before dropping points in a 1-1 draw with Brighton following Declan Rice's red card.
That result left them in fourth, two points behind Liverpool and City, who are the only sides with 100% records remaining in this campaign.
Arsenal will also get their UEFA Champions League campaign underway next week when they face Atalanta in their first league-stage clash.

The 2-1 win over Austria means Norway are now second in League B Group 3, level on points with Slovenia after two games.
Norway's team doctor Ola Sand added that Odegaard may need an MRI scan.
"He's got a small ankle sprain," he added.
"We will see, maybe we use ultrasound to look at it.
"If we are unsure, there will be an MRI tomorrow."
