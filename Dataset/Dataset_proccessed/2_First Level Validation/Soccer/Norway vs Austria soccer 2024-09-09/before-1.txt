Prediction: 2-2

	

Austria

Following a slim goalless draw with Kazakhstan, Norway will be aiming to return to record their first win in Group 3 when they host Austria to their Ullevaal Stadion on Monday evening. Even though Erling Haaland failed to find the net in the Nations League opener, the opposition back-line should have the Man City superstar at bay. Arsenal midfielder Martin Odegaard should keep his place in the starting XI.

The visitors, on the other hand, played out a 1-1 draw with Slovenia in the opening match of their UEFA Nations League campaign and, no doubt, they would be happy with one point from Monday’s game as well. Given Austria’s attacking potential, we believe that punters from all around the globe can find value in betting on both teams to score. David Alaba remains in the recovery room, while veteran Marko Arnautovic should continue leading the line for Das Team.

HIGHLIGHTED TEAM (NORWAY):

Norway are a Nordic side that participated three times at the FIFA World Cup finals (1938, 1994 and 1998). The Norwegians were producing fine performances at the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, with the team setting up a meeting with Italy in the last 16 of the showpiece tournament thanks to a 2-1 win over Brazil in their last group match.

However, the Azzurri proved to be a big catch for Norway and thanks to Bobo Vieri’s goal the Italians made it to the quarter-finals. Norway only once qualified for the European Championship finals, with the team suffering elimination in the group stages of the 2000 tournament in Belgium and Netherlands. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the most famous Norwegian player and it is well known that he helped Manchester United beat Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final.

The “Baby-faced” striker scored the winner for the Red Devils in the dying seconds of the match. Norway play their home games at Ullevaal Stadion, which was opened in September, 1926. The capacity of the venue is 28.000.
