Both teams hope to win maximum points and work towards securing qualification into the next round.

Syria vs Japan clash in the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers second-round fixture on 21 November 2023. The game is set to take place at the Prince Abdullah Al Faisal Stadium, Jeddah. Both teams won their opening matches in Group B and are favourites to qualify for the third round as the top two sides.

Therefore, the upcoming 2026 FIFA WC Qualifiers game between Syria and Japan becomes exciting. Despite the Japanese team being heavy favourites to record three points, one cannot rule out an upset. 

It will be interesting to see how the best-ranked Asian men’s team in the world Japan (FIFA rank 18) addresses the challenges posed by Syria which is ranked 92 in the world. Here is a look at what to expect from the Group B fixture on Tuesday:

Kick-off:

Tuesday, 20:15 IST (17:45 UTC+3) at the Prince Abdullah Al Faisal Stadium, Jeddah on 21 November 2023.

Form

Syria - L-D-W-L-W

Japan - W-W-W-W-W

Player to Watch
Omar Al-Somah (Syria)

Omar Al-Somah leads the forward line for Syria. The skipper of the national side scored the winning goal from the penalty spot against North Korea in the previous Group B fixture of the 2026 FIFA WC Qualifiers. He is extremely precise with his finishing and Japan cannot afford to give him a chance from the penalty spot because he will most likely convert the opportunity.

Ayase Ueda (Japan)
Ayase Ueda scored three goals against Myanmar

Ayase Ueda is a man in form and a striker who is hungry for goals. The Feyenoord striker scored a brilliant hattrick in a 5-0 win over Myanmar in the previous game. He will certainly be one of the many Japanese players who will pose a threat in the attacking third. Syrian defenders must not allow Ueda space and time. He scored a goal against Germany in a 4-1 win too recently.

Match Facts
Japan is on a seven-match winning streak ahead of the game against Syria.
Syria and Japan last played against each other six years ago in 2017.
Japan has scored 29 goals in their last seven matches.
Injury & Team News

Syria has a full-strength squad available. Daichi Kamada may be unable to feature for Japan due to back problems.

Match Prediction

Japan is a heavy favourite to top Group B. Their aim is to qualify for the 2026 FIFA World Cup main draw after navigating the third round of qualifiers. The side is on a sensational winning run and may prove to be too tough for Syria to stop. A one-sided win can be on the cards.

Prediction - Syria 0 - 4 Japan
