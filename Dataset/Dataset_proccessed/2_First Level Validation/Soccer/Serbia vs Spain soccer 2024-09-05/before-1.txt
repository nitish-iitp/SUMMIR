Preview: Serbia vs. Spain - prediction, team news, lineups

Just over seven weeks on from their Euro 2024 triumph, Spain travel to the Rajko Mitic Stadium in Belgrade to face Serbia in their opening match of the 2024-25 UEFA Nations League on Thursday night.

La Roja are the defending champions of the Nations League and, along with Serbia, will compete in League A Group 4 with Denmark and Switzerland.

Spain are preparing for their first fixture since beating England 2-1 in the final of Euro 2024 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin on July 14 - becoming the first nation to win the competition four times.

La Roja were by far and away the standout performers on the continent and deservedly triumphed in Germany. Not only did they become the first European nation to win all seven matches at a major tournament (Euros and World Cup), they also scored more goals (15) than any other team in Euros history.

Luis de la Fuente has won 17 of his 21 matches as Spain head coach since taking the reins in December 2022, and Euro 2024 represents his second major title having previously steered his country to glory at the 2022-23 Nations League.

Indeed, Spain finished top of their group ahead of Portugal, Switzerland and Czech Republic after accumulating 11 points from six games, before beating Italy in the semi-finals and Croatia on penalties in the final following a 0-0 draw.

Ranked third in the world by FIFA, Spain will be regarded as favourites to top League A Group 4 this time around, and they begin their campaign against a Serbia side whom they have only previously faced on one occasion - winning a friendly 2-0 back in May 2012.

Serbia competed at the European Championship this summer as an independent nation for the first time since 2000 and they were tipped by many to progress beyond the group stage, but they ultimately flattered to deceive.

Indeed, Dragan Stojkovic has now failed to win any of his six matches in charge of Serbia at major tournaments, with the Eagles finishing bottom of Group C at Euro 2024 after picking up just two points from games against England, Denmark and Slovenia.

Serbia had more joy in their previous Nations League campaign, though, as they secured promotion to League A after winning four of their six matches to finish top of League B Group 4 ahead of Norway, Slovenia and Sweden.

Ranked 32nd in the world by FIFA, Serbia have in fact progressed from League C to League A within the last three Nations League tournaments and boast a record of nine wins, six draws and only three defeats.

The Eagles may find it challenging to top League A Group 4 this time around, though, and face a difficult opening fixture on Thursday against Spain, who have only lost two of their last 21 internationals since the beginning of 2023.

Serbia will be without key duo Aleksandar Mitrovic and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic due to injury, and Dusan Tadic has retired from international football, while striker Dusan Vlahovic and versatile winger Filip Kostic are two notable omissions from Stojkovic's 25-man squad.

Five uncapped players have been called up by Stojkovic including Aston Villa right-back Kosta Nedeljkovic, Sunderland midfielder Milan Aleksic and Millwall attacker Mihailo Ivanovic, who will all be hoping to feature in some capacity on Thursday.

Luka Jovic is expected to start as the central striker in the absence of Mitrovic, while Sasa Lukic and either Marko Grujic or Ivan Ilic could link arms in centre-midfield.

As for Spain, Unai Simon (wrist), Mikel Merino (shoulder), Alvaro Morata (thigh) and Fermin Lopez (muscle) are all ruled out through injury, while 38-year-old Jesus Navas has retired from international football.

Star midfielder Rodri is yet to kick a ball for Manchester City this season, but he is fit and available for selection, while 26-year-old Valencia midfielder Pepelu has received his first senior call-up and is in contention to make his debut.

The absence of goalkeeper Simon could see Arsenal's David Raya handed a start between the sticks, while Mikel Oyarzabal is expected to lead the line in the absence of Morata, with support in attack provided by wingers Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams.


Serbia possible starting lineup:
Rajkovic; Veljkovic, Milenkovic, Pavlovic; Nedeljkovic, Lukic, Ilic, Zivkovic; Samardzic, S. Mitrovic; Jovic

Spain possible starting lineup:
Raya; Carvajal, Le Normand, Laporte, Cucurella; Rodri, Fabian; Yamal, Olmo, Williams; Oyarzabal




We say: Serbia 0-2 Spain

If Spain are to pick up from where they left off and perform as well as they did at Euro 2024 on Thursday, then they should have few problems coming out on top against a weakened Serbia outfit, who are missing a few key attacking players and may find it difficult to break down a strong La Roja side.
