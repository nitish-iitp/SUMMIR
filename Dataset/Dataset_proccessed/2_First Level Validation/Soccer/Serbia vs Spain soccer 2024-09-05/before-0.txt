The forthcoming confrontation between Serbia and Spain in the UEFA Nations League seems to be interesting. The Stadion Rajko Mitič in Belgrade, with a capacity of 53,000, will host the game for September 5, 2024, at 18:45 local time. Dutch official Serdar Gözübüyük will officiate the game. Both teams are keen to start their campaigns on a high note since this game marks the opening round of the UEFA Nations League League A.

Under the direction of Dragan Stojković, Serbia is expected to have a strong Spanish side. Serbia has a strong record in the UEFA Nations League despite a dismal Euro 2024 campaign; it has advanced from League C to League A recently. Conversely, Spain, the current European and Nations League champions, shows great confidence going into this game following their most recent triumph that of Euro 2024.

Betting Tips and Match Insights

The Serbia vs Spain prediction today is not clear for people wishing to gamble. Spain is the favorites with their outstanding form just one loss in their last 12 away games. But Serbia’s home record in the UEFA Nations League, in which they have scored at least four times in four of their nine home games, points to their potential to be challenging. Starting their League A Group 4 campaigns, both teams have something to prove, thus the match is scheduled as a competitive affair.

Serbia Results

Serbia has had a mixed run of results in their recent matches. Below is a table summarizing their last five games:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
25.06.24	Euro	Denmark vs Serbia	0-0	D
20.06.24	Euro	Slovenia vs Serbia	1-1	D
16.06.24	Euro	Serbia vs England	0-1	L
08.06.24	Friendly	Sweden vs Serbia	0-3	W
04.06.24	Friendly	Austria vs Serbia	2-1	L

Serbia’s recent form shows a mixture of draws and losses, with a notable 3-0 victory over Sweden in a friendly match. However, their performance in competitive matches has been less convincing, with draws against Denmark and Slovenia and a narrow defeat to England. This inconsistent form raises questions about their ability to overcome a high-flying Spanish side.

Spain Results

Spain comes into this match with a string of strong performances. Below is a table of their last five matches:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result	Outcome
14.07.24	Euro	Spain vs England	2-1	W
09.07.24	Euro	Spain vs France	2-1	W
05.07.24	Euro	Spain vs Germany	2-1	W
30.06.24	Euro	Spain vs Georgia	4-1	W
24.06.24	Euro	Albania vs Spain	0-1	W

Spain’s recent record speaks for itself, with five consecutive victories in their last five matches, including wins against top European teams like England, France, and Germany. Their ability to consistently score and maintain a strong defensive line makes them a formidable opponent for any team in the competition.

Serbia vs Spain Head-to-Head

When examining the head-to-head record, the teams have faced each other sparingly. Here are the last five encounters:

Date	Competition	Matchup	Result
26.05.12	Friendly	Spain vs Serbia	2-0

Spain has the upper hand in their limited head-to-head history, with a 2-0 victory in their last meeting. However, much time has passed since that match, and both teams have evolved significantly since then.

Free Tips on Serbia vs Spain

When wagering on a game like Serbia against Spain, one should take several elements into account that might affect the result into account. Examining past performance and form of both teams as well as their head-to-performance can reveal important new angles. Knowing these components will enable you to make better informed bets. These free suggestions based on important statistics and data from past games between Serbia and Spain below.

Head-to-Head Performance: Historically, Spain has had the upper hand against Serbia, winning their only previous encounter. This suggests that Spain may have a psychological advantage going into the match. Reviewing past results can give you an indication of which team tends to dominate the other and how competitive the match might be.
Team Form and Recent Results: Spain comes into this match on the back of a winning streak, having won their last five matches, including major victories against top-tier teams like England and France. On the other hand, Serbia has shown inconsistency, with a mix of wins, draws, and losses. Teams in good form are generally more confident, which can play a critical role in determining the match outcome.
Home vs. Away Performance: Serbia has a strong home record in the UEFA Nations League, having scored multiple goals in several home matches. Playing at home could provide them with an edge, as they will have the support of their local fans at the Stadion Rajko Mitić. Conversely, Spain has been formidable away from home, winning 10 out of their last 12 away games, which indicates they are not easily intimidated on foreign soil.
Impact of Key Player Absences: Both teams will be missing key players due to injuries and suspensions. Spain will be without their captain Álvaro Morata and midfield anchor Rodri, which could impact their attacking and defensive balance. Serbia, meanwhile, will miss influential players like Aleksandar Mitrovic and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. These absences could affect the team’s dynamics and overall performance on match day.
Weather and Pitch Conditions: The weather and pitch conditions on the day of the match can significantly influence gameplay. If the weather in Belgrade is poor, such as heavy rain, it could slow down the game and favor a more defensive strategy, which might benefit Serbia’s home advantage and counter-attacking play. Keeping an eye on the weather forecast closer to match day can provide additional insights for your betting strategy.

By considering these tips, you can enhance your betting strategy for the Serbia vs Spain match and make more informed decisions.
