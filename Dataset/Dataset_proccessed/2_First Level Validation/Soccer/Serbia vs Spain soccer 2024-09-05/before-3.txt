Spain Predicted Lineup vs Serbia Preview

Two talented players, Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams, have returned to Spain’s squad to lead the team in their quest to defend their Nations League title. Coach Luis de la Fuente has just revealed his squad list for the upcoming matches in the competition.

He relied on the same group of players who emerged victorious in the European Championship in July, with Yamal and Williams making a significant impact during the tournament. Spain will be playing against Serbia on September 5 and Switzerland on September 8 as they kick off their Nations League campaign.

There are a couple of fresh faces joining the squad: Óscar Mingueza from Celta Vigo as the right-back and Pepelu from Valencia as the midfielder. De la Fuente has successfully reintegrated Aleix García, Pau Torres, Yeremy Pino, and Robert Sánchez into the team following their absence during the Euros.

Unfortunately, the team will have to make do without their first-choice goalkeeper Unai Simón and striker Álvaro Morata, as they are currently sidelined with injuries. Spain is currently experiencing a remarkable period of success in the world of football. The men’s team achieved Olympic gold this summer, while the women’s team emerged victorious in the 2023 World Cup.
