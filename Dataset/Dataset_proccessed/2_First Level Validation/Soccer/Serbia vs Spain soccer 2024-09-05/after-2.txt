European champions Spain began their Nations League defence with a disappointing goalless draw over Serbia at the Red Star Stadium in Belgrade.

TELL ME MORE

Spain returned to the field for the first time since their Euro 2024 final triumph over England in Berlin. However, during their Nations League A group stage opener against Serbia, La Roja seemed a shell of the side that cruised through the European Championship just two months ago. While Spain dominated possession as was expected, they failed to move the ball into threatening positions through the first half. Serbia, on the other hand, created multiple threats with AC Milan's Luka Jovic receiving the best chance of the game as he failed to convert a one-on-one chance with Spain goalkeeper David Raya.

The second half saw La Roja create more opportunities majorly through Barcelona's in-form duo of Dani Olmo and Lamine Yamal. However, Luis de la Fuente's men failed to break through Serbia's tight defence.

THE MVP

16-year-old Yamal was not quite at his sensational best against Serbia, however, he was arguably the best player on the field as he was possibly the biggest threat to Serbia's goal with Ayoze Perez and Nico Williams seeming to struggle to find their feet. Serbia's defence held strong to cope with Spain's attack with Strahinja Pavlovic and Nikola Milenkovic playing a big part in the clean sheet.

THE BIG LOSER

Jovic had the best chance to score for Serbia in the first half after a pinpoint pass from Lazar Samardzic sent him through against Raya who dove early to the wrong side. However, the Milan striker sent it way wide of the goal.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

Spain will now take on Switzerland away from home in the second group-stage game of the Nations League on September 8, meanwhile, Serbia will face Denmark.
