Spain held by Serbia in drab goalless draw
ByReuters
Updated: Sep 5, 2024, 09:46 pm

Euro 2024 champions Spain were held to a dour goalless away draw with Serbia in Nations League Group Four on Thursday, ending a nine-game winning streak and dropping their first points since March.

Playing their first match after a stunning European Championship campaign in which they won all seven games en route to lifting the trophy with a 2-1 victory in the final over England, Spain dominated possession but were unable to convert in 22 scoring attempts.

Missing key players like midfielder Rodri and captain Álvaro Morata due to a suspension and injured goalkeeper Unai Simón, Spain started the game slowly.

Spain recorded only two shots on target in the first half and were lucky not to go to the break trailing as Serbia forward Luka Jovic missed a golden chance from point-blank range.

The European champions were livelier after the break, but wasted several good chances, including a close-range volley by Dani Carvajal.

Barcelona teenager Lamine Yamal was one of Spain's few bright spots as he created a handful of opportunities as the visitors lacked ideas even with 76% ball possession.

"We lacked mostly everything in the first half," Spain manager Luis de la Fuente told a press conference.

"In the second half we were better and much improved but lacked effectively up front. We could have done better, players were a little tired, the heat was excruciating and we ran out of gas.

"I'm not worried, it's almost a pre-season game for us due to the circumstances, still early in the season and the calendar is busy for the players. It's a process and we will move forward."

Spain and Serbia are second on one point in the standings, two points behind Denmark who beat Switzerland 2-0 on Thursday.
