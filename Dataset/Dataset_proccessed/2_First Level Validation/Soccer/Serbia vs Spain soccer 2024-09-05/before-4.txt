Spain lineup vs. Serbia: Predicted XI for UEFA Nations League clash

Spain head coach Luis de la Fuente will weigh up whether to start Rodri in Thursday's UEFA Nations League clash against Serbia in Belgrade.

The 28-year-old midfielder has not kicked a ball since being forced off with a hamstring injury at half time in the Euro 2024 final against England, and he only returned to Manchester City's matchday squad last weekend - watching on as an unused substitute - after an extended summer break.

Nevertheless, Rodri - the Player of the Tournament at Euro 2024 and the 2022-23 Nations League - is fit and available for selection, with the 56-cap international one of 18 players who have retained his place in Spain's squad following their continental triumph in the summer.

Four of those Euro 2024 winners who will not be involved during this month's international break are goalkeeper Unai Simon (wrist), Mikel Merino (shoulder), Fermin Lopez (muscle) and captain Alvaro Morata (thigh) as they are all ruled out through injury, while 38-year-old Jesus Navas has retired from international football.

Chelsea's Robert Sanchez has been recalled to the Spain squad after missing Euro 2024, but Arsenal's David Raya may be preferred to start between the sticks on Thursday, and he could be protected by a back four of Dani Carvajal, Robin Le Normand, Aymeric Laporte and Marc Cucurella.

Should Rodri be deemed fit to start, he could be joined in midfield by Fabian Ruiz and either Dani Olmo or Pedri of Barcelona, while 26-year-old Pepelu from Valencia has been handed his first senior call-up and is in contention to make his debut.

In the absence of Morata, Mikel Oyarzabal could be handed a start as the central striker, while Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams, who both starred at Euro 2024, are set to occupy the flanks in a three-man attack.

Spain possible starting lineup: Raya; Carvajal, Le Normand, Laporte, Cucurella; Rodri, Fabian; Yamal, Olmo, Williams; Oyarzabal
