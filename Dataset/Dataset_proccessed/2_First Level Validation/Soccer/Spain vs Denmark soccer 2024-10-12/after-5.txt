UEFA NATIONS LEAGUE
SPAIN 1-0 DENMARK - LATE MARTIN ZUBIMENDI GOAL SECURES WIN TO SEND SPAIN TOP OF NATIONS LEAGUE GROUP
BYAARON BARTON

UPDATED 12/10/2024 AT 21:13 GMT

Denmark battled hard at the Estadio Nueva Condomina in Murcia on Saturday night, but Spain kept probing and were rewarded when Martin Zubimendi grabbed the winning goal in their UEFA Nations League contest. Luis de la Fuente's side squandered a number of chances, but Kasper Schmeichel could do nothing when Zubimendi fired home from distance to secure the three points.

Lamine Yamal had the best chance for Spain in the first half, latching onto a great pass from Pedro Porro to go one on one with Kasper Schmeichel but the Barcelona man could only blast his effort well over the bar.

Denmark's best opportunity in the first period came when Christian Eriksen found space on the right-hand side before firing a ball across the face of goal looking for Kasper Dolberg but Spain keeper David Raya read the danger well, coming out at Dolberg's feet to collect the ball.
Spain missed another great chance to take the lead on 68 minutes, this time it was Alvaro Morata who could not convert, firing his effort from close range at Schmeichel who did well to palm away the Spaniard's effort.
Luis de la Fuente’s side continued pushing and they got their reward just before the 80-minute mark, with Martin Zubimendi firing from distance to send Spain top of Group A4.
TALKING POINT - SPAIN MARCH ON
This victory in Murcia takes Spain’s unbeaten streak in competitive fixtures to a whopping 18 matches as they continue their brilliant form under De la Fuente. It is a run that stretches back to 2023, with their last defeat coming in March 2023 against Scotland.
Since that dreadful evening in Hampden Park, Spain have won 16 of their 18 competitive fixtures, were crowned champions at UEFA Euro 2024 after beating England in the final and are now sitting pretty at the top of their UEFA Nations League group, one point above Denmark.
De la Fuente has given supporters of La Roja a side they can believe in, a side who are resilient, who will keep going until the final whistle and that is what they did against Denmark.
Spain last had a longer unbeaten run in competitive fixtures between June 2010 and June 2013 - a streak of 29 unbeaten for a crop who conquered the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 during this run. Not a bad record to try and chase down.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH - FABIAN RUIZ (SPAIN)
The Spanish midfielder was in fine form for his nation. His passing was neat and tidy, completing 60 of his 66 passes. He won all six of his ground duels, made three tackles and was unlucky to not get on the scoresheet when his effort from distance whizzed just past the post. An accomplished performance from the 28-year-old.
PLAYER RATINGS
Spain: Raya 7, Porro 8, Vivian 7, Laporte 8, Grimaldo 8, Ruiz 9, Zubimendi 8, Yamal 8, Pedri 7, Oyarzabal 7, Morata 6 Subs:Merino 7, Baena 7, Joselu 6, Gomez N/A

MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
31’ ALMOST FOR DENMARK! - That is Denmark's best chance so far but they couldn't manage to get a shot off. Eriksen does well down the right wing before firing a ball across the face of goal aiming for Dolberg but Raya comes out quickly to get to the ball before the Danish forward.
44’ A HUGE OPPORTUNITY WASTED FOR SPAIN! - Pedro Porro brilliantly slips Lamine Yamal in with a great ball down the right-hand side, setting the Barcelona man away for a 1v1 but he fires his effort over the bar. That is a huge let-off for Denmark.
68’ ANOTHER BIG CHANCE WASTED! - Alvaro Morata takes a touch to get away from a Denmark defender before firing an effort straight at Schmeichel who makes a great save. That looked for all the world like it was going to be 1-0 Spain.
78’ GOAL! SPAIN 1-0 DENMARK (ZUBIMENDI) - Spain have finally got their goal! The ball falls to Martin Zubmiendi who lets fly on the volley from outside the box and his effort squirms past Kasper Schmeichel and into the back of the net.
KEY STAT
Spain attempted 25 shots against Denmark, their joint-most in any Nations League game (also 25 v Ukraine in September 2020).
