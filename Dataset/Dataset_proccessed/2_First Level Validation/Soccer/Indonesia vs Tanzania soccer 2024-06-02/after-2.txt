The Indonesian national football team underwent a training session at Field B of Gelora Bung Karno Football Stadium in Jakarta on Tuesday (28/5/2024). The team held their first training session ahead of a friendly match against Tanzania and the World Cup 2026 qualifier matches against Iraq and the Philippines.

In a DPR working meeting with the Minister of Youth and Sports Dito Ariotedjo, Monday (3/6/2024), at the Parliament Complex, Jakarta, member of Commission Indonesia continues to provide a 60 percent quota in the composition of the "Garuda" squad to local players. This is to show partiality towards athletes who have been trained domestically.

“I ask, if possible, 60 percent of national players to play. "Don't just be on the field of naturalized players," said Putra in a working meeting discussing the proposal to naturalize two players for the Indonesian national team, namely Calvin Verdonk and Jens Raven.

The intentions of the politicians from the PDI Perjuangan faction were quite clear. Putra certainly wants the government and PSSI to participate in intensifying early childhood development programs throughout the country, instead of just prioritizing the recruitment of players of European descent to strengthen the Indonesian national team.

In his statement, Putra said, "As this is a short-term naturalization program, I ask the Minister of Youth and Sports and the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) to pay attention to the composition of the national team players who compete so that knowledge transfer can occur. This is so that players can share their abilities, strategies, and tactics when playing."

Indonesian players took a group photo before the match against Tanzania in a friendly match at Madya Gelora Bung Karno Stadium, Jakarta, on Sunday (2/6/2024). Indonesia was held to a goalless draw by Tanzania.

He added, "Of course, this request is also to show our support for athletes who have been trained from an early age by the state."

Looking at the composition and performance of the Indonesian national team at this time, it must be acknowledged that naturalized players of Indonesian descent who have received citizenship through naturalization programs have been able to improve the Garuda's playing standards.

The most important thing is early childhood development. This must be done so that local players do not lose and can compete.

Since the naturalization program was approved by Minister of Youth and Sports Zainudin Amali - who later became the Vice Chairman of PSSI for the 2023-2027 period - as well as the Chairman of PSSI (2019-2023) Mochamad Iriawan in 2020, a total of 14 players have undergone naturalization, which of course received approval from the DPR.

During that period, Indonesia made history by qualifying for the knockout phase of the 2023 Asia Cup for the first time, and reaching the semifinals of the 2024 U-23 Asia Cup. In addition, the Garuda team only needs one more win out of the remaining two matches to advance to the third round of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers.

The Indonesian national team players sang the national anthem, Indonesia Raya, during the 2026 World Cup qualifying match against Vietnam at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta on Thursday (21/3/2024). Indonesia defeated Vietnam with a slim score of 1-0.

The three achievements were not realized before the naturalization program was implemented. This second volume of the naturalization program has a clearer goal. It is only aimed at the needs of the national team and therefore must be approved by the coach. In addition, the players being sought must have Indonesian blood or have a lineage that was born in Indonesia.

This is clearly different from the first volume of naturalization programs that appeared during the 2009-2013 period. At that time, naturalization was done for club needs. Players who obtained Indonesian citizenship were not based on the national team coach's tactical desires, so they were unable to contribute to improving the quality of play and the achievements of the Garuda squad.

Secretary General of PSSI Yunus Nusi admitted that the presence of naturalized players, including Calvin and Jens, aims to enhance the quality of the national team. Moreover, he continued, Indonesian national teams at all levels are currently on a mission to compete in Asia and the world.

"We have hopes and expectations to qualify for the 2026 World Cup," said Yunus.

DOKUMENTASI PSSI

Ragnar Oratmangoen (left) and Thom Haye (right) took an oath to become Indonesian citizens at the Regional Office of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights in Jakarta on Wednesday (March 19, 2024) early in the morning. Both of them are naturalized players who will strengthen the Indonesian national team.

Equivalent amount

In the Indonesian squad for the 2026 World Cup qualifying matches against Iraq and the Philippines, Coach Shin Tae-yong has called up 11 players from the naturalization program. If Calvin, who has already attended training, is added, there are 12 players ready to perform. The composition of naturalized players with local or national players - borrowing Putra Nababan's terminology - is equal or 50 percent.

The percentage of naturalized players could be even more dominant if in the next international match calendar, next August, FC Dallas goalkeeper, Maarten Paes, has received permission to transfer the federation from the Netherlands (KNVB) to Indonesia (PSSI). Even so, Shin has been proven to prioritize the principle of fairness in arranging the 11 main players in each match.

In the latest friendly match against Tanzania on Sunday (2/6/2024), Shin fielded four players from the local development program. They were Ernando Ari, Rizky Ridho, Asnawi Mangkualam, and Marselino Ferdinan. Asnawi is still trusted by Shin as the main captain of the Garuda squad.

So, is it still fair to make a dichotomy between naturalized players and national players?

If the goal of the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) and the government is to pursue achievements quickly or instantly, the presence of the naturalization program is needed. The match against Tanzania can be a benchmark. When playing with seven naturalized players, Indonesia was able to produce five shots on target in the first half.

In the second half, with only two naturalized players left, Justin Hubner and Nathan Tjoe-A-On, Garuda could only create two dangerous opportunities in front of the African team's goal.

However, it is not fair to compare naturalized players and local players. The hope for national players to dominate the Indonesian national team's main squad will not be realized if the government and PSSI (Football Association of Indonesia) do not provide justice for domestically trained players.

Players who have undergone naturalization programs are expected to have better quality due to the established and continuous coaching system in Europe, especially in the Netherlands. The sports facilities that they use since childhood are significantly better than those of players born and raised in Indonesia.

PSSI

Maarten Paes, a goalkeeper from FC Dallas, took a photo with the Chairman of the PSSI, Erick Thohir, at a dinner event on Tuesday (30/4/2024) in Jakarta.

Indeed, coaching programs have begun to be encouraged with the presence of a number of football academies in the last one or two years, but these programs are mostly centered in big cities. There are not many opportunities to get ideal football education for players in remote areas who have great talent, such as in eastern Indonesia or the island of Sumatra.

In addition, naturalized players are also trained from an early age with a sustainable and consistent competition system. Since the age of nine, professional clubs in Europe have had young teams starting from the age of nine to participate in regular competitions that run for at least nine months in one calendar year.

In Indonesia, opportunities for youth competitions are still very limited. The majority of playing opportunities for children and teenagers come in the form of short tournaments that last only one to a maximum of three months. In addition to their short duration, these tournaments can only be found in bustling cities.

However, early age development is a prerequisite for the presence of quality local players. Even with inadequate early age development, Indonesia can still produce quality players such as Marselino, Yakob Sayuri, Asnawi, Rizky, Ernando, and Witan Sulaeman. So, one can imagine the enormous potential for local players if accompanied by better early age development.

The issue of air pollution is not new. The condition of the community that is threatened by air pollution has been occurring for a long time. There is a lot of research evidence that shows the threat of the impacts of air pollution. However, this has yet to promote significant efforts in controlling air pollution. As a result, residents are increasingly suffering under the siege of air pollution. Indonesian national team players (from right) Elkan Baggot, Jordi Amat, Marc Klok, and Edo Febriansyah, are seen during a dinner held at the KBRI House in Doha, Qatar on Wednesday (10/1/2024) local time. The Indonesian national team will participate in the 2023 Asia Cup in Doha. The Garuda team is in Group D along with Japan, Vietnam, and Iraq.

However, if the development and competition for young individuals are not improved in the near future, local players will not only find it increasingly difficult to compete in the Indonesian national team, but they will also be further marginalized in professional clubs in the Indonesian League 1.

Because every club is allowed to contract eight foreign players starting from the 2024-2025 Liga 1 season. Although in the regulations, only six players can actually play on the field.

"The most important thing is early age development. That must be done so that local players do not lose and can compete," said Shin, expressing his views on the increase in the quota of eight foreign players in Indonesia's Liga 1.

As a result, rather than continuously debating about local players and naturalization, it is time to demand that national sports stakeholders fulfill their long-term program promises to improve youth development.

This is to ensure that local players have a fair chance to compete with naturalized players from a young age, even if they grow up on different continents.
