The Black Stars squad has been reduced to 22 players as they prepare for their crucial Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Niger on Monday, September 9, 2024. The team trained at the Berkane Football Academy in Morocco after arriving in Oujda on Saturday.

Istanbul Başakşehir defender Jerome Opoku has been ruled out due to an injury, while winger Joseph Paintsil, who plays for Los Angeles Galaxy, remained in Accra to resolve passport issues. These absences leave head coach Otto Addo with 22 players for the upcoming match.

Key players in camp include goalkeepers Lawrence Ati-Zigi, Joseph Wollacott, and Frederick Asare. Defenders Alidu Seidu, Tariq Lamptey, Mohammed Salisu, and Abdul Mumin will also be in action.

In midfield, Thomas Partey, Abdul Fatawu Issahaku, and Mohammed Kudus headline the squad, supported by Kingsley Schindler, Majeed Ashimeru, Abu Francis, and Forson Amankwah.

Forwards Inaki Williams, Antoine Semenyo, Brandon Thomas-Asante, and Jordan Ayew will lead the attacking line as the team aims to secure victory in their second match of the 2025 AFCON qualifiers.

The match will take place at the Municipal Sports Complex in Berkane, Morocco, where the Black Stars hope to bounce back from their 1-0 defeat to Angola last Thursday.
