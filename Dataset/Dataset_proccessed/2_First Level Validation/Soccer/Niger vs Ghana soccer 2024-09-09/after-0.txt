The Black Stars continued their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign with a 1-1 draw against Niger at the Stade Municipal Berkane in Morocco.

It was a disappointing result for the Black Stars, considering their somewhat lethargic performance at a neutral venue.

Ghana opened the scoring in the first half through Alidu Seidu’s strike, which deflected off a Niger player to wrongfoot the goalkeeper.

However, with just 10 minutes left, Oumar Sako equalized for the Mena after a scramble in the Black Stars' box.

Here’s how each Black Stars player is rated out of 10:

Lawrence Ati-Zigi – 5
The St. Gallen goalkeeper came to the rescue of the team on a number of occasions when called upon in the game. He made some crucial fingertip saves in the second half. He could do little about the equalizer.

Tariq Lamptey – 5
After a solid performance against Angola, Lamptey didn’t put a foot wrong against the Mena. The right-back showed good fitness, made important clearances, and contributed with his overlapping runs.

Alidu Seidu – 6
Although played out of position as a left-back for the second time, Seidu held his own defensively and scored Ghana’s only goal. However, he struggled at times with clearances and crosses on his weaker left foot.

Abdul Mumin – 4
The Rayo Vallecano defender had an improved performance compared to the game against Angola. He formed a good understanding with Salisu but give the ball away on some occasions.

Mohammed Salisu – 5
A calm and composed display from the AS Monaco defender. His partnership with Mumin was solid, showing better control than in his recent appearances for Ghana.

Thomas Partey – 5
Partey distributed the ball well and made some important interceptions. However, he was guilty of a few uncharacteristic mistakes that marred his overall performance.

Majeed Ashimeru – 4
The Anderlecht midfielder played close to the central defenders, often slotting in as a third centre-back while he also made a few runs forward. It was a decent showing, especially after coming off the bench in the previous game against Angola.

Abdul Fatawu Issahaku – 2
A largely ineffective performance from Issahaku. The 20-year-old showed some bravery in taking on defenders, but most of his efforts fell flat. He should have been substituted much earlier.

Mohammed Kudus – 5
Kudus was a constant threat, carrying the ball well through the middle. However, he was guilty of holding onto the ball for too long when quicker decisions were needed. His link-up play was effective, but he should have attempted more long-range shots.

Antoine Semenyo – 5
Semenyo offered less threat compared to his performance against Angola. He struggled to assert himself in the final third and was largely ineffective.

Inaki Williams – 4
A routine game for the Athletic Bilbao forward, who won a few fouls and made his usual runs. However, as the central striker, he was not active enough in the box.

Substitutes:

Elisha Owusu – N/A
Brandon Thomas-Asante – N/A
Jordan Ayew – N/A

Otto Addo – 2
Addo’s team showed better passing and game control than in the wins over Mali and the Central African Republic in June. However, his substitutions came too late, limiting the impact they could have had on the game.
