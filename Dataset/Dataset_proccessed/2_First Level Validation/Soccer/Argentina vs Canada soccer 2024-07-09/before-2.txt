The 2024 Copa América was the 48th edition of the Copa América, the quadrennial international men's soccer championship organized by South America's football ruling body CONMEBOL. The tournament was held in the United States and co-organized by CONCACAF. The United States hosted the tournament for the second time, having hosted the Copa América Centenario in 2016. The tournament was held from June 20 to July 14, 2024, and the winner will later compete in the 2025 CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions against the UEFA Euro 2024 winner.

This is the second time that the United States is hosting the tournament, having hosted the Copa América Centenario in 2016. Argentina is the defending champion. The final was played on July 14, 2024, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.

Host selection

The 2024 Copa América had been expected to be hosted by Ecuador due to CONMEBOL's host rotation order. However, CONMEBOL president Alejandro Domínguez said Ecuador had been nominated but not yet chosen to organize the edition. In November 2022, the country declined to host the tournament. Peru and the United States had both expressed interest in organizing the tournament.

On January 27, 2023, it was announced that as part of CONCACAF and CONMEBOL's new strategic partnership, the United States would host the tournament with six CONCACAF guest teams qualifying through the 2023–24 CONCACAF Nations League. The tournament also acts as a prelude to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, of which the United States is a joint host along with Canada and Mexico.

Venues

The opening match will be held at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta while the final will be held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, both venues were announced on November 20, 2023. All other venues were selected and announced on December 4, 2023, two weeks after the opening and final venues were confirmed.

Teams

The tournament will include sixteen teams – ten from CONMEBOL and six from CONCACAF. All ten CONMEBOL national teams are eligible to enter.

The six CONCACAF participants will qualify through the 2023–24 CONCACAF Nations League. The teams will be the four League A quarter-final winners, and two play-in round winners between the four losing quarter-finalists. Unlike the Copa América Centenario, the United States did not qualify automatically despite being the hosts, but still secured a berth following a 4–2 aggregate win against Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad's loss sent them to the losers' playoffs, and their match against Canada will produce a first-time Copa América entrant.

Draw

The group stage draw will be held on December 7, 2023, at 19:30 EST (UTC−5) in the James L. Knight Center in Miami. The sixteen teams will be drawn into four groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.

For the draw, the four teams in Pot 1 were pre-seeded into their respective groups, determined as follows:

The reigning Copa América champions, Argentina, was seeded into Group A
The reigning CONCACAF Gold Cup champions, Mexico, was seeded into Group B
The highest ranked CONCACAF team in the October 2023 FIFA World Rankings, the United States, was seeded into Group C
The next-highest ranked CONMEBOL team in the October 2023 FIFA World Rankings, Brazil, was seeded into Group D

The remaining 12 teams were placed into Pots 2–4 according to their October 2023 World Rankings, with placeholders for the 2 CONCACAF participants yet to be determined at the time of the draw each being automatically placed into Pot 4.

Symbols
Mascot

The tournament's official mascot was unveiled on December 7, 2023, during the group stage draw. It's an eagle named "Capitán", which is a Spanish word meaning captain. The inspiration for the choice of an eagle as the mascot for the 2024 Copa América, was "born from the symbolism that this majestic animal has in various cultures of the Americas, illustrating strength, boldness, and excellence."

Matchball

The match balls of this tournament were provided by Puma for the first time after 20 years of partnership with Nike ended in 2023. The "Puma Cumbre" was unveiled during the draw for the group stage of the competition on December 7, 2023.

Music

Instead of one official song, multiple songs, in Spanish (the tournament's official language) and English (the main language of the host country), were used for the tournament.

A customized version of "Puntería" by Colombian singer Shakira Ripoll serves as the Spanish-language official song of the tournament, with it also being used for TUDN's coverage. The English version of the song is "Soccer Pop" and was performed by Blue Ridge and Shakira Ripoll.
