India vs Syria Highlights: India suffered a 0-3 loss to Syria in their second and final Intercontinental Cup 2024 match in Hyderabad. This meant that India finished last in the tournament, behind Mauritius on goal difference. Up against a side ranked 93rd in the FIFA world rankings, India conceded an early seventh minute goal. Despite creating many chances in the second half, it was Syria who scored the second against the run of play. A third goal in the 96th minute was the final dagger. 

New head coach Manolo Marquez suffered his first loss as India coach, and he's yet to neither win a game nor see his side score a goal.

Here are the Highlights of India vs Syria, Intercontinental Cup 2024 from Gachibowli Athletic Stadium, Hyderabad:

India vs Syria LIVE: Positives
The only redeeming point to take away from these two Intercontinental Cup games will be that second half vs Syria. Yes, India conceded two late goals. But despite trailing, they created several chances and could've scored if they'd been more clinical.

"We were scared in the first half, but 3-0 does not show the reality. We deserved to score in the second half," says coach Manolo Marquez, who has suffered his first loss as an India coach.

India vs Syria LIVE: The goalscorers
It was Mahmoud Al-Aswad who gave Syria a very early lead, in just the seventh minute. India had many chances in the second half, but Syria put the dagger in the 77th minute courtesy Daleho Irandust. And to rub salt on the wounds, a third in the 96th minute by Pablo Sabbag.

A clinical performance by Syria tonight. They beat Mauritius 2-0, and they have demolished India 3-0. Despite India's best efforts in the second half, Syria were devastating on the counter-attack and made India pay for their lapses.
