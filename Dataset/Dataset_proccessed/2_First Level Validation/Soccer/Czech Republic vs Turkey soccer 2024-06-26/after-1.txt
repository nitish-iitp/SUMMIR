EURO 2024
CZECHIA 1-2 TURKEY: HAKAN CALHANOGLU AND CENK TOSUN CONFIRM LAST 16 PLACE IN FIERY CLASH AS 10-MAN CZECHS HEAD HOME
BYEUROSPORT

UPDATED 26/06/2024 AT 22:20 GMT

Turkey are into the knockout round of Euro 2024 following a dramtaic and heated 2-1 win over Czechia - a result that sends the Czechs home from the tournament. Hakan Calhanoglu and Cenk Tosun scored either side of Tomas Soucek's goal for Czechia who also had Antonin Barak sent off in the first half as Turkey advanced in second place in Group F.

Turkey booked their spot in the last 16 for the first time since 2008 as substitute Cenk Tosun secured a last-gasp 2-1 win that saw the 10-man Czechia crash out of Euro 2024.
Vincenzo Montella’s Crescent-Stars only had to avoid defeat to progress to the latter stages and their hopes were buoyed on 20 minutes when Antonin Barak was given his marching orders for two quick-fire yellow cards.

Turkey then looked to be cruising following the interval when captain Hakan Çalhanoglu rifled them in front on 51 minutes with a superb first-time strike from the left side of the area.

However, West Ham’s Tomas Soucek pounced upon an error from goalkeeper Mert Gunok just past the hour to set up a barnstorming finale.
The 10-man Czechs threw everything at the Turkish penalty area but could not provide the late twist to stay alive in the competition, and Tosun polished off the job with a fine shot in stoppage time.
A second red card arrived after the final whistle was blown when Czechia's Tomas Chory was sent off, making this the most ill-disciplined match in European Championship history with a total of 16 yellow and two red cards.
The result sees Turkey finish second in Group F with seeing them progress as one of the best third-placed teams.
The Czechs, who reached the last eight in the previous Euros, end up rock bottom and head home early. Turkey will now meet Austria in the last 16 next Tuesday.
TALKING POINT – TURKEY PROGRESS VIA THE SCENIC ROUTE AS THEY END CZECH HOPES ONCE AGAIN
Turkey have made a habit of beating the Czechs in the last group game at a Euros and coach Ivan Hasek could have been forgiven for thinking fate was conspiring against them before a ball had even been kicked.
The Czechs were already without their record scorer at the Euros in the form of the injured Patrik Schick when a promising start was curtailed by a somehow harsh red card – via two quick cautions.
To their credit, the 10-men continued to battle and despite falling behind grabbed a lifeline when one of several dangerous set pieces paid dividends.
An unlikely turnaround remained on the cards until deep into stoppage time when Turkey rubbed salt in their wounds with a winner on the break.
It’s never routine when it comes to The Crescent Stars but it's usually rather entertaining. They remain dark horses to replicate the kind of run that saw them reach the semis in 2008 as they are in what looks like the easier side of the draw on paper.
PLAYER OF THE MATCH
Hakan Çalhanoğlu (Turkey). The 30-year-old Inter midfielder kept the game ticking over in the middle of the park and capped a fine individual display with his first-ever European Championship goal in his third finals.

Matchcast and commentary
MATCH HIGHLIGHTS
18’ – CZECH REPUBLIC CHANCE! Robin Hranác contrives to guide a free header over after Soucek had nodded a long throw from the right back into the mix.
20’ – CZECH REPUBLIC RED CARD! It's a disaster for the Czechs as Antonín Barák picks up a second yellow card. It seems a bit harsh as there was little in the challenge but it’s two nine minutes apart and it leaves the Czechs with it all to do.
45’ – CZECH REPUBLIC CHANCE! Jurásek surges down the left in support of a fantastic counter attack led by Lukas Provod. It's played into his path inside the area but he can't squeeze his shot beyond the advancing Mert Günok.
51’ - GOAL! – Turkey 1-0 Czech Republic: (Çalhanoglu). Hakan Çalhanoglu breaks the deadlock with a ferocious first-time shot into the far corner from the left side of the area after Stanek had initially kept them at bay with a superb save.
66’ - GOAL! – Turkey 1-1 Czech Republic: (Soucek). Lifeline! The 10-men are back in it and it's their skipper Soucek who hammers it home after Turkey goalkeeper Mert Günok fumbled the ball back into play. It all came from another long throw that wreaked havoc in the Turkish area.
90+4’ - GOAL! – Turkey 2-1 Czech Republic: (Tosun). The substitute finishes it off as he cuts in from the left to polish off a breakaway with a rasping shot into the far corner.
