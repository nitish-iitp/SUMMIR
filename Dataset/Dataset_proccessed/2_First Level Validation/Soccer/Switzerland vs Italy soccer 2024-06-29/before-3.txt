Italy have qualified for the EURO 2024 Round of 16 and will face Switzerland in Berlin on June 29, 2024, at 18:00 CET.

Italy qualified for the EURO 2024 Round of 16 after a 1-1 draw against Croatia in Leipzig on Monday night.

It was one of the craziest games in the Azzurri’s history. Luciano Spalletti’s men needed a win or a draw to progress, but they were 1-0 down in the dying minutes.

There were eight minutes of added time and Mattia Zaccagni, who had come on as a substitute only ten minutes earlier, found the net with a superb curler with the last touch in the game.

His goal allowed the Azzurri to finish as runners-up in Group B with four points so Italy will face Switzerland, the second-placed team in Group A, in Berlin this coming Saturday.

It will kick off at 18:00 CET, 16:00 GMT at the Olympiastadion where the Azzurri won the World Cup Final against France in 2006.
