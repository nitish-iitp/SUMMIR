The Euro 2024 knockout stages get under way in Berlin on Saturday afternoon as Switzerland face Italy with a place in the quarter-finals on the line.

The Azzuri were far from convincing as they finished second to Spain in Group B – edging past Albania in their opener before being outclassed by the Spanish and then grabbing a very late equaliser against Croatia in an uninspiring 1-1 draw.

Luciano Spalletti's side will argue that they made it through and that's all that matters, but there is nowhere to hide now and the pressure is on them to show their quality against a Swiss team that finished the group stages with a flourish.

Beating Hungary 2-1 in their opener and then drawing with Scotland was enough to all but secure Switzerland's place in the knockout stages, but they left arguably the best until last as they nearly upset Group A winners and tournament hosts Germany – with only Niclas Fullkrug's stoppage-time equaliser denying them a famous victory.
