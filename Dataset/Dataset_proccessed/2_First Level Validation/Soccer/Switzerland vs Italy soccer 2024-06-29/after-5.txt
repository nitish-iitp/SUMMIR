Euro 2024: Italy roasted on social media as defending champions crash out in 'appalling' 2-0 defeat

Switzerland are through to the quarter-finals in their first victory against Italy in 31 years. Germany qualified too after beating Denmark 2-0.

Defending champions Italy have crashed out of Euro 2024 with a painful 2-0 defeat against underdogs Switzerland in Berlin.

The Swiss dominated throughout the whole game, offering a solid and effective display against the more emblazoned Italian side, who came second-best on all fronts, including ball possession and shots on target.

By contrast, Italy managed to shoot on target only once in 95 minutes.

The performance was poor and uninspired, even by the standards offered in the tournament so far, where they always conceded the goal first in all four games played.

Italy's captain Gianluigi Donnarumma - the best one of his side - defined Itay's display as "unacceptable", while the Azzurri football fans say this game has been the "worst" in decades.

Switzerland hadn't managed to beat Italy in 31 years until tonight.

Switzerland went ahead after 37 minutes with Remo Freuler before Italy's goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma fended off the potential 2-0 with a stunning save only nine minutes later.

The break didn't change the course of the game as the Swiss doubled up 2-0, only one minute into the second half, with a superb finish by Ruben Vargas, who fired an unstoppable shot into the top corner from inside the box.

This is the first time Switzerland reach back-to-back quarter-finals at the Euros.

Thousands of football fans are reacting on social media to express their shock but also mock what they called one the worst Italy performances in decades.

X has been flooded with tweets and memes targeting the poor Italian performance as well as their manager Luciano Spalletti.

Germany overcome Denmark 2-0 to reach quarter-finals

Hosts Germany are heading to the Euro 2024 quarterfinals after a wet and wild win over Denmark on Saturday.

It could have gone very differently, however. The host-nation buzz was burst when, with the score at 0-0, Denmark defender Joachim Andersen swept home a close-range finish that looked to have put his team ahead in the 50th minute.

But the VAR spotted an offside in the buildup, a free kick was awarded and the ball was played downfield immediately, leading to a cross by David Raum hitting the outstretched right arm of...the very same Joachim Andersen.

The VAR got involved again and awarded a penalty. Kai Havertz converted the spot kick and Jamal Musiala added a second goal 15 minutes later - his third of the tournament, which is tied for the most with Georgia’s Georges Mikautadze.

“We played a super game — we had crazy fans again today,” Germany defender Nico Schlotterbeck said. “We’re playing with euphoria, we’re playing with fun, and that’s what the most beautiful thing about football is.”

It was Germany’s first win in the knockout stage of a major tournament since 2016, as they had failed to advance from the group stage at back-to-back World Cups and lost in the round of 16 of the last Euros in 2021 to England.

Germany will play Spain or Georgia next, while Switzerland will face off with either England or Slovakia, who will be playing on Sunday.
