05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 1-1 after 105 minutes

We had an interesting substitute here from Spain as Ruiz was unable to continue any more striker Josephulu has been called upon as a replacement. Once again not a lot to separate both sides even in this Extra Time it is looking very likely we might go to extra time.

23:38 (IST)
05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 1-1 after 100 minutes

Spain has started well here in the Extra Time. They are pressing high and testing the defenses of Germany. The hosts seems to be tired after all the energy burst and relief they had when Wirtz has scored. However, Germany would be hoping for one opening to get through. 

23:34 (IST)
05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 1-1 after 95 minutes

Both teams are now to be even more switched. The play might be a bit on the slower side but one mistake is what either side is waiting for. This applies especially to goal-keepers who have stopped some of very sharp chances under pressure especially in the first half.

23:30 (IST)
05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 1-1 kick-off

23:20 (IST)
05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 1-0 after 90 minutes

23:15 (IST)
05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 1-0 after 85 minutes

Havertz had got the chance to level when there was an error from Spain and Havertz was one-on-one with the keeper and he sent it over the bar. The Germans should have buried it but he missed to keep Spain in the lead.

23:05 (IST)
05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 1-0 after 75 minutes

Mittellstad has been shown yellow for Germany here. It is his reaction after the referee gave him a foul against Torres that induced the card as we updated the yellow card this time for Ferran Torres. It was a rugby tackle from the player on German player who was running away with the ball.

22:59 (IST)
05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 1-0 after 70 minutes

Toni Kroos gets a yellow finally after so many getaways. Olmo was getting away with the ball but Kroos pulled back with their arm and takes one for the team. Time is running out here for Germany, and the crowd's tension seems palpable.

05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 1-0 after 65 minutes

Torres comes in for Yamal for Spain the player walked off to a standing applause and rightly so. This has been a brilliant performance by the 16-year-old today. Germany has brought in the changes and they have gone up the gears but still not penetrative enough at the moment.

Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 1-0 after 55 minutes

Dani Olmo scores here. What a brilliantly constructed goal from Spain. It is his late run from the mid-field that did the trick for Spain. A word on Yamal's assist he did not panic with the ball under the feet and picked and chose the right moment to cross and play it to the right player.

05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: Roy Keane on ITV

Kai Havertz has had two opportunities but they weren't easy chances. A prolific goalscorer may have taken them. I think he could have done a touch better with the header. It was good movement for the second opportunity. But two tough chances.

22:20 (IST)
05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 0-0 after half-time

That's the first half done and dusted with all square. It is going to be a big half-time team talk for both coaches. Though the score reads 0-0 the game was not short of action. We have another 45 minutes of enthralling football left folks do come back and join us. 

22:15 (IST)
05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 0-0 after 45 minutes

05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 0-0 after 40 minutes

Toni Kroos after starting a bit raggedly has slowly is setting the tempo of this game from the mid-field. Initially, he was going back and joining the back four and becoming that extra defender however, as Germany is seeing more of the ball he is joining the mid-field and dictating play.

22:06 (IST)
05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 0-0 after 35 minutes

Germany has been seeing a lot more ball in the last 5 minutes or so. Spain players are pressing and waiting for an opportunity to counter and they almost had one when Morata sent one through to Olmo however, Tah does well to stop the Spaniard and avoid counter-attack.

22:01 (IST)
05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 0-0 after 30 minutes

Raum gets the second yellow of the game for his foul on Carvajal once again a promising position for Spain to make something out of it but it ended in nothing. As we update Spain's Normand too gets a yellow card for a foul on Germany's Gundagon and should Spain qualify for the semifinal Normand will miss the game.

21:56 (IST)
05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 0-0 after 25 minutes

Germany's first big chance came through Havertz who headed one however, Spain's goalkeeper Unai Simon was alert, and the ball did not have much pace to it, ball just floated up there for Simon to stop it. Despite all the high-intensity football, the score reads still 0-0.

21:50 (IST)
05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 0-0 after 20 minutes

Pedri has walked off due to an injury induced by a rough tackle from Kroos early in the game. Spain has taken a lot more shots early in the game and Germany is yet to have a clear-cut chance in this game. They are letting Spain have the ball and wait for their chance.

21:45 (IST)
05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 0-0 after 15 minutes

Rudiger has been booked early in the game for pulling down Olmo who came in as sub for Pedri. It is outside the box excellent position for Spain to score early in the game. They have been applying a lot of pressure here are Spain with their forward press to which Germany's answer as of now seems like hard tackles.

21:41 (IST)
05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 0-0 after 10 minutes

Toni Kroos has been doing a few fouls here early in the game looks like that is what his role is and it is going to be an issue for Spain players with the ball throughout the evening. Kroos has evaded easily one yellow card at least early in the game.

05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: ESP vs GER 0-0 after 5 minutes

05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: Hola!

The national anthems are done the stadium is buzzing here in Germany it is going to be a cracking game of football. Spain has a relatively younger squad and it is their opportunity to make an impact in a big and for Germany, it is a home game hence plenty is at stake.

Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: Toni Kroos’s Germany vs Rodri’s Spain part 2

Like the Spaniard, Kroos has dictated the mood of Germany too. When he shifts through his creative gears, Germany is a thrilling force to watch. The wingers spreading the canvas wide, the nifty forwards striding upfield, rotating their position, an electric marriage of pace and skills. When he endures rare off-days, so would Germany. This Euro, Kroos has made the most successful passes (416 of 435), commanded a completion rate of 95.75 percent and has conjured the second most chances in the tournament. He is, as the former Argentina midfielder Juan Roman Riquelme noted, “the closest thing football has to Roger Federer.” “He can go out, play, and go home again without even needing to bathe: he doesn’t sweat, doesn’t get dirty, doesn’t need to throw himself down.”

21:19 (IST)
05 JUL 2024
Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: Toni Kroos’s Germany vs Rodri’s Spain part 1

Rodri is often the busiest man on the pitch; yet he has the calmest pair of eyes. He is always dispensing instructions, exhorting his men to keep the shape and order, urging them to keep calm and ride the storm, sniffing out a potentially dangerous move, filling up the space left behind by those deputed to attack or spotting an unspotted path to attack. But his eyes remain quiet, serenely scanning the field, processing the next move, and the next, comprehending the thrust of the narrative and seizing it before the adversaries do.

Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: Julian Nagelsmann, Germany coach ahead of game

“It’s not a final, it’s a quarterfinal. We want to be one of the teams in the semifinal. Spain want to be champions as well, so it’ll be a tough game. Both teams are good in possession, have good counter-pressing qualities and can put their opponents under pressure.”

Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: Luis de la Fuente, Spain coach ahead of game

“It’s going to be an equal game. It could have been the Euro final and I think it’ll be an even game on a footballing level. Germany always start matches strongly, so obviously we’ll try and counter that. We’ll try and take the initiative and go all-out from the first minute.”

Spain vs Germany, EURO 2024 Live Score: Hola!

Hello and welcome to our live blog of Germany taking on Spain in the quarterfinal of Euros 2024. It is going to be a cracking game of football for teams who like to play attacking football and keep possession of the ball as well. It is going to be a battle of mid-fields stay with us for all the live updates. 

Toni Kroos’s Germany vs Rodri’s Spain

Rodri is often the busiest man on the pitch; yet he has the calmest pair of eyes. He is always dispensing instructions, exhorting his men to keep the shape and order, urging them to keep calm and ride the storm, sniffing out a potentially dangerous move, filling up the space left behind by those deputed to attack or spotting an unspotted path to attack. But his eyes remain quiet, serenely scanning the field, processing the next move, and the next, comprehending the thrust of the narrative and seizing it before the adversaries do.

His manager Pep Guardiola appraised him as the best midfielder in the world. “He’s able to do everything. The tempo he has, his character when the situation is going wrong, to step forward, go backwards, the ability to play short and long,” the master tactician detailed. He scores important goals too, often stoppage-time winners and equalisers, a Champions League final winner, often long-range screamers. But most of all, he gives midfield control, the territory where big games are often won and lost. READ MORE
