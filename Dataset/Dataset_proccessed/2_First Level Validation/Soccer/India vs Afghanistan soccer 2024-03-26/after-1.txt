Sunil Chhetri's Contribution to Football and Records  

The 150th international match for Indian men’s football team captain Sunil Chhetri ended in disappointment. India lost to Afghanistan  2-1 in the FIFA World Cup 2026 Qualifier, played at the Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Guwahati, Assam, on 26 March 2024.

India has just four points from four matches in the four-team Round 2 group. Currently, Qatar leads the group with nine points from three matches, while Afghanistan has four points from three matches.

India has two more games against Asian champions Qatar and Kuwait.
