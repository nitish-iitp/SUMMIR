REPUBLIC OF IRELAND VS. ENGLAND - PREDICTION

These two sides have met just three times since 1995, with two ending in a draw and England winning one of those head-to-head encounters.

Both of these sides are coming into the game under new managers but Ireland's form is very poor, with the Boys in Green winning only five of their last 19 games, with those wins coming against Hungary, Gibraltar, Latvia and Malta. Ireland have also drawn a blank in front of goal in three of their last four games.

There's a huge gap in quality between these two sides so it feels safe to expect England to win, despite the uncertainty surrounding two teams under new management. Ireland 0-2 England.

REPUBLIC OF IRELAND VS. ENGLAND: PREDICTION, PREVIEW & BETTING TIPS

The upcoming UEFA Nations League clash between the Republic of Ireland and England offers a compelling narrative between two sides entering new eras.

Date: 07/09/2024
Kick-off time: 17:00
Location: Aviva Stadium, Dublin

The Republic of Ireland enter this match at a critical juncture. After three years under the stewardship of Stephen Kenny, the team struggled to find consistent form, leaving Irish fans yearning for something to shout about. Kenny's tenure was marked by a series of underwhelming performances, culminating in a disappointing Euro 2024 qualifying campaign where the team managed only six points from eight games. This dismal showing highlighted the deep-rooted challenges within the squad, and the need for a fresh approach became evident.

The appointment of Heimir Hallgrímsson as the new manager marks a significant shift in the national team’s direction. Known for his previous success with Iceland, where he famously led the team to the quarter-finals of Euro 2016, Hallgrímsson brings a wealth of experience and a track record of exceeding expectations with underdog teams. His pragmatic approach to management, coupled with his ability to build a cohesive team spirit, is precisely what Ireland needs as they look to re-establish themselves on the international stage.

One of the key tasks for Hallgrímsson will be integrating the promising young talent emerging from the Irish ranks into the senior setup. Players like Jake O'Brien, Evan Ferguson, and Troy Parrott represent the future of Irish football. O'Brien, a towering defender with a strong aerial presence, has been making waves at club level and is seen as a potential mainstay in Ireland's backline. Up front, Evan Ferguson and Troy Parrott provide a glimpse of hope for a team that has struggled for goals in recent years. Ferguson, in particular, has drawn attention with his physicality and finishing ability, traits that have made him one of the most exciting prospects in Irish football.

Adding to the excitement around this new era is the inclusion of Kasey McAteer, a dynamic winger who recently switched his international allegiance from England to Ireland. McAteer’s decision to represent the Republic highlights the appeal of this new project under Hallgrímsson. His pace and goal threat on the wings could offer Ireland a new dimension in attack, something that has been sorely lacking in recent campaigns.

However, despite the optimism, the reality is that Ireland remain a team in transition. The legacy of underachievement cannot be erased overnight, and Hallgrímsson will need time to instil his philosophy and build a team capable of competing at the highest level. The Nations League provides an opportunity to start this process, but it will also be a stern test against strong opposition, starting with England.

On the other side, England arrive at this fixture following a period of introspection. After consecutive defeats in the Euro finals—most recently a heartbreaking loss to Spain—the Three Lions are at a crossroads. The departure of Gareth Southgate, who had been at the helm for eight years, marked the end of an era that, despite its disappointments, brought England closer to international glory than they had been in decades.

Taking charge, albeit temporarily, is Lee Carsley. Promoted from the U21s, Carsley has been entrusted with the task of guiding England through this transitional period. His appointment is currently seen as a stopgap solution, but there is a genuine opportunity for him to make the role his own. Carsley’s credentials are strong; he led the U21 side to a European Championship victory last year, earning widespread praise for his tactical acumen and ability to instil an attractive brand of possession football.

One of the most notable aspects of Carsley’s interim tenure has been his willingness to rejuvenate the squad. Drawing heavily from his successful U21 side, Carsley has called up players like Levi Colwill, Angel Gomes, Morgan Gibbs-White, and Noni Madueke—all of whom played pivotal roles in the U21 Euros triumph. These players bring energy, creativity, and a fearless approach to the game, qualities that have sometimes been missing from the senior squad.

Levi Colwill, in particular, is seen as a potential future star for England. The young defender has already begun to make his mark in the Premier League with Chelsea, and his composure on the ball, combined with his defensive intelligence, could see him become a regular feature in the England backline for years to come. Meanwhile, Angel Gomes and Morgan Gibbs-White offer versatility and technical ability in midfield, providing Carsley with options to experiment with different formations and tactical setups.

Noni Madueke’s inclusion adds a touch of unpredictability to England’s attack. The winger, known for his flair and direct style, can be a game-changer on his day. His ability to beat defenders one-on-one and create chances out of nothing will be a valuable asset as England look to evolve their attacking play beyond the traditional reliance on Harry Kane.

Another interesting addition to the squad is Tino Livramento, a right-back, who can also play at left-back, and has impressed with his performances for Newcastle United. Livramento’s energy and defensive nous make him a strong contender for a starting spot, especially given England’s recent struggles with injuries and form on the left side of the defence.

The question now is whether Carsley can blend this youthful exuberance with the experience of established internationals to form a cohesive unit. This match against Ireland will be a significant test of his tactical flexibility and his ability to manage the expectations that come with leading a team of England’s stature. It is also an audition of sorts for Carsley, as a strong performance here could strengthen his case for being appointed as the permanent manager.

TEAM NEWS

Republic of Ireland Team News:

Ireland could do a number of things here with a new manager in the dugout.

Heimir Hallgrímsson has shown a preference for a 4-4-2 setup in recent years, and looking at the squad he's selected it feels plausible he could opt for that setup here.

Predicted lineup: Kelleher; Coleman, O'Brien, Collins, Scales; Ogbene, Cullen, Smallbone, Brady; Ferguson, Szmodics.

England Team News:

Phil Foden, Cole Palmer and Ollie Watkins have all withdrawn from the squad after being assessed by England's medical team, so none will play a part here.

The withdrawal of Foden and Palmer could see Eberechi Eze benefit from a chance to impress from the start, with Jude Bellingham also absent from the squad due to injury.

Predicted lineup: Pickford; Alexander-Arnold, Guehi, Stones, Livramento; Rice, Gomes, Eze; Saka, Kane, Gordon.

REPUBLIC OF IRELAND VS. ENGLAND - FORM GUIDE

The Republic of Ireland's form is poor, as they come into this game fresh off the back of a 3-0 hammering at the hands of Portugal.

Prior to that, Ireland claimed a 2-1 win over Hungary, where Troy Parrott netted the winner in stoppage time after Adam Idah had opened the scoring in the first half.

That result was preceded by a 0-1 defeat to Switzerland, which came after a 0-0 draw against Belgium and a 1-1 draw against New Zealand, where Idah was the man to get on the scoresheet.

England are in pretty good shape as they come into this game with only one defeat in their last five. Most recently, England were beaten 2-1 by Spain in the Euro 2024 final, where Cole Palmer's second half equaliser was not enough to prevent Spain from emerging victorious after grabbing a late winner.

Prior to that came a dramatic 2-1 win over the Netherlands in the semi-finals, where Ollie Watkins' injury-time winner sent the Three Lions to the final after Harry Kane's first half penalty had levelled the scoreline.

That game followed a penalty shootout win over Switzerland following a 1-1 draw where a fine solo goal from Bukayo Saka sent the game into extra-time after Switzerland had taken the lead late in the first half.

Before that, England took on Slovakia, and despite trailing 0-1 in the 94th minute, England still managed to find a way to go through as Jude Bellingham's spectacular overhead kick sent the game into extra-time before Harry Kane's header proved to be the winner.

England's only other result in that five-game stretch was a 0-0 draw with Slovenia.
