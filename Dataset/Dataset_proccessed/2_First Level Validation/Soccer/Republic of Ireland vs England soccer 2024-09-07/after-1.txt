Republic of Ireland 0 England 2: Rice and Grealish defy boos, Gordon’s pace proves key
By Jack Pitt-Brooke, Liam Tharme and more
Sep 7, 2024

275

England beat the Republic of Ireland 2-0 in their Nations League group fixture to give interim manager Lee Carsley a dream start.

Declan Rice opened the scoring in Dublin with a powerful finish in the 11th minute following a fast break from Anthony Gordon, before Jack Grealish doubled the lead 15 minutes later — the result of a flowing move down the right.

The win puts England top of group B2 with Finland and Greece playing later today. Here, our writers Jack Pitt-Brooke, Liam Tharme and Tim Spiers break down the key talking points.

Explained: The UEFA Nations League: How does it work, what’s changed and why does it matter?

Anthems and celebrations 

This was always going to be a game dominated by the non-football context and the fact two England players — Rice and Grealish — as well as Carsley used to play for Ireland.

Carsley’s comments before the game that he would not sing the national anthem have become a huge story, even though he was clear he has never sung an anthem, preferring to focus on the match ahead. So it was no surprise to see Carsley standing tight-lipped when God Save the King was played before kick-off (after he had momentarily sat in the home rather than away dugout).

As expected, Grealish and Rice were heavily booed when the game started, although neither player looked distracted by it. They both started the game brilliantly before scoring. Rice responded with a pointedly muted non-celebration, holding his palms to the floor as if to apologise to the Irish crowd he represented three times in the past.

Grealish, however, was more enthusiastic, joyfully celebrating in front of the travelling England fans as if he had scored a goal against any other country.

Flash Gordon

When interviewed by ITV earlier this week and asked if Euro 2024 was a success or failure for England, Anthony Gordon did not hesitate to say the latter. “You could say we controlled our games, but I don’t think we were very dynamic,” he added, highlighting that England failed to put teams away and relied on individual brilliance.

Part of that was England’s left side, with Kieran Trippier a makeshift, right-footed left-back and Phil Foden ahead of him. It meant England were stocked with ball-to-feet No 10s and a No 9 who wanted to drop into the space in midfield. Southgate only used Gordon once from the bench.

The first half in Ireland showed Gordon’s suitability, consistently running in-behind to complement Harry Kane coming deeper, a key threat against 5-4-1 defending with a high-line, and the ideal type of winger to maximise Trent Alexander-Arnold’s passing range from midfield.

England’s first goal came from that move. Even if Gordon should have scored the initial chance, his runs in behind Ireland’s defence were disruptive, giving England central routes through and pulling defenders deeper to make space for Grealish.

Carsley has stressed the importance of England having multiple ways of playing, all tailored to individual strengths. He’s found one in his first game.

Liam Tharme

Grealish gives Carsley options

This was a great day for Grealish. Back in the England team in his favoured No 10 position, he was integral to everything good that England did. He looked happy and confident, as was clear when he gleefully celebrated his well-taken goal.

It must have been a relief given it was only three months ago that he was cut from Southgate’s squad for Euro 2024 to the shock of not just Grealish himself but some of his team-mates.

Given how well the 28-year-old played, you might think he will be an integral part of the Carsley era. But there is an issue. Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden and Cole Palmer were all absent from this England squad. They are three of England’s best players and not just in this particular position.

They will all want to play in that No 10 role. Southgate never quite worked out how to play Foden and Bellingham together, to England’s cost at the Euros. How Carsley will fit those three along with Grealish will be one of the questions that defines his tenure.

Different to the Euros

This couldn’t have gone much better for England or Lee Carsley.

Watching England play with freedom, pace, fluidity and positive intent in the first half was in stark contrast to the laboured bilge we had to endure during the early stages of the Euros.

There are obvious reasons for the marked difference in quality and entertainment in attacking areas, chiefly how willing Ireland were to give them space to exploit.

New boss Heimir Hallgrimsson was a little naive in how he set up his team — defenders were repeatedly left isolated, particularly Seamus Coleman who endured a torrid time against Gordon at points. If this was a World Cup group stage match, he surely wouldn’t have set up this way.

Another reason for the improvement will be the freshness offered by having new ideas from a new head coach, something England haven’t had since October 2016. The players undoubtedly respected Gareth Southgate, but in the past couple of years, they had lacked the kind of sharpness and buoyancy we saw here, with quick passes, playing through the lines, one-twos, brisk movement and getting their heads up after winning possession and looking forward.

They also pressed with energy and purpose, again something so often lacking in Germany when performances were poor up until the latter stages.

There were also a couple of basic positional changes that having a new manager not tied to old ways always seems to bring, i.e. using common sense to play Trent Alexander-Arnold as a right-back drifting into midfield and Grealish in at No 10.

All in all, a successful new manager bounce for England.

Tim Spiers

What did Lee Carsley say?

On Rice and Grealish:

Carsley told ITV: “I thought they [Rice and Grealish] took their goals really well. Really well-worked moves and brilliant finishes. I think, moving forward, they can both add a lot more goals to their game.

“Jack definitely doesn’t have anything to prove to us, we can see his quality, but today will have done him the world of good, getting another goal for England and hopefully he can continue that form.

“On a really dry sticky pitch, it’s not ideal for dribblers but I thought Anthony [Gordon] was a real threat. He’s carried on his form from last season and he looks a really dangerous player.”

On whether the anthem debate affected his day:

“No, it’s definitely not affected my day or my preparations. I found out about it this morning.  I fully respect people’s opinions. It’s something that I’ve never done. But I fully respect both national anthems. Today would be probably one of the proudest days of my career, to lead an England team out in Dublin, you definitely couldn’t have written it. I don’t feel hard done by or aggrieved, I respect everyone’s opinion.

“I’ve played in teams out there where players are belting the anthem out next to me, but also I’ve played in teams where players or coaches don’t sing. I don’t think it makes me or someone who doesn’t (sing) any less committed. I was looking forward so much to today. It’s the proudest day of my football career.”

What next for England?
