England were ignominiously relegated from League A two years ago, but are firm favourites to top their League B group this time round, although fierce rivals Republic of Ireland would love nothing better than to defeat their neighbours from across the sea on Saturday evening.

Republic of Ireland vs England Preview

It's the start of a new era for England, as Lee Carsley takes charge of the senior side for the first time since being appointed interim manager. He inherits a side who've been very successful under Gareth Southgate, reaching back-to-back Euro finals, even if they don't have the silverware to show for it. Now though is the start of a new era for the Three Lions, who became the first traditional heavyweight to be relegated out of Nations League A in 2022, so are widely-expected to cruise to top spot in this second-tier section, with fixtures against Finland and Greece to come.

Prior to a 3-0 friendly win behind-closed-doors in 2020, England were winless in seven encounters with Republic of Ireland, most-famously beaten 1-0 at Euro '88 by Ray Houghton's stunner in Stuttgart. In Dublin meantime, their last four encounters have all produced draws, so can the Three Lions claim their first on the Emerald Isle for 60 years?

As for the Republic of Ireland, it's also a first match in charge for their new boss Heimir Hallgrímsson. He was Jamaica's manager during last summer's Copa América, having previously been Iceland's head coach, most-notably defeating England en route to the quarter-finals of Euro 2016. He takes over an Irish side in need of a lift, considering they've won only nine of their last 43 competitive internationals, four of which have come against minnows Gibraltar. The Boys in Green have been nowhere near qualifying for any recent major tournaments and, as co-hosts of Euro 2028, have plenty of work to do if they're to be competitive on home soil in four years time. The most memorable moment of Stephen Kenny's ill-fated tenure was a 3-0 home win over Scotland, so will Hallgrímsson's reign begin with a statement success against England?

Republic of Ireland Team News

With goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu sidelined line-term, Liverpool's Caoimhín Kelleher will be donning the gloves, winning his first competitive cap for over two years. During his four-match interim spell in charge, John O'Shea deployed a back three/five, so it'll be interesting to see if Heimir Hallgrímsson sticks with this formation. Assuming captain Séamus Coleman features, he'll win his 73rd cap, only 17 Irishmen have more. In attack, having appeared in all four friendlies so far this year, Sammie Szmodics will make his competitive international debut; he's one of six members of this squad who were born in England.

Republic of Ireland predicted lineup vs England: (3-4-2-1): Kelleher; Collins, O'Brien, Scales; Coleman, Molumby, Knight, Brady; Ogbene, Szmodics, Idah.

Republic of Ireland Player to Watch vs England

The aforementioned Sammie Szmodics is Ireland's danger man, having only declared to represent the Boys in Green earlier this year, despite having been eligible for both England and Hungary. He won the Championships' golden boot last season, an impressive feat considering his Blackburn Rovers side finished 19th, earning him a £9 million move to Ipswich, for whom he marked his full debut with a goal against Manchester City a fortnight ago. He's yet to find the net for Ireland, but now would be a pretty good time to start.

England Team News

Lee Carsley has really shaken things up with his first squad selection, calling-up uncapped quartet Tino Livramento, Morgan Gibbs-White, Angel Gomes and Noni Madueke, all of whom will be hoping to debut here. Meanwhile, Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, Cole Palmer and Ollie Watkins are amongst those missing out due to injury. Trent Alexander-Arnold will surely start at right-back while, with no natural left-back in the squad, Levi Colwill is set to win only his second cap. In attack, captain Harry Kane's 66 international goals have been scored against 30 different opponents, hoping to add Ireland to his list of victims. Lastly, Declan Rice and Jack Grealish both represented Ireland before switching allegiance, so the pair should not expect a warm welcome back to Dublin.

England predicted lineup vs Republic of Ireland: (4-2-3-1): Pickford; Alexander-Arnold, Stones, Guéhi, Colwill; Rice, Mainoo, Saka, Eze, Grealish; Kane.

England Players to Watch vs Republic of Ireland

With no obvious number ten, in the absence of Bellingham, Palmer and Foden, Eberechi Eze is likely to get the chance to stake a claim during this double-header. He took his tally to seven senior caps during the Euros, showcasing what he can do with a fabulous strike at Stamford Bridge last Sunday, so could make an early impression in Lee Carsley's first match at the helm.

Republic of Ireland vs England Prediction

It;'s going to be a battle, but we're forecasting a hard-fought England victory on Saturday evening. The Three Lions should be far too strong for Nations League B, so we're expecting them to leave Dublin victorious while, having kept 11 clean sheets in their last 24 outings, we're backing Jordan Pickford for another shutout too. On the flip-side, Ireland have failed to score in 19 of their last 41 matches, with recent defeats to Portugal, France and Netherlands emphasising that they're unable to compete with elite-level opposition: Republic of Ireland 0-2 England.
