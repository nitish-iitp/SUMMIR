Match Report | Republic of Ireland 0-2 England

Sep 7 2024

The Republic of Ireland was defeated in their opening UEFA Nations League Group B game against England after two first-half goals from Declan Rice and Jack Grealish. 

Ireland had chances of their own to get back in the game, but efforts of note from Szmodics and Molumby failed to find the net. However, it was a game of note for Leicester City winger Kasey McAteer, who was to make his debut for the Boys in Green, coming on in the second-half.

The first chance of the game came in the third minute when a corner for Ireland was met by Jayson Molumby with his header going over Pickford’s goal. This was followed up with a chance for the away side as a cross into the Irish area by Walker was met by Harry Kane whose effort went over the crossbar.

Pickford was forced into making a low diving save after Molumby played an excellent through ball to Szmodics, but the England netminder pushed away his low effort.

Declan Rice opened the scoring for England following two chances in quick succession for the away side. Kelleher denied Gordon with a fine stop that was followed up by an excellent stop by Collins who denied Kane but the resulting ball fell to Rice who smashed the ball to the top right-hand corner in the 11th minute.

England got their second goal of the evening just 15 minutes later following a quick, flowing move from the away side. A quick one-two between Saka and Rice saw the latter send the ball into the path of Jack Grealish who slotted the ball to the bottom left-hand corner. 

Ireland had the first big chance in the second half when a break down the right by Ogbene was met first time by Szmodics with his effort just whistling past the post and wide. This was followed up with another chance for the home side as Szmodics latched onto another Ogbene ball and he switched it to Molumby whose effort from the edge of the area went high over the bar.

Kelleher once again was called into action to deny England a third goal as Gordan’s low effort was stopped by the Irish keeper at his near post into the closing stages of the game. He was to make another fine save as a second-half replacement for England, Bowen, hit a high effort that Kelleher pushed away. 

It was a dominant performance from the away side as Ireland will have to refocus for their big tie against Greece on Tuesday night at the Aviva Stadium.
