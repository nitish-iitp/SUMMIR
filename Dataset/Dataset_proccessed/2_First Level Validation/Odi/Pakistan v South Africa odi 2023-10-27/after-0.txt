October 7 events a ‘horrible failure’: Netanyahu

In response to a question by a reporter if he took responsibility for the Hamas attack on October 7, the prime minister said “difficult questions” will have to be answered, including by him.

“There was a failure here. A horrible failure. There will be no stone unturned in order to save the country and lead it to definite victory,” he said.

Netanyahu said it wasn’t clear if Iran was involved in the planning of October 7, but accused it of funding Hamas. About “90 percent” of Hamas’s military budget comes from Iran, he said.

South Africa hold their nerve to win a thriller against Pakistan

After opting to bat, Pakistan set South Africa a target of 270 as Saud Shakeel and Babar Azam hit half-centuries in the first innings, while Tabraiz Shamsi and Marco Jansen picked up four and three wickets each.

South Africa looked in control of their chase despite losing early wickets as Aiden Markram hit a 91, but after a middle and low order collapse, they were put through a tense chase. In the end, Keshav Maharaj hit the winning runs with 16 balls remaining as the Proteas sealed a thrilling win in Chennai.

The match was arguably the best so far in this World Cup.

Maharaj gets South Africa over the line in tight finish

After Markram took a single off the first ball, Maharaj took matters into his hands, scoring the four runs needed for a win.

As he sent his shot at deep backward square, Maharaj thumped his chest in jubilation as South Africa emerged victorious.

South Africa are now top of the table with 10 points from six games, above India on net run rate, though India have a game in hand.

Pakistan, on the other hand, are sixth with four points from six matches.

The first heartstopping match of the 2023 World Cup.

Long awaited. We need more of this.

47 overs. South Africa 266-9

Wasim’s over starts with a wide before Maharaj takes a single. Shamsi does well to defend the following ball and then runs a single.

And that’s the end of the over. South Africa need five runs from three overs for a win, while Pakistan need a wicket.

This is going down to the wire!

46 overs. South Africa 263-9

Shamsi is South Africa’s last man in as they try to push through for a win.

Rauf ends the over with three runs leaked. South Africa need eight runs to win.

Earlier, Rauf appealed for an LBW dismissal against Shamsi but the umpire was not interested. Pakistan take a review and the ball tracking showed the impact was in line, pitching outside off and just brushing the leg stump. So the on-field decision stands and South Africa survive!

This is the game this tournament needed #CWC2023
