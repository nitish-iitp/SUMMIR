Preview

England will be going head-to-head against Afghanistan in the 13th match of the ODI World Cup 2023 at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi. After defeating Bangladesh by a big margin in their previous match of the flagship tournament, the English will be confident about easing past Afghans in their upcoming encounter. These two nations have played twice against each other in ODIs, during the past two ICC Cricket World Cups, where England got the better of Afghanistan in an effortless way.

Pitch Report

The pitches at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi have been massively in favour of the batters, coupled with the short size of the boundaries. It has led to South Africa breaking the record for the highest ODI World Cup score against Sri Lanka in excess of 400, despite the average first innings score being just 238 at this venue.

Team Analysis

England

Jonny Bairstow and Dawid Malan stitched together a 100-plus run opening stand in no time, against Bangladesh, to bring the ODI World Cup 2023 campaign for England back on track, which provided Joe Root and other batters the opportunity to put 364/9 on the board. Reece Topley, in his first match of the flagship tournament, delivered a few key wickets in the powerplay to allow England to register a comprehensive victory by 137 runs.

Afghanistan

The captain Hashmatullah Shahidi and Azmatullah Omarzai scored important fifties for Afghanistan against India, to ensure that their batting lineup didn’t collapse in back-to-back matches. But, in defence of 272 total, the Afghan bowlers were way below par, conceding the runs in just 35 overs to succumb to their second defeat of the ODI World Cup 2023.

Match Prediction

Conclusion

England have a definite advantage over Afghanistan in their upcoming match of the ODI World Cup 2023, owing to the gulf between the players of both sides. But still, the English can’t afford to be complacent against the Afghans, who are steadily improving their stature in ODI format in recent times.
