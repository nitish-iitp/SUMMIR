In an exciting clash, title holders England are set to face off against Afghanistan in the 13th match of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023. England, after a remarkable performance in their last game, will be looking to maintain their momentum against Afghanistan.

England’s recent match against Bangladesh showcased their resilience, with Dawid Malan playing a key role by scoring an impressive 140 runs. This resilient performance allowed England to post a massive total of 364 and ultimately secure a commanding 137-run victory. Their ability to bounce back highlights their status as defending champions and strong contenders in this World Cup.Afghanistan, on the other hand, hasn’t had the best start to the tournament, suffering losses in both of their previous matches, including a tough defeat against India. Despite their struggles, Afghanistan remains a determined side, and they have displayed moments of promise, particularly with their batting. The spin bowling expertise, led by Rashid Khan, remains their strong suit, and they’ll be aiming to leverage it against England.The match is scheduled to take place at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi. The conditions in Delhi are expected to be hot, with temperatures reaching around 35°C, but it will cool down in the evening. The humidity is predicted to be around 37%, and there is minimal chance of rain, ensuring an uninterrupted game.

Head-to-head, England and Afghanistan have met twice in ODI history, both during previous World Cups, with England coming out victorious on both occasions. England won by 150 runs in the 2019 World Cup and by nine wickets in the 2015 edition.

This encounter promises to be a thrilling contest, with England entering as favorites. However, Afghanistan’s spin attack could be a game-changer, making this match an exciting one to watch. Cricket enthusiasts can catch all the action on the Star Sports Network or live stream it through the Disney+Hotstar app and website. As England aims to continue its winning streak, Afghanistan is determined to put up a strong fight and upset the defending champions.

Pitch Report

The pitch at the Arun Jaitley Stadium generally offers favorable conditions for batsmen, with its dry surface and short boundaries making it easier for them to hit boundaries. However, as the match progresses, spinners can also benefit from the dry pitch, adding an extra dimension to the game. Teams that win the toss often choose to bat first and set a competitive total on the board, which they can effectively defend by capitalizing on conditions that favor both batsmen and spinners.
