#CWC23 | INDvNZ: Come on India, time to end the Black Caps voodoo
By Mumbai Indians | 21 OCT, 2023

It’s the battle of the unbeatens in World Cup 2023 when hosts India take on table-toppers New Zealand at the scenic HCPA Stadium in Dharamsala on Sunday (October 22).

Both teams have won each of the their four opening games in CWC23, but the focus is more so on the Men in Blue - who successfully chased down targets in all their four games to maintain a 70 percent win percentage while chasing in ODIs since 2022.

Rohit Sharma has been in hot form in the World Cup this year, with 265 runs in four games under his belt. Having become the most prolific SIX hitter in international cricket, the Indian skipper is one away from being the first Indian to notch 50 ODI sixes in a calendar year. HITMAN Special LOADING…..

What: India vs New Zealand, ICC Cricket World Cup 2023

When: Sunday, October 22, 2023

Where: HPCA Stadium, Dharamsala

What to expect: Hitman chasing another milestone, Shubman Gill bossing over his favourite opponents, Virat Kohli vs Trent Boult and an entertaining modern cricket rivalry at the scenic venue in Dharamsala.

What you need to do: Recharge your vocal chords to chant ‘Chak de India’ at every boundary struck and every wicket taken by the Men in Blue, carry extra clothing when the early heat is swapped with the evening chill, and keep a strong BELIEVE in Hitman and Co. to win their first ODI World Cup game against the Kiwis in 20 years.
