However, it was Mehidy Hasan Miraz who truly stole the show. Not only did he excel with the ball, but he also showcased his batting prowess, crafting a brilliant 57 runs off 73 balls during Bangladesh's reply. This magnificent display of skill and determination allowed the 2015 quarter-finalists to chase down their target of 157 in just 34.4 overs.

Speaking at the post-match presentation ceremony, Shakib al Hasan expressed his delight with his team's performance, saying, "Very happy with the way we played. We believed if we got a wicket, we could come back in. Wasn't easy for a few players, but happy with the way we batted and bowled. We have been practicing here. We need to adapt to these things (tough outfields) if we want to win."

Furthermore, Shakib expressed his confidence in Bangladesh's bowling arsenal, noting, "We've got three, four fast bowlers; they can change any game, and I hope they will bowl well in the upcoming games. It's a long tournament." He also praised Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Shanto, emphasizing their dedication to performing well for the team.

As Bangladesh revels in the momentum generated by this impressive victory, fans can look forward to an exciting journey ahead in the Cricket World Cup, filled with hope and anticipation under the leadership of their astute captain, Shakib al Hasan.
