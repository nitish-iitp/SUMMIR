Bangladesh are outside contenders to reach the semi-finals ahead of their Cricket World Cup opener against Afghanistan who, in spin friendly conditions, could punch above their weight.

Off-field, Bangladesh have been a mess, with the retirement, un-retirement and then omission (followed by very public spat) of the legendary Tamim Iqbal dominating their headlines.

Oh, and he was also the captain as recently as August.

But they’re a good team. And in conditions that will suit them, a best case tournament looks like potentially sneaking into fourth and making the semi-finals. It’s unlikely, but it’s possible.

Afghanistan, on the other hand, probably won’t reach the semi-finals, but they’re strong enough to really mess around with the competition.

Explosive openers, combined with an excellent spin attack that’s spearheaded by a modern day great in Rashid Khan, means that if you catch them on their good day - or your bad one - a loss awaits.

Cricket is the team sport played by individuals, and Afghanistan have the individuals to knock over good teams.

Bangladesh v Afghanistan key player to watch
Rashid Khan (Afghanistan)

It’s impossible to look anywhere else. The best T20 bowler in the world, who is also capable of launching sixes out of the ground, Afghanistan’s success at this tournament will directly correlate with the success of Khan.

If Bangladesh keep Khan quiet, the path to victory is a lot clearer.
