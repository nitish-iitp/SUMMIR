Bangladesh vs Afghanistan LIVE: Player of the Match is Mehedi Hasan Miraz

"It’s a great moment for me, I’ve done a lot of hard work in the past. But the credit also must go to team management for believing in me. I was a bit cautious, the captain told me to bowl in the right areas. He told me to be consistent and to focus on my own performance so credit to the captain. I didn’t look at the runs. Wicket was turning a bit, I just tried to play straight. I’ve always batted at no 8 so a great moment for me to bat at the top of the order. They tried me at the top of the order in the last few matches and it’s a great moment for me," says Mehedi Hasan Miraz.
