In 2023, the Bangladesh ODI team delivered an encouraging performance, achieving a 40.00% win rate in 20 matches. Their success includes eight victories, demonstrating their competitive edge in the format through consistent displays of skill on the field.

Balancing experience with young talent, the Bangladesh squad is well-prepared for future success in upcoming matches. In general, their performance appears to hold promise, establishing them as formidable competitors for any opposing team.

The Afghanistan cricket team faced challenges in 2023, participating in 11 ODI matches and securing just three victories. Their win percentage stands at 27.27%, indicating a demanding ODI journey for AFG. Improvement in their performance will be essential in the matches ahead.
