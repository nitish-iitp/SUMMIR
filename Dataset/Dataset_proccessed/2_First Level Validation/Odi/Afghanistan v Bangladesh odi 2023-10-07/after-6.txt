A quick look at the head-to-head record and the forms of the two teams before Bangladesh's ODI World Cup opener against the Afghanistan.

Bangladesh are set to kickstart their 2023 World Cup campaign against Afghanistan at the iconic Dharamshala's HPCA Stadium on Saturday morning. This would be World Cup's first day-game in the current edition; however, the backdrop for the Bangladesh team has been anything but serene. A cloud of controversies and internal differences, particularly involving star players Shakib Al Hasan and Tamim Iqbal, has cast a shadow over the team's preparations.

While they recently suffered a defeat to Bangladesh in the Asia Cup last month, the Afghan side will draw inspiration from its remarkable 2-1 series victory over Bangladesh earlier this year.
