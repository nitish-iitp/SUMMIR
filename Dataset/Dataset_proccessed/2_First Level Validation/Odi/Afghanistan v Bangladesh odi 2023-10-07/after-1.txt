‘Atmosphere of fear’

Gaza-based writer Mohamed Mhawish says the the intensity and scale of Israeli air raids has been “huge” and “unprecedented”, especially since Netanyahu announced a full-scale war against Hamas earlier in the day.

“There is nowhere safe to be honest. It is a complete a tragedy,” he told Al Jazeera. “I’m hearing loud explosions that are beyond anything describable.”

Mhawish added there was “an atmosphere of fear” which was widespread, and that it was very difficult for him and others to feel calm in such times.

“It’s something that we are sadly are used to,” he noted, saying this latest assault marked the fifth Israeli attack he had endured while living in Gaza.

Goodbye for now from Dharamsala

A rollercoaster of a start for Afghanistan with highs at the start of both innings followed by deep drop-offs.

A mere merry-go-round for Bangladesh ahead of England – all that was missing was the candy floss.

Hope you enjoyed our coverage of the action today at the delightful Dharamsala.

Join us again tomorrow for more 2023 Cricket World Cup coverage when we bring you a blockbuster as India take on Australia in Chennai.

For now though, thanks for following and goodbye.

Out of the frying pan for Afghanistan

For Afghanistan it’s on to Delhi to face the hosts and heavy favourites for the tournament, India.

Afghanistan captain Hashmatullah Shahidi reflected: “We had a good start but in the middle after losing the second and third wickets we had bad shot selection.

“Their bowlers bowled tight and I’ll give them credit for that.

“I thought we fought well but we did not have enough to defend.

“We need to learn from our mistakes and not do it again.”

Shakib full of praise for his team

Bangladesh captain Shakib said: “We didn’t start the way we wanted but we came back well. All credit to the bowlers and kept and fielded well.

“We also have a seam attack who will go on to do well here.

“We trained really hard on this surface the last two days. We talked about it in the dressing room and said the outfield could not be our excuse and if we want to do well we have to adapt.

On Player of the Match, Miraz, Shakib added, “He’s one of out form players, he and Shanto are confident and did well for the team today.”

Miraz the pick of the bunch

Miraz is awarded Player of the Match for his 57 in the chase and 3-25 from nine overs with the ball.

The offbreak bowler, 25, credited his captain Shakib, who himself claimed three wickets, at the end for his guidance.

Those two could be a handful for England on Tuesday.

England up next for Bangladesh

Bangladesh face the defending champions England on Tuesday at the same venue.

It’s an emphatic victory to take into a game against Jos Buttler’s side who are looking to bounce back from a thumping by New Zealand.

England will have had a good look at this ground and the conditions but the track is two along the square from the one played on today.

Plenty of eyes on the morning of the match will be on how much grass is on the surface once more.

That will interest England’s seamers but it was the spinners to the fore today – so Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid will need to be in form on Tuesday.

Bangladesh win by six wickets!

With three to win Shanto opens up for his third four of his innings – smashing a drive off Naveen through mid-off.

Shanto finishes unbeaten on 59.

Almost fittingly for Afghanistan it was an untidy piece of fielding, at best, that allowed the ball through to win the game.

34 overs. Bangladesh 148-4

And with the end of the 34th over so, too, the fifty for Shanto.

The left-hander nudges a single to move to the milestone after 80 balls with just one four and one six.

Well deserved and well managed. Nearly there for Bangladesh with only single figures to win.

Bangladesh 146-4. Shakib out! Wicket!

No winning runs for the skipper but he’ll take the day he’s had.

Shakib holes out to deep square as he fails to get hold of the pull off Azmatullah.

The ball before was smeared for four through midwicket as Bangladesh try to get this done.

33 overs. Bangladesh 141-3

The siren rings around the stadium as the first no-ball of the match is bowled.

That caught us all on the hop as Naveen over-stepped.

Well I, for one, nearly jumped out of my skin anyway.

The free hit is guided to deep third and just a single for Shanto, who is closing on his fifty.
