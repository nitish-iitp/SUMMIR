Ireland loses half of their side within 10 overs

Chasing a target of 344, Ireland got off to a shaky start, losing Andrew Balbirnie for just one run off seven balls in the second over. In the following over, Lungi Ngidi dismissed captain Paul Stirling for five runs off seven balls.

Curtis Campher and Harry Tector attempted to stabilize the innings, forming a 37-run partnership for the third wicket. The former was dismissed for 17 runs by Lizaad Williams on the third ball of the ninth over. On the very next delivery, Williams also removed wicketkeeper Stephen Doheny for a golden duck.

Tector departed shortly after, scoring 20 runs off 28 balls, including two boundaries. Tector’s wicket left Ireland in a precarious position at 50/5 after 9.5 overs. At the time of writing, Ireland were 90/7 after 19 overs, needing 254 runs to win, with Andy McBrine (4) and Gavin Hoey (4) at the crease.
