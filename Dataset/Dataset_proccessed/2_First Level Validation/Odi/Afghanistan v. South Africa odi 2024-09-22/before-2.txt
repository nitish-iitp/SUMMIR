The three-match ODI series between Afghanistan and South Africa kick off on Wednesday, September 18, in Sharjah. This series is the first bilateral encounter between the two cricketing nations, adding significance as both teams aim to finalize their combinations ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. While South Africa and Afghanistan have previously clashed in ICC events, this will be their first-ever face-off in a bilateral format.

Previous encounters between Afghanistan and South Africa

Their last ODI meeting took place during the ICC World Cup on November 10, 2023, in Ahmedabad, where Rassie van der Dussen’s composed half-century led the Proteas to a five-wicket victory. Now, Afghanistan, led by Hashmatullah Shahidi, will be eager to secure their first-ever victory over South Africa in any format as they face the Proteas side, featuring several fresh faces.

Team news and key players
Afghanistan: Afghanistan have been bolstered by the return of star spinner Rashid Khan, a vital figure in their bowling attack. However, the team will be without opener Ibrahim Zadran, who has been consistent with the bat in white-ball cricket, and spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman, known for his ability to restrict opponents. Key players such as Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Gulbadin Naib and Mohammad Nabi will be expected to step up.
South Africa: South Africa have opted to rest some of their marquee players, including David Miller, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje. Nevertheless, they welcome back pacer Lungi Ngidi, a crucial part of their bowling lineup. Additionally, all-rounder Andile Simelane has earned his first call-up, while Nqaba Peter and Jason Smith, both of whom have T20I experience, could make their ODI debuts.

Form guide and expectations

Afghanistan will enter the series with momentum, having secured a 2-0 series win over Ireland earlier this year in March. South Africa, on the other hand, have not played a 50-over match in 2024 yet. Their last ODI series ended in a 1-2 defeat at home against India, and they will be eager to bounce back, despite fielding an almost new-look team. Both teams will look to fine-tune their strategies, making this historic series a key test ahead of future international challenge
