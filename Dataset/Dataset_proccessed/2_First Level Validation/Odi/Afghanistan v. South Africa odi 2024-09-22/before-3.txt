PREVIEW

In what seems to be unprecedented and historic in itself, Hashmatullah Shahid’s Afghanistan registered a ‘milestone’ series win against South Africa with a 177-run win against South Africa in the second ODI of the three-match series. Now, the highly confident Afghan guys will face the Proteas in the third and last fixture of the three-match series at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium in Sharjah on September 22, 5.30 PM (IST).

Afghanistan had a sensational and unforgettable day at the office when they took on Temba Bavuma’s men in the penultimate fixture of the ODI series. Skipper Shahidi opted to bat first after winning the toss; the star opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz lived up to the expectations of his captain and smashed an amazing century to take the team’s total to 311 runs for the loss of four wickets in the allotted 50 overs. 

Later, Rashid Khan-led bowling attack of Afghanistan bundled the Proteas at the score of just 134 runs in 34.2 overs to register a massive 177-run victory to take an unassailable lead of 2-0 in the series. That said, Afghans will look ahead to register a historic ‘clean sweep’ against SA with a win in the third ODI. On the contrary, South Africa will fight for their prestige; they’ll be eyeing a consolation in Sunday’s dead rubber.

As the team gears up for the upcoming clash, all eyes will be on the thrilling competition set to unfold on the cricket field. Ahead of the game, here is a look at the Dream11 predictions, the fantasy tips, the pitch report, the top player picks, and the best-predicted XIs for the fantasy contests of the match.

PITCH REPORT

The surface at Sharjah Cricket Stadium will be flat and conducive to batting. The pace and bounce will be even, while there could be a hint of turn for the spinners. Meanwhile, the pacers will focus on bowling more cutters and slow balls than seam-up deliveries.
