Afghanistan vs South Africa 2nd ODI, Check Live Score From Sharjah Cricket Stadium (X)

Afghanistan vs South Africa, 2nd ODI, Live Score:  After making history in the first ODI, Afghanistan are set to lock horns with South Africa once again in the second match of the 3-game series, aiming to seal the series and further cement their place among the elite teams in international cricket. The second match will unfold at the iconic Sharjah Cricket Stadium, promising yet another gripping contest. South Africa, who entered the series as clear favourites, stumbled in the first game with a forgettable batting display. The absence of captain Temba Bavuma, due to illness, left the Proteas unbalanced, and it showed in their performance. Their batting lineup was dismantled by Afghanistan’s impressive bowling attack, led by Fazalhaq Farooqi and AM Ghazanfar, leaving the Proteas reeling at 36/7 by the end of the first powerplay. Wiaan Mulder fought back with a gritty 52, helping South Africa post a modest total of 106 before being bowled out. With the ball, South Africa started strong, making early breakthroughs, but Afghanistan’s seasoned duo, Azmatullah Omarzai and Gulbadin Naib steadied the ship, guiding their team to a historic chase and securing Afghanistan’s first-ever ODI win against the Proteas. For the second battle, the Proteas will quickly have to adapt to the subcontinental conditions and come up with a strong response to Afghanistan’s formidable bowling attack, which has been a force in recent years. On the other hand, Afghanistan will be eager to put in another dominant display and seal the series, a potential landmark achievement for this rising team. With this being a must-win game for South Africa, expect them to come out stronger, making this contest even more anticipated.

Rahmanullah Gurbaz is up for a chat and says that the wicket was not easy to bat but they managed it really well and he thinks that it’s a good total for them. Further adds that it is a great opportunity for them to play against the Proteas and they are a very strong team. But he reckons that their bowling unit also has to give up their best to close the game on their side.

On the bowling front, South Africa struggled to contain the Afghan batters, with their bowlers failing to maintain pressure throughout the innings. Despite a decent fielding effort, they found it difficult to restrict runs. Now, they face the daunting task of chasing a formidable target on a surface that seems conducive to Afghanistan’s spin-heavy attack.

Rahmat Shah and Azmatullah Omarzai also played significant roles in building the innings. Rahmat anchored in the middle, scoring a patient fifty in 66 balls, while Azmatullah’s explosive knock of 86 from just 50 balls powered Afghanistan to an imposing total. His aggressive stroke play, particularly towards the end of the innings, provided the crucial final push for Afghanistan.

What a brilliant display of batting from Afghanistan! The batters have put up a stellar batting performance in the second ODI, setting a formidable total of 311/4 in their 50 overs. Their innings was anchored by a superb century from Rahmanullah Gurbaz, who scored his 7th ODI hundred, amassing 105 runs off 110 balls, including 10 boundaries and 3 sixes. Opening partner Riaz provided a brief contribution but fell after the first Powerplay. Rahmat Shah played a calm and steady role in the middle order, crafting a well-paced fifty off 66 balls, while Azmatullah Omarzai gave the innings a much-needed final flourish. Azmat’s blistering 86 off just 50 balls, filled with powerful shots, propelled Afghanistan past the 300-mark and put them in a commanding position.
