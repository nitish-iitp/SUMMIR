Pakistan stay alive, Bangladesh are officially knocked out. That's the big picture at the end of the game. It was a one-sided affair pretty much right from the start. Do be sure to tune in tomorrow for another massive clash that promises to be a thriller with New Zealand facing off against South Africa. This is Abhimanyu signing off!

Pakistan's love affair with Eden Gardens continues

Pakistan have now played seven matches at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, and won six of them. I don't know what's the secret behind their success here (maybe it is the Park Street biryani they refused their hotel food for reportedly, maybe it is not) but clearly, this venue has been happy hunting grounds for them across decades and generations! Their only defeat here came against Sri Lanka in the 1997 Independence Cup.

A big win for Pakistan!
Associated Press

Fakhar Zaman and Abdullah Shafique laid the groundwork for a resounding Pakistan victory at the Eden Gardens. Bangladesh were flattened by the Pakistan bowlers and then by the two openers, as they sunk further in their hopes of securing a Champions Trophy spot which is all left for them to play for.

Pakistan, of course, have kept their hopes of a semi-finals spot alive with this seven-wicket victory.

Fakhar and Shafique started watchfully before slowly picking up the tempo. The two put on 128 for the opening stand, with both batters hitting impressive half-centuries.

Mehidy removed Pakistan's top three, but by the time he made his impact with the ball, Pakistan were well in control.

Fakhar hit 81 off 74 in his comeback game, smashing seven sixes and three fours. Shafique scored two sixes and nine fours in his 69-ball 68.

Of course, the win was originally set up by the bowling unit. Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf started the slide for Bangladesh before Iftikhar Ahmed and Usama Mir picking up a couple of wickets. Shaheen returned to take an important wicket and so did Rauf before Wasim ran through the tail.

Only Imran Nazir has hit more sixes than Fakhar Zaman for Pakistan in an ODI World Cup game. Fakhar became only the second Pakistan batter to hit five or more sixes in an ODI World Cup game.

He misses out on his century, holing out at cow corner to give Mehidy his third wicket, but it's a knock of the highest quality, helping make this chase as straightforward as it could get.

Abdullah Shafique is trapped lbw as he misses a sweep and it gives Bangladesh something to be relieved about, if not pleased. Shafique and Fakhar Zaman fall just six runs short of Pakistan's best opening stand of the tournament, but Shafique can walk back knowing that they all but have the match in the bag. With a required rate less than three, it's unlikely that Bangladesh can work their way back into this contest.

Shakib Al Hasan has launched himself into the attack and he is a threat Pakistan will be wary of. With 21 wickets in 17 games, he has been Bangladesh's most prolific wicket-taker against Pakistan in ODI history. He will need to add a few to that tally if he wants to keep his team's chances alive at the Eden.

Mustafizur Rahman is among the most wily bowlers in the world, but Abdul Shafique has taken the attack to him. Shafique takes on a pitched up delivery and sends it aerially to the long-on boundary before whipping a length ball off his pads through midwicket. He finishes the over with another flick over midwicket. He has moved to 38.

Dropped early inthe tournament, Fakhar has marked his return with a solid knock that is setting them up for a comfortable chase.

Pakistan won by 85 runs

Led by Misbah-ul-Haq, Pakistan registered a comfortable win over India to seal the series in what was Pakistan's last bilateral tour of India.

Nasir Jamshed hit a century, while Mohammad Hafeez scored a quick 76 before Ishant Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja helped India run through the rest of the batting lineup.

But Saeed Ajmal, Junaid Khan and Umar Gul combined to bundle India out for 165. Even MS Dhoni's defiant half-century could not get India close to a result.

Pakistan clean Bangladesh up for 204
Associated Press

Mohammad Wasim castles the last three batters to finish Bangladesh's innings in the 46th over. It rounds off an excellent bowling display, especially by the quick bowlers, with Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf providing the early breakthroughs.

Mahmudullah hit a valiant fifty, while Shakib Al Hasan and Litton Das fell just short. Bangladesh could not get any partnerships going and it sees them fall around 50 runs short of even the average first innings score at this ground.

Shaheen struck in the very first over, trapping Tanzid lbw, and was then gifted a wicket by Shanto, who chipped him to midwicket. Haris Rauf, hit for three boundaries in the first five balls of his first over, completed it by getting Mushfiqur to edge behind.

Mahmudullah and Litton then kept the bowlers at bay for around 15 overs before Litton also fell victim to a soft dismissal, chipping Iftikhar to midwicket.

Shaheen returned to dismiss Mahmudullah, and Towhid Hridoy was out trying to force the issue early in his innings.

Shakib and Mehidy Hasan Miraz then looked to put on another rescue act, but once Rauf had Shakib miscuing a pull, Wasim returned to run through the rest.

We all know how dangerous Mehidy Hasan Miraz can be in the back end of an innings, and even though he was running out of support, as long as he was at the crease, Pakistan were in dangerous of letting Bangladesh get away. But Wasim gets a full delivery to tail in, with a hint of reverse swing, and it knocks off-stump out of the ground as Mehidy swings across the line and misses. One delivery later, he pitches it up on middle and leg to Taskin and with the reverse sweep, it beats the bat to take off stump again.

Change in bowling brings a wicket, with Haris Rauf accounting for the well set Shakib Al Hasan. Shakib goes to pull a short ball and gets a top edge that Agha Salman just about holds on to at midwicket. Rauf can afford a little laugh as that ball nearly pops out of the fielder's hands. Shakib ,isses out on a half-century, and more importantly, exposes the Bangladesh tail.

He looks to continue his aggression and when Usama flights it up wide of the stumps, he reaches out trying to slap it away but just manages to get an edge to Iftikhar Ahmed at first slip. Bangladesh lose two wickets in two overs, and suddenly, after two steady partnerships, they are wobbling.

Of course it had to be that man Shaheen Shah Afridi who gets the crucial breakthrough. He goes around the wicket and gets a length ball to ricochet onto the stumps off Mahmudullah's pad, straightening just enough to beat his flick. Mahmudullah was looking dangerous, but like so many times in this World Cup, Shaheen has taken a crucial wicket in the middle overs. This is his seventh wicket in the middle overs in the tournament. This also makes him the joint-highest wicket-taker in the World Cup, with 16 wickets along with Adam Zampa.

The promotion to No. 4 has so far paid great dividends for Mahmudullah. He scores his 28th ODI half-century and he has been scoring at a decent click too. He has hit four fours and one six so far. He came in with Bangladesh in trouble and then gave impetus to the partnership with Litton Das. Bangladesh will want him to go on and make this a big one.

This is the second time Litton has got just lucky with the ball falling short of the fielder, having almost pulled Shaheen Shah Afridi to midwicket early in his innings.

Shaheen Shah Afridi, in two overs today, doubled his tally of powerplay wickets in this World Cup. This one though, of Najmul Hassan Shanto, should be credited more to Usama Mir for taking a fine catch at midwicket, falling to his right. Shaheen bowls one on the pads and Shanto clips it too close to the fielder.

Coming into this game, Pakistan have won 78% of the games where Shaheen has taken two or more powerplay wickets.

Shaheen finds swing straight away, getting the first ball to shape away from the bat. Continues to bowl it on a fourth-fifth stump line for the next three deliveries, just varying his length. Tanzid also starts moving across his stumps. And on the fifth, he Shaheen gets in to go on straight and rap him on the front pad knee roll.

One battle to watch out for at the top will be Litton Das against Shaheen Shah Afridi. In the three games that Shaheen has bowled to Litton, he has got him out twice. Litton has managed just 6 runs from 14 balls against the left-arm quick. Litton has blown hot and cold this World Cup and was out early against Netherlands at the same venue.

The only respite for him is that Shaheen has not been at his lethal best with the new ball this World Cup. He has managed just two of his 13 wickets in the powerplay, averaging 69 in the first ten overs.

All in all, this is set up to be one contest to look forward to early in the game.
