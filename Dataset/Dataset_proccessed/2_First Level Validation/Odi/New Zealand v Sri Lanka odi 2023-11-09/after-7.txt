NZ 172/5 in 23.2 overs

FOUR! Phillips drives this down the ground as Madushanka overpitches. FOUR! Pulled away to the boundary behind square-leg and New Zealand wins by five wickets with plenty to spare.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 19:41
W
NZ 164/5 in 23 overs

Beaten! Phillips looks to lift this over the in-field on off-side off Mathews length delivery but is beaten. Driven through the off-side for a single by Phillips. FOUR! Straying on the pads and put away to the fine-leg boundary by Mitchell with ease. OUT! Mitchell ends up chipping this high in the air as Mathews takes the pace off the ball. The ball balloons in the deep behind point and a stunning effort diving forward by Asalanka to complete this catch. Latham comes in and Mathews straight away goes up for a leg-before review as Latham misses a flick down leg-side. But the ball is pitching outside the line of leg-stump and Sri Lanka loses the review. A couple to end the over and Latham is off the mark.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 19:36
NZ 157/4 in 22 overs

Madushanka returns. Pushed down the ground for a single by Mitchell. Short and pulled away by Phillips with brute force to deep midwicket for just a single. Off the inside half of the bat of Mitchell to long-on for one more. Short, goes over Phillips attempted pull and called wide for height. Tucked off his hips by Phillips for a couple at deep midwicket. Full ball clipped off the pads for one more by Phillips and he will keep strike.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 19:30
W
NZ 150/4 in 21 overs

Mathews with the ball. Spanked to long-off by Mitchell for a single. OUT! Confusion in the middle and Chapman is run out. He swung his bat for the fences but got an inside edge that went off his legs to square-leg. Mitchell hared off for a single and Chapman first sent him back but then was forced to sacrifice himself for the set batter. He is fuming as he walks off. Glenn Phillips comes in and starts off with FOUR! He slashes hard outside off stump and the ball goes in the air but through the gap between point and backward point.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 19:23
4
NZ 144/3 in 20 overs

Madushanka comes back. FOUR! Back of a length outside off and Chapman swats this over the covers for his first boundary. This is pushed to mid-on for a single next ball by Chapman. Driven to long-off by Mitchell for one more. Three successive singles as Chapman comes back for one more. FOUR! Full, in the slot and Mitchell slogs and finds the midwicket boundary. Full and Mitchell hammers this straight and the ball goes off the bowler and dribbles to mid-on for a single. The ball went off Madushanka’s boot and it looks like he has hurt himself as the physio is on the field to check on him.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 19:16
W
NZ 132/3 in 19 overs

Mathews again with the ball. FOUR! Short and this is pulled away to the midwicket boundary. FOUR! Williamson chops on and has to go. Mark Chapman is the new man in. Wide down leg-side by Mathews. Chapman is off the mark with a tight single after punching the ball to mid-off. Mitchell defends solidly on the off-side to end the over with two dot balls.

Shortish, it sits up for Mitchell to hit and he launches this towards the midwicket fence for a couple of runs. Four runs from the first three balls. FOUR! This is punched beautifully through covers by Williamson for a boundary. He dabs the next ball for a single at deep third. One more for Mitchell to end the over.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 19:03
4
NZ 108/2 in 16 overs

Theekshana beats Williamson outside off first ball of the over. The next one turns into him and hits Williamson high on the back pad. Full toss after that and flicked down the ground for a single. FOUR! Reverse-sweep again from Mitchell and this goes to the backward point boundary. Defended back to the bowler to end the over.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 18:57
6
NZ 103/2 in 15 overs

Chameera again. Williamson gets an outside edge that evades the slip fielder and just a single. Huge appeal for caught behind as Mitchell comes down the wicket and is beaten outside off. Mendis decides not to review it and that turns out to be a good decision as there was no bat on this and it flicked the back pad on the way to the keeper. SIX! This is slapped down the ground for a six by Mitchell. It went high up in the air, didn’t come off the middle of the bat but still went the distance. FOUR! Full on the pads and Mitchell shimmies out and clips this over midwicket for another boundary.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 18:52
W
NZ 92/2 in 14 overs

Theekshana again. Ravindra makes good use of his feet and punches to long-off for a single. Punched to long-off by Williamson and he is off the mark with a single. OUT! Ravindra looks to slog sweep this over the in-field on leg-side but doesn’t get the elevation and ends up handing a catch at mid-on. Big wicket for Sri Lanka and both openers are back in the hut. Here comes Daryl Mitchell. FOUR! First ball reverse-sweep and he beats the backward point fielder to fetch a boundary. Full-toss next up and Mitchell reverse-sweeps this to the short-third fielder and misses an opportunity to absolutely belt this delivery over the fence.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 18:45
W
NZ 86/1 in 13 overs

Chameera continues. Blocked with the inside half of the bat by Conway to mid-on. OUT! Conway has to go. He gave Chameera the charge and ended up handing a catch at midwicket as the ball flew off the inside half of the bat. Kane Williamson is in next. He dabs the first one to backward point. This is punched to point by Williamson. He now hops and punched this short delivery and stopped by the cover fielder. A bit of bottom edge as Williamson defends this one. Maiden wicket for Chameera.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 18:42
4
NZ 86/0 in 12 overs

Theekshana to bowl his fourth over. FOUR! Ravindra rocks back and pulls this through midwicket for another boundary. This is whipped to long-on for one more. Punched by Conway to long-on for one more and he will keep strike.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 18:26
NZ 65/0 in 9 overs

Dushmantha Chameera into the attack. Starts off with a short of a length ball on leg-stump and defended back to the bowler. Ravindra pushes the ball to mid-off and hares for a quick single. A direct-hit at non-striker’s end is reviewed but Ravindra is comfortably home. This is fended off awkwardly by Conway on leg-side for quick single and uneven bounce has troubled Conway on two occassions in this over. The physio is out to have a look at Conway’s hand as he seems to have been hit by the last short delivery.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 18:24
6
NZ 63/0 in 8 overs

Theekshana again. Conway gets a single at long-off. SIX! Dispatched with absolute disdain. Ravindra slog sweeps this over deep midwicket for a maximum. FOUR! Next ball he moves his feet well and cuts this with authority through point for a boundary. He keeps strike with a single at long-off off the last ball of the over.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 18:17

Full on the legs and Conway whips this through midwicket for another boundary. That’s 50 up for the Kiwis in 6.3 overs. Full on the pads and pushed down the ground for a quick single by Conway. Beaten! This whizzes past Conway’s outside edge as the ball deviates just a bit and leaves the left-hander to beat his drive.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 18:14
6
NZ 42/0 in 6 overs

Dhananjaya de Silva into the attack. Dragged short and Ravindra rocks back and pulls this to long-on for a single. Tucked on the leg-side by Conway for a single next ball. SIX! Ravindra clears his front leg and lofts this over wide long-off for a maximum. Imperious shot. Ten runs from the over.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 18:11
4
NZ 32/0 in 5 overs

Madushanka again. FOUR! Shortish outside off and Conway gets a thick outside edge as he goes fetching wide outside and the ball flies past the diving keeper to the boundary. A couple more as Conway whips the next one through square-leg. FOUR! Incredible timing. He just gently patted the ball to mid-on and beat the diving fielder there to fetch another boundary. FOUR! Short and this is duly pulled to the square-leg boundary.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 18:06
NZ 18/0 in 4 overs

Theekshana will continue. Full outside off and drilled to long-off for a single by Ravindra. Tossed up on middle and driven down the ground by Conway for one more. Theekshana troubles Ravindra a bit with his carrom ball that turns into the left-hander.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 18:01
4
NZ 16/0 in 3 overs

Pushed to point by Conway for a dot ball. Another dot as Conway defends tentatively outside the off-stump. Conway prods outside off and the bowler looks very interested in a caught-behind dismissal. He pleads the captain to go upstairs and he obliges. There is significant gap between bat and ball and Conway survives. FOUR! Full on the toes and Conway drives this down the ground with ease for a boundary.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 17:58
4
NZ 12/0 in 2 overs

Maheesh Theekshana from the other end. Ravindra starts off by punching a length ball back to him. Similar shot to the bowler next ball. Sliding down leg-side and clipped off the pads for a couple. Cut away behind point and a misfield allows the batters to steal a couple of runs. This is defended solidly off the front foot on the off-side. FOUR! Beautifully driven through covers as Ravindra opens the face of the bat on the drive.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 17:50
4
NZ 4/0 in 1 over

Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra will begin the run-chase for the Kiwis. Huge cheer from the crowd as Rachin’s name is announced.

Length ball on off-stump and defended to the bowler. Four dots in a row. FOUR! Short and this is pulled away by Conway through midwicket for a boundary. Last ball of the over is left alone outside off.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 17:26
Sri Lanka folds out for 171

New Zealand will be happy with the target but given where the Lankan innings was at one stage, it would know it took too long to get the final wicket. Maheesh Theekshana, Dilshan Madushanka and Dushmantha Chameera did their best to frustrate the Kiwi bowlers and give their side a total to fight for.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 17:21
SL 171 in 46.4 overs

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 16:18
SL 128/8 in 32 overs

Boult to Theekshana. Boult is able to trap him on the pads on the final delivery and Williamson goes for a review. There is no inside edge but this one looks to be going down leg. The ball tracker confirms it and NZ loses its second review.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 16:17
SL 128/8 in 31 overs

Theekshana slaps Santner through covers but Mark Chapman is quick in covering ground at long off which keeps it to single. Two more singles in the over.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 16:11
SL 125/8 in 30 overs

Alright, Kane Williamson has had enough. He gets his strike bowler Trent Boult back to wrap up the tail. PUT DOWN! The last delivery of the over sees Chameera tap a simple catch back towards Boult whose one-handed effort is not enough to grasp it. The end of another maiden.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 14:06

Full and driven to mid-off by Perera for a dot ball. Dropped! Outside edge and dropped by Latham. That was an easy take and Latham dropped it as the ball kept going away from him. OUT! Latham makes no mistake next ball as Nissanka gets a feather on the outside edge and this goes straight into Latham’s gloves. Top stuff from Southee. Kusal Mendis comes in next. He charges down the wicket and leaves the ball alone outside off.

NOVEMBER 09, 2023 14:00
SL 1/0 in 1 over

Kusal Perera and Pathum Nissanka will open the batting for Sri Lanka. Trent Boult with the new ball and he will hope to put his forgettable PowerPlay returns in the tournament behind him today. Angled into the right-hander Nissanka, who defends on the front foot. On a length just outside off and a slight bottom edge on the cut. Shaping into the right-hander again and blocked solidly. Tucked to square-leg for a fifth dot ball in a row. Driven with an open face and stopped by Phillips at point to keep it down to just a single.

What’s at stake?

Well, quite a bit. New Zealand will need to win this to cement its place in the semifinals. It could still be eliminated though if Pakistan beats England comprehensively, going past New Zealand’s Net Run Rate. What goes in the Kiwis’ favour is that they have the best NRR among teams vying for the fourth spot, the other teams being Pakistan and Afghanistan.
