That’s all folks!

So that brings an end to our coverage.

Thanks for joining us, and we hope you enjoyed the coverage.

Another tasty-looking encounter on Monday as New Zealand face the Netherlands in Hyderabad. The Dutch made their way into the tournament at the expense of the West Indies, Ireland and Zimbabwe via the qualifiers hosted by the latter.

The Kiwis, of course, looking to go two from two after handing out some revenge to England after their defeat in the 2019 final.

Join our coverage again soon.

From Shubi Arun, Patrick Keddie and myself, Kevin Hand, it’s goodbye for now.

On to New Delhi for the favourites

After a statement win against Australia, India now face Afghanistan in New Delhi on Wednesday.

It was a trouncing for Afghanistan against Bangladesh on Saturday, so they face a tall order to avoid consecutive defeats to start the tournament.

Australia have one more day to rest and recover from the Indian hiding before they face a huge task against South Africa in Lucknow on Thursday.

Aiden Markram recorded the fastest World Cup 100 as South Africa hit 425-5 in a 102-run victory against Sri Lanka.

That was the highest score for the Proteas in the tournament’s history.

With Australia’s opening defeat, that promises to be a mouthwatering clash as the Aussies will be desperate to get a win on the board.

‘Hats off to Virat and KL’: Rohit Sharma

India captain Rohit Sharma on starting with a win: “Pretty exciting. A good feeling to come out on top. It was a good game for us. To start the tournament in the way we did was quite pleasing to see.

“Our bowlers used the conditions perfectly. We knew that there will be some assistance for everyone. We saw the seamers getting some kind of rewards as well. The spinners bowled in nice areas and kept challenging the batters.

“You don’t want to start your innings like that when you’re chasing that kind of target, but credit to the Aussies. They bowled well.

“Some loose shots there as well but that happens when you are chasing that kind of target. You want to get off the mark as quickly as possible and score as many as possible in the power play.

“Hats off to Virat and KL and how they stuck in the middle out there and created that match-winning partnership for us.”

Cummins rues Kohli drop

Australia captain Pat Cummins was left to rue the drop of Kohli early in the chase: “Not ideal – especially someone of his calibre. Four down would have been the ideal start but not to be.”

He was equally disappointed with the performance with the bat: “It’s going to be tough defending around 200 on any wicket.

“Their spinners in particular were tough work out there so it was one of those wickets you have to get yourself in on.

“We had them three down for two runs with our quick bowlers, and if you put another fifty on the board that bowling performance looks a bit different.

“It’s only one game out of nine but there are areas we need to get better.”

KL Rahul – Player of the Match

No surprise who the Player of the Match is: KL Rahul.

So what was the chat with Virat Kohli when he arrived in the middle at 2-3: “There was not a lot of conversation. I was just trying to catch my breath.

“I had just had a shower and thought I would get a good half an hour or an hour to put my feet up and just rest up but I was out there in no time. So it was a bit of a rush.

“Virat said there’s a bit of help in the wicket so you just have to play proper shots and play like it is Test cricket and see where it goes so that was mostly the plan.

“It remained the same for most of the game. There was a bit of help for the fast bowlers even when we bowled and when the spinners came on there was a bit in the wicket but in the last 15 or 20 overs, the dew played a little bit of a part for them. And when they changed the ball it came on a little better.

“It wasn’t a great wicket to bat on nor was it too flat. I think it was a good wicket and that’s what you get in the south of India.

“I was calculating how I could get to a hundred in the end – the only way was to hit a four and then a six and that’s what I planned but I hit it too well.”

Three ducks and two heroes

After keeping Australia below 200 that game should always have been India’s.

Three ducks at the start of the innings gave the Aussies hope.

Once Kohli was dropped on 12 that hope was extinguished by as good a partnership as there could be.

Australia had no answer to the fourth wicket pairing and that will be a huge concern for them.

India have sent a clear message to all their challengers in their opening game.

Did Rahul hit that too well?

Rahul finishes unbeaten on 97 and appeared in some shock when that last ball went for six.

Was he just looking to chip four off that one to leave him with a chance of going for the century with a six thereafter?

It looks as though that was exactly what was in his mind.

He was trying to go inside out with the field up in the circle but the timing was too good.

A chanceless innings from Rahul and fitting that he hit the winning runs even if he missed out on the hundred.

41 overs. India 195-4

Not to be upstaged, KL Rahul is on the act.

First ball of Maxwell’s over goes back over the bowler’s head for six.

The second goes in the same direction for four on this occasion.

A single third ball takes Rahul to 90.

Two more singles follow before the over is out and Rahul will have strike on 91 with five needed to win.
