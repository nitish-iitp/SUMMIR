Virat Kohli and KL Rahul have guided India to a comfortable six-wicket victory over Australia in their Cricket World Cup opener.

The pair steadied the ship for the hosts after Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood combined to send Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kashan and Shreyas Iyer all back to the pavilion for ducks.

With that early onslaught, India found themselves 3-2.

But that was the end of Australia's joy as they were left to rue a simple Mitch Marsh dropped catch.

Kohli was dropped on 12 by Marsh when he skied a short ball off Hazlewood. Marsh charged in but failed to get his hands to the ball as it went through his arms with Alex Carey also approaching.

It proved costly as Kohli reached 85 before he was eventually caught at mid-wicket pulling Hazlewood (3-38) again.

But by that point, the game was all but over, as India ran down the target with 8.4 overs to spare.

"It's not ideal, especially someone of his calibre," Australia captain Pat Cummins said of the drop.

"It happens, 4-20 would have been a dream start, but not to be."

KL Rahul also finished unbeaten on 97, as he and Kohli put on 165 for the fourth wicket after Mitchell Starc (1-31) and Hazlewood had India wobbling at 3-2.

India were able to bat without risk after Kohli's early life in the chase, against an Australian team that were sloppy at times at Chennai's MA Chidambaram Stadium.

Scorecard

The obvious net run-rate hit aside, the other big issue for Australia looms as spin.

On a slow wicket that offered plenty for the turners, India's three spinners bowled a combined 30 overs for 6-104 as Australia batted themselves into a hole.

Only David Warner and Steve Smith passed 30 for the five-time world champions, before they were all out in the last over and faced 174 dot balls in their innings.

Australia at one stage went 73 balls between boundaries and hit two in total between the 16th and 39th overs, in a period where spin was almost exclusively used.

Ravindra Jadeja was the pick of the spinners with 3-28, while Kuldeep Yadav also bagged 2-42 after taking the crucial wicket of Warner for 41 to halt Australia's momentum.

Jadeja then took all three of his wickets in the space of 2.3 overs, as Australia's platform of 2-110 quickly eroded to 5-119.

The left-arm orthodox spinner's ball to get Smith was the best of the lot, after it angled in at the right-hander, spun back past his outside edge and took the top of off stump for 46.

In reply, and with the ball skidding on more in dewy conditions, Australia's spinners couldn't get anywhere near the same purchase.

After Starc and Hazlewood left India reeling with three wickets in the first two overs, the hosts were able to cruise through the middle parts of their innings.

Maxwell was brought on by the 10th over and went for 0-33 from his eight overs, while Adam Zampa went for 0-53 from eight.

With Ashton Agar a late omission for the tournament through a calf injury, Australia's spin stocks are limited with Zampa the only front-line option in the squad.

But on Sunday night, he never really threatened to take a wicket

That could become an issue later in the tournament, particularly if wicket squares wear and turn more as the World Cup goes on.

"We had them 3 for none basically with our quick bowlers, so I wasn't too upset (about the lack of spin options)," Cummins said.

"We still had 20 overs of spin.

"I think with another 50 on the board there that bowling innings looks a little bit different."
