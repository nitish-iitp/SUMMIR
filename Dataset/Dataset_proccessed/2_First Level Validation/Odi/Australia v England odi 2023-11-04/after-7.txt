Well that’s it from me – and for England’s hopes in this competition.That defeat of Bangladesh on October 10 seems a long time ago – since then a dirty great storm of poor form and spiralling lack of confidence. The holders still have two more games left – against the Netherlands and Pakistan – from which to salvage some pride and a possible Champions Trophy place.

Australia, meanwhile, are up and away, with clear water between them and New Zealand, Pakistan and Afghanistan. A semi-final place is very likely, if not yet mathematically sealed. The reports from today will be in place soon, thanks for all your messages – goodnight!

Buttler did speak. This is what he said: “I feel like we are having the same chat after every game at the minute. There were improvements again today. We got back to more like how we can play but still short of it to lose by 30 odd.

“There’s plenty of ways to find those 30 runs we needed. It certainly feels like a low point. I’ve had a few but definitely as a captain. To be stood in this position having arrived in India with high hopes is incredibly tough and disappointing. It hurts a lot.

“We haven’t done ourselves justice. Coming into the tournament we fancied ourselves to have a real go and push whoever it was going to be all the way. It’s incredibly tough to reach those highs absolutely. Everyone knows how much hard work goes into that, and even when you come up short.

“We’ve let ourselves down. We’ve let down people down at home, who support us through thick and thin and we wear that on our own shoulders.”

Jos, dump that guilt. We all fail – but most of us without the huge success first.

Adam Zampa wins the player of the match award for his 3-21 off 10, and I’m not sure if I missed Jos Buttler, when I was trying to find the right channel, but there is no sign of him now

Moeen Ali has the short straw and is with Sky “ Obviously very disappointed, we just haven’t been good enough in this tournament, a lack of confidence in the side. A little better today. We tried so much, and as players tried to be really aggressive but we just couldn’t do it and lost wickets in clumps.

“The message has been clear, just go out and play our game, I think just the lack of belief in the side…we haven’t done it.

Stands by Buttler and Mott:“I think the clarity in the players, the messaging, has generally been the same but …. maybe we haven’t been talking to each other in the same way. Lack of runs, lack of wickets, you can feel embarrassed and internalise it a bit. In the past we’ve stuck our chest out but this time we haven’t done that.

“I know it is very disappointing at the minute but going forward with the players we have and the younger players coming through with the fearless attitude they have…” and then the feed drops I’m afraid.

A smiling Pat Cummins, “We knew at the start of the tournament we weren’t at our best, we’ve seen a marked improvement. Adam Zampa is a match-winner, and we’re lucky to have a few of them. We feel like we have a whole squad ready to play.”

England are knocked out of the World Cup

Put the calculators away – its all over. They go out with some pride after a hard-fought performance –despite today being their sixth defeat of the competition. They remain bottom of the table. Sky show what they think by flicking straight to the football.

WICKET! Rashid c Inglis b HAzlewood 20 (England 253 all out) Australia win by 33 runs and England are out of the World Cup

Swing, edge, out.

48th over: England 253-9 ( Rashid 20) It IS Stoinis. Rashid and Woakes are breathing heavily, obviously. Cummins dries the ball, but it still slips out of Stoinis’ hand – a full toss, that Rashid edges behind slip for SIX! Woakes misses a slow bouncer, and has to attack the full toss. Very nicely batted.

WICKET! Woakes c Labuschagne b Stoinis 32 (England 253-9)

Woakes takes fly at a full toss – he has to – and it goes up, up and Labuschange collects, as tightly as the Aussies have all afternoon.

17.40 CET

47th over: England 243-8 ( Woakes 29, Rashid 13) Just three singles off Cummins until Woakes lets fly and slaps the ball straight back for six with a slotted spoon. England need 43 from 18 – with the two part-timer overs left. Tantalising!

17.36 CET

46th over: England 233-8 ( Woakes 21, Rashid 11) A helicopter swish of the blade from Adil Rashid, and a diving Cameron Green on the boundary both loses the ball and his trousers. Seven from Hazlewood’s over, 54 needed from 24.

“Hola de Mexico,” nice to meet you Kat Peterson. “I’d like to join the foreign correspondents contingent. Thought I’d avoid England’s ignominy by being out and about but have inadvertently ended up in a city with public wifi everywhere. Thanks Mérida. Obviously I could stop constantly refreshing the score but it’s the hope etc etc.”

45th over: England 223-7 ( Woakes 19, Rashid 3) Superb over from Cummins, leaking just three. But as they point out on comms, Australia are still going to need two overs from their part timers.

“I don’t pretend to know why England keep stepping on rakes, Sideshow Bob style,” muses Niall Mullen, “but it is stark how a team for whom nothing seemed impossible has transformed into a team where nothing is possible.”

At this point, I should say they need two a ball for five overs.

44th over: England 223-7 ( Woakes 19, Rashid 3) Woakes isn’t going down without a fight. Slaps Hazlewood through midwicket for four. Willey managed another four before being brilliantly caught by Zampa. This is still, tentatively, a possibility.

WICKET! Willey c Zampa b Hazlewood 15 (England 216-8)

Another superb catch from Australia – this time a running, one-handed clutch and dive on the boundary rope from Zampa.

43rd over: England 212-7 ( Woakes 11, Willey 15) Starc’s final over proving more lucrative for England than his first. A wide to start, then two handsome drives from Woakes for four, one square, one through cover. Thirteen from the over.

17.16 CET

42nd over: England 187-7 ( Woakes 7, Willey 9) Zampa, baby-faced, even at 31, wheels through his final over, concedes just one. Congratulated by Warner, and Labuschagne, he tucks his towel into the back of his trousers and wanders away to his fielding position. Three for 21 today, 19 in the tournament. Fabulous stuff.

17.12 CET

41st over: England 187-7 ( Woakes 6, Willey 10) An expensive eleven from Starc’s over, including a wide and two up yours boundaries from David Willey.

“Hi Tanya,” hello Edmund Bannister!

“My son loves the Pixar film inside out at the moment, I can’t help but see the parallels with this England team, once driven by joy, there now seems to be sadness, disgust, fear and anger at the control panel ….!”

17.08 CET

40th over: England 187-7 ( Woakes 5, Willey 1) The required rate is ten an over. A third wicket for the excellent Zampa who now has 9-0-20-3.
“Maybe I’ll start the pizza early for everyone,” types Mark Beadle, a man suddenly in a hurry. “BYOB.”

WICKET! Moeen c Warner b Zampa 42 (England 186-7)

The end of Moeen, for a delicate run a ball 42. Cummins ushers Warner into position and Mo obliges by slog sweeping with pin point accuracy. As he hits, he knows, and drops his head in frustration. Warner celebrates with typical restraint.

39th over: England 186-6 ( Moeen Ali 42, Woakes 5) And over that starts with a Moeen hook for four, ends with a Woakes upper-cut for four, with a single in between. The umpires reach in a chocolate box of balls for a new one. It has to be the dark chocolate truffle.

Merni writes to point out that, “All of India is also in the northern hemisphere!” Good point – I’ll go back and tweak.

WICKET! Livingstone c Abbot (sub) b Cummings 2 (England 174-6)

Livingstone pulls fiercely – but from nowhere at midwicket appears a flying Sean Abbot, who grabs with both hands and doesn’t let go.

36th over: England 171-5 ( Moeen Ali 33, Livingstone 1) An admirable innings from Stokes, a man out of touch but trying to get there by aura alone. And another wicket for the tournament’s leading wicket-taker, Adam Zampa.

WICKET! Stokes c Stoinus b Zampa 64 (England 170-5)

Stokes throws his hands to the ground in despair after getting down low and sweeping -straight to short fine leg. He marches off, dumps his bat, throws off his gloves and his helmet, shakes his head and his long red beard. From the dugout, the other England players and support staff watch, clapping nervously.

35th over: England 169-4 ( Stokes 64, Moeen Ali 32) Stokes swings at Hazlewood but can only pick up a single, the force isn’t yet with him. But Moeen Ali has found his mojo, and as dusk starts to fall here in Manchester, he drives effortlessly through the covers for four

34th over: England 162-4 ( Stokes 63, Moeen Ali 27) Labuschagne is Stoinus’s chief ball drier. Stoinus starts with a yorker, and another, the next is tickled for four by Moeen. He and Stoke punch gloves. The next ball is short and Moeen pulls him for four more – and that’s the fifty partership off 53 balls. Stoinus is not best pleased with his fielders.

33rd over: England 152-4 ( Stokes 6s, Moeen Ali 18) They pause for drinks and to mop up the dew. Snappy fielding by Stoinis at cover cuts off more from Stokes. Fifty-five thousand people in today and nearly every one sighs in appreciation as Moeen Ali, all high elbow and perfect face, drives Hazledwood straight back down the ground for four.

Fifty for Ben Stokes!

31st over: England 138-4 ( Stokes 51, Moeen Ali 12) Starc, black sleeves under his yellow shirt. Stokes shares a smile with him, as sweat drips from his helmet. And, pow!, suddenly on comes the dazzling spotlight as Stokes pulls for six. He barely acknowledges it, a brief nod of the bat.


Peter Rowntree strokes his beard. “The side has got old. YJB hasn’t yet got back to the player he was before his accident. The inclusion of players such as Brook, Duckett and James Rew would certainly help to bring the average age of the side down. “

30th over: England 128-4 ( Stokes 46, Moeen Ali 11) Through a clouded window, a figure leans his head on his hands. It is Jos Buttler. Just three singles off the tricky-to-hit Head. The rate raises to eight an over.
