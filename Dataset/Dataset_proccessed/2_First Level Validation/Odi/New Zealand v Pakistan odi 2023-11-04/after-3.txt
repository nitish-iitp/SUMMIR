Live New Zealand vs Pakistan Score Updates: Pakistan defeated New Zealand by 21 runs via DLS method in a rain-hit game to keep their semifinal hopes alive.Fakhar Zaman played an unbeaten knock of 126 and was well-assisted by Babar Azam during their run chase, which was impacted by intermitted rain.

New Zealand vs Pakistan Score: Fakhar Zaman and captain Babar Azam starred as Pakistan pulled off a dramatic, rain-hit 21-run victory over New Zealand to stay alive at the Cricket World Cup. Pakistan now have eight points from as many games with their last match against England in Kolkata on November 11.

Pakistan opener Fakhar Zaman made history on Saturday by smashing the fastest century for his country in World Cup history.

Rain interrupted Pakistan's charge in their crucial World Cup match against New Zealand with the team 10 runs ahead on Duckworth Lewis (DLS) par score. Pakistan were placed comfortably at 160 for one in their chase of 402 runs for victory when rain stopped play with 21.3 overs bowled. Pakistan were set a revised target of 342 off 41 overs to beat New Zealand and keep their World Cup hopes alive on Saturday.

Pakistan's decision to bowl first backfired as Rachin Ravindra (108 off 94) scored his third century of the ongoing World Cup and together with skipper Kane Williamson (95 off 79) shared 180 runs for the second wicket to set the platform for New Zealand's total.

Pakistan will need to chase the target in 35.2 overs to beat the Kiwis on net run rate (NRR) and keep their hopes alive in the tournament.

Glenn Phillips (41 off 25), Mark Chapman (39 off 27) and Daryl Mitchell (29 off 18) scored brisk runs towards the end to help New Zealand's cause.

Mohammad Wasim (3/60) was the pick of the Pakistani bowlers, while Iftikhar Ahmed (1/55), Hasan Ali (1/82) and Haris Rauf (1/85) picked up a wicket each. New Zealand began the ICC World Cup 2023 with a dominating victory over reigning champions England, but have since suffered a three-game losing streak. South Africa defeated them by 190 runs in their most recent match.

Pakistan, on the other hand, ended a four-game losing streak by defeating Bangladesh. With the game approaching a critical stage, they must win to keep their semi-final hopes alive.

Pakistan Final XI

Fakhar Zaman, Abdullah Shafique, Babar Azam (C), Mohammad Rizwan (WK), Saud Shakeel, Iftikhar Ahmed, Salman Ali Agha, Hasan Ali, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Muhammad Wasim Jr, Haris Rauf

New Zealand Final XI

Devon Conway, Rachin Ravindra, Kane Williamson (C), Daryl Mitchell, Tom Latham (WK), Glenn Phillips, Mark Chapman, Mitchell Santner, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee and Trent Boult.

New Zealand vs Pakistan Highlights:

Kane Williamson joined the action after a 68-run opening stand between Ravindra and Devon Conway, and the right-hand, left-hand combination gave a torrid time to Pakistan.

Ravindra brought up a popular hundred with a single off pacer Mohammad Wasim, as a good weekend crowd loudly chanted ‘Raachin Raachin.’

However, the double barrel firing came to an end when Williamson fell well within sight of his 14th ODI hundred, an attempt to clear the fence off Ahmed ended in a finely judged catch by Fakhar Zaman at long-on.

Ravindra too did not last long as his pull-off Wasim was snaffled at square leg by Saud Shakeel.

Pakistan might have thought of making a late comeback as they did against Australia a few days ago , but Mark Chapman and Daryl Mitchell gave further impetus to Kiwis innings making 57 runs off 32 balls for the fourth wicket.

Glenn Phillips (41 off 26 balls) too chipped in with some typical beefy blows as the Black Caps innings switched on the afterburners.

In total, New Zealand made 114 runs in the last 10 overs to give Pakistan a steep mountain to scale down.

Fakhar Zaman and skipper Babar Azam (66) added 194 for the unbroken second wicket stand.

Fakhar Zaman took the attack to the New Zealand bowlers, smashing four sixes and as many boundaries in his 39-ball fifty.
