PREVIEW
Afghanistan take on Netherlands in high-stakes clash

Both teams are still in the race for the semi-finals, but there is also a Champions Trophy place at stake

Hayden: 'Would like to see Rashid Khan bowl early against Netherlands'

Big picture: Semi-finals and Champions Trophy to play for

England - check, Pakistan - check, Sri Lanka - check, Netherlands - next?

Coming into this tournament, Afghanistan had just one win - in 2015 - to show for their previous two World Cup campaigns. Now, they have beaten three previous World Cup winners in this edition alone, and are gunning for two crucial points against Netherlands to turn up the heat in the race for the semi-finals.

Lucknow was Afghanistan's adopted home turf back in 2019, when they faced West Indies in one Test, three T20Is and three ODIs. While they did not have much success in the ODIs back then, the familiarity with the venue could give them an edge in this contest.

Afghanistan have solved some serious problems during their campaign. They were overly reliant on their top order for runs but the middle order has come to life with Hashmatullah Shahidi and Azmatullah Omarzai finding form. Fast bowler Fazalhaq Farooqi is coming off a four-wicket haul against Sri Lanka, having shown there's more to Afghanistan's attack than just spin.

And they have been clinical - not mercurial - in their victories. After dismantling England comfortably during their defence in Delhi, they chased down targets against Pakistan and Sri Lanka with a calmness that showed they belonged at the World Cup. Another victory will take Afghanistan to eight points, level with Australia and New Zealand who are in third and fourth place.

Afghanistan, however, are up against a team that also has much to play for. Netherlands are still in the running for the semi-finals, though their chances are slim, but they have a real shot at qualifying for the 2025 Champions Trophy. To do that, they need to finish in the top eight at this World Cup, and taking two points off Afghanistan will open a four-point lead over the two teams currently below them (Bangladesh and England).

Having taken down South Africa earlier in the tournament, Netherlands come into Friday's fixture fresh off a win against Bangladesh. Their bowling - apart from the thumping against Australia - has been consistent but their batting has lacked firepower. Netherlands have scored 250-plus just once in this high-scoring tournament and have needed their middle and lower order to come to their rescue several times.

At a venue where run-scoring hasn't been as easy, Netherlands will need to find a way to succeed against an Afghanistan attack that is much more than the exceptional Rashid Khan.

Form guide

Afghanistan: LWLWW (last five ODIs, most recent first)
Netherlands: LWLLW

In the spotlight: Azmatullah Omarzai and Aryan Dutt

Azmatullah Omarzai had a mere 35 runs in four ODI innings at 11.66 at the end of 2022. The allrounder has turned a corner in 2023: 305 runs in 12 ODIs with three fifties and an average of 43.57. He is currently Afghanistan's fifth highest run-scorer in the tournament with 203 runs at 50.75. He has also chipped in with his medium pace, taking five wickets at 39.80. Omarzai's variations in the middle overs could be key.

Offspinner Aryan Dutt has bowled the first over for Netherlands in every game so far this tournament and has been economical in the powerplay. He has sent down 23 overs in the powerplay, taking three wickets and conceding just 4.56 per over. No other bowler has bowled more maidens than Dutt's seven and he will be coming into the game high on confidence after taking 1 for 26 in ten overs against Bangladesh.

Team news

Ikram Alikhil hurt his finger against Sri Lanka but Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott confirmed the wicketkeeper-batter was available for selection. If Lucknow is likely to aid spin, Afghanistan could look to bring in Noor Ahmad for Naveen-ul-Haq. They played four spinners against Pakistan in Chennai and Noor took 3 for 49 in that match.

Afghanistan (possible): 1 Rahmanullah Gurbaz, 2 Ibrahim Zadran, 3 Rahmat Shah, 4 Hashmatullah Shahidi (capt), 5 Azmatullah Omarzai, 6 Ikram Alikhil (wk), 7 Mohammad Nabi, 8 Rashid Khan, 9 Mujeeb Ur Rahman, 10 Naveen-ul-Haq/Noor Ahmad, 11 Fazalhaq Farooqi

Netherlands are unlikely to make changes to the XI that beat Bangladesh.

Netherlands (possible): 1 Max O'Dowd, 2 Vikramjit Singh, 3 Wesley Barresi, 4 Colin Ackermann, 5 Scott Edwards (capt & wk), 6 Bas de Leede, 7 Sybrand Engelbrecht, 8 Logan van Beek, 9 Shariz Ahmad, 10 Aryan Dutt, 11 Paul van Meekeren

Pitch and conditions: Another slow burner?

The pitch for the game is a mixture of black and red soil and could help the spinners. Before the square was re-laid earlier this year, the Ekana Stadium wasn't known for high scores. Only once in 16 ODI innings has a team scored 300-plus here - by South Africa earlier in the competition.

Stats and trivia: Mujeeb on the cusp of a hundred

Mujeeb Ur Rahman is one away from 100 ODI wickets. If he gets there on Friday, he will be the fourth Afghanistan bowler to reach the landmark.
Vikramjit Singh is 12 short of 1000 runs in ODIs.
Rahmat Shah needs 95 to become the fourth Afghanistan batter to reach 4000 runs in international cricket.
Scott Edwards has played three ODIs against Afghanistan and scored a fifty each time.

Quotes

"We are here at a World Cup, we're not playing the Champions Trophy. The focus is the semi-final for us. We're not interested in what's happening in two years' time. We've got a game to win tomorrow."
Colin Ackermann says Netherlands have unfinished business in India

"We're not going to make the semis by just talking about it. We have to play good cricket. How well we start tomorrow is going to be crucial and how well we finish."
