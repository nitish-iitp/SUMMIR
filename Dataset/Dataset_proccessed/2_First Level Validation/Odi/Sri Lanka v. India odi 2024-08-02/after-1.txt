India vs Sri Lanka 1st ODI Match Live Score and Updates: The first ODI in the 3-match series ended in a tie as India could only manage to equal Sri Lanka’ first innings score of 230 as Charith Asalanka bowled a delightful spell where he snapped up Shivam Dube and Arshdeep Singh in back to back deliveries with India needing just 1 from 14 balls.

Dunith Wellalage’s rearguard 67 helped Sri Lanka post 230/8 against India at the R Premadasa Stadium on Friday. For India, Axar Patel and Arshdeep Singh took 2 wickets each while Pathum Nissanka was the second-highest scorer for Sri Lanka with 56.

Earlier, Sri Lanka captain Charith Asalanka had won the flip of the coin and opted before India’s bowlers rattled the top-order despite opener Pathum Nissanka’s fifty. The Lankans were reduced to 101/5 before the 21-year-old Wellalage racked up his best ODI score to help Sri Lanka post a fighting total.

Sri Lanka XI: Pathum Nissanka, Avishka Fernando, Kusal Mendis(w), Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka(c), Janith Liyanage, Wanindu Hasaranga, Dunith Wellalage, Akila Dananjaya, Asitha Fernando, Mohamed Shiraz India XI: Rohit Sharma(c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul(w), Shivam Dube, Washington Sundar, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammed Siraj

IND vs SL Live Score, 1st ODI: Rohit Sharma speaks

The score was gettable, you had to bat well to get there. We batted well in patches. No consistent momentum. We had the upper hand, we lost a couple of wicket. With the KL-Axar partnership, we came back. Little disappointing at the end. These things happened. Sri Lanka played well. In the end, it was a fair result. It (pitch) remained the same. It's not where you can come and play your shots. You have to dig in. The game shifted towards both teams at different times. We should have got that one run.

Rohit-Gambhir’s headache

India's head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma attend a practice session on the eve of the first one-day international (ODI) cricket match between India and Sri Lanka, at the R Premadasa International Cricket Stadium, in Colombo, Thursday, Aug. 1, 2024. (PTI Photo)
