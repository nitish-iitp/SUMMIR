Australia finished the group stage in third place with 7 wins in 9 matches. They were level on points with South Africa, but the Proteas finished in second by virtue of their superior net run rate. In their last group stage match, Australia rode on Mitchell Marsh's massive century (177*) to chase down 307 against Bangladesh in Pune.

Here's all the match details for this Cricket World Cup 2023 clash, including TV information around the world, start time, betting odds and historical meetings in ODIs between the two nations.

Australia vs South Africa predictions, latest betting odds

South Africa's chasing woes in this World Cup have been well-documented. They failed against Netherlands, almost made a hash of an easy chase against Pakistan but imporved slightly against Afghanistan.

The pitch at Eden Gardens is not always easy to bat on, so 270-280 is likely to be a challenging score here. If South Africa can bat first and score 10-20 runs above par, they will be firmly in the driver's seat. However, any scenario that sees Australia bat first will tip the scales in their favour.
