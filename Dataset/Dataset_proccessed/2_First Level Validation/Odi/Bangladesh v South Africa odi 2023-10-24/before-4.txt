The Bangla Tigers have had an up and down tournament so far. After putting on a clinical show against Afghanistan in their first game, they suffered three losses at the hands of England, New Zealand and India. Things are unlikely to get any easier against an intimidating South African side.

South Africa began their campaign by racking up a World Cup-record 428/5 against Sri Lanka to secure a 102-run victory, before beating Australia by 134 runs. Despite suffering a shock loss to Netherlands, the Proteas bounced back strongly, to beat England by 229 runs at this same venue on Saturday.
