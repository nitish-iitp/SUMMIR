We are just a few hours away from the commencement of the much-anticipated West Indies vs England ODI series. This three-match rubber will begin at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua on October 31 (11:30 pm IST).

England will see this series as a much-needed preparation for next year's ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan. They are currently on a bad streak, having lost a five-match ODI series to arch-rivals Australia followed by a 2-1 Test series loss to Pakistan. Similarly, the West Indies also had a forgettable white-ball tour to Sri Lanka, where they lost both the T20I and ODI series.

Ahead of the first West Indies vs England ODI, here are some important numbers you need to know from previous one-day internationals played at the venue in Antigua.

Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua Pitch Report

England, coincidentally, have a great record at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, having won five of the seven games played. They even smashed a whopping 325 runs at the venue in their last ODI bilateral series before the hosts chased it down on the back of Shai Hope's hundred.

The Antigua pitch will have a good pace and bounce initially, which might help the team batting first. As the match progresses, expect the spinners to come into the game more, with the average second-inning score here being less.

Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua Last ODI

The last time ODI cricket was played at this venue was also during a three-match series between the West Indies and England. It was in December last year that England kept the series alive with a win by six wickets.

It was the second ODI, where the West Indies batted first but had a disastrous start. They were 23/4, with Sam Curran (3/33) wreaking havoc. While Shai Hope and Sherfane Rutherford made fifties, England spinners kept WI at bay and restricted them to just 202/10 in less than 40 overs.

England's chase began superbly, with Will Jacks hammering a 72-ball 73. Then, an unbeaten 58 by Jos Buttler sealed the deal for the visitors.
