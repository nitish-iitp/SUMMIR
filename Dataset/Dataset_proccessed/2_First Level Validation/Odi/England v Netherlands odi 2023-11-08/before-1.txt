With just one win in their first seven games, England's World Cup defense was in tatters as they played Australia in Ahmedabad on Saturday. They put their opponents in to bat, and Australia registered 286, thanks in large part to Marnus Labuschagne's 71.

In reply, Dawid Malan (50) and Ben Stokes (64) both scored half-centuries, and Moeen Ali 42 but without enough support from the other batters, England slipped to a loss by 33 runs, their sixth of the tournament. 

Netherlands suffered a disappointing loss to Afghanistan in their latest match, but with a couple of solid wins over South Africa and Bangladesh in the tournament, will be looking to win a third match and cement qualification for the 2025 Champions Trophy.

Here's all the match details for this Cricket World Cup 2023 clash, including TV information around the world, start time, betting odds and historical meetings in ODIs between the two nations.

England vs Netherlands predictions, latest betting odds

Netherlands have been one of the most tactically astute teams in the tournament, even if they haven't quite put together all facets of their game yet. England have performed well below expectations but will probably still start as favourites.

There has been enough evidence throughout this World Cup to suggest a Netherlands win could very much be on the cards, and they will definitely run England close but the 2019 world champions should still emerge victorious.
