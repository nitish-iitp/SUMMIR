AUS vs NED Dream11 Prediction: Top Captaincy Picks

David Warner: David Warner is the most popular captaincy choice for this game. Warner has been in terrific form and can wreak havoc against the Netherlands. The pitch will also suit him.

Mitchell Starc: Mitchell Starc will enjoy bowling to the Netherlands’ batters. Starc has a fabulous World Cup record, and he can dismiss a few out-of-form batters with his accuracy in the game.

Bas de Leede: Bas de Leede will contribute with both bat and ball. Bas is among the best batters in the team, and he also picks wickets consistently. Expect him to make an impact again.

AUS vs NED Dream11 Prediction: Top Differential Picks

Marcus Stoinis: Marcus Stoinis has surprisingly been picked up by less than 42% of users as of now, making him a good differential pick. Stoinis has improved massively as a bowler and can dismiss a few batters. He will also contribute with useful runs in the lower order.

Paul van Meekeren: Paul van Meekeren has been selected by less than 21% of people as of now. Paul has bowled really well throughout this World Cup and can again trouble the Aussie batters. Expect him to pick a few wickets in this game.

AUS vs NED Dream11 Prediction: Players to Avoid

Vikramjit Singh: Vikramjit Singh hasn’t done anything significant of late and can be avoided for this game.

AUS vs NED Dream11 Prediction: Mega League Base Team

If AUS bat first:

Complete the team with three among Josh Inglis, Steven Smith, Teja Nidamunuru and Josh Hazlewood.

If NED bat first:

Complete the team with three among Scott Edwards, Travis Head, Marcus Stoinis and Paul van Meekeren.

AUS vs NED Dream11 Prediction: Small League Base Team

If AUS bat first:

Complete the team with Josh Inglis, Glenn Maxwell and Logan van Beek.

If NED bat first:

Complete the team with Travis Head, Marcus Stoinis and Paul van Meekeren.
