ICC Cricket World Cup 2023: New Zealand vs Afghanistan, Match 16 – Fantasy Tips, Predicted XI, Head To Head Record, Pitch Report
By Pavan Suresh - October 17, 20230
New Zealand

New Zealand will face a tricky Afghanistan side to be played at Chennai on 18th October 2023. Kiwis have been dealt a huge blow as Kane Williamson will not take part due to a thumb injury. They will look to continue their winning form as registered all three matches.

On the other hand, Afghanistan will be high on confidence as they stunned the defending Champions England by 69 runs at Arun Jaitley Stadium, New Delhi. They will be looking to replicate their form against the Kiwi side that is on a roll.

Match Details

Details– New Zealand vs Afghanistan, Match 16, ICC Cricket World Cup

Venue– MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai

Date and Time– 18th October, 2.00 PM IST

Head-To-Head Record

New Zealand and Afghanistan played a total of 2 ODI matches with New Zealand both matches. These two encounters took place in World Cups including 2015 and 2019. New Zealand registered comfortable victories over Afghanistan.

New Zealand won the match by 7 wickets in the 2019 edition while won by 6 wickets in the 2015 edition played in New Zealand and Australia.

Pitch Report

The pitch used for New Zealand and Bangladesh had some pace and bounce. New Zealand pacers made use of the conditions putting enough pressure on the batters.

It promises to be an exciting battle between these two teams. New Zealand would be high on confidence after their dominating win over Bangladesh at the same venue while Afghanistan needs to adapt to the conditions that would be on offer in Chennai.

The captain that wins the toss would likely field first, restricting the opponent and then chasing down the target.
