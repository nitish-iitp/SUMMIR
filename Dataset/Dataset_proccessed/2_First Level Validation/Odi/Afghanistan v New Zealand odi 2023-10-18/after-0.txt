NZ vs AFG: New Zealand win by 149 runs against Afghanistan

NZ vs AFG Score Updates:New Zealand made it four wins from four at the Cricket World Cup on Wednesday with a 149-run thrashing of Afghanistan who came crashing back down after their shock win over defending champions England
NZ vs AFG LIVE Score Updates: New Zealand's Trent Boult celebrates with teammates after taking the wicket of Afghanistan's Ibrahim Zadran during the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 match between New Zealand and Afghanistan, at M. A. Chidambaram Stadium, in Chennai (PTI)

NZ vs AFG LIVE Score Updates: A determined New Zealand brushed aside Afghanistan by 149 runs to record their fourth consecutive win at the World Cup here on Wednesday.

Riding on fifties by Will Young (54), Tom Latham (68) and Glenn Phillips (71), Kiwis made 288 for 6 and then bowled out Afghanistan for 139 in just 34.4 overs.

Afghanistan, who had defeated champions England, could not repeat the heroics against an organised New Zealand and only Rahmat Shah (36) offered a semblance of fight.

Pacer Lockie Ferguson and left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner took three wickets each.

Azmatullah Omarzai and Rashid Khan clinched back-to-back wickets to derail New Zealand batting. Rachin Ravindra, Will Young and Daryl Mitchell walked back to pavilion and currently New Zealand skipper Tom Latham and Glenn Phillips are on the crease trying to stabilise the innings. 

New Zealand openers Devon Conway and Will Young began on a cautious note, but target Afghanistan spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman. But, soon Mujeeb Ur Rahman bounced back and departed Devon Conway to give first jolt to New Zealand. 

As the cricket world turns its gaze toward the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, an electrifying encounter is on the cards. New Zealand, an unbeaten team in the tournament so far, are preparing to lock horns with Afghanistan, fresh from their sensational victory against England. With India leading the points table, New Zealand trail in second place, bolstered by three wins and a strong net run rate. Afghanistan, having sprung one of the tournament's biggest surprises, occupy the sixth spot.

Unveiling a twist to the MA Chidambaram Stadium's typical narrative, recent matches have favoured teams batting second. Despite a historical edge for teams opting to bat first—claiming victory in 14 out of 25 games—the tide has turned. Both recent World Cup games hosted at this venue saw teams chasing targets of 200 and 246, turning the tables on the established paradigm.

It's worth noting that the venue has been a playing field that rewards the tactically adept, particularly those skilled against spin bowling. The pitch can be a double-edged sword: While established batsmen can score heavily, the surface's slow pace can fox power hitters.

New Zealand's invincibility this season isn't their only claim to fame in this match-up. The Kiwis have a historical upper hand, defeating Afghanistan in both previous ODIs during past World Cups. However, Afghanistan's form this year could make for a very different contest. Under Hashmatullah Shahidi's leadership, the team now boasts stars like Rashid Khan, Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Mujeeb Ur Rahman.

While New Zealand continue to ride a wave of success with three matches and as many wins, Afghanistan are lifted by a morale-boosting victory against England—the defending world champions no less. The Afghans outclassed England by 69 runs, shaking the points table and the World Cup narrative at large.

This clash isn't just a fixture; it's a litmus test for both squads. New Zealand aim to continue its winning spree, holding onto the coveted second spot on the table. Afghanistan, on the other hand, want to maintain its newfound momentum, striving to climb further up the ladder.

New Zealand Final XI

Devon Conway, Will Young, Rachin Ravindra, Tom Latham (capt, wk), Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Mark Chapman, Mitchell Santner, Mark Henry, Lockie Ferguson and Trent Boult.

Afghanistan Final XI

Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Ibrahim Zadran, Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi (C), Azmatullah Omarzai, Ikram Alikhil, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Naveen-ul-Haq and Fazalhaq Farooqi.

NZ vs AFG Live: Will Young on New Zealand's first innings

NZ vs AFG Live: “They managed to take some wickets in the middle but credit to the guys, we finished well. Just the way they soaked up the pressure, they both felt they could go and I think we got 80 runs off the last 6 overs or so, they timed it brilliantly. I would’ve been stoked if I could take it deep but it wasn’t to be today. it doesn’t feel good to be left out but our bench strength is good. You go again and try to win it for your side," said Will Young on first innings on New Zealand. 

18 Oct 2023, 05:56:08 PM IST
NZ vs AFG Live: FOUR of the final ball, New Zealand at 288/6 in 50 overs

NZ vs AFG Live: Azmatullah Omarzai started the 49th over with a high fulltoss ball which went for the FOUR and umpire raised his hand to indicate NO BALL. It was a FREE HIT for Mark Chapman, but Azmatullah Omarzai made a good comeback and didn't let Mark Chapman score big on free hit. 

Another FOUR by Mitchell Santner against Azmatullah Omarzai and this batter is showing the skills of a finisher. New Zealand needs more such big shots to finish with a good score. 

18 Oct 2023, 05:41:46 PM IST
NZ vs AFG Live: Wicket!!! Another one for Naveen-ul-Haq

NZ vs AFG Live: Naveen-ul-Haq striked again in the same over as he dismissed skipper Tom Latham and now both the batters on crease are new. Mitchell Santner and Mark Chapman have a clear cut role, but can they smash those big wickets without loosing their wickets against strong Afghanistan bowling. 

The two wickets at this stage is a setback for New Zealand as the two batters would have taken the score ahead and now it's not clear how well the new batters will finish the innings for New Zealand. 

18 Oct 2023, 05:39:19 PM IST
NZ vs AFG Live: Wicket!!! Glenn Phillips OUT

NZ vs AFG Live: Naveen-ul-Haq finally dismissed Glenn Phillips, who is walking back to the pavilion with pride as he has done his job well. This wicket is may be too late for Afghanistan as the new batter Mark Chapman is on crease and he has a clear role to smash big shots and take the final score as high as possible.

NZ vs AFG Live: Tom Latham smashes 50 

NZ vs AFG Live: New Zealand skipper Tom Latham played a true captain innings today as he smashed his half-century and with just 2 FOURs. It tells that the skipper understood his role well and allowed Glenn Phillips to play his attacking game and take the score to good height. 

New Zealand is moving to a big score now and in case the new batters stay on the crease till the final ball, the team may even cross the score of 300 runs. 

18 Oct 2023, 05:23:33 PM IST
NZ vs AFG Live: Glenn Phillips goes big 

NZ vs AFG Live: Back-to-back two SIXES against Afghanistan pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi and the batter and the bowler is delivering on the wrong line as the batter in set on the crease. This is big over for New Zealand and this will push Afghanistan bowling lineup. New Zealand skipper Tom Latham is close to his half-century. 

18 Oct 2023, 05:19:33 PM IST
NZ vs AFG Live: New Zealand score 210/4 in 44 overs

NZ vs AFG Live: New Zealand is slowly coming back to the game as they defended their wickets and skipper Tom Latham and Glenn Phillips are playing in a 100+ runs partnership now. Afghanistan bowlers have dropped 4 catches today, but need to forget that and focus back on the game as New Zealand batters will change gears now and they need to be stopped, if Afghanistan wants any chance in the game. 

18 Oct 2023, 05:14:39 PM IST
NZ vs AFG Live: Poor display from Afghanistan fielding 

NZ vs AFG Live: One more catch dropped and again it is Rashid Khan who is bowling and the spinner is fuming now. New Zealand batter Glenn Phillips smashed his half-century and played a big role today to stabilise New Zealand's vulnerable innings and partnered well with his skipper Tom Latham to take the score forward. 

18 Oct 2023, 05:11:25 PM IST
NZ vs AFG Live: New Zealand score 199/4 in 42 overs

NZ vs AFG Live: Glenn Phillips is playing extremely well today and just smashed a massive SIX against spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman. The batter is close to his 50 and has played a crucial role in New Zealand's comeback in the game after loosing multiple wickets in quick succession. Now, as the innings move towards final few overs, the batters will change gears to push the final score higher. 

18 Oct 2023, 05:07:47 PM IST
NZ vs AFG Live: Afghanistan drops another catch 

NZ vs AFG Live: This is third catch drop from Afghanistan in today's match and one stumping chance was also missed by the wicketkeeper. Mujeeb Ur Rahman couldn't judge the simple catch and Rashid Khan is clearly unhappy with the fielding effort today. Loosing such chances against a strong team like New Zealand is nothing less than suicide and imagine if all three catches were caught, New Zealand would have been much behind in the game.

NZ vs AFG Live: New Zealand score 181/4 in 39 overs

NZ vs AFG Live: Good over from spinner Rashid Khan as he looks to give more room to New Zealand batters, allowing them to take more risks. The partnership between Tom Latham and Glenn Phillips has crossed 71 runs now and Afghanistan must take some wickets before the beginning of the final 5 6 overs as if the current batting duo stand till then, they can become very dangerous and take the final score to some good heights.  

18 Oct 2023, 04:55:42 PM IST
NZ vs AFG Live: New Zealand score 177/4 in 38 overs

NZ vs AFG Live: Afghanistan bowlers still maintain the tight grip on the bowling and not allowing New Zealand batters to try big shots. The run rate is 4.66 runs per over which is below average for a good team like New Zealand. 

Tom Latham and Glenn Phillips are slowly taking the innings forward and will look to finish around 280-290 runs, but need to take more risks it order to ensure that score at this pitch. 

18 Oct 2023, 04:48:43 PM IST
NZ vs AFG Live: NOT OUT, close call for Glenn Phillips 

NZ vs AFG Live: New Zealand batter Glenn Phillips had a close save against Rashid Khan who made a big LBW appeal. As the umpire didn't look intrested, Hashmatullah Shahidi decided to take DRS.

NZ vs AFG Live: New Zealand score 167/4 in 36 overs

NZ vs AFG Live: Good over from Fazalhaq Farooqi and Afghanistan bowlers are successful so far to keep Tom Latham and Glenn Phillips under pressure. The New Zealand batters are playing cautiously and Afghanistan bowlers are also increasing the pressure to clinch more wickets. 

If the batters stay on the crease till last 5 6 overs, then they can change the game for New Zealand and smash some big shots to take the score forward.
