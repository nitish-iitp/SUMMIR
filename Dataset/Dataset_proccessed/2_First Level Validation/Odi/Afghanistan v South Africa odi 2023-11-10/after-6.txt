Calmness of Rassie van der Dussen and the fire of Gerald Coetzee helped experienced South Africa overcome a spirited resistance from Afghanistan to carve out a five-wicket win in their last league game of the World Cup. Set a target of 245, South Africa, who are already assured of a place in semifinals, completed the task with Van der Dussen remaining unbeaten on 76 off 95 balls. Andile Phehlukwayo was unbeaten on a 37-ball 39 after a match-winning partnership of 65 runs with Van der Dussen.

NEW DELHI: Rassie van der Dussen struck a calm unbeaten half-century after pacer Gerald Coetzee grabbed a four-for as South Africa registered a comfortable five-wicket win over Afghanistan in their last World Cup group game on Friday in Ahmedabad.
Set a target of 245, South Africa, who are already assured of a place in semifinals, completed the task with Van der Dussen remaining unbeaten on 76 off 95 balls.
Andile Phehlukwayo too hit an unbeaten on a 37-ball 39 after a match-winning partnership of 65 runs with Van der Dussen.
Earlier, pacer Coetzee took 4 for 44 as Afghanistan were limited to 244 despite Azmatullah Omarzai's impressive 97. Omarzai's knock, however, helped the Afghans to recover from 116 for six.

With the win, the Proteas tuned-up for their semi-final against Australia next week.
New Zealand also look all set to meet hosts India in the other semi-final unless Pakistan pull off a huge win against England on Saturday.
Playing for pride, Afghanistan's spinners checked South Africa's strong start of 64-0 after Mujeeb Ur Rahman dismissed skipper Temba Bavuma for 23 and fellow spinner Mohammad Nabi trapped Quinton de Kock lbw on 41.



Bavuma's hamstring troubled him throughout the match while fielding and batting in a worrying sign ahead of their semi-final.
De Kock, who will quit one-day internationals when this World Cup is over, overtook New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra (565) to reclaim his top spot in the tournament batting chart with 591 runs including four centuries.
The Proteas put their chase back on track in a third-wicket stand of 50 but leg-spinner Rashid Khan broke through with the wicket of Aiden Markram for 25.
South Africa looked in trouble when Rashid bowled Heinrich Klaasen for 10 but Van der Dussen stood firm to build partnerships including an unbeaten 65-run stand with Andile Phehlukwayo, who hit the winning six in an unbeaten 39.

Earlier Afghanistan slipped to 116-6 before Azmatullah hit his ODI best to lift the team to a competitive total.
South Africa fast bowler Gerald Coetzee took four wickets while spinner Keshav Maharaj returned impressive figures of 2-25.
De Kock played a key part with his six wicketkeeping dismissals to equal a World Cup record of Australia's Adam Gilchrist (v Namibia - Potchefstroom, 2003) and Pakistan's Sarfaraz Ahmed (v South Africa - Auckland, 2015).


Openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran started aggressively before Maharaj struck with his first ball to have Gurbaz caught for 25.
Coetzee sent back Ibrahim in the next over to check the batting surge and Afghanistan slipped from 41-0 to 45-3 when Maharaj had skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi caught behind for two.

Afghanistan lost three more wickets to be in danger of getting bowled out in less than their quota of 50 overs but Azmatullah stood firm to play out the innings.
Afghanistan, led by Hashmatullah Shahidi, ended a strong campaign after they beat defending champions England, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Netherlands.
