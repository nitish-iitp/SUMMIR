South Africa saw off a spirited fightback from Afghanistan to win by five wickets in their final World Cup group game and consolidate second place in the standings.

The Proteas have 14 points from their nine games, two points ahead of Australia who play Bangladesh on Saturday. South Africa and Australia are now both sure to advance and will face each other in a semi-final on Thursday.

Afghanistan wrapped up their best ever World Cup campaign having won four games and also sealed a place in the 2025 Champions Trophy. “We gave a good message to the world, we played big teams and fought till the end,” said their captain, Hashmatullah Shahidi.

“I’m proud of what our batsmen did in this tournament,” Shahidi added. “Everyone knows we have a good spin department, but if we carry the momentum of what we did with the bat, we will be a very good side.”

Shahidi opted to bat first in Ahmedabad and his side posted 244 all out in 50 overs on the back of Azmatullah Omarzai’s unbeaten 97, which included seven boundaries and three sixes, while Gerald Coetzee was the pick of the South African bowlers with figures of 4 for 44.

In response, Quinton de Kock set up the chase with a breezy 41 that took him to the top of the World Cup scoring charts on 591 runs. Rassie van der Dussen (76 not out) then guided the Proteas home, stitching together a 65-run partnership with Andile Phehlukwayo, who hit the winning runs with a massive six over deep midwicket in the 48th over.

“They say winning is a habit so we want to take that momentum through, we take a lot of confidence,” the South Africa captain, Temba Bavuma, said. “We did something differently today, we normally bat first but we batted second. To get over the line in that manner will give us confidence.

“We’d like to be playing here again [in the final], in front of a full capacity crowd. But there’s a hurdle we have to get over first, against Australia in Kolkata.”
