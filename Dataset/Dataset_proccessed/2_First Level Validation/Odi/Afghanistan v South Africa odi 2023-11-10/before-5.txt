Analysis

The South African team has quickly moved away from the dark-horse tag to emerge as one of the favourites in this World Cup. The Proteas’ batting has been their biggest strength with a top-order which has been firing all cylinders. Similarly, their bowling, led by Marco Jansen, performed well and troubled several top-quality batters in the tournament. But still, chasing has been a big weakness for the Proteas.

On the other hand, Afghanistan has been the surprise team of this World Cup as they have defeated three previous World Cup champions. The Afghan batting has made massive strides throughout the tournament with three solid chases on tricky surfaces. Whereas bowling has continued to be Afghanistan’s biggest strength with the likes of Rashid Khan, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Noor Ahmad and Naveen-ul-Haq in good form.
