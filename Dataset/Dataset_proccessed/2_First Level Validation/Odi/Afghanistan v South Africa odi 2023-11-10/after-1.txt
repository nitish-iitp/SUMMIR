South Africa vs Afghanistan Live Score Updates: An unbeaten half-century from Rassie van der Dussen and a 64-run partnership for the opening wicket between Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma helped South Africa defeat Afghanistan by five wickets in their last league match of the World Cup

South Africa vs Afghanistan Live Score Updates: SA vs AFG,South Africa beat Afghanistan by five wickets to win their last World Cup group game on Friday as the Asian side were eliminated from the semi-final race.

Chasing 245 for victory in Ahmedabad, South Africa saw Rassie van der Dussen make an unbeaten 76 as the Proteas reached their target with 15 balls to spare in a tune-up for their semi-final against Australia next week.

The Proteas, who have already qualified for the semifinals, completed the task in 47.3 overs. They now have 14 points and continue to occupy the second spot behind India, who are on 16 points.

Azmatullah Omarzai hit an unbeaten 97 to guide Afghanistan to 244 all out in a match where they needed an unlikely 438-run win to make the last four.

 Afghanistan scored 244 runs after 50 overs as Azmatullah Omarzai played a wonderful innings of 97 runs. The batter missed his century by just 3 runs, but surely created an impact for his team. South African pacer Gerald Coetzee clinched 4 wickets to keep Afghanistan batters restricted. 

Aghanistan batter Azamatullah Omarzai slammed his 50, even as the team continues to loose wicket and lost 7 wickets on the score of 160. Noor Ahmad and Azmatullah Omarzai are the two batters on crease and Afghanistan is looking to score around 250 runs. 

Afghanistan openers started on a cautious note but lost their wickets within the first 10 overs. South African spinner Keshav Maharaj dismissed Rahmanullah Gurbaz while pacer Gerald Coetzee took out Ibrahim Zadran 

The SA vs AFG match is most likely to have little bearing on the ICC World Cup 2023 hopes. The Proteas are ranked second on the points table after winning six of their last eight games. They will drop to third place and forfeit their second place if they lose today and Australia win their subsequent game. That won't matter, though, because South Africa and Australia will still play against each other in the semi-final in Kolkata.

Up until last night, when New Zealand crushed Sri Lanka by 5 wickets and saw a significant increase in their net run rate (NRR), Afghanistan must have had high expectations for this match. Afghanistan need to defeat the African heavyweights by 438 runs to advance past the Kiwis and face India in the semi-finals. Although theoretically still feasible, it is unlikely to happen.

South Africa vs Afghanistan Live Score Updates: Key Highlights

1. Afghanistan skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi won the toss and chose to bat first

2. Afghanistan openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran began the innings for their team. 

3. Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi began the South African pace attack

4. Keshav Maharaj striked on his first ball as he dismissed Afghanistan opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz

5. Back-to-back wickets for South Africa as Gerlad Coetzee dismissed Ibrahim Zadran

6. Spinner Keshav Maharaj clinched another wicket as he dismissed Afghanistan spinner Hashmatullah Shahidi

7. Lungi Ngidi provided South Africa with another breakthrough as he dismissed Rahmat Shah.

8. A good length from Mujeeb Ur Rahman, outside off. Bavuma rocks back and pulls shakily, and is caught by Gurbaz.

9. A short delivery by Mujeeb, spinning in. Temba Bavuma pulls it, but cannot clear the long square boundaries, and gets caught near deep midwicket.

10. Markram pushes forward and outside edges, and is caught by Naveen-ul-Haq.

11. Good length delivery, pitching outside off stump. Klaasen gets on the back foot but makes no contact while attempting a cut, the ball gets through, and Klaasen is bowled.

12. A legbreak by Rahmat, dragged short. Van der Dussen sweeps him behind square on the on-side, for a four and gets his 14th ODI fifty.

13. Miller rocks back and drives poorly, and is caught by Mohammad Nabi.
