Afghanistan's campaign ends with a loss

But they can hold their heads high as they exit the World Cup. It has been a stellar campaign for them where they beat four excellent teams, but also ran the likes of Australia and South Africa close. A few results going their way and Afghanistan could well have made their way into the final four. The loss against Bangladesh might hurt them the most, but they are surely a force to reckon with going ahead.

South Africa, well they will be happy to have chase down a total, and will hope for a more clinical show against Australia in the semis.

South Africa beat Afghanistan by five wickets

South Africa 247 for 5 (van der Dussen 76*, de Kock 41, Nabi 2-35, Rashid 2-37) beat Afghanistan 244 (Omarzai 97*, Coetzee 4-44, Maharaj 2-25) by five wickets

Rassie van der Dussen is the player of the match for his 95-ball 76 and this innings should give him a load of confidence. He came into the game, not having the best of records in chases in ODIs this year, but has shown his mettle with a composed knock.

It was a 65-run stand between Rassie van der Dussen and Andile Phehlukwayo that shepherded South Africa through to a win in their last league game of the World Cup. There was a brief stutter but the duo ensured they did not give it away. Earkier, the game was set up by Gerald Coetzee (4-44) and Keshav Maharaj (2-25) who ensured Afghanistan could only make 244 in 50 overs. That Afghanistan reached 244 was down to Azmatullah Omarzai's unbeaten 97.

The spin trio of Rashid Khan, Mohammad Nabi and Mujeeb Ur Rahman was excellent but the South Africa batters held their nerves.

Here's what the Player of the Match and the captains had to say.

Rassie van der Dussen, Player of the Match: We were happy with bowling first, we would have chased anyway. They have a quality bowling attack and we wanted to put ourselves in a tough situation. Maybe one or two things we can tweak, but happy with how the run-chase went. In any chase, there has to be someone who plays an anchor role. The openers set things up nicely. We know what our batting line-up can do. Had some good partnerships in the middle and happy to get across the finish line. Sometimes, when you do one thing so well, and the other part is not so good, people say you are doing it badly. We are probably 50-50 when chasing and we would like to improve that, of course. Going into the semi-final, this is what we wanted to do and it worked out well. (On the different surfaces) Kolkata was a lot drier and lower. Having played there, we know what to expect. Hopefully if we get back here, it will presumably play pretty similar.

Hashmatullah Shahidi, the Afghanistan captain: As a captain, I am quite happy with our performances. We fought till the last moment in each and every game. We had good matches and had some good learnings for the future too. (On the batting department) Proud of the way our batters performed in this tournament. We were struggling before the World Cup. So, we sat together and talked about our weaknesses. In the end, you saw how our batters did and it is a positive sign for the future. Everyone knows we have good spinners. If we go with the same momentum that we had in the batting department this World Cup, we will do well. We gave a good message to the world. We played big teams and we fought till the last moment, even if we lost. Even the Australia game was in our hand but it was shocking the way Maxwell batted. I was very shocked, but there were lots of learnings too.

Temba Bavuma, the South Africa captain: The leg is a bit sore, don't know to what extent but it will have to be fine, at least in my stubborn eyes. We had the option of coming off, but I think as much as it was our last group-stage game, probably it didn’t have a big bearing in terms of our playoff, but I still wanted to be out there with the guys, some opportunity to spend time in the middle. So I didn’t want to let that go but also to keep leading the guys, keep marshalling out in the field, keep strengthening those relationships with the bowlers. It was a bit risky, but that’s what I felt was right. Winning is a habit, so, we want to take that momentum through. Today we did a few things different. We batted second today. To get over the line in that manner, that is going to give us a lot of confidence. Fantastic knock by Rassie, he took ownership and the guys batted around him. (On the opposition lower order scoring runs) Not really (a concern). The wicket got better. When Keshav came back for his second spell, it was not gripping and spinning as much. Gerald also came in and took wickets, always a huge plus. We can always pick on the different phases and we can think of things to improve, but we will take the win. (On if they are dreaming of a maiden World Cup triumph) Yeah, definitely. We would want to play here (in Ahmedabad) again, in front of a full capacity crowd, and it will be a different experience playing in front of a hundred thousand fans. Before that, we have Australia. We will enjoy today and from tomorrow, we will start training our minds for that clash.

That's that!

Phehlukwayo might have had his struggles against spin but he was always going to target the quicks. And Naveen is who he goes after. He first clears his front leg to deposit the fast bowler over the long-off in the 46th over and with 14 needed off 18, he slams two sixes and a four to end the chase with ease. On 13 off 28 at one stage, he finishes on 39 off 37 as South Africa chase down the 245-target by five wickets and with 15 balls to spare.

Rassie van der Dussen plays his role to perfection as he finishes 76 not out off 95 balls with his 65 run-stand with Phehlukwayo taking the team home at the end.

The chase gets tricky?

All happening, lots of false shots but no wickets for Afghanistan. Mujeeb Ur Rahman beats Phehlukwayo a number of times in the 41st over, strikes him on the pads, but does not get his man. Nabi also induces a leading edge off Phehlukwayo but the ball drops in the gap around the cover area. Van der Dussen then gets a leading edge off Mujeeb but the ball again does not carry to the bowler. The run rate meanwhile reaches six an over.

Phehlukwayo then tries to play a pull off a Naveen-ul-Haq short of a length ball only to get a top-edge. Hashmatullah Shahidi sprints back from mid-on, dives full-length but is unable to hang on to a tough chance.

While the chase has become slightly tricky, South Africa know a majority of the spin-threat is gone. Mujeeb, Rashid and Nabi have bowled out their ten overs, while Noor hasn't been as incisive. They would back themselves to knock off these runs against the likes of Naveen, Omarzai and Noor.

South Africa haven't managed a single four in the last 42 balls.

South Africa are 212 for 5 after 45 overs and need 33 off 30

SA need 53 off the last ten

Right, then. The last ten overs of the chase - South Africa need 53 off 60 balls and Rassie van der Dussen remains the key. Mohammad Nabi has looked incisive as ever, but Noor Ahmad hasn't given him as much support. Phehlukwayo hasn't looked as confident against spin so far but the important thing is that he is still out there, and will want to hang around till the end with van der Dussen.

South Africa are 192 for 5 after 40 overs and need 53 off 60

Miller falls to leave game in the balance

The stand seemed to be taking South Africa home, but a wicket and suddenly there are a few jitters in the camp. The wily customer that is Mohammad Nabi gets the all-important wicket of David Miller. The softest of dismissals. A slower back of a length ball that just stops on the batter as he looks to defend. He plays with hard hands and ends up spooning a simple catch to Nabi.

Rassie van der Dussen's role become even more important now. The ball is spinning and Andile Phehlukwayo is playing his first World Cup game. Another wicket and Afghanistan will be in the bowlers.

South Africa are 184 for 5 after 38 overs and need 61 from 72

Van der Dussen holds fort; Miller starts fluently
Rassie van der Dussen attempts a reverse sweep•AFP/Getty Images

It’s been an up and down World Cup for Rassie van der Dussen thus far. He has scored one fifty and two centuries but has fallen for less than 30 in the other five innings. Moreover, coming into this game, he averaged just 12.6 in run-chases this tournament and had fallen to spin in six of the eight innings. He seems to be righting all of those wrongs here.

While van der Dussen hasn’t always looked settled against spinners, he has fought it out as he gets to fifty off 66 balls, with five fours and a six to his name. He reaches the landmark with a fierce slap behind square off Rahmat Shah.

Meanwhile, David Miller, who knows this ground well having spent a lot of time here with Gujarat Titans, has started well. He slams Mujeeb for a powerful cut through covers and also pumps Rahmat for a six straight down the ground.

South Africa are 175 for 4 after 35 overs and need 70 to win off 90 balls

Rashid snares Markram, Klaasen...game on!
Rashid Khan is off after he castled Heinrich Klaasen•Associated Press

It was coming. Something was to give and Markram it is, who bites the dust. Rassie van der Dussen did break his boundary drought by smashing a Rashid googly over long-on. But the wily legspinner struck back in his next over taking out Markram. It was a rather nonchalant delivery too. Short of a length on off, but the ball just seemed to stick into the surface and Markram, who was looking to muscle it off the backfoot, was way too early into his shot. In the end, he could only manage a leading edge that was snapped up by the incoming cover.

Van der Dussen, however, got two fours away against Rashid, albeit off the outside edge, but the legspinner was proving to be very difficult for the South Africans to read.

Heinrich Klassen smoked Noor Ahmad for a four but Rashid struck back again cleaning up the batter with a quick legbreak. Klaasen hopped back to Rashid...never a good idea. He missed and Rashid, like he so often does hits.

Spin troubles for South Africa
The Afghan spinners were on point•Associated Press

The surface is certainly aiding some spin and South Africa, as things stand, haven’t been able to pick them well. In the 30 balls between overs 15.1 and 20, there were 17 dot balls with South Africa managing just 24 runs, though they did not lose a wicket. Aiden Markram did break the shackles launching Mujeeb-Ur-Rahman over long-on and slapping Noor Ahmad past point, but those were the only boundaries they managed in this five-over spell.

The run rate isn’t what will concern South Africa though. This spin test should keep them in good stead going forward into the knockouts. But for now, getting the Afghanistan spinners has been a tricky task for Markram and Rassie van der Dussen.

One brings two!
Quinton de Kock was done in by Mohammad Nabi's offspin•Associated Press

And now de Kock is a goner. What's happening here? A start which looked so good has gone awry. It's the reverse sweep that brings about de Kock's downfall. Nabi gets the offbreak on the stumps. De Kock goes for the reverse, misses but the on-field umpire stays unmoved. Afghanistan are quick on the review. Did he get some glove on it? Nothing on the UltraEdge. The impact is in line and ball tracking suggests that the ball was crashing into leg stump.

South Africa lose 2 for 2 in 14 balls and are 74 for 2 after 15 overs.

Bavuma's misery ends

He was just all over the place, trying to soldier on as best as he could. But Bavuma finally falls, caught at deep backward square leg off Mujeeb Ur Rahman. He got lucky third ball of the 11th over when a thick inside edge snaked past the stumps. Three balls later, he isn't as lucky though. It was a quicker back-of-a-length ball on the stumps. Bavuma gets across trying to muscle it over the ropes. Does not get enough power and Rahmanullah Gurbaz gobbles it up easily.

South Africa are 64 for 1 after 12 overs

Bavuma sodliers on; De Kock flies away
Quinton de Kock was quick off the blocks like he so often is•ICC via Getty Images

Temba Bavuma is clearly struggling with a hamstring issue, and that is hampering his running and also the calling between the two. Nearly a run out as Bavuma ticks to square leg and sets off. A slight miscommunication ensues with Quinton de Kock unsure whether to run or not. He stutters and eventually goes for the run to make it even with a direct hit.

As Bavuma soldiers on, de Kock continues to fly away thumping Naveen-ul-Haq over the deep square leg fence before tonking Omarzai straight over his head for a huge six. A swipe to the right of Rashid Khan at deep backward square leg gets South Africa their fifty in 9.2 overs. Bavuma, meanwhile does get a couple of fours against Nabi and Naveen as he continues to hobble. With the semi-final just a few days away, should Bavuma risk aggravating the injury?

Can South Africa chase down 245?

Firdose Moonda is quick to point out that they weren't able to chase down 246 against Netherlands, though that was in a rain-shortened game. South Africa have started well here with Quinton de Kock smashing Mujeeb Ur Rahman for four through covers before skipping down and whacking him over the long-off fence. Naveen-ul-Haq has looked good, though and has beaten the bat of both de Kock and Temba Bavuma a couple of times. Bavuma is struggling with a hamstring issue but needs a big innings here.

Mohammad Nabi is introduced into the attack early and he troubles both batters right away. Beats Bavuma first ball before catching De Kock's outside edge. The ball flies past Rahmat Shah at first slip, who just couldn't get his hands up in time.

Omarzai unbeaten on 97; Afghanistan bowled out for 244
So close yet so far for Azmatullah Omarzai•Getty Images

Afghanistan 244 (Omarzai 97*, Noor 26, Coetzee 4-44, Ngidi 2-69) vs South Africa

Heartbreak for Azmatullah Omarzai, who can't get to his maiden ODI century and ends 97 not out. He really picked up pace in the last few overs, being particularly severe on Lungi Ngidi smashing him for two sixes and a four with the fast bowler’s last two overs going for 35. He swiftly moved through the seventies and eighties and needed just four to get to a hundred in the last over. But Kagiso Rabada brought out all his experience into play to deny him his maiden ton. He got the yorkers and bumpers on point and there wasn’t much that Omarzai could do. Naveen-ul-Haq was run out of the final ball as Afghanistan posted 244 off their 50 overs. Omarzai's innings was laced with seven fours and three sixes as he took his side to a competitive total.

That Afghanistan could post 244 was all down to Omarzai who crafted his innings brilliantly. He now moves to the second spot for the most runs for an Afghanistan bater this World Cup behind Ibrahim Zadran. Afghanistan has lost 3 for 4 in 16 balls when he came in. He built important strands with Rahmat (49), Rashid Khan (44) and Noor Ahmad (44) before teeing off in the end.

South Africa will be a bit peeved that they allowed Afghanistan to bat out the 50 overs, but should fancy themselves chasing this total down.

244
The highest total in a men's ODI World Cup without a fifty-plus stand. The 49-run partnership between Omarzai and Rahmat was the highest in this game.

Gerald Coetzee on his surprise call-up and being South Africa's enforcer at the World Cup

He's fast, he's scary and he's been one of the finds of the World Cup. Gerald Coetzee has amped up the pace and now finds himself at the top of the wickets column for South Africa in this World Cup with 18 scalps to his name. He first goes level with Marco Jansen for his 17th when he bounces out Noor Ahmad who fends at a 149 kph bumper only to glove to Quinton de Kock. That was the sixth catch of the innings for de Kock and he becomes the third keeper to take six catches in a men's ODI World Cup match, after Adam Gilchrist and Sarfaraz Ahmed.

Coetzee then claims his 18th wicket of the World Cup sending back Mujeeb Ur Rahman for 8. He finishes his spell with figures of 4 for 44 off his ten. Omarzai is battling at the other end but is quickly running out of partners.

How many can Afghanistan end with?

It’s taken them a while, but Afghanistan have finally started to string in a few fours. Noor Ahmad strikes a beautiful straight drive against Phehlukwayo before Omarzai gets into the act to drag Kagiso Rabada to the deep midwicket fence. Coetzee is then slapped in front of square by Noor as Afghanistan collect 25 runs in the five overs between 40 to 45. They bring up 200 in 45.2 overs with Noor and Omarzai looking to give them a late push. Can the duo get them to 240?

Bavuma in trouble?

He's been hobbling for a while, and that seems to have increased in the last few overs. Why he is on the field? He is clearly struggling. Omarzai sweeps a full ball to Bavuma at square leg and the catch is referred upstairs, but replays clearly show that was a bump ball. Three balls later, Omarzai gets a massive top edge on a sweep but evades Bavuma, who hobbles as he runs back. Can't reach the ball though.

Azmatullah Omarzai - the lone bright spark in the Afghanistan unit•Associated Press

Azmatullah Omarzai had only 137 runs in eight ODI innings at 22.83 coming into the ODI World Cup. The allrounder has more than doubled that count in this World Cup alone and looks to be on the upswing. As things stand, he is currently Afghanistan's fourth highest run-scorer in the tournament, averaging in excess of 60 and quickly moving up the charts. He came in with his side on 45 for 3 and even as wickets kept tumbling at the other end, held his own. He notches up his third fifty of the tournament off 71 balls. Can he along with Rashid Khan take Afghanistan to a competitive total?

Pace is pace
Gerald Coetzee gets the pace going his way•Associated Press

Afghanistan bring up 100 in the 25th over as Ikram Alikhil looks to counterattack. He does succeed to an extent, slamming Phehlukwayo for a four straight over his head and then swinging Ngidi across the line over long-on. But Coetzee's pace does the damage once more. He ruffles up Alikhil with a sharp bouncer that whistles past him and goes for four byes. What that short ball did was keep Alikhil on the backfoot. Coetzee then gets the line back of a length on the stumps. Alikhil is caught on the crease and meekly pokes at the ball getting a thin edge to de Kock.

The very next over, it is Mohammad Nabi who departs giving Quinton de Kock his fourth catch of the innings. It needed a review, but the right decision was made in the end. Back of a length ball outside off, Nabi looks to glide it to deep third without any foot movement. He can only get a feather through to the 'keeper. The on-field umpire hasn't heard anything but de Kock very quickly asks Bavuma to go upstairs and is vindicated. Afghanistan six down for not many.

Miller hangs on...just about

It took him three attempts but he somehow holds on to what should have been a simple catch. And, Lungi Ngidi, who still is running quite gingerly gets a wicket in his first over after a break. It was a length ball outside off and Rahmat Shah threw his hands at it, looking for a square drive. What he failed to do was keep the ball down as the ball goes straight to David Miller at backward point. It does come at him at an awkward height around the midriff. Miller performs a juggling act before finally hanging onto the catch low to his left.

Comedy of errors!

Andile Phehlukwayo – what have you done? Oh, dear. Both batters look to up the ante with Rahmat Shah first thumping Aiden Markram through covers. Omarzai then lofts Phehlukwayo over covers. He gets a decent connection but not enough for the ball to reach the boundary. Temba Bavuma sprints from mid-off and sends a good throw. A miscommunication ensues with Rahmat eyeing a third run only to be sent back by Omarzai. But Rahmat was already halfway down. Phehlukwayo gathers the ball cleanly but but takes an eternity to release the ball. He is so close to the stumps as he fires a back-of-a-hand underarm throw, and then misses. Quinton de Kock can’t believe what he’s just seen. Massive opportunity goes a begging.

Bowlers continue to rule the roost

Keshav Maharaj has the Afghanistan batters on a leash here. He’s landing the ball on the same spot over and over again, but the pace variations are making it so tough for the batters to get him away. Azmatullah Omarzai finally breaks the shackles as he sends Aiden Markram down town over mid-off. The run rate at the moment is still under four, but Afghanistan will hope Rahmat Shah and Omarzai can stay at the crease for a while. The pitch is for certain taking some turn.

What's clicked for Maharaj?
Keshav Maharaj's stocks continue to rise•AFP/Getty Images

Keshav Maharaj has had an excellent tournament, having picked 14 wickets thus far. He has the Afghanistan batters on a string here, but what's clicked for him?

Here's Firdose Moonda: Keshav Maharaj made a miraculous recovery from a ruptured Achilles to play at this World Cup and is now South Africa's third-leading bowler. Two hallmarks of Maharaj's success are how much more turn he has found on these surfaces (especially compared to home) and his accuracy. Maharaj has regularly been seen at training working on his lines and lengths. Under the watch of bowling coach Eric Simons, Maharaj has been bowling at a target and observers have noted that he has never missed. Maharaj has also worked on varying his pace, but never at the expense of control and he is now South Africa's third-leading bowler after Marco Jansen and Gerald Coetzee.

Gerald Coetzee got rid of the in-form Ibrahim Zadran•ICC via Getty Images

Wickets falling in a heap in Ahmedabad and it is the Maharaj-Coetzee combination that is doing the damage. After Maharaj has Gurbaz caught at slip, Coetzee bounces out Ibrahim Zadran with pace. Short-of-a-length ball on Ibrahim's hips as he looks to pull it fine. But the pace does him in and he can only get an edge through to Quinton de Kock, who moves to his left nicely. Back-to-back wicket-maidens for South Africa.

And if that wasn't enough, Keshav Maharaj strikes again in his second over. The pace variation does the job. Keeps the first four balls of the over slower, and then gets the arm ball in quicker outside off. Hashmatullah Shahidi shapes up for a cut, but can only manage a fine edge to de Kock, who snaps it up gleefully. South Africa are all over Afghanistan at the moment.

Afghanistan: 45 for 3 after 11 overs

Wicket first ball for Maharaj

Keshav Maharaj has been prolific all tournament and gets into the act right away. Is introduced into the attack in the ninth over and strikes with his first ball. Starts with a loopy length ball that drifts away baiting Gurbaz into a drive. He goes for it, without reaching the pitch and can only get a thick edge to Heinrich Kllasen at first slip, who ain't dropping those. Rahmat Shah comes in at No.3 and leaves the first ball that goes perilously close to his off stump. Maharaj starts with a wicket-maiden.

Afghanistan: 41 for 1 after 9 overs

Ngidi in trouble?
Lungi Ngidi looks in some pain as he walks off after what seems like an ankle injury•Getty Images

Lungi Ngidi did not finish his quota of overs in the last game against India, walking out two balls into his ninth. Just three balls into his third here, he clutches onto his ankle, and seems to be in some strife. Was it the footmarks that caused the problem? Out comes the physio, and Ngidi is walking off. Aiden Markram will complete the sixth over. South Africa will hope it isn't anything serious. He does look in a lot of pain. Has his hands on his head as he walks back.

Gerald Coetzee starts off his spell and has some issue with his bowling shoes. Calls for a replacement, which takes a looong time. Play is finally underway. And Gurbaz whacks a pull in front of square for a four before smashing a cut over point that races away. Afghanistan have the momentum on their side.

Early life for Ibrahim, who has looked compact
Ibrahim Zadran looked in good touch early on•ICC via Getty Images

After Gurbaz almost spooned a catch to mid-off, Ibrahim Zadran mistimes a square drive meekly to the right of Keshav Maharaj, at cover. The fielder went with one hand, could've gone with two. Drops it, eventually. Keeping that aside, Ibrahim has looked good so far. Gets a couple of fours away against Ngidi and looks compact, like he has all tournament. He is the current highest-scorer for Afghanistan in the World Cup and looks set for a lot more.

Rabada with the first over...

And he almost strikes immediately in his 100th game. Rahmanullah Gurbaz is in some early strife, he gets beaten first ball with a sharp back of a length in-decker. Two balls later, Rabada induces a false shot by going fuller. Gurbaz looks for an on-the-up drive, does not get enough connection but just enough to clear Temba Bavuma who was in at mid-off. Ibrahim Zadran, though starts off with a perfect cover-drive.

Afghanistan: 6 for 0 after over number 1

Rashid: Very proud of the way batters have performed

Time for the anthems. Afghanistan's first followed by South Africa's. Meanwhile, Rashid Khan says that the way the batters have performed in the World Cup has pleased him to no end.

Rashid Khan: (On the Australia game) It was a kind of game that was hard to take. As a team, we should be proud of how we have played in the tournament. We did not play well in that part when Maxwell was playing but credit goes to him. We have done some great things and we have had some great wins. We want to think about that and want to focus on what we can do against South Africa today. It is just the beginning for us, winning big games. We will face such games in the future but as a team, it is about staying together collectively. (On the conditions in Ahmedabad) I have played a lot here in the IPL and the wicket is good for batting, but there is some help for the bowlers as well. The pitch is not very different to Mumbai. We should be thinking more about our skills. The challenge is to adjust our skills as soon as possible and we have done it successfully so far this tournament. (Biggest positive from this World Cup) Lots of positives, especially the batting department. We have three or four guys who have scored more than 300 runs. That was one of the goals we had. The batting department taking responsibility, and all of them taking responsibility, I am very happy and proud about it. I was relaxed, sitting in the dressing room and that is down to how the batters have played.

Toss and teams - Jansen and Shamsi rested

Afghanistan have won the toss and will bat first. Same team for Afghanistan as the last game. South Africa have two changes. They have rested Marco Jansen and Tabraiz Shamsi, with Gerald Coetzee and Andile Phehlukwayo coming in.

"We are looking at the surface and also the weather," says Hashmatullah Shahidi, the Afghanistan captain. "The surface looks like it will spin in the second half. [On the Australia clash] It was a tough game for us. We have spoken about it day after the game. It is part of the game. We have to move forward. Today is an important game for us. We have to talk about today."

"We have been given the choice to chase. We have another opportunity to take over. Two changes for us. It [the surface] will probably skid on later. It felt a little bit slower," reckons Temba Bavuma, the South Africa captain.

Afghanistan XI: Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Ibrahim Zadran, Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi (capt), Azmatullah Omarzai, Ikram Alikhil (wk), Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Noor Ahmad, Naveen-ul-Haq

South Africa XI: Quinton de Kock (wk), Temba Bavuma (capt), Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Andile Phehlukwayo, Gerald Coetzee, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi

Batting might vs bowling smarts
Kagiso Rabada set to play his 100th ODI•ICC via Getty Images

Let's set up the scene then. For starters, Shaun Pollock has just presented Kagiso Rabada, who is set to play his 100th ODI, a special cap. Heinrich Klaasen is also set to play his 50th ODI.

As far as the match goes, the outcome of this game could well depend on how Afghanistan's bowlers match up against the South African batters. Afghanistan, along with India, are the only two sides yet to concede a score in excess of 300. South Africa have breached the 300-run mark on five different occasions. here's more in the preview.

Both teams also come into this game having a point to prove. Afghanistan need to pick themselves up after they almost took down Australia only to be defied by Glenn Maxwell. South Africa folded for just 83 against India and will want to prove that was just a one-off innings, which they got out of the way.

Just for the record, Afghanistan do have a chance to take their net run rate above New Zealand. But that's more in theory - they'll need to win by 438 runs here.

Harmison: Chance for SA to go into semi-finals with momentum

Hello, and welcome from match no. 42 of the ICC Men’s ODI World Cup from Ahmedabad where it is hot and hu,id. Just a few more games before the all-important knockouts beckon. So, what do we have in store today? South Africa, already through to the semi-final take on Afghanistan, who will want to finish their campaign on a high. Until last evening, Afghanistan had a realistic chance of making the final four. But, New Zealand's big win against Sri Lanka has all but dashed their hopes. Having qualified for the Champions Trophy 2025, Afghanistan will dearly want to finish their World Cup on ten points. For South Africa, it is more of a free hit, a chance to fine-tune their preparations before that crucial semi-final against Australia. Buckle your seats, folks, it's going to be an interesting ride.
