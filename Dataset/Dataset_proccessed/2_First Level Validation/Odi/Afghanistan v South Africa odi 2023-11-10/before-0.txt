SA vs AFG, World Cup 2023 Match 42: Team news

In the history of ODIs, South Africa have faced Afghanistan once, in the 2019 World Cup, and emerged victorious by nine wickets, thanks to Imran Tahir’s 4-29.

Lungi Ngidi walked off the field after bowling two balls into his ninth over. Although he came out to bat later and has regained full fitness, South Africa may rest him or Kagiso Rabada. Andile Phehlukwayo is a potential replacement.

Tabraiz Shamsi making way for Gerald Coetzee is another probable swap in the South African line-up. They will look to fine-tune their combinations before the all-important semi-final against Australia.

For Afghanistan, left-arm seamer Fazalhaq Farooqi may replace either Mujeeb Ur Rahman or Noor Ahmad, depending on the Motera wicket. Having won only against Scotland once across their previous World Cup appearances in 2015 and 2019, Afghanistan have pipped three world champions this time – England, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.

They were on the cusp of achieving their biggest win against Australia, having reduced them to 91-7 at one stage while defending 292 before an all-time classic innings from Glenn Maxwell knocked them over, making their path to the top four difficult.

New Zealand’s big win against Sri Lanka has virtually ruled them out, but they will look to end their campaign on a high.

South Africa vs Afghanistan: Predicted XIs

Afghanistan: Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Ibrahim Zadran, Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi (c), Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Ikram Alikhil (wk), Rashid Khan, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Naveen-ul-Haq, Noor Ahmad

South Africa: Quinton de Kock (wk), Temba Bavuma (c), Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, Tabraiz Shamsi/Gerald Coetzee

Match prediction: Who will win today’s SA vs AFG match?

The batting slip against India was an aberration to their red-hot form, and South Africa will look to debunk the perception of them being bad run-chasers against a dejected Afghanistan team freshly up from a demoralising defeat to Australia. Batting strength tilts the contest heavily in their favour.
