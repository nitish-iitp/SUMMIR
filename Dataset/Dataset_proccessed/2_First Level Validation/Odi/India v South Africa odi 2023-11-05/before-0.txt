#CWC23 | INDvSA: Let's tame the Protea fire in the City of Joy
By Mumbai Indians | 04 NOV, 2023

Battle of the Behemoths. Clash of the table-toppers. Contest of skill sets. India vs South Africa. A mouth-watering Super Sunday clash awaits at the Eden Gardens on November 5.

India - with seven wins on the trot and qualification for the CWC23 semis in the bag - will face a realistic test of their title credentials against a Proteas team that has scored five 300-plus team totals in this World Cup and also has the most wickets in the competition (67 at the time of writing).

The head-to-head narrative will be a subjective motivation for either side. South Africa leads the overall H2H (50 wins in 90 games) and H2H in World Cup games (three wins in five meetings). In comparison, India have triumphed in 17 of the 31 INDvSA matchups on home soil and have two wins in three ODI contests between the teams at Eden Gardens.

What: India vs South Africa, ICC Cricket World Cup 2023

When: Sunday, November 5, 2023

Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata

What to expect: A Virat Kohli birthday celebration at Eden Gardens with 70000 fans wearing his face masks. Shami, doing a Shami. And obviously, Rohit rekindling his love story with Kolkata!

What you need to do: Get on your BLUE gear, keep reserves of all energy-boosting items, practice your chant mantras to lift us to the top of the table, firmly!
