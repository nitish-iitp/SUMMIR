The Mets live to fight another day.

After getting humbled by the Dodgers in the previous two games to be put on the precipice of elimination, the Mets’ bats broke out in the final game at Citi Field to send the NLCS back to Chavez Ravine. The Amazin’s were outscored, 18-2, in the first two games in Flushing Meadows, but the Dodgers were not going to hold down their opponent’s potent lineup forever, and we saw them explode for a dozen runs Friday afternoon.

Jack Flaherty was absolutely dominant in his Game 1 start, holding the Mets scoreless for seven innings allowing just two hits and two walks against six strikeouts. It’s amazing the difference a week can make, the Mets lineup taking a far more aggressive game plan against pitches in the zone. All told, they crushed the Trade Deadline acquisition for eight runs on eight hits and four walks in three innings without Flaherty recording a single strikeout.

However, the Mets offense may never have gotten into that gear had starter David Peterson not dodged a bullet in the top of the first. Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts opened the game with a single and double, respectively, to put runners on second and third with no outs, but Peterson buckled down to get Teoscar Hernández to ground out, Freddie Freeman to line out, and Tommy Edman to strikeout to strand Ohtani and Betts in place.

This near-Houdini act seemed to send a jolt through his lineup, because they pounced on Flaherty from the first pitch he threw. Francisco Lindor singled to right and Brandon Nimmo walked to put runners on first and second with no outs, and though thrilling rookie Mark Vientos just got underneath a ball and missed out on a home run, Pete Alonso certainly did not miss, blasting a well-executed slider below the zone to dead center for a three-run bomb to ignite the home crowd — his fourth home run of the postseason in what could be his final game at Citi Field wearing Mets colors.

Peterson navigated into and out of trouble with minimal damage in the top of the second, allowing just one run on a wild pitch after walks of Kiké Hernández and Ohtani sandwiched around an Andy Pages single. His offense capitalized on this second disappearing act, Starling Marte doubling home Alondo and Jesse Winker after they drew a pair of walks to open the frame. A Francisco Alvarez single plated Marte to set up a Lindor RBI triple and Nimmo RBI single to hang a five spot on the board by the time the inning was over, blasting Flaherty from the game.

Pages clawed a run back with a solo shot in the top of the fourth, but the Mets managed another miraculous escape, Reed Garrett striking out Freeman to strand the bases loaded after an Ohtani single and walks by Betts and Hernández, all with two outs.

Brent Honeywell entered to pitch for the Dodgers starting in the fourth, and promptly hit Alonso with his second pitch out of the bullpen. Winker made him pay by lacing a center-cut fastball to right for an RBI triple, and after another plunking — this time of Tyrone Taylor — a Jeff McNeil sac fly brought in the second run of the frame and the Mets’ tenth of the game.

As impressive as he was to end the fourth, Garrett gave it all back in the fifth. He gave up a two-run home run in relief of Luis Severino in the Mets’ 8-0 Game 3 loss, and he picked up in the fifth where he left off, starting with a hit-by-pitch of Kiké and a walk of Max Muncy to tee up a three-run homer from Pages to cut the Mets’ lead to 10-5.

Ryne Stanek came on in the sixth and promptly served up a leadoff home run to Betts, and just like that the Mets’ 10-2 lead had shrunk to 10-6, meaning Carlos Mendoza was no longer afforded the ability to hold his higher leverage bullpen arms in reserve. To his credit, Stanek stayed in to record seven important outs, four by the strikeout.

The reprieve offered by Stanek freed up the offense to grab a late pair of valuable insurance runs. Winker got plunked to leadoff the bottom of the sixth and advanced to third on a Marte double before scoring on a McNeil’s second sac fly. Then in the eighth, the Mets opened the frame with three straight singles from Alonso, Winker, and Marte, the final one driving in the final run of the game as Edwin Díaz pitched a shutdown eighth and ninth to seal victory, 12-6.

Both teams get the day off tomorrow as they fly back to Los Angeles. The Mets have just the man they want on the mound, Sean Manaea holding the Dodgers to three runs (two earned) with seven strikeouts in five innings of their 7-3 win in Game 2, the lefty having finished his season with a 3.47 ERA in a career-high 181.2 IP. The Dodgers have the next 24 hours to decide who will start that game — they unsuccessfully went with a bullpen game in Game 2 and would have Walker Buehler on four day’s rest following his four shutout with six strikeouts in the Dodgers 8-0 victory in Game 3. First pitch is scheduled for 8:08pm EDT on Sunday as the Mets look to keep their season alive.
