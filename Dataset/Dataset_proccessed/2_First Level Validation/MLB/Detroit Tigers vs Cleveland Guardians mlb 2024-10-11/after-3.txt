Gerrit Cole and the Yankees marched their way to the American League Championship Series, though it did not come without its drama. Their opponent in that upcoming series had a chance of being decided on Thursday night, with the Tigers a win away from taking the ALDS against the Guardians. It was a back-and-forth affair at Comerica Park in Detroit, and given the outcome, the Yanks will ultimately have to wait to fully gameplan for the ALCS.

AL Division Series Game 4

Cleveland Guardians 5, Detroit Tigers 4
(Series tied, 2-2)

The Tigers have already stood out as the Cinderella of the 2024 MLB postseason, and for good reason. The stormed their way into the playoffs for the first time in a decade as unlikely entrants, and they’ve continued their magic into October. After dropping Game 1 in Cleveland, they took a dramatic victory in Game 2 on the back of Kerry Carpenter’s stunning shot off the previously untouchable Emmanuel Clase, which brought them right back into it. Then, a win in Game 3 gave them a shot to take the series in Detroit and punch a ticket to the ALCS.

Game 4 pitted Tanner Bibee for the Guards against Reese Olson for Detroit, but both offenses were able to shake off any nerves early on. In the top of the first, after Steven Kwan led the game off with a single and was advanced, before Lane Thomas knocked in Game 3’s first run with a single through the right side. It was actually Cleveland’s first run since

Now trailing 1-0, the Tigers hit the board in the bottom half of the second, which started with the bases juiced for Detroit, thanks to a pair of walks to Colt Keith and Zach McKinstry and a knock from Spencer Torkelson. Trey Sweeney took advantage of the prime spot and tied things up with a sacrifice fly into center field. Any further rally was thwarted rather quickly though, when Jake Rogers lined into a brutal inning-ending double play.

With things knotted up at one apiece, both Bibee and Olson were able to reel it in for the next few innings. Josh Naylor and Thomas both singled in the third inning, but Olson was able to work his way out of the frame, and only one other baserunner reached for either squad though the fourth.

The bats woke up once again once they headed into the fifth in Detroit. With two outs in Cleveland’s half, José Ramírez finally made his impression on the 2024 postseason, launching a go-ahead solo shot into the bullpens in left field.

The blast put Cleveland ahead 2-1, but the Tigers wasted no time in squaring things back up. McKinstry worked a 3-1 count against Bibee, and slashed an outside fastball the other way, lofting it all the way into the bullpens in left, once again tying Game 3 at two.

Although they couldn’t muster anything else in the fifth, the Tigers kept the momentum going into the sixth against the Guardians bullpen. The inning began with a single from Game 2 hero Carpenter, and Riley Greene later followed with a walk to put Detroit in position to take their first lead of the game. Pinch-hitter Wenceel Pérez cashed in on the opportunity and blooped a ball into left field to gave the Tigers a 3-2 lead. It was not all sunshine and rainbows, however, as Carpenter seemed to tweak something in his lower half rounding third base, and ultimately left the game.

The Guardians were now just nine outs away from being eliminated from the postseason, but as had been the case over the last few innings, the 3-2 score was not long for this world. After two quick outs, Kwan kept the seventh inning alive with a roller up the middle, giving Cleveland a chance with a pinch-hitter of their own. 2024 All-Star David Fry did everything he could with that chance, and launched a season-altering two-run homer off Beau Brieske into left field.

Fry’s pinch-hit heroics would prove to be the turning point in this one, and Cleveland was able to add another run in the top of the ninth. Fry contributed to that rally too, amusingly with a squeeze play rather than pop.

The insurance came in handy. The Tigers didn’t go down without a fight in the bottom half, which began with a two-bagger from Justyn-Henry Malloy. They scratched a run across to bring their deficit to one, but Emmanuel Clase (who had entered in the eighth) locked down the save with a swinging K of Matt Vierling to avenge his Game 2 loss. This American League Division Series is going to a decisive fifth game.

The Yankees’ ALCS opponent will be decided on Saturday in Cleveland, where the Tigers will have to send Tarik Skubal to the bump to carry the load once again. (Crucially, that means the Yanks wouldn’t have to deal with him until a possible ALCS Game 3.) The Guardians have not yet revealed their Game 5 starter, so stay tuned!
