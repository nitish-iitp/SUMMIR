SAN FRANCISCO — Jackson Chourio hit a two-run home run, Frankie Montas pitched six scoreless innings, and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the San Francisco Giants 3-0 on Thursday night to take another step toward winning the NL Central.

The Brewers, who hold a nine-game lead over Chicago in the division, took two of three from the Giants and reduced their magic number to seven.

The game was scoreless until Milwaukee's Willy Adames reached base with a walk in the seventh and rounded the bases on three Camilo Doval (5-2) wild pitches. Milwaukee added to the lead when Chourio hit a two-run shot to right off Spencer Bivens in the eighth, scoring Brice Turang after he reached on an infield single.

“Opposite field at this park is unheard of to begin with," Brewers manager Pat Murphy said. “It still takes a pretty good shot to get it out of here.”

Milwaukee's Jackson Chourio hits a two-run home run during the eighth inning of the Brewers' 3-0 win over the San Francisco Giants on Thursday, Sept. 12, 2024.

The 20-year-old Chourio became the youngest player with a 20-homer, 20-stolen base season in MLB history.

“He already is a really good player, but I think he’s going to be one of the greatest for sure,” Montas said of Chourio. “He’s one of a kind.”

Chourio exchanged a signed bat with the fan who caught his historic home run ball.

The Giants had the tying run on base with one out in the ninth after Mark Canha singled and Jerar Encarnacion doubled to left off Brewers closer Devin Williams. Williams responded by striking out Grant McCray and forcing pinch hitter Patrick Bailey to ground out for his 11th save.

The Giants had a runner in scoring position six times and never plated a run.

There were only four hits in the game — two for each side — through six innings as Montas (7-10) struck out eight and San Francisco starter Hayden Birdsong struck out four in five innings.

“He’s not afraid of the big moment either, so that's what’s fun,” Murphy said of Montas. “These guys have high hopes, but we got a long way to go.”

No runner advanced past second base until Adames scored.

The Giants had a chance to take the lead in the fourth after consecutive two-out walks, but Montas got Encarnacion to line out to right. Curt Casali added a one-out double in the fifth but was stranded.

Aaron Ashby and Trevor Megill pitched scoreless innings for Milwaukee before Williams entered in the ninth.
