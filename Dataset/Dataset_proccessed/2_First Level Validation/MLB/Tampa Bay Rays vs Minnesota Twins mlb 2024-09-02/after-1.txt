Trevor Larnach hits fan in the face with home run shot as Twins punch back in AL Central race

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — There have been many times early in his career where Trevor Larnach feels as if he’s been “punched in the face” by baseball. On Monday night, Larnach did the punching.

Though Larnach’s three-run home run in a 5-4 Twins victory over the Tampa Bay Rays occurred far too early to be considered a knockout blow, the second-inning drive actually knocked out a fan seated in the first row of the right-field bleachers at Tropicana Field. Larnach’s 368-foot line drive struck a fan trying to catch the ball in the nose, instantly knocking him backward and causing a nosebleed.

Larnach’s 15th homer of the season, a later round-tripper by rookie Brooks Lee and 5 1/3 outstanding innings from the bullpen led the Twins to a second straight September victory, one that allowed them to gain ground on multiple competitors in the American League playoff picture.

The Twins moved ahead of Kansas City and put more space between themselves and Boston and Seattle while keeping pace with first-place Cleveland, which remains 3 1/2 games in front in the AL Central.

“I’ve thought about (success) a couple times,” Larnach said. “I definitely don’t want that thought to sink it and think, ‘I’ve made it. I’m good.’ I always want to keep pushing and finding something to keep going. This game will humble you so quick. Any time you think you’ve got it or you’re good, you get punched in the face somehow and it’s your job to battle back and answer.”

Having already discussed the afflicted fan, Larnach smirked when reporters noted he mentioned being punched in the face. Larnach was astounded by what occurred after he connected on a 1-1 slider from Tampa Bay starter Zack Littell that rocketed into the right-field stands to put the Twins in front for good, giving them a 4-2 lead.

The drive exited Larnach’s bat at 112.5 mph, and though the fan required medical attention, he later returned to his seat and met with Larnach afterward.

The Twins outfielder invited the fan and his sons to the field to check on the man, sign an autograph and share a few laughs.

“I’ve never seen that before,” Larnach said. “Insane. … I just asked him, ‘Are you OK? Do you remember anything?’ We just had some good laughs and a good conversation. It was just one way to remember a ballgame for sure.”

Larnach’s last month is also proving memorable.

Healthy and productive, Larnach’s August was the most prominent of his career as he played 22 games. Before this season, Larnach had only been active for a total of 18 games in his career from Aug. 1 through the end of the season, including 10 in August 2021.

But Larnach is thriving and some of the bad luck he experienced earlier in the season is turning in his favor.

Not only did he homer Monday, Larnach walked twice and scored the team’s first run when Royce Lewis doubled him home in the first inning.

Larnach is hitting .289/.365/.513 with four home runs and 14 RBIs in 85 plate appearances since Aug. 1.

“He just looked good, and our hitting guys have been very keen on just saying, ‘This guy, he’s in a good place,'” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “The fact that he hasn’t let the pure numbers of it that are up on the board affect him — in any direction — when he’s going real good, he just keeps doing what he’s doing. When he lines out two times a game for a week, which he’s done probably more than most, he hasn’t changed. He’s been very, very consistent and those hard-hit balls are turning into what we’re looking for right now.”

While Lee’s homer just cleared the fence in left-center in the eighth inning and damaged the Rays’ chances of rallying, it did no physical harm to anyone in the seats.

Bullpen’s workman-like effort critical

Jhoan Duran knew how much Baldelli and the Twins wanted to win Monday when they called upon Jorge Alcala to preserve a one-run lead in the fourth inning. Summoned from the bullpen, Alcala struck out Brandon Lowe to keep the Twins ahead 4-3 and the right-hander returned to strike out two more in a scoreless fifth inning.

Ronny Henriquez, Griffin Jax, Cole Sands and Duran then combined for four innings of one-run ball as the Twins overcame a short start from rookie Simeon Woods Richardson, who made several big pitches but allowed three earned runs on six hits in 3 2/3 innings.

Though Sands yielded a solo homer to Tampa Bay’s Jonny DeLuca with two outs in the eighth, the Minnesota bullpen proved otherwise unflappable despite several gut-check moments.

• Pressed in his second inning when Christopher Morel fouled off two nasty pitches and ended an eight-pitch at-bat with a single to put two men on with two outs, Alcala responded by striking out Ben Rortvedt to strand a pair of runners to end the fifth.

• Shortly after allowing a long drive to right caught at the wall, Henriquez induced a comebacker to breeze through the sixth.

• After yielding a two-out single to Josh Lowe in the seventh, Jax blew a 98 mph fastball past Dylan Carlson for his second strikeout.

• Sands yielded the DeLuca two-out homer but rebounded with a four-pitch strikeout of Jonathan Aranda.

• Charged with a pitch-clock violation to start his outing, Duran easily recorded a 1-2-3 save facing the top of Tampa’s lineup.

“(Henriquez) never throws in that situation and he did good,” Duran said. “That’s good for our bullpen. Cole Sands, he came in and did good work, too. That homer happens to everybody. That’s the game. After that, he got the out and we win the game. … When I (saw) that situation (Alcala pitching early), I put in it my mind, the team needed it — a good pitcher right now because the game is tied, close, and Cleveland won.”

Buxton begins rehab assignment

Byron Buxton played his first game since Aug. 12 on Monday, going 1-for-3 with a walk and a run at Triple-A St. Paul. The Twins hope it’s one of two warmup appearances Buxton would need before potentially rejoining the team Friday in Kansas City.

Out with right hip inflammation, Buxton made sure to be thorough in his recovery, something he’s become more comfortable with later in his career knowing he needs to properly heal and not just reach a point where he’s playable.

The Twins are 52-38 this season when Buxton plays and 23-24 without him in the lineup.

“He knows what’s at stake for the team,” Baldelli said. “There’s nothing more than he wants to be out on the field and playing because he loves it. But he also knows, when he comes back, we need him to be able to play. Not come back and then feel some things after a couple of days and then not be out there on the field. … You’re looking for sustained success and he understands it and gave it a little extra time where maybe he wouldn’t have before.”

Lewis struggles to grasp second base

He passed his first test with flying colors, but Royce Lewis still isn’t feeling second base.

Lewis made his first major-league appearance on the right side of the diamond late in Sunday’s comeback victory, fielding all three chances, including two with a higher degree of difficulty. He also hit his first home run since Aug. 12, lifting the Twins to a critical victory.

Yet Lewis’ concern as he discussed the performance Monday is that he could wildly harm his team’s playoff chances with an ill-timed miscue. Already concerned about how worn down he’s been, Lewis isn’t keen on dealing with something else late in the season.

“I’m terrified out there,” Lewis said. “I’ve got so many things going on and now we’re going to add in second. I’ve got (Carlos) Santana yelling at me, ‘Hey, cover first!’ Because I didn’t even know I had to — I mean, I knew, but I probably would have been a second late. Little things like that are just, like, adding extra elements to an August, September push that’s important to me. I don’t know, we have plenty of really good second basemen and I don’t want to mess up our defense just because we’re going to try something new. It’s not spring training or Triple A for that matter.”
