14 SECONDS REMAINING

SEATTLE -- Victor Robles ran wild again, Mitch Garver got off the schneid with a massive three-run homer, Randy Arozarena reached the coveted 20/20 club and George Kirby dominated over seven shutout innings for a big rebound as the Mariners established an early lead, tossed a 27-batter combined one-hitter and cruised to a 7-0 win over the Rangers on Sunday afternoon at T-Mobile Park.

Seattle (77-73) has now won eight of its past 11 and advanced to four games above .500 for the first time in exactly one month as it attempts to mount a late postseason push with just 13 games left. The Mariners remained 4 1/2 games back in the American League West after Houston’s win in Anaheim and 2 1/2 games back of the final AL Wild Card spot after Minnesota beat Cincinnati.

Complete coverage: Mariners’ clinch scenarios, tiebreakers, key games and more

Here’s a breakdown of the four players with the biggest performances in Sunday’s win -- and what it means for this final stretch:

Arozarena
The Mariners’ key Trade Deadline acquisition put together arguably his two best games since the splashy deal when accounting for his bases-loaded walk-off on Saturday. In the finale, he ambushed a 3-0 fastball low-and-in for the big blast, his 20th of the year and fifth with Seattle. Coupled with his 20 stolen bases, he joined Cleveland’s José Ramírez as the only players to achieve a 20/20 season in each of the past four years.

“I'm very blessed, very blessed,” Arozarena said through an interpreter. “Thankful to God to be able to do it, especially on a day like this, to show some love to Roberto Clemente. This was a goal that I set for myself in the beginning of the season, something personal I want to achieve.”

The slugging outfielder also doubled in the fifth inning and drew a critical walk in the first, spitting on a borderline pitch with two outs to set up Garver’s tone-setting homer.

Arozarena plays his best baseball when the lights shine brightest. If the Mariners can keep this momentum over the final two weeks, it likely hinges on him being a huge contributor.

Robles
The day wasn’t all positive. Robles exited to begin the seventh inning with a minor leg injury that Mariners manager Dan Wilson said is unrelated to the left hip flexor issue that Robles was dealing with earlier this summer.

Robles was walking gingerly to the plate just before ripping his third hit of the game and departing, but Wilson said the move was more precautionary and that Robles should return on Tuesday vs. the Yankees.

The Mariners need him healthy because he’s been arguably their best position player since he signed with Seattle in early June, aside from perhaps Cal Raleigh. Over the past month, Robles has slashed .421/.489/.566 (1.055 OPS) in 91 plate appearances.

Garver
In the midst of the most trying season of his career -- and the first in Seattle on a two-year, $24 million contract -- the veteran is making the most of his diminished playing time. Sunday marked his first game in a week and just his fifth of September.

He’d been chiefly catching Kirby in the second half, sliding into the backup backstop role, but even that role has dwindled given Raleigh’s consistent production.

So, when he saw a first-pitch fastball from Andrew Heaney, whom he caught for 19 innings during his time in Texas, Garver pounced and pulled it 408 feet. It proved critical, too, given that the Mariners didn’t score again until the sixth, and that without it, the tenor of the game would’ve been much different for most of the afternoon.

“I am staying as ready as I've been all year,” Garver said. “When the opportunities come for me to get into the game, then I want to make the most out of them. And where we're at right now as a team, we put the best nine players out there that give us a chance to win the game for this playoff push.”

Kirby
The uber-competitive right-hander needed just 80 pitches to carve through seven shutout innings, surrendering just one hit while facing the minimum. Setting out to expand the zone in two-strike counts, Kirby instead relied on a bounty of weak contact, as he had just three K’s, while only three of the 18 balls in play against him were hard-hit.

“I feel like, yeah, I just didn't really miss today,” Kirby said. “And it was a great feeling.”

With Trent Thornton and Eduard Bazazrdo's help, Kirby and the Mariners achieved their 14th shutout, second-most in MLB to Atlanta’s 15.
