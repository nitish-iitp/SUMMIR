D'Backs Offense Joins World Series History in Game 2 Win /
In this story:
Arizona Diamondbacks
Texas Rangers

The Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Texas Rangers on Saturday night 9-1 in Game 2 of the World Series.

As a result, the series is tied at one game apiece and each team is three wins away from a World Series title.

The win was driven by Tommy Pham, who went 4-for-4, but also Gabriel Moreno, who hit a home run. Four different D'Backs players registered multi-hit efforts.

Also at the center of the win was Arizona's ability to just make contact.

Per Sarah Langs of MLB.com:

teams with 15+ hits and 2 or fewer strikeouts in a WS game: 

Tonight Dbacks: 16 hits, 2 K 

2002 G2 Angels: 16, 0 

1987 G6 Twins: 15, 1 

1928 G4 Yankees: 15, 2 

1912 G7 Giants: 16, 1 

1910 G3 A’s: 16, 1

teams with 15+ hits and 2 or fewer strikeouts in a WS game:

Tonight Dbacks: 16 hits, 2 K
2002 G2 Angels: 16, 0
1987 G6 Twins: 15, 1
1928 G4 Yankees: 15, 2
1912 G7 Giants: 16, 1
1910 G3 A’s: 16, 1

It's sounds simple, but just making contact affords you so many opportunities offensively. In a league now dominated by strikeouts, teams will often rack up 10+ k's in a game. By putting the ball in play, Arizona found holes and created constant pressure for the Rangers' pitching staff and defense.

Merrill Kelly also did great work on the mound, going 7.0 innings. He allowed just three hits and one earned run. He walked none and struck out nine.

The two teams will be off on Sunday as they make the short trip to Arizona. Game 3 will be played on Monday night at Chase Field. First pitch is set for 8:03 p.m. ET as Max Scherzer (TEX) pitches against Brandon Pfaadt (ARI).
