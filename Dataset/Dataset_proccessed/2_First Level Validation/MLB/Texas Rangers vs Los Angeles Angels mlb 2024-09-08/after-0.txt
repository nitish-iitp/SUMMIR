Andrew Heaney finally receives run support in Texas Rangers’ win over Angels
Heaney’s poor record in 2024 is not reflective of how dependable he has been for the Rangers.

ARLINGTON — They finally rewarded their durable left-hander.

Texas Rangers starting pitcher Andrew Heaney — for the first time in a long time — got some run support from his teammates in a 7-4 series-clinching win vs. the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday at Globe Life Field.

Heaney had a three-run lead to work with before he threw a pitch vs. the Angels after Marcus Semien (solo home run) and Nathaniel Lowe (two-run home run) jumped on Los Angeles right-hander Caden Dana in the top of the first inning. The 33-year-old left-hander allowed three earned runs on three hits, one walk and eight strikeouts in six innings and earned his first win since July 21 vs. the Baltimore Orioles.

“I was very happy,” Heaney said. “I was probably jumping up and down in the dugout being kind of a clown. Very happy about that, happy for those guys.”

He’d gotten just four runs of support in his last seven starts combined since July 31. His 1.05 runs of support per nine innings in that span ranked second-lowest among qualified American League pitchers. He’d only gotten five runs of support twice prior this season (on July 26 against the Toronto Blue Jays and on April 8 vs. the Houston Astros).

“I know it’s not intentional,” Heaney said. “I know those guys aren’t having a meeting about, ‘Hey, don’t forget Heaney is on the mound, don’t score today.’ I know that, I know it’s been trying for them. I’ve had very trying seasons — I know how frustrating that can be.”

Heaney’s 3.84 ERA ranks 21st among qualified AL starting pitchers. His 13 losses, though, are tied for the second-most.

“He’s pitching so much better than his record,” Semien said. “This is actually a career year for him if you look at what he’s been doing for us, staying healthy. I feel bad for him when you look at his record; I feel good for him in just how he’s throwing the ball.”
