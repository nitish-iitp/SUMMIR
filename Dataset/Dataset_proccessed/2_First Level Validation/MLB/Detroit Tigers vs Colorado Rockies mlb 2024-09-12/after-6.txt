MLB – Major League Baseball

Detroit Tigers 7, Colorado Rockies 4
Cleveland Guardians 6, Chicago White Sox 4
Los Angeles Dodgers 10, Chicago Cubs 8

Tigers 7, Rockies 4 – Kerry Carpenter’s 4 hits lead surging Tigers past Rockies, 7-4
Kerry Carpenter matched a career high with four hits and the Detroit Tigers kept pace in the AL wild-card race with a 7-4 win over the Colorado Rockies. Carpenter came up in the seventh inning needing a homer for the cycle — the first for a Tigers player since Carlos Guillen in 2006 — but hit an infield single. Tigers starter Casey Mize allowed four runs and six hits in 4 2/3 innings, striking out seven without walking a batter. Tyler Holton got the win with two scoreless innings of relief and Jason Foley earned his 22nd save with a scoreless ninth. Tanner Gordon took the loss.

Guardians 6, White Sox 4 – Lane Thomas has 4 RBIs to lead Guardians over White Sox 6-4
Lane Thomas had four RBIs and the Cleveland Guardians held on behind their bullpen to beat the Chicago White Sox 6-4 for a three-game series sweep. Austin Hedges added a solo home run for the AL Central-leading Guardians, who moved 4 1/2 games ahead of second-place Kansas City when the Royals lost 4-3 in 11 innings at Yankee Stadium. Cleveland and New York are tied for the best record in the American League. Chicago dropped a franchise-record 15th straight at home, lost its 17th in 19 overall and was swept for the 24th time.

Dodgers 10, Cubs 8 – Dodgers hit 4 homers in 1st, then rally to beat Cubs 10-8. Ohtani homers and steals a base
Gavin Lux singled in the go-ahead run with two outs in the seventh inning and the Los Angeles Dodgers rallied after blowing a 7-3 lead to beat the Chicago Cubs 10-8. Shohei Ohtani hit his 47th home run and stole his 48th base while three other Dodgers went deep in the first inning for the NL West leaders. The Dodgers’ magic number to clinch the division dropped to 11 after San Diego lost at Seattle. Dodgers reliever Michael Kopech loaded the bases on three straight walks in the ninth before getting out of the jam and earning his 13th save.

MLB – Reinsdorf `impressed’ by team’s professionalism during `very painful’ season
With his team slogging through the worst season in franchise history, Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf says this has been a “very painful” year but he’s been “impressed” by the professional attitude from players and staff. Reinsdorf issued a statement Wednesday in response to several requests from media outlets, the club said. Chicago is 33-114, nearing the record for most losses by a major league team since 1900

NFL – Williams looks to move on after shaky debut as Bears get ready for Stroud, Texans
Caleb Williams insisted he won’t be motivated by comparisons to C.J. Stroud when the Chicago Bears visit the Houston Texans. The quarterback drafted with the No. 1 overall pick simply wants to do better after less-than-dazzling debut and help his team come away with another win. The 2022 Heisman Trophy winner at Southern California got bailed out by the defense and special teams as the Bears rallied to beat the Tennessee Titans 24-17 in the season opener. He could be missing two of this top wide receivers this week with Rome Odunze and Keenan Allen heel banged up and sitting out practice on Wednesday.

NFL – Packers aren’t ruling out Love for Colts game even as Willis prepares to start
Green Bay Packers coach Matt LaFleur still isn’t ruling out the possibility Jordan Love could play Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts as the quarterback recovers from a knee injury that has kept him from practicing. Love injured his left medial collateral ligament Friday on the third-to-last play of the Packers’ season-opening 34-29 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Brazil. Malik Willis is preparing for the likelihood he will start a game for Green Bay less than three weeks after the Packers acquired him in a trade from the Tennessee Titans.

WNBA – Women’s National Basketball Association
Last Night
Las Vegas Aces 86, Indiana Fever 75
Washington Mystics 89, Chicago Sky 58

Aces 96, Fever 75 – A’ja Wilson becomes the WNBA’s single-season scoring leader, Aces beat Fever 86-75
A’ja Wilson became the WNBA’s single-season scoring leader and finished with 27 points and 12 rebounds to help the Las Vegas Aces beat the Indiana Fever 86-75 on Wednesday night for their 14th straight win in the series. Wilson passed Jewell Loyd’s total of 939 points on a jumper from the free-throw line with 26.4 seconds left before halftime. Wilson needed just 35 games to top last year’s record by Loyd, who needed 38 games. Wilson’s previous high was 912 points, set in 40 games last season. She finished the game with 956 points this season and could potentially be the first player in league history to reach 1,000 in a year.

Mystics 89, Sky 58 – Mystics beat Chicago 89-58 to move within 1 game of the 8th-place Sky for final playoff spot
Aaliyah Edwards had 15 points and 10 rebounds, Brittney Sykes added 14 points, eight rebounds and seven assists, and the Washington Mystics beat Chicago 89-58 on Wednesday night to move within one game of the eighth-place Sky for the final playoff spot. Washington (12-24) is tied for ninth with Atlanta (12-24), which hosts the Mystics on Friday in the first of a home-and-home series. Chicago (13-23) closes the week against playoff-bound Minnesota and Phoenix — before a matchup with Atlanta on Sept. 17. Washington shot 50% from the field, with 11 different players making a field goal. The Mystics allowed a season-low 58 points after the Sky shot just 36% with 15 turnovers.

NCAAFB – Michigan coach Sherrone Moore signs contract, 9 months after agreement
Michigan coach Sherrone Moore has signed his complete contract, nearly nine months after he began working under an initial agreement. University of Michigan President Santa J. Ono and athletic director Warde Manuel made the announcement on Wednesday. When Jim Harbaugh left in late January to take over the San Diego Chargers after leading the Wolverines to a national championship, Moore signed a five-year contract with a starting salary of $5.5 million. The 17th-ranked Wolverines will play their third of four straight home games on Saturday against Arkansas State.

NCAAFB -Notre Dame counting on young offensive line to grow into new roles quickly
Notre Dame’s young offensive line handled the hostile environment at Texas A&M just fine. Then came the home opener everyone wants to forget — a 16-14 loss to Northern Illinois. Now, two weeks into the season, the Fighting Irish offense is languishing near the bottom of the FBS rankings. And while fans are quick to blame the revamped line, coaches believe there’s plenty of blame to spread around. And they’re hoping to see changes Saturday when No. 18 Notre Dame visits longtime in-state rival Purdue. Coach Marcus Freeman says "overall, I thought our five offensive linemen, they played better Week 2 than they did Week 1.”

NCAA – Pac-12 targeting Boise St., Fresno St., San Diego St., Colorado St. for rebuild
The Pac-12 is ready to begin its rebuild. The conference is targeting Boise State, Fresno State, San Diego State and Colorado State of the Mountain West. According to two people with knowledge of the situation, those schools could be accepted as members, starting in 2026, as soon as this week. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the conference’s discussions with possible new members were not being made public. The Pac-12 is currently a two-school conference. Oregon State and Washington State are the only remaining members after the league was picked apart by other conferences.

Nassar – Authorities find no smoking gun in Nassar records held by Michigan State
Michigan’s attorney general says records finally given up by Michigan State University don’t reveal anything new about convicted sports doctor Larry Nassar. Attorney General Dana Nessel says it “seems sort of improbable,” but that is the conclusion. Nassar is serving decades in prison for sexually assaulting athletes, mostly female gymnasts. Until this year, Michigan State was withholding 6,000 documents protected under attorney-client privilege. Nessel says there is “no fulfilling answer” as to why Nassar wasn’t stopped long before 2016.
