MLB
Miserable White Sox season hits new low with painful mishap, home run robbery
By Christian Arnold

There may not be a better summation of the 2024 Chicago White Sox than Wednesday’s game against the Texas Rangers, when two wild plays occurred to the detriment of the Sox. 

Chicago suffered its 103rd loss of the season in a 4-3 defeat to the Rangers, but what really stood out were the wild happenings that went down in the process. 

First, infielder Lenyn Sosa got hit in the face with a ball before the top of the eighth, and then, Andrew Vaughn was robbed of what would have been a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth. 

Sosa got caught not paying attention while he was standing on second base as catcher Chuckie Robinson threw the ball to end warmups and appeared to connect with Sosa’s nose. 

The White Sox middle infielder immediately looked to be in pain and was checked out by the team’s training staff. 

It was a rough night for the White Sox on Wednesday.

Sosa remained in the game, though his nose appeared to be red as he prepared for the start of the frame. 

The night took another turn an inning later when the White Sox had a victory ripped out of their grasp when left fielder Travis Jankowski made a leaping catch at the wall. 

Vaughn crushed the ball deep to left field, and it seemed destined to go into the bullpen at Guaranteed Rate Field, but Jankowski snagged a game-saving catch for the second out of the bottom of the ninth. 

Jankowski managed to stick his glove over the wall to grab the ball and pull it back into the park to preserve the Rangers’ lead. 

Travis Jankowski made an unreal catch to rob a homer.

The 2024 season has been historically bad for the White Sox, and they’re teetering with potential MLB history. 

Chicago picked up its 100th loss earlier in the week to put them on pace to lose 124 games and usurp the 1962 Mets for most losses in a single MLB season.
