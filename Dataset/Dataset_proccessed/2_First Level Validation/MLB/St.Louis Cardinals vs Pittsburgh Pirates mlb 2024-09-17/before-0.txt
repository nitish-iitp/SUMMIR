Pittsburgh Pirates vs St. Louis Cardinals Prediction

I’m going to try the Cardinals here. Lynn is doing pretty well on the mound right now. In his last three starts combined Lynn is 1-0 with just two earned runs in 15.0 combined innings. As for Falter, he’s coming off 7.1 clean innings in a win over Miami but had seven earned in 9.0 frames during his two previous starts.

On Monday the Cardinals got a brilliant pitching effort from Pallante and the bullpen (2.0 innings; no hits; no walks; three Ks). The bats were solid as well, especially after Skenes left. I like St. Louis to keep it rolling on Tuesday.
