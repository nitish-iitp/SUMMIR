Brendan Donovan hit a two-run home run to lift the St. Louis Cardinals over the visiting Cincinnati Reds 6-1 Thursday afternoon.

Masyn Winn hit a homer and scored twice for the Cardinals (74-72), who took two of three games in the series.

Cardinals starter Sonny Gray (13-9) allowed one run on two hits and two walks in six innings. He struck out nine.

This was quite a reversal for Gray, who lost his two previous starts against the Reds this season while allowing 12 runs (nine earned) on 12 hits in 9 1/3 innings.

JoJo Romero got the final four outs to earn his first save.

Starter Jakob Junis allowed one run on three hits in five innings for the Reds (71-77). He struck out three and walked none. Reliever Carson Spiers (5-6) took the loss.

Cincinnati outfielder Will Benson suffered a left middle finger contusion while attempting to bunt in the sixth inning.

Winn broke the scoreless tie with his third-inning solo homer, his 13th of the year.

Gray retired the first 15 batters he faced, but Cincinnati broke through in the sixth inning to tie the game 1-1.

Jake Fraley led off with a single and Santiago Espinal drew a four-pitch walk. After Benson was injured and pinch hitter Amed Rosario struck out, Jonathan India hit an RBI single.

Elly De La Cruz walked to load the bases, but Gray retired the next two batters.

The Cardinals took a 2-1 lead in the bottom of the inning against Spiers. Winn reached on a bunt single and Alec Burleson followed with an RBI single. After Nolan Arenado walked, Lars Nootbaar hit a sacrifice fly.

St. Louis moved ahead 4-1 in the seventh inning. Thomas Saggese poked a single for his first big-league hit and Donovan followed with his homer.

The Cardinals made it 6-1 in the eighth on a double by Nootbaar and Saggese’s RBI single. Donovan and Michael Siani walked, then Winn reached on a run-producing error.
