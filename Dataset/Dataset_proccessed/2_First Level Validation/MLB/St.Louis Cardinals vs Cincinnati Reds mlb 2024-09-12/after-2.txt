Links: Jakob Junis’ Stats | Sonny Gray’s Stats


Jakob Junis


With the Reds still trying to patch together a rotation, Jakob Junis is getting his third start in his last four games. Over his last three outings he’s been very good. He’s thrown 12.2 innings and allowed one run and just three hits while striking out nine hitters. The last time out he threw five shutout innings against the Mets.

He’s been very good against both lefties and righties this season. Lefties are hitting for more power, but they don’t hit for average and almost never draw walks against him – posting an abysmal .225 on-base percentage. Righties don’t hit for much average or power, and they also rarely walk – but they do walk more than lefties do.

Sonny Gray


The Cincinnati Reds have faced Sonny Gray twice this season and they’ve done well in both games. Back in June they scored six runs (three earned) in 4.1 innings against him in a win. Then in mid-August they scored six runs and hit three homers in 5.0 innings in yet another win.

The splits for Gray are big. Left-handed hitters hit for a solid average and hit for plenty of power. Righties don’t hit for any average, rarely walk, and don’t hit for much power. His home and road splits are big, too. At home he has a 2.63 ERA (5.20 on the road) and hitters have an OPS of .565 against him (.809 on the road).

News and Notes

Minor League playoff updates

Both the Daytona Tortugas and Dayton Dragons will take the field tonight down 0-1 in best-of-three series. They will both be playing as the road team tonight, and if necessary, tomorrow night. They are the only teams from the farm in the playoffs and are looking to become the first full-season team from the organization to win a league title since 2002. The no-longer affiliated Billings Mustangs won three Pioneer League championships after that, with the last being in 2014. They, however, were a short-season rookie-level team that only played for two months out of the year.

Oldtimer 09/12/2024

Hope the Reds beat my (and Doug’s) “cousin” Sonny today. We share a surname with him.

Good lineup today. Hoping for the best. Even though Benson’s BA is way down in 2024, his HR and RBI numbers are comparable (per game and AB) to 2023.

Many Reds greats got their start in Billings. I think Votto did. I think Bench did, too (but not sure). Eric Davis maybe another ex-Mustang.

LDS 09/12/2024

I didn’t think Bench or Davis either one played for Billings. But Gary Redus’ 1978 season was certainly one to remember.

As for Benson, I’m kind of tired of him. I’d rather see Dunn or Hinds starting. Calling them up was a waste.

Oldtimer 09/12/2024

You are correct. Neither Bench nor Davis were Mustangs.

Some who were. Oester. Milner. Esasky. O’Neill. Browning, Daniels. Dibble. Oliver. Trevor Hoffman. Sanders. Boone. Dunn. Encarnacion. Bruce. Frazier. Justin Turner. Maile. Winker. Hamilton. Barnhart. India. Greene. Tyler Stephenson. Friedl.

PTBNL 09/12/2024

gray & oldtimer………..got it.

Daytonnati 09/12/2024

As my Dad used to tell me as he became elderly, “Gray hair is much better than the alternative.”

Dennis Westrick 09/12/2024

Sonny Gray was, and always will be, one of my favorite Reds pitchers! That being said, I hope we knock him off the mound early today!

Tom Diesman 09/12/2024

Congratulations to Tyler Stephenson! Today’s start behind the dish marks the first time in his professional career that he has started 100 games in a season as a catcher.

Dennis Westrick 09/12/2024

A couple of comments about last night’s one-run loss (again) and then I’ll move on!

Few, if any baseball teams can win when the lineup has 11 strikeouts AND goes 2-9 with RISP!

Hoping for better numbers today!

Speaking of numbers, the Reds have 15 games remaining! Need to go 10-5 to reach the Holy Grail of .500!

Michael 09/12/2024

@dennis

Would that mean we are avoiding peaks and valleys 

Daytonnati 09/12/2024

Elly seems ready for the off-season 

RedsGettingBetter 09/12/2024

Elly ,Stephenson and Steer have been K’d so much recently

Mark Moore 09/12/2024

Big stretch of being on the schneid

Kevin H 09/12/2024

Junis, France, and Espinal should be on this team next season.

As well as Martinez and Suter.

JB WV 09/12/2024

?

JB WV 09/12/2024

@kevin, that was meant to be a thumbs up

Kevin H 09/12/2024

LOL, no worries it happens

Mark Moore 09/12/2024

Emojis are limited. I’ve found about 6 that work regularly.

Mark Moore 09/12/2024

Tuned in with a couple of meetings coming up this afternoon (at least one of which I’m running). Commenting will be limited, but hoping we can break the offensive funk and score. Junis looking solid again through the first couple. Our guys … well … not so much, eh?

Perhaps cold Redbird Salad Sammies on Getaway Day?

Mark Moore 09/12/2024

Sadak almost sounded like he was trying to defend Benson (and perhaps Marte) … but he did more than hint at it being performance based. Cowboy’s counter about not being in The Show to develop was well stated.

Count me among those that says the Benson experiment needs to end in the offseason. Perhaps new scenery and a new hitting coach might help him. Heaven knows he has talent.

wkuchad 09/12/2024

He has options. I’d much rather send him to the minors vs cut bait.

Mark Moore 09/12/2024

Behind early by the dreaded 1 run … 

SultanofSwaff 09/12/2024

Well dang, I was just about to type that Junis is cooking so far.

His 4 pitch arsenal isn’t unlike Lowder when you watch him.

Ksdavis 09/12/2024

If the Reds make only one change in the offseason it needs to be to fire the hitting coach. I have never seen a Reds that has so many players going through extended slumps. Elly 3-23 on the road trip. Before he had a hit last night India was something like 0-19. Many more examples

Dennis Westrick 09/12/2024

+1,000%

RedsGettingBetter 09/12/2024

Gray is untouchable today or the Reds incompetence is abysmal today… A perfect game is in progress

Dennis Westrick 09/12/2024

In between meetings here at work and just checked the box score! Different day, same old Reds! No hits thru 4 innings with 7 strikeouts already!

Game wil be close to being over when I get out of my next meeting at 3:30!

SultanofSwaff 09/12/2024

I’ll regret jinxing the team, but to my eyes Goldy and Arenado look washed, like they’re surviving on smarts. If I were the Cardinals, I’d be reluctant to go into 2025 counting on either to make a significant contribution.

Dennis Westrick 09/12/2024

Can we start with a hit! Just ONE measly hit! Please! Pretty please!

RedsGettingBetter 09/12/2024

The offense was really ugly in this kind of game helping Gray a lot in his pitch count. Gray is tossing a prefect game now on 5 innings and less than 60 pitches… France swinging at the first pitch after two quick outs is not smart….

LDS 09/12/2024

Sonny Gray is making the Reds look bad today. 2nd no-hitter of the year coming up?

Kevin H 09/12/2024

Gray is dealing today. Mixing pitches and keeping reds hitters off balance. Phenomenal so far for Gray.

Still don’t understand the Gray trade.

Pharmer85 09/12/2024

No-hitter, anyone? Haven’t seen anything close to a hit yet. One run looks insurmountable

Mark Moore 09/12/2024

I had to present on a meeting and, in the mean time, we’re now in the 6th???

Hope we can get something going. Probably takes the bottom of the order doing it … again.

RedsGettingBetter 09/12/2024

Fraley !

Mark Moore 09/12/2024

I’m guessing that’s a busted finger or two. Not how I wanted to see the Benson experiment end. Holy smoke!!! 

SultanofSwaff 09/12/2024

The stats at the top of the page about Gray’s struggles vs. lefty batters don’t lie, yet Bell has the lefty swinging Benson BUNT, when he clearly has zero skill in doing so….all so we can bring up a right handed batter. SMH

This is why we can’t have nice things.

SultanofSwaff 09/12/2024

I mean, if you don’t believe in the lefty/righty matchup, then why bother stacking your lineup with left handed hitters??

greenmtred 09/13/2024

Sultan: I’m not saying that it was the right move, but MLB managers have information about specific match-ups that goes far beyond simple R/L splits. Bell may for example have good reason to know that Benson, despite Gray’s difficulty with lefties, would be overmatched and that the righty following Benson had a better chance.

Mark Moore 09/12/2024

India off the schneid for the moment with the RBI single.

RedsGettingBetter 09/12/2024

India! with a clutch RBI single…Unbelievable

Mark Moore 09/12/2024

Gray’s pitch count escalated quickly 

RedsGettingBetter 09/12/2024

What is happening to Stephenson? Wow what a way to fail with RISP and less than 2 outs…

SultanofSwaff 09/12/2024

5th or 6th time as a team in the last 3 games I believe…..

Mark Moore 09/12/2024

Got to think it’s his first full season after injuries and he’s a bit worn down.

Kevin H 09/12/2024

Gray battled and won
Great pitching by Gray.

Mark Moore 09/12/2024

failure to launch a sac fly … same as it ever was.

RedsGettingBetter 09/12/2024

Pathetic offense really, atrocious

Mark Moore 09/12/2024

Ballgame

RedsGettingBetter 09/12/2024

Spiers is very ineffective… He’s not a solution…The Game is lost

Mark A Verticchio 09/12/2024

Another epic failure of scoring a man from 3rd with less than 2 outs. This time it was Stephenson but they really just take turns failing.

Mark A Verticchio 09/12/2024

The dream of playing .500 is all but gone. What a miserable year this has been. They need to take a good look at every position next year.

Mark A Verticchio 09/12/2024

Spiers is awful, Bell gave away the game when he put him in. At least they won the season series from St. Louis 7 to 6.

DaveCT 09/12/2024

You sort of have to admire the Cards ability to humiliate the Reds time after time after time.

Mark A Verticchio 09/12/2024

As I said the Reds did win the series season and did humiliate them last month in Cincinnati.

DaveCT 09/12/2024

I guess you have to throw the dog a bone every so often.

Mike W 09/12/2024

Wow, I was really hoping Bell would get the message: “If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.”
Unless they say they’re tired, Stop pulling starters who are pitching great after only 60 or 70 or 80 pitches!
Today: I see he pulled Junis out after only 69 great pitches and giving up only 1 run. Sure, let’s bring in some RP who may or may not have his stuff today. Sure let’s use our bullpen because we only used 4 guys yesterday and have a surplus of pitchers — not.
Now he’ll start the micro managing of lefty v righty hitters.
I wish I was at home watching this on TV so I could yell at the TV and get out some of my frustration. Looks like it was a good game until Bell started “managing”. So sad.

Tom Diesman 09/12/2024

What’s Junis’ pitch count history?

DaveCT 09/12/2024

Let’s see. In the last month, Junis has thrown this many pitches per appearance.

21
11
13
47
43
62
73
69

See a pattern? What makes no sense is putting Junis out there for another 15-25 pitches and risking injury as well as a career. Managers and organizations are not just responsible for games, lineups etc. They are responsible for players’ health and well being. And this is not coddling. It’s a union right.

And, also, sending Junis out there for just 5-10 more pitches isn’t logical. It’s the opposite, especially with your multi inning guy hot and ready to come in, as planned.

Roger Garrett 09/12/2024

I get it and your right about Junis.I do recall however that Hunter was left in after throwing up literally on the mound in two different ball games and AA starts the game with a blister and never has been the same and lets not forget that time and time again first Benson and later Marte were sent out to just fail over and over.Hard for me to believe there was any concern then about the players health or well being.Again I agree with you about Junis and more then likely he was and should be on a pitch count.

DaveCT 09/12/2024

Benson and Marte’s failures are not health and well being. They are performance. I suppose you could suggest their mental health was at risk, however, if that were the case, they’d not be on an active roster. So, it’s a stretch and not really substantiated.

Greene had heat exhaustion (not heat stroke or a viral condition). It’s simply over heating to the degree of nausea. Athletes and others doing outdoor activities experience it daily. It is not a threat to health or well being (other than puking in front of millions on TV). In Hunter’s case, the team stupidly wearing those dumb black uniforms on 95 degree days with high humidity is certainly questionable. As is Hunter’s wearing a long sleeve undershirt. Can’t comment on Abbott.

And, anyway, my point is simply that removing a pitcher at his pitch limit is a matter of health and safety and, by implication, not a David Bell issue.

RedsGettingBetter 09/12/2024

Stephenson has wasted many chances today and in the series overall… awful

Kevin H 09/12/2024

It happens

LDS 09/12/2024

I know it’s unlikely to happen, but I don’t know what else Bell has to do to demonstrate that he isn’t the guy to move this team forward. If anything they seem to be moving backwards. I don’t see leaving Spiers in when he clearly isn’t having a great day. What is he “saving” the bullpen for?

Kevin H 09/12/2024

My only guess is the bullpen is on fumes and the players let him know if they can go or not.

A guess of course, however bullpen has covered alot in the last month.

Kevin H 09/12/2024

Stratch that theory. I forgot Legumina.

Mark A Verticchio 09/12/2024

Elly has not had a good series. I still believe he has a long way to go and would best fit the team needs in center field with Mclain and then Arroyo playing short.

Daytonnati 09/12/2024

The Athletic’s Jim Bowden, former Reds GM, rated Arroyo as the 3rd best prospect in MLB today.

Doug Gray 09/12/2024

The 3rd best prospect? Or the Reds 3rd best prospect? Because one sounds sellable and one sounds insane.

jeffversion1 09/12/2024

Not exactly. “Ten MLB prospects who are primed to make Jim Bowden’s top 50 ranking in 2025” is the title of the article. Edwin Arroyo is third on the list.

Daytonnati 09/12/2024

Yes, apologies. I saw the article and went straight down the list! I should have done a closer read. This is what Bowden said:

“3. Edwin Arroyo, SS, Reds (Did not play — rehab)
Age: 21
Bats: B Throws: R
Height: 6-0 Weight: 175
Scouting grades: HIT: 55 PWR: 45 RUN: 55 ARM: 65 FLD: 60

Edwin Arroyo had surgery to repair a torn labrum in his left shoulder in March and missed the entire season. When healthy, he belongs in the top 50. He was expected to start the year in Double A and possibly make the big leagues late in the summer. Arroyo, whom Cincinnati acquired in the Luis Castillo trade two years ago, is the best defensive shortstop in the Reds’ system, with a strong arm. A switch hitter, Arroyo has 15- to 18-home run power and 30-stolen base potential.”

LDS 09/12/2024

It would be interesting to see a correlation between Reds wins and the number of times that EDLC gets on base.

Doug Gray 09/12/2024

I will scream this until I die, come back as a zombie, and then die again because someone bashed in my brain: Elly De La Cruz is easily the best defensive shortstop option for the Cincinnati Reds right now. He’s one of the best in the entire game of baseball. Moving him would be a big mistake.

Doug Gray 09/12/2024

He makes some errors that, understandably, can be frustrating to see.

But he makes plays that no one else in baseball can make. And he does it like once or twice a week. And those plays far outweigh the errors…. which are also likely to be cleaned up over time somewhat.

Ksdavis 09/12/2024

Doug, Have a question for you regarding minor league SS. Obviously with the injury this year you can’t get any measure on Arroyo. I hope he gets enough playing time in AFL. But how are the comps between him and Stafura? I know Larkin raves about him, and he is twolevels lower , but does Stafura project as a better SS?

DaveCT 09/12/2024

Simply put, moving your best player off of his best position, a position in which he was named an All Star in just his first ML full season, is nonsense.

Justin T 09/12/2024

Not only does he makes errors, he makes THE MOST errors in baseball. Making a great play once or twice a week offsets errors that allow baserunners and/or to advance? I understand your point but if he leads the league in errors again next year id think you have to make a change, I would expect improvement next year if I am the Reds. I still think there is a reason you havent seen many 6’5 shortstops and when you do, they usually arent there for long.

I think his issues are with concentration, putting him in the outfield would help with that. He only needs to see the ball and catch the ball out there.

Doug Gray 09/13/2024

Justin – if he leads the league in errors, but still makes far more outs in the field and has an incredibly high defensive rating like he does this year, you would move him to another position for what exactly? The chances that he’s more valuable anywhere else on the field are slim. The chances that moving him to another position and replacing him with someone else at shortstop somehow provides more defensive value is also quite slim. At least if he performs defensively on the same level as he has this year. If his range gets worse, if he makes a bunch more errors – that changes the math. But right now the math says that the entire package of his defense is very, very, very good. He just gets to that value in a way that doesn’t seem “normal”. And it’s not. But at the end of the day he’s incredibly valuable defensively.

Pharmer85 09/12/2024

Hard to find many Reds wins the rest of the way. Twins and Braves both playing for playoff spots; Pirates never easy; Cleveland and Cubs on the road.

Daytonnati 09/12/2024

Quick check, and granted, extremely brief career comparatively, but in terms of career fielding percentage, we have:

Larkin: .975
Davey: .971
Elly: .956

Oldtimer 09/12/2024

Check Larkin and Concepcion fielding % at age 22 for apples and apples comparison.

Oldtimer 09/12/2024

Concepcion .945 at age 22 in 1970. Then .974 in 1971 and .969 in 1972. Average 0.962 first three years. Davey had 5 GG, second most among NL SS behind Ozzie Smith.

Larkin .976 at age 22 in 1986. Then .965 in 1987 and .960 in 1988. Average 0.967 first three years,

ELDC .953 at age 21 in 2023. Now .954 at age 22 in 2024. Average 0.953 first two years.

Oldtimer 09/12/2024

Career Defensive WAR for some Reds SS.

Davey 21.4 in 19 years.

Larkin 14.4 in 19 years.

McMillan 21.7 in 16 years.

Cardenas 16.4 in 16 years.

Based SOLEY on that, they rank McMillan > Davey > Cardenas > Larkin.

I cannot find Def WAR for EDLC yet.

greenmtred 09/13/2024

Not surprised about McMillan: he was a magician. If he could have hit….

DataDumpster 09/12/2024

Tired Musings for a tired team. Picked up on the game just about when it looked like the Reds were going to run Sonny Gray out of the game and take the lead (not). Listening to Sadak more lately since he has been paired with the Cowboy. Sadak seemingly more low keyed and tolerable but of course he has little to yell and cheer about. As the Reds dropped further behind, Cowboy gives the laconic statement of the day “it’s really hard to win a series when you only score 5 runs total.” Sadak clues in about the defensive problems on the team as Elly commits his 28th error (leading the league). Yes, the starting pitching in the last month has been stupendous but to little effect on the ledger. Just sad.

Mike W 09/12/2024

Gentlemen, baseball moves players around often. From their college position to a minor league position to a ML position. SS’s that become, pitchers that become SSs. 2B to 3B. OFs to IF. Junis has thrown 51 total innings this year. Two years ago he had 17 starts and threw 112 innings. 2020 and 2021 he only started a dozen games. 2018 and 2019 he had 31 and 30 starts and 175 and 177 innings. He knows his body best and if he said he was gassed, then pull him out. If he says he can go another inning then let him go. A 6’3” 238 pound 31 year old making millions. He doesn’t want to hurt himself and knows his body better than anyone else. Maybe I’m TOTALLY wrong and when Junis finished 5 and came back to the dugout, Bell went over to him and said “Hey kid. You’re pitching great. Are you tired or feeling anything? If so, our RPs are ready to go and I thank you for getting us this far and the lead! If not do you want to go another inning?”
No way the Bell we’ve all seen for 6 years does that.

Mark A Verticchio 09/12/2024

As for Elly playing center field, he may one day be a great shortstop but I believe he has a higher ceiling in center field plus Arroyo is a plus plus shortstop.

Doug Gray 09/12/2024

Arroyo is not a plus plus shortstop. In the latest Baseball America rankings he gets a 55, which isn’t even plus. It’s above-average, which nearly every shortstop is graded because they can play shortstop. MLB Pipeline gives Arroyo a 60, which is plus. But it’s not plus plus. Kiley McDaniel of ESPN said before spring training – where he had Arroyo rated 84th in baseball – “Arroyo is close to 50/50 on being a shortstop (or moving to second base)”. That’s not something you say about someone who is a plus plus shortstop.

Elly De La Cruz, entering today, is among the most valuable defensive players in baseball according to both Fangraphs defensive metrics and Statcasts defensive metrics. Errors and all.

old-school 09/12/2024

Hes playing in the Arizona Fall league. See if he gets any time at 2b.

MBS 09/12/2024

Doug, to be fair, the Reds played EDLC at SS, and 3B (Minors, and Majors), that’s not something you do with someone who is a plus plus shortstop either.

The thing is it doesn’t matter what we think, it seems likely that the Reds are going to keep EDLC as the SS. I like the idea of Arroyo as the 2B, that’s where I always wanted him. McLain is not a 2B, he’s a good SS, and I think he could be a good 3B.

Doug Gray 09/12/2024

It’s something the Reds constantly have done for a decade plus when they have multiple players who are capable of playing shortstop on the same team in the minor leagues.

Oldtimer 09/12/2024

The Reds have done that (move SS to other positions and INF to the OF) for more than half a century.

In 1960s, Helms came up as SS, then played 2B and 3B.

Rose came up as 2B, then played LF, RF, 3B, and 1B.

Deron Johnson came up at 1B, then played 3B and LF.

Just a few examples. Many really all-time great SS either came up at another position (Ripken 3B for example) or were moved to another position (Schmidt and Brett from SS to 3B for example). Molitor and Yount are two more. Ernie Banks was a crackerjack SS in 1950s (NL MVP in 1957 and 1958) but played most if 1960s at 1B.

MBS 09/12/2024

@Old yes, many players come up as SS and change positions. That’s kinda the point, people outgrow shortstop. It’s not called tallstop.

I’m not saying EDLC can’t play SS, there are rare people like Magic Johnson who can defy body types in a given position.

@Doug, who was the last great Reds SS who split time at other positions in the minors and majors? Larkin had 2 starts at 2B as a Red, and 2 in the MILB.

Well, if we’re going to go with “great shortstops” then the Reds have what, two guys in the history to even talk about and both were in the minor leagues 40 or more years ago, so it’s not really relevant to today’s discussion is it?

Oldtimer 09/12/2024

None of the position switches I listed were not made due to being too tall for SS. Most were made to get better hitting at SS position. Banks moved to 1B so Kessinger could play SS for most of 1960s. Brett or Schmidt could have done what Ripken did. Both were superior fielders at 3B.

Ryne Sandburg was SS who moved to 2B because Cubs had Larry Bowa, then Shawon Dunston at SS. Ron Oester was SS who moved to 2B because Reds had Davey at SS.

The Reds have had four great SS in my lifetime. 1950s until now. McMillan, Cardenas, and Larkin played SS almost exclusively. Concepcion nearly always played SS but did play some games at 2B or 3B when Larkin had SS locked sown.

Concepcion played behind Frank Duffy at SS in AAA, usually 2B or 3B when not SS. Other than that, he played SS more than 90% of his games.

@Doug, Yes maybe we have been using SS’s at other positions because we haven’t had a complete package sure fire SS in a long time.

We will never agree, but I hope if EDLC remains the SS, (which is likely) he continues to improve his routine fielding skills as a SS.

MBS: There are lots of former shortstops playing other positions because shortstops, typically, are the best athletes from Little League onward. And the best athletes are the guys who generally end up in MLB.

MBS 09/13/2024

@Green, and what did I say that would make you think I am unaware of that. Infact that’s my whole point. You put the player in the best position to help the team.

EDLC looked like a GG 3B last year. This year all the SS competitors were injured (McLain/Arroyo) or on suspension (Marte).

I think that locked up EDLC’s future as the SS. That doesn’t mean I think it’s his best position (3B is), and I don’t think he’s our best fielding SS (McLain is).

EDLC is going to make spectacular plays wherever you put him, and yes, he’ll make more spectacular plays at SS than anywhere else. @Doug believes the net spectacular plays not only offsets the errors on standard plays but exceeds them in value. I do not. Not when he was making a ton of spectacular plays at 3B and was making all the standard plays as well.

And why did Manager Bell bring Spiers back out to pitch a THIRD inning after he gave up 4 singles, an HR, a walk and 3 runs in just TWO innings! That should have told Bell Spiers didn’t have his stuff today. All of us posting on Doug’s site certainly knew that, and we don’t get guaranteed millions to manage. (And P.S. No it doesn’t matter if Spiers said “Skip, leave me in, I’m feeling fine.”) Results are what matters. This is supposed to be a business desirous of winning and making money.

Mauired 09/12/2024

Because by then Bell had waved his white flag and was managing for tomorrow like he always does.

Mike W 09/12/2024

I don’t want a manager who gives up before we’re eliminated. We don’t have many mor tomorrows left this year.

Doug Gray 09/12/2024

As our very own Mary Beth Ellis says: Baseball Is Life

Mike W 09/12/2024

Good point Doug.
