Cincinnati Reds vs St. Louis Cardinals Prediction

I might try St. Louis here. Probably not touching it, though. Gray had a rough outing in a loss to Minnesota back on August 24 with 6.0 innings and five earned runs. Since then, however, Gray is 1-0 with just two earned in 13.0 innings over a pair of starts.

On Wednesday the Cardinals had another rough offensive night, but it was enough to support a great pitching outing. St. Louis’ bats are going to need a boost Thursday in the finale, but I think they’ve got a good shot at a W.
