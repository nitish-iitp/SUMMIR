Game updates

(7:22 p.m.) Ninth inning: Astros 5, Rangers 4

Top: Jose Leclerc returned for the ninth, and gave up a single and a walk before Jose Altuve blasted a three-run homer to turn the score back into Houston’s favor, 5-4.

ADVERTISEMENT

Bottom: Mitch Garver led off the bottom of the ninth with a single off Ryan Pressly. Josh Smith came in to pinch run. Jonah Heim followed with another single, putting runners at first and second with no outs. Robbie Grossman pinch ran for Heim. Marcus Semien lined out to shortstop for the inning’s first out, before Corey Seager flied out deep to center field. Evan Carter struck out to end the game. Houston leads the ALCS, 3-2

(6:58 p.m.) Eighth inning: Rangers 4, Astros 2

Top: Aroldis Chapman came on to pitch for Texas, and struck out Yordan Alvarez to start the inning. Jose Abreu followed with a full-count flyout to right field, before Kyle Tucker doubled down the left field line. Jose Leclerc then entered the game, and got a pinch-hitting Michael Brantley to pop out to end the inning.

Bottom: Things exploded even further in the eighth inning after Adolis Garcia was hit by a pitch by new Astros pitcher Bryan Abreu. The benches cleared and players had to be restrained. By the end of the scuffle, Abreu, Houston manager Dusty Baker and Garcia were ejected. Travis Jankowski would pinch run for Garcia, but Texas didn’t add any insurance in the frame.

Top: Josh Sborz returned for the seventh. And after a leadoff walk to the No. 9 hitter Martin Maldonado, Jose Altuve flew out to left field and Sborz struck out both Mauricio Dubon and Alex Bregman to end the inning.

Bottom: Hector Neris returned for the seventh, and retired the side in order.

(6:05 p.m.) Sixth inning: Rangers 4, Astros 2

ADVERTISEMENT

Top: The Astros threatened again in the sixth. Yordan Alvarez followed an Alex Bregman walk with a single to right to put runners on the corners with one out. Corey Seager couldn’t handle a one-hop liner from Jose Abreu’s bat, and Bregman scored to retake the lead for Houston. Josh Sborz came on to replace Montgomery after a walk to Kyle Tucker loaded the bases. Sborz escaped the jam with a flyout and a diving stop and throw to first from Marcus Semien.

Bottom: After being held in check all afternoon by Justin Verlander, the Rangers offense exploded back to life in the sixth. Corey Seager led things off with a one-out double, before an Evan Carter single set the stage for a monster three-run homer from Adolis Garcia. Another single from Josh Jung knocked Verlander from the game. Hector Neris relieved him, and worked around a Mitch Garver walk to get out of the inning.

Top: Kyle Tucker led off the inning with a single and Jeremy Pena also reached thanks to an error by Marcus Semien. A sacrifice fly put runners on the corners with two outs, but Jordan Montgomery escaped without any damage after Jose Altuve was thrown out on a drag bunt attempt to end the inning.

Bottom: The Rangers finally got to Justin Verlander thanks to a one-out, solo home run from Nathaniel Lowe.

(4:51 p.m.) Third inning: Astros 1, Rangers 0

Top: Aside from the Alex Bregman homer, Jordan Montgomery has remained relatively clean through three innings. He is at 31 pitches.

Bottom: A one-out walk by Mitch Garver gave Texas its first baserunner of the game. Jonah Heim followed with a single, putting runners on the corners. But a first-pitch popout from Marcus Semien and a first-pitch flyout to left from Corey Seager ended the scoreless inning.

(4:35 p.m.) Second inning: Astros 1, Rangers 0

Top: Jordan Montgomery came back with another quick inning in the second, retiring the side on 10 pitches.

Bottom: Justin Verlander retired the first six batters he faced in Game 5, though two of the outs in the second required some nice plays from the infield.

Pregame: Roof? Closed. Lineup? A little different. Manager Bruce Bochy moved hot-hitting Leody Taveras up from the No. 9 spot to fifth. Also, Josh Jung moved up to sixth and Jonah Heim dropped to ninth.
