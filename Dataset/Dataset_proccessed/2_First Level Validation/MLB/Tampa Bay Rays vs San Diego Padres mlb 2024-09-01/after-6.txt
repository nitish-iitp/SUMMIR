Padres score in final at-bat (again), start September with their normal kind of win over Rays

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — The final month of the season began with the Padres playing as they have from the start.

They beat the Rays 4-3.

It was a crucial victory, considering the time of year and the fact the teams around them in the playoff race continue to win most days.

“We play our game, man,” manager Mike Shildt said when postseason positioning was brought up afterward. “… We take care of our business, and that’s the way this game works.”

And that is sort of the point to ponder about this team at this time.

This is the Padres’ normal. They are on most nights the embodiment of every cliché about winning being the only thing.

“Now it doesn’t matter,” said Xander Bogaerts, whose sacrifice fly in the ninth inning drove in the deciding run. “You could be 0-for-4, 0-for-5, it’s about playing fundamentally solid baseball.”

Throughout the day there were reminders of why the Padres (78-61) are in the position they are, tied with the Diamondbacks for the National League’s top wild-card spot and, with 23 games remaining, five wins away from passing last year’s total.

It was the latest confirmation of how they were built and what they believe. It was the kind of baseball they played even when the losses were as plentiful as the wins but that they always maintained would eventually lead to what they have become.

The Padres had just six hits, but they walked 10 times and were relentless at the plate. They ran, they hit a home run, they moved runners with bunts and fly balls.

“We didn’t have the most hits, didn’t score the most runs,” Jake Cronenworth said. “But the at-bats were outstanding.”

The ninth inning began with Cronenworth’s walk. Manny Machado’s single moved Cronenworth to third, where he was replaced by Tyler Wade, who scored on Bogaerts’ fly ball to center field.

Robert Suarez worked around a one-out walk and single to record his 30th save.

And before all that, the Padres lost a three-run lead, which is something they have not done a whole lot but nonetheless contributed to making this victory very much on brand.

The Padres are 29-17 in games in which they lost a lead, illustrating about as well as anything the difference in this year’s team. As does Sunday being their 29th victory in a game in which they were tied or trailing in the seventh inning or later and their 18th victory earned in their final at-bat.

Last season, they had 18 victories secured in the seventh or later, eight earned in their final at-bat and went 18-33 in games in which they lost a lead.

“It’s something that we’ve seen for so long with this team,” Bogaerts said. “We just have that knack. … We find a way. It’s very special — that ability to find a way. Sometimes it doesn’t have to be pretty. At this time in September, it’s about getting the job done.”

The Padres’ 19th one-run victory (as compared to nine last year) was harrowing.

Early on, the Padres kept making Rays starter Ryan Pepiot throw pitches — 23 in the first, 24 in the second, 20 in the third — and would end up seeing 200 pitches in the game, something that has been done just 46 times in the major leagues this season and a league-leading four times by the Padres.

They took a 3-0 lead in the fourth.

Jackson Merrill’s 21st home run provided two of those runs.

After Bogaerts led off the inning with a single, Merrill launched a fastball Pepiot has been getting by hitters all season, at 95 mph and near the top of the strike zone, 421 feet over the center field wall.

“I was looking for a heater to hit,” Merrill said.

David Peralta followed with a single and moved to second base when Luis Campusano walked. That was the end for Pepiot, who threw 89 pitches in his three-plus innings.

With Cole Sulser pitching, a sacrifice bunt by Mason McCoy moved Peralta to third. The Rays intentionally walked Luis Arraez before Jurickson Profar sent a fly ball to the track in left field to score Peralta.

The Rays tied the game in the sixth, as Dylan Cease’s command evaporated and Jason Adam’s command never really showed up.

Cease, who threw five innings had walked a batter and allowed a single, threw 10 consecutive balls to start the sixth and then yielded a single that loaded the bases and ended his day.

Adam, who was feted with a video tribute and ovation during Friday’s game at the ballpark he played in from 2022 until the Padres acquired him in a July 28 trade, replaced Cease and with his third pitch hit Junior Caminero to bring in a run.

A double play grounder by Josh Lowe brought in the second run and moved a runner to third. But with two outs, the Padres had a chance to escape with the lead.

That did not happen, as a breaking ball bounced in front of and then past Campusano, the Padres catcher, and all the way to the backstop, allowing Brandon Lowe to run in from third.

“(Cease) has been throwing the ball well, and Adam, since we got him, I don’t think he’s messed up,” Bogaerts said. “Sometimes in this game, it’s bound to happen. … But it’s nice we got them, picked them up.”

Yeah, no big deal.

“I mean, it’s what we do,” Shildt said. “We don’t want to give up leads. That’s not what we do. … But if we do get in a position where we need to fight back, we do.”
