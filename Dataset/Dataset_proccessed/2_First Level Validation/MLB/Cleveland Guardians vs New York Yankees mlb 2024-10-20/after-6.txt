Joshua Diemert has been writing at Pinstripe Alley since April 2017, in a perpetual search for a more perfect understanding of what value is.

For the 41st time in team history, the New York Yankees are going to the World Series. It took 10 innings, but two big swings from the Captain’s co-stars sealed a 5-2 victory in Game 5. The Yankees will wait to see how the National League shakes out to determine their opponent in the Fall Classic.

The Yankees made a serious decision to empty out a huge chunk of their pitching depth last December. The only guarantee was one year of Juan Soto, who despite his all-world track record, didn’t exactly have the best 2023 in San Diego. It was an extremely high-risk decision.

And it is the ultimate high-reward decision.

In the 10th inning, on a cold night in Cleveland, arguably the best 25-year-old hitter in baseball history launched a ball over Progressive Field’s center-field wall. It was a perfect Juan Soto at-bat, four consecutive foul balls and a long battle with Hunter Gaddis. When it was over, when that ball landed, the Yankees were punching their ticket to the World Series:

Juan Soto already has an iconic playoff home run, taking Justin Verlander deep mere days after turning 21 in the 2019 World Series. This one, with the weight of 15 pennantless years, with free agency looming, may be bigger than that one. Touch em all, Juan, you may never hit a bigger home run in your life.

In Game 5, Carlos Rodón resembled Clarke Schmidt in both of his playoff starts, where he was solid enough before being bogged down in the fifth. Rodón struck out six against a single walk, which is promising, but as I said in the gamethread, limiting hits against the Guardians is crucial. Five base hits, including a pair of doubles, led to a 2-0 deficit and traffic before Boone went to Mark Leiter Jr.

I’m not going to hang anything on Rodón; he struck out four of the first six hitters he faced and kept the ball in the ballpark. The big issue was all that commotion in the fifth inning, where Andrés Giménez doubled and was brought around by Steven Kwan. David Fry singled to put even more pressure on and that was it for Carlos’ day. With the amount of stress that’s been put on the bullpen this week, it would have really been a plus to see Rodón get into the sixth inning, but it wasn’t to be.

I told my boyfriend in the top of the sixth that this was the inning for a comeback. The top of the order was due up against Bibee and seeing him for the third time; if the Yankees were gonna manage anything it would be here. Sure enough, Gleyber Torres and Soto both notched base hits, but Aaron Judge’s double play put paid to much hope.

And then we kind of got the ur-example of Giancarlo Stanton.

These were the first two pitches, both swinging strikes. That first slider in particular made me melt down, as Bo Naylor set up in the left-handed batter’s box as Bibee was coming set. A terrible, terrible swing decision by Stanton, and then Naylor nearly went prone to set up for that second-pitch changeup.

But then, that is Giancarlo Stanton. He will make you want to yank your own teeth out, and then hit a tank that ties the game. With four home runs in the Championship Series, he’s been the biggest piece of a pennant winner, and a well-deserved pick for ALCS MVP.

It’s an individual award, not a collective one, but you could make the argument that the Yankee bullpen also earned its flowers. The quartet of Leiter, Tim Hill, Jake Cousins, and Luke Weaver held the Guardians off the scoreboard, bending but not breaking even as overworked as they were. For all the handwringing over Weaver’s Games 2 & 3, the righty and the love of my life was tasked with recording two innings and did just that, on top of the mound when the final fly ball landed in — who else? — Juan Soto’s glove.

It has taken so many different formulae, strategies, and aspirations to get the club back to this point. That this journey started with a bombshell trade 10 months ago is the stuff of MLB: The Show. That that trade has paid dividends over and over again, and most of all tonight, is the stuff of Hollywood. But it’s real, and there’s only one more stop on this journey: the Canyon of Heroes as World Series champions for the 28th time.

The attention will now turn to the NLCS, as a Dodgers victory means the Yankees face their old Brooklyn rivals on the West Coast on Friday night, for their first Fall Classic showdown with LA since 1981. A Mets comeback means the first World Series game the Yankees compete in since 2009 will happen in the boogie-down Bronx for a 2000 Subway Series rematch. Either way, we’ll have all the coverage you need here, starting with a start time when we get one hammered out.
