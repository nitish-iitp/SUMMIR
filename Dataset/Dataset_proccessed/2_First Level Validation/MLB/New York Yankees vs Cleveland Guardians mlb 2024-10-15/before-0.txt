Cleveland Guardians Betting Preview

Cleveland had a tough Division series versus a plucky Detroit Tigers team, and it took all five games to decide a winner. The Guardians won the last two outings 5-4 and 7-3. In Monday’s ALCS opener versus the Yankees, Cleveland gave up three runs in the third on the way to a 5-2 loss. Alex Cobb surrendered those three earned in 2.2 innings with five hits and three walks in the start.

For the Game 2 starter gig, the Guardians will send out Tanner Bibee. This year Bibee went 12-8 with a 3.47 ERA in 31 starts. Bibee has two postseason starts in his career, posting a 2.08 ERA without a decision.

Over on the Yankees’ side, they split their two home games versus the Kansas City Royals 6-5 (win) and 4-2 (loss) in the Division Series but won both road games 3-2 and 3-1 to move on. In Monday’s matchup New York got a solo homer and two runs from Giancarlo Stanton. Starting pitcher Carlos Rodon was great in 6.0 innings with one earned on three hits alongside nine Ks.

Cleveland Guardians vs New York Yankees Prediction

I’ll probably just stick with New York. Cole hasn’t had the most even campaign this year, and he gave up three earned in 5.0 innings during Game 1 of the Division Series. That said, Cole came back to pitch the decisive Game 4 on Thursday, posting 7.0 innings with one earned on six hits. As for Bibee, he’s given up two earned over 8.2 innings of work in his two postseason outings this year. We should have a fairly quiet scoreboard while the two starters are out there.

On Monday the Yankees didn’t have a very dynamic offensive evening; Juan Soto had two of the team’s six hits. The major keys in the victory were the seven walks and the wild pitches by Cleveland, both leading to a few runs. I’d like to see New York’s bats get going a little better here, but they should be in good shape behind Cole.
