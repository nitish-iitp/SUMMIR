Postgame

So the Yankees do what they need to do, play a good game of baseball, score some runs and get a win. That means no series sweep and a ray of pride has arrived in the Bronx. So have their bats. Even Judge looked a bit better tonight.

Make no mistake though, the goal of LA was to get through a bullpen game without using their big bullpen pieces. They did just that, and now those relievers will all be fresh and ready to go in Game 5 tomorrow night at Yankee Stadium. And yes, New York will have their ace Gerrit Cole on the hill as they try and force a return trip to LA for a Game 6. But the Dodgers will also have a formidable arm going in Jack Flaherty, a real starting pitcher, rather than a parade of middle relievers not allowed bny the Dodgers to get close to any serious baseball situation.

So there’s a lot to look forward to! We’ll be back for Game 5 on Wednesday! For now, thanks for reading, and wherever you are, good morning, good afternoon and goodnight!
