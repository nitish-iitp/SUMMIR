San Diego Padres vs St. Louis Cardinals Prediction 

St. Louis comes into this matchup after a dramatic win on Wednesday night and they will look to get back to .500 with a win here. The Cardinals are 35-32 at home this season, while the Padres are 39-27 on the road. San Diego is trying to gain ground on the Dodgers in the NL West, while also trying to get by Arizona. San Diego is starting Michael King, who has been very solid in recent weeks. St. Louis is going with Sonny Gray, who I don’t really trust at this point, despite back to back solid home starts. Give me the Padres to get the series win here.
