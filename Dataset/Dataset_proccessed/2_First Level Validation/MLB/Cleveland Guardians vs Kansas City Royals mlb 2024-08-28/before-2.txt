Kansas City Royals vs Cleveland Guardians Prediction

I’ll lean toward the Royals but I could probably go either way. Wacha is rolling along nicely these days with just four earned in 19.0 innings over his last three starts. He’s 3-0 in that trio. As for Bibee, he’s doing well also with six earned over his last 16.1 innings in three starts. Bibee is just 1-2 in his last three, though.

On Tuesday the Royals had a couple of good innings and did a solid job at not relinquishing their early lead. Kansas City did use a lot of pitchers though, so it’ll be important for Wacha to eat up some innings Wednesday. I think the Royals will be fine though.
