Cleveland Guardians vs. Kansas City Royals, August 28, 2024
By Joe Noga, cleveland.com

CLEVELAND, Ohio — The Guardians preach “punching back” whenever they fall behind in games this season.

By coming back for a 7-5 win against the Royals on Wednesday at Progressive Field, Cleveland avoided a four-game sweep and guaranteed it would not have to punch up at Kansas City from second place in the American League Central Division for at least the next two days.

Bo Naylor sparked a rally in the seventh inning with his 11th home run, a solo blast off Royals starter Michael Wacha to open the frame.

The chaos of “Guards Ball” took over after that. Cleveland took the lead with three more runs thanks to a variety of bloop hits and slap singles, and the best bullpen in baseball locked things down behind AL Cy Young candidate Emmanuel Clase.

Hunter Gaddis worked a 1-2-3 eighth and Clase mowed through the top of the Royals lineup for his 39th save. He tied Cody Allen with 149 career saves on Cleveland’s all-time list and has converted a career-high 26 straight save opportunities since May 20.

Eli Morgan (2-0, 2.36) picked up his second win in relief. Cleveland (76-58) moved one game ahead of Kansas City (75-59) for sole posssession of first place in the division with 28 games remaining. The two clubs meet again on Monday for a three-game set at Kauffman Stadium.

Wacha limited Cleveland’s offense to two runs early while striking out seven batters in six innings. But after Naylor’s home run, Wacha allowed opposite-field singles to Steven Kwan and Andrés Giménez before Royals skipper Matt Quatraro summoned righty Lucas Erceg from the bullpen.

Erceg retired José Ramírez on a shallow pop before Josh Naylor dumped an RBI single into center.

Will Brennan followed two batters later with a soft liner that just got over shortstop Bobby Witt Jr.’s glove behind second base to score Giménez. Jhonkensy Noel capped the rally with another soft shot that dropped in front of MJ Melendez in left.

Erceg (2-4, 2.88), acquired from Oakland at the trade deadline, had not allowed a run in 12 outings with Kansas City, but suffered his first loss since joining the Royals.

Cleveland’s six hits in the seventh marked a season high for a single inning. Kwan, Giménez, José Ramírez and Josh Naylor combined for seven hits, four RBI and four runs scored. After losing nine of their previous 11, manager Stephen Vogt said the Guardians delivered a great response.

“We haven’t looked exactly like ourselves at times, but for our guys to come back in that game, put up that inning, that’s us,” Vogt said. “Find a way to put up a crooked number, especially with two outs. Two-out hitting has been great for us all year.”

Cleveland added a run in the eighth when Royals reliever Chris Stratton hit Bo Naylor with a pitch. Pinch runner Lane Thomas stole second and moved to third on an errant throw by catcher Freddy Fermin. Giménez brought Thomas home with a sacrifice fly to center that gave Cleveland a two-run lead.

Brennan has hit in 12 of 18 games since being recalled from Triple-A Columbus on Aug. 8. Noel came through with his sixth go-ahead RBI in 44 games.

“It’s different guys every night,” Vogt said. “That’s what we’ve been built on, so it was really nice to see a day like today.”

Vinnie Pasquantino collected a career-high four hits and took Cleveland starter Tanner Bibee deep in the first inning. Michael Massey and Witt added solo shots for the Royals.

Massey greeted Bibee with his 11th home run on the fourth pitch of the game. It was the first career leadoff home run for Massey and the 11th hit by the Royals this season.

After striking out Witt, Bibee worked ahead in the count to Pasquantino, but left a curveball over the outside part of the plate that the Royals first baseman yanked into the seats for his 19th home run and a 2-0 Kansas City lead.

Bibee has surrendered 13 earned runs in the first inning of his starts this season, including five home runs. When asked about the early home runs, he said it comes down to executing pitches.

“That’s always what it is with me,” Bibee sauid. “I feel like I executed the Pasquantino one and he put a good swing on it. The Massey one was pretty bad, and (Witt) wanted to ambush me.”

Bibee faced three batters in the sixth before Adam Frazier ended his afternoon with an RBI single. He opened the inning by walking Melendez, who moved to third on a soft single to right by Paul DeJong before scoring on Frazier’s line drive to center that put Kansas City in front 4-2.

Bibee matched a career high with eight hits allowed. The three home runs marked the most he has ever surrendered in a single game. Despite the recent results, Cleveland is 19-7 in Bibee’s starts this season, the most team wins in starts by a pitcher in the majors this season.

“When we’re going really well, that’s what we’re doing,” Bibee said. “It not just us laying down. It’s us fighting back in the 7th, 8th, 9th. That’s kind of where we did a lot of our damage early in the year. It was good to see that today.”

Cleveland fought back with a run in the second on an RBI groundout by Josh Naylor and added a run in the fifth when Kwan dropped a single near the left field line that Witt could not track down. Kwan finished with a pair of hits and an RBI in four at-bats, raising his average back to .301.

Next: The Guardians are off Thursday before opening a three-game home series against the Pirates on Friday at 7:10 p.m.
