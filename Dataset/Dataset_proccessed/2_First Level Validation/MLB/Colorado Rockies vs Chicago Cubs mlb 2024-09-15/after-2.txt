'Can’t thank them enough': Hendricks grateful for Cubs' continued belief

DENVER -- There was a moment early in this season when Kyle Hendricks’ struggles reached a point of wondering if the time had come for the Cubs to consider turning the page on his tenure. Chicago stuck by the pitcher, allowing him the chance to rediscover his rhythm while continuing to be a veteran leader behind the scenes.

On Sunday, Hendricks was in fine form against the Rockies, giving the Cubs six strong innings, while Michael Busch belted a pair of home runs en route to a 6-2 victory at Coors Field. Hendricks likely has two starts remaining before the end of the regular season, giving him a few more opportunities to keep showing Chicago that it made the right call by being patient.

“I can’t thank them enough. It’s on my mind every second of the day,” Hendricks said. “All the way to the top, they just kept giving me opportunities that I didn’t deserve, to be honest with you. All the way through this year. I’m just so thankful and grateful just to keep going.”

Hendricks limited Colorado to one run -- via a leadoff homer by Jacob Stallings in the third inning -- in his six frames, ending with seven strikeouts and three walks in the win. The righty now has a 2.93 ERA through three September starts, while the Cubs are five games behind the Mets and Braves for the National League’s third Wild Card slot and desperately try to stay in the hunt.

With 13 games left on the regular-season schedule and the North Siders still mathematically in the race, Hendricks said that is where his mind is centered. The 34-year-old veteran of 11 MLB seasons with the Cubs -- the last active player on the roster from the 2016 World Series team -- did acknowledge that he will want to savor the innings he has left this year.

“That’s a tough balance, you know?” said Hendricks, who will be eligible for free agency this coming offseason. “I’m definitely going to soak in these moments and Wrigley and see it as what it is, but my focus is always on the day to day. I really want to make this last push, man. You never know what can happen.”

Hendricks had a 10.57 ERA through his first seven starts, which were interrupted by a stint on the injured list due to a back issue. The righty accepted a move to the bullpen in late May and used that stint to adjust his routine and fine-tune his delivery. Hendricks’ openness to take those steps impressed manager Craig Counsell.

“His attitude about it has been a big part in this,” Counsell said. “In retrospect, he needed to go to the bullpen. He needed to go and pitch in some smaller stints and have a little bit of time to digest what was going on. And I think he’s come back better from that.

“But the willingness to do that -- after kind of where he’s at in his career -- I think is something to be commended.”

Hendricks’ teammates were not surprised.

“I wouldn't expect him to handle it any other way,” Cubs lefty Justin Steele said. “He’s a true professional in all aspects of the game. I’ve learned a lot from him on the baseball side of things, pitching side of things, but I’d say I’ve probably learned the most from him as far as just learning how to be a pro.”

Three tough outings inflate the 5.05 ERA Hendricks has logged in the 15 starts since returning to the rotation on June 19. He has a 3.16 ERA in the other 12 turns.

“They've been solid in totality,” Counsell said of Hendricks’ starts since moving back into the rotation. “He's given us a chance to win. That's what his job is, and I think that's what he values, too.”

Hendricks began this road trip by holding the intimidating Dodgers lineup to two runs in a 10-4 win for the Cubs. His outing on Sunday snapped a three-game losing streak and defied the elements of Coors Field. In fact, Hendricks became the first Cubs pitcher in the ballpark’s history (since 1995) to allow no more than one run and two hits in a start of at least six innings.

“It’s certainly one of Kyle’s best outings this year,” Counsell said.

Chicago’s trust in Hendricks paved the path to that being possible.

“We’ve still got a long way to go,” Hendricks said. “I want to keep working and take it one day at a time, but I’m super, super grateful for everything I’ve been given this year.”
