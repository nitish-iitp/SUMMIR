Yankees vs. Dodgers: Yoshinobu Yamamoto leads L.A. to 2-0 World Series lead, but everyone holds their breath for Shohei Ohtani

The Los Angeles Dodgers took a 2-0 lead in the World Series on Saturday, but they were left with the biggest possible question mark as the series heads to New York.

The good for the Dodgers was a stellar start from Yoshinobu Yamamoto against the New York Yankees, while Tommy Edman, Teoscar Hernández and Game 1 hero Freddie Freeman all homered off Yankees starter Carlos Rodón in a 4-2 victory.

Yamamoto's lone hit allowed was a home run from Juan Soto in the third inning. After that, he retired 11 straight batters to finish his biggest start since arriving stateside. His final line: 6 1/3 innings, one hit, one earned run, two walks and four strikeouts. Just about every one of his pitches was working, particularly a splitter that drew four whiffs on seven swings.

The bad for the Dodgers came in the seventh inning, when superstar Shohei Ohtani sustained a painful-looking shoulder injury while attempting to steal second base. He left the field with an athletic trainer, and the Dodgers, plus the MLB league office, will hold their breath as Ohtani's shoulder is examined.

Manager Dave Roberts referred to the injury postgame as a "little" subluxation. He said the team will do more tests, but early signs were positive.

Things got even more stressful for the Dodgers when the Yankees got the go-ahead run on base in the ninth against Blake Treinen, but Treinen struck out Anthony Volpe, and then Alex Vesia came in and got the final out of the game to secure a 4-2 win after a lot of Yankee traffic in the final frame.

No matter the tension, a 2-0 lead in the World Series is the better place to be, even with one of the game's best players potentially injured. It's the Yankees' backs that are now against the wall. They'll need a win with Clarke Schmidt on the mound against Walker Buehler in Game 3 on Monday.

Now, the series heads to New York for Game 3, with the Yankees in as must-win of a situation as it can be without elimination on the line.

They'll have Clarke Schmidt on the mound against Walker Buehler on Monday at Yankee Stadium.

Alex Vesia celebrates harder than anyone on the Dodgers. It was no different after he got out of a bases-loaded, ninth-inning jam in the World Series.

FINAL: Dodgers 4, Yankees 2

Alex Vesia gets out of it with a Trevino flyout. And breathe.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 8:07 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Treinen, on his 33rd pitch of the inning, strikes out Anthony Volpe. Dave Roberts finally pulls him and brings in Alex Vesia with the game on the line. The Yankees respond by pinch-hitting Jose Trevino for Austin Wells.

The Dodgers keeping Blake Treinen in this game, with Alex Vesia warmed in the bullpen, is absolutely bizarre. Dave Roberts is betting on his top bullpen arm, and it's going to be ugly if it goes against him.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 8:03 PM PDT

Anthony Rizzo gets hit by a pitch for the second time tonight.

The bases are loaded with Yankees. Still just one out.

This game was ALL Dodgers, and suddenly the Yankees are threatening to flip the script.

Stanton lasers a ball down the third-base line. It hits the bag and bounces in the air, staying fair. Soto scores to make it 4-2.

Super weird bounce on that one, but the Yankees will take it. They need two more runs before two more outs.

Stanton hits this one off of 3rd base and Soto comes in to score and it's now a 4-2 ball game! 👀

Soto bounces one off the right-field wall for his second big hit of the night — and the Yankees' second hit of the night.

One on, nobody out. The Yankees need three runs.

Ohtani injury looms large for Dodgers

Stealing bases had been the story of Ohtani's season, as he went from a fast but inefficient baserunner to one of the best in baseball in his first season with the Dodgers. He made MLB history with the first 50-50 season, finishing the year with 59 steals on 63 attempts, but the postseason was another story for that skill.

The play on which he was injured was only his second attempt of the playoffs, with no successes.

Mark Leiter Jr. is in for the bottom of the eighth for the Yankees.

He gets three quick outs from Teoscar, Freeman and Edman. This one is wrapping up in a hurry.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 7:42 PM PDT

Michael Kopech pitches a quick, 1-2-3 top of the eighth to temporarily right the ship.

Yankees are down to their final three outs to avoid an 0-2 hole in this series.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 7:38 PM PDT

Ohtani walked off the field with a trainer. It appears that he landed badly on his left arm during his slide.

He was already unlikely to have another at-bat in the game, so we will wait to see what the Dodgers share postgame. That could've been the biggest moment of this game.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 7:32 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Oh, no. Shohei Ohtani was caught stealing and is grabbing his left arm in pain.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 7:30 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Shohei Ohtani is 0-for-3 tonight, but the Yankees still want very little to do with him. Clay Holmes threw him five pitches, and none was in the zone. That's a leadoff walk with Mookie Betts coming up.

Anthony Volpe flies out, and the Dodgers are six outs from taking a 2-0 lead in the World Series.

Anthony Rizzo, the active career leader in HBP, gets on base after Banda grazes his hand with a fastball. The Yankees get their first baserunner since Soto's homer in the third, but with two outs in the seventh.

The Dodgers gave Yamamoto the biggest contract in the history of pitching to keep him away from the Yankees and Mets last offseason. With the start he delivered tonight, that's looking like a bargain.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 7:14 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Yamamoto gets Stanton to fly out, and here comes Dave Roberts. Yamamoto retired his last 11 batters faced and receives a standing ovation and "Yoshi" chants from Dodger Stadium as he heads to the dugout. In comes Anthony Banda.

Yamamoto's final line: 6 1/3 inning, 1 H, 1 ER, 2 BB, 4 K, 86 pitches.

Jack Baer

Banda is left-handed, so we'll see if Yamamoto gets the full inning. The left-handed Jazz Chisholm and Anthony Rizzo are due up after Stanton, so this might be a one-batter assignment for Yamamoto.

Yoshinobu Yamamoto is back out there to start the seventh inning, though Anthony Banda is warming.

Will Smith grounds out, and we're headed to the seventh. Yoshinobu Yamamoto is staying in with a big matchup against Giancarlo Stanton looming.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 7:05 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Again, you can't rule out the Yankees, but this is very bad.

Aaron Judge has taken 109 swings in these playoffs and has whiffed on 47 of them. That's a swing-and-miss rate of 43.1%.

For reference: The highest whiff rate during the regular season was 36.4%, by Zack Gelof.

Tim Hill retires Kiké Hernández and Max Muncy, and that will do it for him after a perfect 1 1/3 innings. Clay Holmes enters to face Will Smith with two outs.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 7:03 PM PDT
Jack Baer

This is looking bad for the Yankees, but here's the thing: They have crushed a lot of spirits in the seventh, eighth and ninth innings this postseason. You cannot count them out with them down only three runs.

Yamamoto has allowed only one hit — the Juan Soto home run — and three baserunners total while striking out four in six innings. Much was made entering this game about how his best game of the regular season was against the Yankees, and, well, he's replicating that.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 6:58 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Yoshinobu Yamamoto goes 1-2-3 against the top of the Yankees lineup in eight pitches, with another strikeout of Aaron Judge. That was impressive, and the Dodgers will probably keep riding him.

Hill strikes Tommy Edman out looking to keep the fifth inning scoreless. And Yoshinobu Yamamoto stays in to face the top of the Yankees order in the top of the sixth.

No one is warming in the Dodgers bullpen.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 6:51 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Freeman hits a soft fly to right field, and swung and missed on a first-pitch inside fastball (the same pitch Nestor Cortes threw him).

Yankees fans, discuss.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 6:47 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Teoscar Hernández stays hot with a single off Jake Cousins, and now Aaron Boone is bringing Tim Hill in to face Freddie Freeman. As many Yankees fans wish he'd done last night.

However, the bigger concern for the Yankees might be that the sidearmer will have to face lefty-crusher Tommy Edman unless Freeman hits into a double play.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 6:42 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Another scoreless inning for Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who is now at 72 pitches through five. The top of the lineup is due up next inning, though, so we'll see how cautious the Dodgers want to play with the third time through the order.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 6:34 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Cousins gets Ohtani to ground out to end the inning. It's still 4-1 Dodgers through four.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 6:32 PM PDT

Will Smith welcomes Jake Cousins with a double to the center-field wall. Big hit there because it means Shohei Ohtani will probably be facing the righty Cousins, though Cousins is good on both sides of the plate.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 6:28 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Rodón's final line: 3 1/3 innings, 6 H, 4 ER, 0 BB, 3 K, 3 HR, 63 pitches. Just a bad matchup for a solid pitcher.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 6:27 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Rodón strikes out Muncy, and that will do it for him. Jake Cousins, who took the loss last night after allowing a hit and a walk in three batters, is taking over.

The Yankees bullpen has 5 2/3 innings to cover, which probably isn't what Aaron Boone was envisioning tonight.

The Yankees are indeed keeping Rodón in for the fourth inning. Maybe not a surprise with the back half of the lineup due up, but you could also see them pulling him after the left-handed Max Muncy.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 6:23 PM PDT
Jack Baer

Yoshinobu Yamamoto throws a scoreless fourth inning, and just as significantly, needs only 10 pitches to do it. He has thrown 62, and the Dodgers would certainly like it if he can go longer than his usual, say, five innings.

Sat, October 26, 2024 at 6:20 PM PDT
Jordan Shusterman
Homers getting to Rodón

Even when Carlos Rodón's stuff looks sharp and is in the zone, he is especially prone to fly balls — a dangerous weakness against a team such as the Dodgers that has so many hitters capable of hitting the ball airborne with authority.

Rodón's hardest pitch of the night — a 98 mph, 1-0 heater to Teoscar Hernandez — was torched to center for a homer before Freddie Freeman followed by winning a six-pitch battle that ended with another homer to put L.A. up 4-1.

Aaron Boone will have some tough decisions to make soon regarding which bullpen arms he chooses to deploy if he hopes to keep this game close.

Carlos Rodón gets out of the inning, and we'll see if they send him back out there to face the bottom of the Dodgers lineup before reaching the third time through the order. He's at 59 pitches through three.

Big problem for him here: He usually relies on his changeup against right-handed batters such as Edman and Hernández, but the Dodgers had the best wOBA in baseball against offspeed pitches during the regular season.
