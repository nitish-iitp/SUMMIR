Game 1 of the World Series between the Dodgers and Yankees was an extra-inning thriller packed with historic moments and controversy, and it came down to Freddie Freeman’s walk-off grand slam in the 10th.

This live blog's coverage of Game 1 of the 2024 World Series has concluded.

What to Know
Freddie Freeman hit a historic walk-off grand slam with two outs in the bottom of the 10th inning as the Los Angeles Dodgers outlasted the New York Yankees 6-3 in Game 1 of the 2024 World Series.
Jazz Chisholm had singled, stolen two bases and scored on a fielder's choice to give the Yankees a 3-2 lead in the 10th.
It was the third straight year that Game 1 of the Fall Classic went to extras.
The Yankees will look to bounce back and even up the series in Game 2 at Dodger Stadium on Saturday.

The 2024 World Series started off with an instant classic.

For a third straight year, Game 1 of the Fall Classic went to extras after the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers were tied 2-2 through nine innings at Dodger Stadium on Friday.

The Yankees jumped ahead in the top of the 10th when Jazz Chisholm manufactured a go-ahead run thanks to a single and a pair of stolen bases.

But then, with the bases loaded and the Dodgers down to their final out, Freddie Freeman hit a walk-off grand slam off Yankees southpaw Nestor Cortes, who was making his first appearance in over a month, to give the Dodgers a thrilling 6-3 victory. It was the first walk-off grand slam in World Series history.

Here's a look back at how Game 1 played out, along with some postgame comments from both clubs:

Dodgers' Freddie Freeman hits walk-off grand slam in Game 1 of World Series
By Mike Gavin

In a year that has been so improbable, the impossible has happened...again!

Vin Scully's call from 1988 echoed at Dodger Stadium on Friday as history repeated itself with Los Angeles trailing by one run and down to its final out. That's when Freddie Freeman crushed a 10th-inning, walk-off grand slam in Game 1 of the World Series to give the Dodgers a 6-3 win over the New York Yankees. It was the first walk-off grand slam in World Series history.

After the Yankees took the lead in the top of the inning, Gavin Lux drew a one-out walk and Tommy Edman singled to put the tying and winning runs on for Shohei Ohtani. The Yankees brought in Nestor Cortes, who had not pitched in a major league league game since Sept. 18 due to a left flexor strain. Cortes got Ohtani to hit a pop up into foul territory down the left field line, where Alex Verdugo made a running catch and flipped into the stands for the second out of the inning.

Mookie Betts was then intentionally walked to load the bases and bring Freeman to the plate. Freeman crushed the first pitch he saw from Cortes into the right-field stands, giving the Dodgers a thrilling comeback win. Freeman raised his bat in the air as he walked down the first base line, the ball soaring down the same path as Kirk Gibson's iconic walk-off home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series that gave the Dodgers a 5-4 win over the Oakland Athletics and led to Scully's famous call.

Jeffrey Maier?! Fan interference called on Gleyber Torres double, Dodgers escape jam
By Mike Gavin

Yankees fans thought they had another Jeffrey Maier.

Google him if you're too young to remember that controversial Derek Jeter home run in the 1996 American League Championship Series. This time, however, it wasn't a Yankees fan who was trying to help the team.

A Dodgers fan seated in the outfield reached over the fence and caught a fly ball hit by Gleyber Torres.

What momentarily appeared to be a go-ahead home run in the ninth inning was instead ruled fan interference by the umpires. That put the go-ahead run on second base with two outs. Juan Soto was then intentionally walked, putting two on for Aaron Judge. Dodgers reliever Blake Treinen entered and got Judge to pop up to third and end the inning.

It's up to the Yankees' bullpen from here.

Manager Aaron Boone elected to remove Gerrit Cole after he allowed a lead-off single to Teoscar Hernandez in the bottom of the seventh inning.

Holmes then got Will Smith to pop out to short. Tommy Kahnle replaced Holmes to face Gavin Lux, who grounded out to second base to end the inning.

Cole tossed 88 pitches over six-plus innings, allowing one run on four hits.

By Mike Gavin

Gerrit Cole has protected the Yankees' lead.

Tommy Edman led off the bottom of the sixth inning with a double down the right field line, putting the tying run in scoring position. Edman advanced to third on a slow bouncer up the middle by Shohei Ohtani, but he'd get no further after Mookie Betts hit a liner to Jazz Chisholm at third and Freddie Freeman followed with a fly out to right.

Cole has thrown 80 pitches through six innings, allowing three hits, walking none and striking out four.

The Dodgers shortstop made a diving stop on a grounder up the middle by Austin Wells with runners on first and second. Wells reached safely with the infield hit to load the bases, but Anthony Banda then struck out Alex Verdugo to end the threat and the inning.

The Yankees head to the bottom of the inning with a 2-1 lead after Giancarlo Stanton's go-ahead home run.

The Dodgers center fielder led off the bottom of the fifth inning with a triple to right field that Juan Soto was unable to cut off, giving Los Angeles their first baserunner since the first inning when Freddie Freeman tripled.

Gerrit Cole allows first-inning triple to Freddie Freeman
By Mike Gavin

The first pitch Shohei Ohtani saw in the World Series sure seemed headed for the seats.

But his long fly ball to straightaway center off Yankees ace Gerrit Cole fell just short of warning track, where fellow probable MVP Aaron Judge made the catch. Mookie Betts followed with another long fly ball that had warning track power, with left fielder Alex Verdugo making the catch against the wall.

Freddie Freeman then hit a liner down the left-field line for a triple after the ball got away from Verdugo. The Dodgers stranded Freeman at third as Teoscar Hernández lined out to shortstop to end the inning.

No score after the first.

Who is Taylor Trammell? He'll get a World Series ring no matter who wins
By Mike Gavin
Getty Images

One player is already guaranteed a 2024 World Series ring. That would be Taylor Trammell, the only major leaguer who played for both the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees this season.

The 27-year-old outfielder appeared in just 10 games combined this season, five for the Dodgers and five for the Yankees. He opened the season in spring training with the Mariners before being designated for assignment. The Dodgers claimed him, and he made one start and six plate appearances for them in April, failing to record a hit.

He was then designated for assignment by the eventual National League champions and claimed by the eventual American League champions. In two plate appearances with the Yankees, he singled, walked and scored two runs.
