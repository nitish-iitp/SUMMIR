Nick Martinez


Earlier this month Nick Martinez dominated the Brewers in Milwaukee as he fired seven shutout innings while allowing just one hit and striking out seven. The Reds lost that game 1-0.

The splits aren’t very big for lefties or righties against Nick Martinez. Lefties are hitting a little bit better across the board, but by small amounts in each category. Where his splits are big, though, are in the home and road categories. His ERA at home is 4.42 (2.74 on the road) and his OPS against at home is .797 (.558 on the road).

Colin Rea


Back in the middle of June the Reds scored two earned in six innings against Rea. That was the only time they have faced him this season. He’s been inconsistent in August. In his first and third starts of the month he fired off seven shutout innings against Atlanta and Cleveland. In his second start he gave up seven runs to the Dodgers and in his last start he allowed four runs to Oakland – giving up six home runs between those two games.

The splits aren’t big for Colin Rea when it comes to the handedness of the hitters. Lefties have a 40 point advantage in slugging percentage, but that’s pretty much where the differences are. Hitters have a 77 point advantage in OPS against him when he’s on the road, but his ERA is actually 0.56 lower on the road. A big part of that may be that he’s allowed 15 homers at home and just seven on the road.

News and Notes

Making plenty of roster moves

Cincinnati made four roster moves this morning to get ready for today’s doubleheader. Rhett Lowder was officially added to the 40-man roster and called up. They also called up Yosver Zulueta as the 27th man for the doubleheader. Brandon Leibrandt, who pitched 2.1 innings last night was optioned to Louisville. And they created the 40-man roster spot for Lowder by designated Davis Wendzel for assignment. You can read a bit more about all of those moves here if you wanted more details.

Hunter Greene is throwing again

Hunter Greene has started throwing again, Bell said. They are working on a target date for Greene to return this season.

Good news on Greene but I’ll be very surprised to see him pitch again this year. Games against Brewers are always fun. Go Reds

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

At this point in the season I would be OK if the Reds elect to shut down Greene and get him 100% healthy for 2025!

LWBlogger 08/30/2024

I concur.

Oldtimer 08/30/2024

He had a bruise. Nothing torn or broken. The bruise is healed. He is NOT unhealthy.

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

Wow! Started Game 1 early! Thought it was a 1:10 start! See where perennial Reds Killer Adames has erased the Reds early 1-0 lead!

I miss the good old days when the day-night double-headers started late afternoon and second game would start about 30 minutes after the ccompletion of Game 1.

Excited to see how Lowder pitches in Game 2

Jim Walker 08/30/2024

I recently “tuned in” too. Doug had the start time down as 12:40 at the top of this preview but the game doesn’t; seem to be very far along to have started then.

wkuchad 08/30/2024

I agree Dennis. I got to attend a couple of doubleheaders at Riverfront. I don’t remember Great American ever having a real doubleheader.

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

Plus, back in the day, you only ahd to pay one price to see both games!

greenmtred 08/30/2024

I miss those doubleheaders, too, and agree with you about Greene, Dennis. Unless, of course, the Reds run off 15 wins in a row and find themselves back in race.

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

That, indeed, is wishful thinking!

greenmtred 08/30/2024

What else is left?

CincyDo 08/30/2024

Over the last month or so Espinal is Reds most reliable hitter, followed by TySteve. Everyone else is hit or miss, can’t count in to get a hit. Look like Benson started to eat his Wheaties for breakfast again.

wkuchad 08/30/2024

Not sure how to define reliable, but TySteve has been our best hitter of the last month, and it’s not close.

Espinal has been 2nd best. Benson still hasn’t been great, but Steer definitely playing well.

CincyDo 08/30/2024

You’re right. TySteve power number is far better than Espinal. But I was thinking more about the number of hits. My back of envelop tally showed Espinal has more multi hit games and more total number of hits than TySteve

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

Just tuned in as Elly snuck one through to drive in Benson. Martinez looking pretty good in the 3rd. Don’t like seeing Friedl slamming into the wall, but catching that next one helps.

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

My dislike for Contreras rivals that of the Neck Tattoo. I don’t really know why, but that’s what it is. When he puts one over the wall, it just intensifies.

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

There are 2 guys in the Brewers lineup that are perennial Reds Killers, Adames & Contreras! So far, they each have a solo HR and Adames is 2 for 2!

Hope that trend does not continue!

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

Well nuts … 

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

Yep! Nick threw Frelick a meatball right over the center of the plate on an 0-1 count!

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

Apparently, bunting a leadoff runner who just singled is verboten!

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

“bunting into scoring position”

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

And that’s exactly why EDLC stays at SS as long as he’s in a Reds uniform. Churio isn’t slow and even a bit of a looping throw still beat him.

Too bad he rolled his ankle. I’ve done that (not under those conditions) and it really hurts. Hate to see that happen.

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

And he stays in the game????

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

That little “meeting” half way down the line made me smile. Assist to the hip check 

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

Hope to squeeze on more inning out of Nick considering we have another game to play today!

Of course, Diaz is at the ready!

Oldtimer 08/30/2024

Why the snide comment about Diaz?

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

Why? Because I can! It’s called free speech! Relax Oldtimer! It was meant to be funny! Obviously, you are humor challenged!

Diaz, like any pitcher, has his good days and bad days! Last night was not one of his good days! I still believe he adds value to this team!

DaveCT 08/30/2024

Free speech as you suppose it to be does not apply on a private forum. Just saying.

Do people not realize this is Doug’s livelihood? That he has advertisers? The constant berating of the home team just exemplifies thoughtlessness.

Oldtimer 08/30/2024

It’s an ill chosen comment. Diaz has three good years as a Red. He’s a a slump lately.

Free speech has nothing whatsoever to do with RLN comments.

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

And, the former ROY ties it up! New ballgame boys!

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

Into the Brewers bullpen early in Game 1! That’s a good thing, right?

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

Nice job by Farmer! Now for a crooked number from the good guys!

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

Farmer at 11 pitches thru his 1.2 innings of work! I say ride that horse for another inning!

LWBlogger 08/30/2024

Even at 100 degrees I feel 11 pitches through 1-2/3 is pretty darned efficient and he should be good to go for the next inning but we have Pagan in there now. Maybe Farmer can go in game 2? I may have sent him back out there though. He and Pagan are both RHP, so I wouldn’t think platoons factor into this much.

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

Too close to take, Jon.

CincyDo 08/30/2024

Maile just cannot buy a hit this year. .24 average last year, .16 this year.

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

He at least worked the count the last two times. On a DH day that really helps.

CincyDo 08/30/2024

Overall I see a lot of good ABs today, until Steer last AB. That was awful.

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

Nice heads up from Elly!!! A bobble added a base.

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

Probably worth the challenge.

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

And Churio is out anyway 

JB 08/30/2024

That’s the only angle they have at first?

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

Have to think they have more. With that angle “stands” is the right call. There is at least a hint of a tag with his fingers up as he gets to the base. Need a shot from the LF line.

LWBlogger 08/30/2024

Fastball up and away like a pitchout for the caught stealing. Big out.

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

Followed by that whiff was extra sweet!!

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

This is what I don’t understand about Bell’s approach to relief pitching and frustrates me to no end! Yes, I know it’s a hot summer day in August, but Farmer was pitching lights out and had only thrown 11 pitches in his 1.2 innings of work! Why not at least start him in the 8th inning? Farmer will likely not be available for Game 2 so why not use all the gas in the tank!

In any event, Pagan got it done! Can’t wait to see who toes the rubber in the top of the 9th!

Oldtimer 08/30/2024

There is a double header today.

LWBlogger 08/30/2024

That makes sense if Farmer is to be available for Game 2. I have doubts that he is though. I think I agree with Dennis on this one. Having said that, Pagan did a fine job.

LWBlogger 08/30/2024

That right there (Hinds picked off by Contreras at 1B) is why the fanbase is constantly harping on the coaching and what seems to be a major lack of fundamentals with this team. Great AB, have a very hot hitter up, but then get caught off 1B by the Catcher. It’s just bad baseball.

Roger Garrett 08/30/2024

France thrown out at second trying to stretch it and Hinds gets picked off is just the season in a nutshell.Doesn’t take long for the new guys to fall in line with the rest.Took Espy awhile to get it but he is really good at it now like yesterday at third with Elly up next.Talk all we want about the pitching but as Harry Stoner said lets not forget about the poor hitting poor defense and poor base running.No defending the way this team plays.How can any coach that coaches hitting or defense or base running still have a job or how can the manager that the coaches work for still have his job.

RedAlert 08/30/2024

This right here ! Nail on the head Roger !

RedAlert 08/30/2024

Little league baserunning continues …. It’s inexcusable , especially the number of times it has happened this year . I mean do they ever bother working on it at all !!!!!
IT’S INSANE !!!!!! Continues to be tolerated as well ….

LWBlogger 08/30/2024

Someone needs to go take a look at the outs on the bases, as a ratio of total times on base. They then need to look at that data for the Reds versus the rest of the league. I mean, we have a ton of steals and base-advances too, so I wonder how hard factoring that into the ratio would be. My gut tells me that the Reds would be doing VERY poorly looking at that but sometimes the math doesn’t agree with my gut.

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

What amounts to a strike ’em out throw ’em out DP!!

LWBlogger 08/30/2024

With how Maile has been struggling, I would absolutely love for the guy to walk it off today. The odds must be astronomically against it, but it would be epic and another quirk of baseball.

LWBlogger 08/30/2024

I was banging on the Reds but then Perkins got picked off. That’s why I want to see some sort of comparison with the rest of the league.

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

I did’t know I could hold my breath for so long! Nice job Wilson!

Also, nice to see a TOOTBLAN by the opposing team!

Red Thunder 08/30/2024

Bottom 9th! Well as Nuxy would say, can’t win them both if you don’t win the first one.

Mauired 08/30/2024

Maile first base hit since June 24. Unbelievable that he’s still on the team.

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

Maile bats … I kind of get that. But you don’t run for him tied in the 9th? Baffling … 

Oldtimer 08/30/2024

Yeah, that would be a natural spot to use a pinch runner.

Mark 08/30/2024

Tyler wasn’t going to put on the gear till the second game.
Pinch hit maybe but that’s all.

JB 08/30/2024

You know he is bunting and he still beats it. Incredible

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

So well executed and screaming speed down the line.

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

Run was gonna score. Bike Helmets are very appreciated.

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

Two outs on the base paths in the bottom of the 9th inning is inexcusable!

dimondfvr 08/30/2024

Wouldn’t it seem logical for Elly to bunt with a runner on second?

JB 08/30/2024

Not under Bell baseball.

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

Again, please refrain from using the words logic and Bell in the same sentence!

greenmtred 08/30/2024

Is a Elly a good bunter? He hasn’t done it much with the Reds.

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

I expect we’ll see Williams in the bottom of the 10th!

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

Honest question … is Marte faster than India? If he is, why not PR here.

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

Terrible call on strike 2. Too aggressive on strike 3. 

LWBlogger 08/30/2024

Watching Gamecast so hard for me to tell other than it was outside the box on the changeup. It also appeared from Gamecast that Elly swung at the worst pitch he got the whole AB.

LWBlogger 08/30/2024

Down to the last out.

JB 08/30/2024

Elly would have bunted India over then he scores there.

LWBlogger 08/30/2024

1) In fairness, there is no way I would have had Elly bunting there. I know that is the classic play, but he is my best hitter and is the most likely guy in the lineup to hit a 2-run, game-winning HR.

2) Maybe he doesn’t throw that pitch with a runner on 3B?

JB 08/30/2024

Funny I watch the Brewers have Yelich bunt and he is their best hitter. But you and Bell will always be in 4th place.

greenmtred 08/30/2024

Yelich is a good bunter. Do you know for a fact that Elly is?

JB 08/30/2024

Do you?

LWBlogger 08/30/2024

Wow, we disagree and now I’m a “4th placer”? You don’t know me at all  … It’s okay though. Back to the actual subject at hand

Having him swing didn’t work out obviously, as he “K”-ed. As for the bunt, we’ll never know. Maybe you’d have been proven right. The old-school book says you bunt there, so bunting there likely isn’t the “wrong” play.

Randoxu1 08/30/2024

Can’t win unless you tie it first, but Bell doesn’t see that

LWBlogger 08/30/2024

Do you have Elly try to bunt India to 3B to start the inning? My thoughts are above (I don’t), but the old-school fundamental play is the bunt.

JB 08/30/2024

Great win Brewers. Fundamental baseball wins again!

LWBlogger 08/30/2024

Welp, a 10-pitch AB for France there after going down 0-2 is pretty strong, but not strong enough.

Mark Moore 08/30/2024

Double NUTS!!!!

CI3J 08/30/2024

Another 1 run loss…

Red Thunder 08/30/2024

Things are back to normal for the Reds

JayTheRed 08/30/2024

Another 1 run loss… This infuriates me so much. Will say Ty France did give a good ab at least.

Dennis Westrick 08/30/2024

The Brewers are living rent free in the heads of the Reds! Game was lost in the bottom of the 9th due to the two TOOTBLANS!

JB 08/30/2024

I don’t think it’s rent free. These are two different organizations that have been going different ways. One plays defensively and has good fundamentals added in with good solid pitching and players who don’t swing for the fences. Brewers just play their game and wait for other teams to make the mistake. To which the Reds are good at.

Mark A Verticchio 08/30/2024

Just another game where fundamental baseball won, something the Reds don’t have and never will under Bell.

JayTheRed 08/30/2024

Amen!

Brian Rutherford 08/30/2024

I have to vent and can think of no other place.

I am sick of John Sadak and his endless list of terrible statistics about the Reds and constantly complimenting the other team. It’s gotten to Larkin finally where he said (paraphrasing here) I hope the opposing broadcasters are talking about our players as much as we talk about the other team.

I understand 100% why Vin Scully is such an icon. He had tons of human interest stories about the platers and their families and rarely talked down about the Dodgers.

I would like to watch the game with some hope from the broadcasters that our team as a chance to win. When they were batting in the bottom of the 9th I don’t know why they even went up there to hit. Sadak had Williams wearing Superman’s cape and the Reds were the baseball equivalent of the Washington Generals (Globetrotter reference for young people).

Rant over. Resume hating my posts and the usual insults.

Thank you for your time.

Doug Gray 08/30/2024

Alejo Lopez was the last Red to get a hit against Williams. Dude pretty much is wearing Superman’s cape.

Brian Rutherford 08/30/2024

You are 100% correct but I would like the broadcasters to bring hope instead of doom and gloom. Every freaking game.

I watch the game for a pleasant distraction, not to hear about how big of a waste of time it is to watch.

Just a personal preference I guess.

Melvin 08/30/2024

Speaking of Alejo Lopez he’s having a pretty good year in AAA.

https://www.milb.com/player/alejo-lopez-664670

Mark 08/30/2024

Sadak can be very irritating. Not close to being my favorite play by play guy. But like a lot of things seems we are stuck with him.

Rick 08/30/2024

And he had Chiros likely done for the remainder of the game & possibly the series! Lol
Yeah, bleed Red or not at all Sadek.
I tire of his biography on seemingly ever opponent.
