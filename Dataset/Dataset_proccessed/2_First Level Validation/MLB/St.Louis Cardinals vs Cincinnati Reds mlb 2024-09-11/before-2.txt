Rhett Lowder, Reds bullpen shut down Cardinals in 3-0 win
 Doug Gray  09/10/2024 95

Rhett Lowder made his first start on the road of his big league career and he didn’t seem bothered by the away crowd at all as he fired off five shutout innings. The Cincinnati Reds bullpen took care of the rest as the four relievers completed the shutout 3-0 win over the St. Louis Cardinals to open up the 3-game series between the two National League Central clubs.

Final	R	H	E
Cincinnati Reds (71-75)
	3	7	0
St. Louis Cardinals (72-72)	0	8	0
W: Lowder (1-1) L: Pallante (6-8) SV: Pagan (1)

Box Score | Game Thread

Elly De La Cruz drew a 4-pitch walk in the top of the 1st inning. He then proceeded to steal both second and third base, but he was stranded at third base. In the bottom of the inning it was the Cardinals that were threatening after Paul Goldschmidt doubled with two outs. But he would be stranded there when Rhett Lowder struck out Nolan Arenado to end the inning.

The Reds had runners on in each of the next three innings, but they were unable to cash in on those opportunities. None of those opportunities matched the one they had in the top of the 5th when Jonathan India led off with a walk and moved up to second on a single by Elly De La Cruz. Both then moved up a base on a wild pitch. This time they made something of it as TJ Friedl came through with a 1-out, 2-run single that put Cincinnati in the lead. Friedl would then come around to score on a high chopper from Ty France to extend the Reds lead to 3-0.

In the 6th inning the Reds would once again get two runners on, but Elly De La Cruz took back-to-back pitches for called strikes to strikeout. Both pitches – at least according to the pitch tracking – were outside. It led to David Bell coming out to talk with the umpire and shortly after that led to Bell’s ejection from the game. A pop up would end the inning as Cincinnati failed to add to their lead.

After throwing five shutout innings on just 84 pitches, Rhett Lowder was replaced to begin the bottom of the 6th inning in favor of Justin Wilson. He was welcomed with an infield single on a chopper to third base. A 1-out walk would put pressure on, but Wilson locked in and struck out the next two batters to hold onto a 3-run lead.

Tony Santillan took over for Cincinnati in the 7th and needed just eight pitches to get three outs. Brent Suter followed up with a 7-pitch 8th inning as the Reds clung to a 3-0 lead. When the bottom of the 9th began it was Emilio Pagan that took the mound. And he immediately gave up back-to-back singles to start the inning. He then walked Lars Nootbaar to load the bases.

That led to a visit from pitching coach Derek Johnson. After almost hitting Jordan Walker on the first pitch of the at-bat, Pagan struck him out on the three pitches after that. Three pitches later he had also struck out Thomas Saggese for the second out of the inning. Matt Carpenter came off of the bench to pinch hit for Pedro Pages, but just like the two batters before him, he went down on strikes with this one ending the game.

Key Moment of the Game


Emilio Pagan striking out Matt Carpenter to end the game and strand three runners on the bases.

Notes Worth Noting

Rhett Lowder earned his first career win in the big leagues. He didn’t walk a batter for the first time in his career (just his third start). His ERA dropped to 0.59.

Cincinnati’s pitching staff walked just two hitters and had nine strikeouts. The Reds batters walked six times on the night.

Santiago Espinal was the only Red with two hits in the game. Elly De La Cruz had a hit, two walks, two steals, and a run scored.

Two shutouts in a row! When was the last time that happened?

Great job by Lowder and the bullpen!

Oldtimer 09/10/2024

May 5 and 7 (May 6 was off day) in 2021.

ChrisInVenice 09/10/2024

Thank you

greenmtred 09/11/2024

OT, I really enjoy your comments. Interesting facts from the present and past and a great sense for history. Helps keep my love of the game alive.

Oldtimer 09/11/2024

Thank you both. My Reds interest dates back to the 1956 team, which was a jolt of pure oxygen for a Reds fanbase that endured the 1945 to 1955 decade of losing.

Baseball is my favorite sport and always will be.

The Reds turned 1960 into 1961. 1971 into 1972. 1989 into 1990. Despite having very talented players on all of those teams, some did very well and others not so much.

Redsvol 09/10/2024

Awesome job by Lowder and the bullpen. This team can compete in 2025 with some health and a couple moves.

Offense continues to struggle to generate runs. It has to be improved in off season.

Anyone notice the bullpen began to stink when Suter and pagan went on the DL? I’m sure someone will prove me wrong but seems like those 2 are very important to the stability of the pen.

But let’s not win too many games – I still want a top 10 draft pick out of this!

DW 09/11/2024

I’ll agree with Suter, but can’t say the same for Pagan.

jmb 09/11/2024

Can’t rely on Wilson, Diaz, or Cruz.

David 09/11/2024

This guy Lowder….he might be pretty good.

I dunno, maybe the Reds front office and scouts knew what they were doing when they drafted him?

The offense? Pitching wins games. Pitching won last night, and it won tonight. Knock me over with a feather, I thought the Reds would be over for the year when Lodolo, Abbott and Greene all went on the DL.

Reaganspad 09/11/2024

With all those loses, and they are huge, the biggest loss has been McLain followed by a healthy Friedl. Give me those pitchers back healthy and those 2 players for 150 games and we win the division in 2025

SultanofSwaff 09/11/2024

Agree.

redfanorbust 09/11/2024

Agreed but don’t forget CES, Marte and Candelario somehow getting their hitting mojos back and Reds signing a needle moving OF.

jmb 09/11/2024

Pitching, defense, and timely hitting. The old formula still works. Funny how it’s so difficult for teams to get things right…even after a century of knowing the winning formula!

TR 09/11/2024

If the Reds get some key moves from the front office in the offseason, I see them coming together as a consistent, winning team in 2025.

Dewey Roberts 09/11/2024

I think they need two bats for next season. Move Espinal to third. Get McLain back and healthy. Add a dependable backup catcher. Alternate France and Steer at first base. Get right field and left field bats. With the pitching this team could fight for the division. But will the front office do these things?

Andrew Brewer 09/11/2024

What Drama in the 9th. The first three batters reach, and then Pagan gets to strikeout the side… The Reds are on a roll, and I’m lovin’ it !
Yeah, no one would have guessed that Martinez, Aguiar, Junis, Williamson, Lowder. and Company would be able step up and dominate like they have. Is there a lesson to learn here, or have the Reds already learned it ?
The Reds are 71-75 with 16 games left … With a September surge like we’re on, at least we should move up in the Division. It’s good to see the Reds on a winning streak.

Andrew Brewer 09/11/2024

And beating the Cardinals is always special…

jmb 09/11/2024

Yes, the idea that the Dodgers are the team to beat is a throwback to the old NL West days, pre-1990s. I love those days. I’d love to see the Astros go back to the NL and the Brewers go back to the AL. Maybe something like that could happen once the next expansion comes to pass. But, as it is, the Pirates and Cardinals are the teams to beat, the teams the Reds have major running rivalries with.

TR 09/11/2024

Not much Cardinal talk on KMOX last night after the Reds shut them out at home,.

greenmtred 09/11/2024

I know it’s a throwback, jmb, but so am I. I’ve despised the Dodgers since they moved from Brooklyn. Tommy Lasorda used to say that he bled Dodger blue and I, when younger and more given to such thoughts, used think: hey, Tommy, let me help you.

The Duke 09/11/2024

If they stay hot through the end of the year, maybe they could avoid a losing record. Need to go 11-5 the rest of the way. 10-6 gets them to .500.

jmb 09/11/2024

Espinal has the best BA since July 8th, hitting .381 since.

The Duke 09/11/2024

Don’t see how you can’t have Lowder on the opening day roster next year.

2025
Greene
Lodolo
Lowder
Abbott
Aguiar

Petty and Burns could be knocking on the door this time next year as well, which will be needed if Lodolo continually can’t get through a season. The pitching is here, go get a bat to round out this lineup and get McLain back healthy. Probably need to add another bullpen lefty along with Moll for next year as well.

Tampa Red 09/11/2024

Where does Williamson fit in?

JB WV 09/11/2024

I’m not giving up on Ashcraft either, and given the questionable durability of the staff, Burns could enter the equation.

The Duke 09/11/2024

Williamson starting in AAA, injuries will happen, he’ll get his shot.

As for Ashcraft, I move him to the bullpen and see if he can become a high leverage reliever. He’s ended each of the previous two seasons injured. I believe in his stuff though, so you try to find a role where he can give you value.

Burns, Petty, Williamson, maybe a guy like Ryan Cardona, the Reds are going to need 9-12 SP next year, that’s just how baseball is now. Rare is the season where a 5 man rotation makes 30+ starts each anywhere. Even 4 of those guys making 30+ starts is rare.

Mauired 09/11/2024

No way Williamson is in minors unless in rehab. He’s been one of the most productive starters since he’s been promoted and given no reason to be demoted.

Tom noonan 09/11/2024

I was thinking the same thing. Very tough rotation with some depth for 2025!! And what about Martinez? Maybe him instead of Aguiar?

The Duke 09/11/2024

Martinez is 34 years old and probably declines his option for 2025. Not sure on the wisdom of giving a guy in his mid 30’s a 3-4 year deal worth $15+ million a year, and that’s probably what he is looking for. We’re already eating a deal like that for Candelario, we can’t have too many of those like the teams that have double our payroll or more.

Redsvol 09/11/2024

@Duke – normally I would agree with you on starting pitching aging out but Martinez has a relatively “young” arm. He only has 754 major league innings (pitched 4 years in Japan and we know those don’t compare) and he will pitch almost all of 2025 at age 34.

We need 1-2 veteran starters on the team in 2025. Too much risk in counting on the young pitchers to continue to develop. I’d like to see Reds give Martinez another guaranteed year plus the option he needs to pick up to have him pitch next 2 years in Cincy.

Payroll is dirt cheap over next 2 years. We can afford a competent major league veteran pitcher who doesn’t mind going from the pen to starting role and back. In fact, we can afford many of them.

I’m not confident Greene, Lodolo, Ashcraft and Abbott will be healthy next year with how they are finishing.

Planned 2025 starters – Greene, Abbott, Lodolo, Lowder, Free agent
Backup 2025 starters – Martinez, Aguillar, Williamson, Spiers, Junis

We need to overwhelm the division in 2025 with quality starting and relieving depth.

Doug Gray 09/11/2024

What do you mean we know those don’t compare?

Do you believe that Nick Martinez was throwing at 80% because he was in Japan?

Dennis Westrick 09/11/2024

Hope the Reds can retain Martinez and add him to the mix of excellent starting pitchers!

MBS 09/11/2024

I’d have to say there are only 3 locks. Lowder should be a lock, and the Reds don’t seem to play service time manipulation games, but they could.

Spots 4, and 5 are between: Lowder, Williamson, Ashcraft, *Martinez imo.

Aguiar, Petty, Spiers are probably going to be in name competing for a spot, but they really are AAA bound unless something terrible happens.

Old Big Ed 09/11/2024

The Reds get an extra draft pick in the 2026 draft after the first round, if Lowder wins rookie of the year in 2025 and has been on the MLB roster 172 days.

Winning ROY is a longshot for any player not named Bench, but the extra pick does incentivize bringing up promising rookies-to-be in late August, to get them MLB experience.

Mauired 09/11/2024

That’s good point Big E. I think Lowder has as good a shot as anyone to win ROY next year. Probably one of the favorites.

To leverage that into a top pick would be very helpful. Jonny Farmelo was the 1st prospect incentive draft pick two years and is now a top ten prospect in Mariners farm system.

Mauired 09/11/2024

*actually Farmelo was taken in 2023

The Duke 09/11/2024

I think Lowder would be included in a top 5 of most likely RoY odds on picks for 2025. Given there are 15 other teams in the NL, it’s still long odds to count on though.

The good news is they will have a competitive balance A pick in 2025, so they will have an extra pick in the 30-40 range as opposed to the Comp B pick they had this year at 71. Don’t get me wrong, i’m a big fan of the Holman pick, but it also would have been cool to have a shot at someone like Blake Burke, Brody Brecht, Caleb Lomavita (we really need catcher depth), or anyone else they liked 10-15 picks higher than we picked Tyson Lewis.

Mauired 09/11/2024

So Duke I guess you changed your mind about Lowder being promoted?

The Duke 09/11/2024

No, but he’s proven himself and they are adding more time he’d have to be down in the minors in 2025 every day, so roll with the punches and accept the new reality. I still wouldn’t have done it, but no sense trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube.

Mauired 09/11/2024

Ok stick to your guns I guess despite his sparkling sub 1 era. Guess the better move would have been Charlie Leibrant or Justin Wilson in the rotation instead.

Doug Gray 09/11/2024

Hold up now…. I would pay to watch the nearly 68-year-old Charlie Leibrandt pitch for the Reds right now.

Mauired 09/11/2024

Lol

The Duke 09/11/2024

I never said that him pitching now has no value. It’s great he’s doing well in a season where we aren’t making the playoffs. There is value in getting this experience. I just think that value is a lot less than the entire 2031 season worth of pitching.

Mauired 09/11/2024

So he gets to free agency faster by pitching in September

The Duke 09/11/2024

Yes, if he comes up 3 weeks into next season they have player control for an extra year.

Mauired 09/11/2024

Interesting. But as pointed out before if he’s not on the opening day roster I don’t think Reds would be eligible for the prospect incentive pick.

The Duke 09/11/2024

No guarantees he’s the RoY, even if he has an excellent year.

Mauired 09/11/2024

Very true. Buts its a missed opportunity if they go with the conservative route and don’t try. What’s more important a potential top prospect that could be on the team for six years or more. Or one more year of Lowder. Reds have been going the conservative route to nowhere for 30 years! Always living in the past and five steps behind the rest of baseball. When is it time to try something new?

Steven Ross 09/11/2024

Pitching, Defense and timely hitting. What a concept. Team is much better with Marte and Benson out of the lineup. Imagine that! Espinal, IMO, has been our best all around player for the past two months.

Hard to ignore how much better defensively we are with Espinal at 3B and even France at 1B. Congrats to Lowder. Kid looks and acts like he belongs. Love listening to Brantlely tell it like it is in regards to players. Be it good or bad.

Finally, Larry Vanover needs to retire. Gawd awful behind the plate.

redfanorbust 09/11/2024

I don’t know if he needs to retire and don’t know much about the overall quality of his umpiring this year but yes last night ball and strike calls were an adventure to say the least. First time I saw Elly openly complain to an umpire. Bell came out and took the ejection for him. BTW anyone watch the first base ump last night, how me makes close play calls? Added a fun touch of drama.

Dewey Roberts 09/11/2024

Defense is so important. If McLain comes back healthy, the Reds could have a very good defensive infield. France has made some spectacular plays at first. We need some good hitters in right and left fields and this team could begin to do something. I think they should keep Espinal at third base.

The Duke 09/11/2024

At the very least start Marte in AAA in 2025 if/until he gets his mojo back. Espinal is arb eligible next year, so he should be here and he should be starting if he’s the best man for the job.

Same thing with CES. Roll with France to start the year, Candy can play some 1B too, and have CES in AAA to get his feet under him after the long injury layoff. He hasn’t proven anything at the big league level to be assured a roster spot.

Mauired 09/11/2024

Why not send CES to Arizona Fall League to make up for lost time. Maybe even some winter ball too.

The Duke 09/11/2024

Is CES even ready to play in the AFL? I’ve heard nothing about him rehabbing and working towards getting back on the field like we have with McLain (before his set back) or Edwin Arroyo.

Mauired 09/11/2024

Well he was previously stated to come back for playoffs but obviously that’s not happening but for different reasons.

BK 09/11/2024

From the Red’s website:

“Encarnacion-Strand began baseball activities on Sept. 4 and is scheduled for a follow-up exam with his hand surgeon on Sept. 16 to check his progress. He underwent surgery on July 11 to repair ligament damage in his hand. Encarnacion-Strand was diagnosed with a right ulnar styloid fracture on the inside of his hand near his wrist on May 8, and he also has ligament damage in the same area. (Last updated: Sept. 5)”

RedsGettingBetter 09/11/2024

Rhett Lowder first ML career win. He’s tossed 11.1 scoreless in his last 2 outings against good lineups. Outstanding. Hopeful for the near future. We’ll see Chase Burns next year who has been considered even better than Lowder regard stuff and upside. Staying healthy is the key.
Back-to-back shut outs, never made it by the Reds this season and it’s curious that got done during his worst pitching health crisis.
The offense keeps struggling especially in clutch situations. Rosario, Stephensonand Espinal were awful with RISP and less than 2 outs many times in the game.

Old-school 09/11/2024

Good to see top notch starting pitching, good relief work and an offense that gives you professional at bats 1-9.

Also want to point out the contributions of 3 players getting regular at bats 2nd half of 2024 to help push this offense out of its prior doldrums
Fraley is quietly putting together a strong 2nd half. He dealt with his daughter leukemia, then got the bronchitis and lost 10 pounds then took the emergency family leave before the As break.

Fraley since the AS break :

.275/.327/.451/.778

Espinal since the AS break:

.363/.405/.513/.918

France since coming to the Reds:

.311/.358/.475/.833

The productivity coming from these 3 hitters adds to that from JI/EDLC/TS/SS and is giving this offense depth while the starting pitching and bullpen continue to pitch well. Reds are winning games in different ways and scratching out runs and thats good to see. Too little too late but some sorting for 2025.

G-man 09/11/2024

Good stuff…thanks Old-school! Definitely giving us hope for next season!

SultanofSwaff 09/11/2024

A comment by the Brewers announcers recently has stuck with me…..they were describing how Pat Murphy only worries about winning that day. It’s a formula that has worked wonders for a team that had more pitching injuries than the Reds yet still figured out a way to piece the puzzle together, much like the Reds are doing now. I think the certainty a healthy 5 man rotation gives a manager is more of a security blanket but the lack of one shouldn’t be an excuse for playing competitive baseball. That said, of course you need quality fill-ins like Lowder, Aguiar, and Williamson, but I think there’s too much pearl clutching about prospects being ‘ready’ or overworked, especially compared to the immense benefits of these young guys gaining experience at the highest level.

Lowder starting to look like his usual self with the zero walks….got hit a little on pitches left up in the zone, but a solid 84 pitch outing.

The game shouldn’t have been that close–3 times we didn’t get a runner home with less than 2 outs.

MBS 09/11/2024

A player should worry about the play in front of them, the coach should worry about the game in front of them, and the GM should worry about the season in front of them. The owner should worry about the organization’s future. Over simplified, but generally true.

Roger Garrett 09/11/2024

I agree 100% and to the Reds credit this team has made it very simple as to how they play the game.They just play and whatever happens on the bases or at the plate on the mound or in the field well just happens.Sometimes they win and sometimes they lose and thats ok cause if it wasn’t people would lose jobs and players would be let go or benched or sent down.Happens all over in other places but not in Cincy.

Doc 09/11/2024

And two times we did. That’s a 40% success rate for players coming to the plate who have a less than 30% success rate getting hits all season. I’d say they were above average in getting it done.

Mauired 09/11/2024

“Pat Murphy only worries about winning that day”

This is exactly what Reds need. Bell seems to forget this and always be worried about tomorrow. Which is why I think he has a losing record and can’t get the team to the playoffs. He consistently sacrifices and surrenders games because he feels it might hurt the team in the long run. That strategy is the road to nowhere.

Mark Moore 09/11/2024

Wins in St. Louis are always extra sweet no matter what the standings say. Great for Lowder to get his first W. He’s definitely making the case to start 2025 in the rotation.

I heard Greene wants to come back and pitch. I’m not so sure that’s a risk worth taking. He’s too valuable in the long run.

Dennis Westrick 09/11/2024

I agree, Mark! The Reds should not risk using Greene for a couple of meaningless starts and have him healthy for what looks like a promising 2025!

Doc 09/11/2024

What guarantee do you have that he will be healthy starting 2025 just because he doesn’t pitch again in 2024?

redfanorbust 09/11/2024

I agree with Mark, no to Green pitching again this year and agree with you agreeing with Mark. 

Rob 09/11/2024

I am on the other side guys……if the consensus of the medical field is that there is no risk of injury. My basis is that we have got to get these guys built up to throw 175 innings and into September and October. Isn’t that something we want or need for 2025? Gosh, they are no longer youngsters but heading into their fourth year. I believe they are already into their arbitration years. Onboard with no health risks but I think innings prevails over anything else. 4-5 inning starts. Greene is already throwing simulated games and Lodolo has a lousy blister. I must be missing something other than the normal risks that go along with every pitch.

Oldtimer 09/11/2024

Agree. He had a bruise. Nothing else. If the bruise is healed, let him pitch.

The Duke 09/11/2024

If any doubt, sit him out. But if Greene feels great, no sense in not letting him get out there and end the season on a positive, confident note.

Michael B. Green 09/11/2024

Just 1 walk again yesterday. Fantastic!

Michael B. Green 09/11/2024

If Hunter Greene is healthy, pitch him. It’s who he is and what he does. This idea of saving bullets for the next mediocre season is ridiculous.

Old Big Ed 09/11/2024

It seems like the intent is to get Hunter maybe 2 starts at 4-5 innings each. I think the idea is for him to exit the season with his having full confidence that the injury is behind him.

If you recall, that is exactly what the Yankees did with Frankie Montas last season. They gave him a MiLB start and a Yankee appearance in late September.

That is probably the Reds intent for some other guys, too, like Abbott and McLain. It would turn the off-season into just another off-season, with the injuries in the rear-view mirror. Neither may make it that far this season, but it’s worth a chance to try it.

SultanofSwaff 09/11/2024

And btw, what’s the plan for Rece Hinds? With nothing to play for there’s no reason not to play him at DH over Amed Rosario (.480 OPS since being acquired), yet Rosario has DH’d 3 of the last 4 games. Hinds has all of 7 PA the last 2 weeks. More Bell magic.

PTBNL 09/11/2024

Exactly. How we gonna know what he can do if he doesn’t get a chance. He may strike out every plate appearance. However Rosario isn’t tearing it up for the Reds right now and has struck out a ton lately too. What Hinds does in the outfield with his youth, defensive value, speed, smoothness and cannon should allow him more opportunities. When he gets on base, he has high value too with his savvy, instincts and fire. This stint on the bench for the Reds is doing nothing for his development. At least he can run into one and knock it into the Ohio. Can Rosario do that?

Doug Gray 09/11/2024

Can Rosario slug his own body weight? Because Rece Hinds hasn’t been able to do that since the All-Star break.

We’ve got to stop with the “gotta play the prospects” stuff when the prospect(s) in question have shown absolutely nothing to suggest they should be playing. Sometimes you just have to be the warm body/defensive replacement/pinch runner. That’s Hinds right now. That’s Dunn right now.

If they want to play in the big leagues then they need to show that they can hit in Triple-A. They haven’t. And in Hinds’ very specific case, he’s been so bad in the second half that there’s a better argument for sending him to Double-A than giving him starts in the big leagues.

Mauired 09/11/2024

Ok Doug maybe you’re right and Hinds doesn’t deserve big league at bats right now. Then why is he in the big leagues?? Put him in AAA and play him everyday so he can get better. He’s still a 23 year old developing prospect. Don’t morph him into a project and stunt his growth ala Barrero

Doug Gray 09/11/2024

He’s in the big leagues because he’s on the 40-man roster and the team needs to fill out the bench. They’ve used 900 spots on the 60-day IL already, the roster is as thin as possible, so unless you’re going to start DFA’ing some other guys you basically have to have two of someone like Hinds/Dunn/Hurtubise/Wiemer in the big leagues as a bench player. If it’s not Hinds it’s going to be someone else and maybe it won’t be you, but it’ll be someone complaining about how that guy also needs to play every day in the big leagues or in Triple-A and honestly, it’s just not really an option right now for two of these guys.

The Duke 09/11/2024

We have a surplus of AAAA outfielders in Louisville and none of them are separating themselves. None of Dunn, Hinds, Hurtubise, or Weimer have performed lately. Roll with the young pitching going into 2025 and spend what FA money we have on a power hitting corner OF and a LHRP.

Oldtimer 09/11/2024

Case in point to support what Doug said. George Foster. Decent numbers from June 1971 through September 1971. Back-up OF in 1972 sometimes PR or defensive replacement in IF. AAA in 1973. Got better in 1974 as Reds 4th OF. Got MUCH better in 1975 as Reds starting LF.

Doug I’ll take Hirtubise 10 out of 10 times in this situation since he’s destined to be a fifth outfielder anyways.

It certainly seems possible, inasmuch as Hinds is a long way from mastering minor league pitching, that the Reds don’t feel that it helps him at all to be be repeatedly retired by major league pitchers. Rosario has a big-league track record. It also seems possible that decisions relating to player development may not be Bell’s alone. Perhaps Marte’s playing time is another example.

Tom Diesman 09/11/2024

Hopefully he’s taking full advantage of his time on the bench with the big club and soaking in everything he can about pitch recognition and selection so he can go back to AAA next season and show us that he’s mastered that level and ready for an extended trial in the big leagues. Otherwise he won’t even advance far enough to even become the next Aquino or Barrero.

It so happens that I will be in St. Louis to see the game tomorrow (Thursday) afternoon. Probably one of the few Reds’ fans in attendance (I WILL be wearing the Wishbone-C!). Anybody have a guess as to who will be starting on the mound for the Reds?

PTBNL 09/11/2024

My money would be on either Junis or Spiers at this point.

The Duke 09/11/2024

I don’t know how you don’t give it to Junis after his last start. Or take a page out of the Daytona playbook and tandem start Junis and Spiers.

My guess is that it will be somebody we weren’t expecting to start when the season began. And I know I’m right. Bring home a win and have a great time!

TJ 09/11/2024

I’m going today and sitting in a suite (sweet). Hopefully bringing home a winner. Might go tomorrow also if the weather is nice

RedsMonk65 09/11/2024

That’s great. We will be behind home plate (Section 150) — so, not quite as good as a suite. That sounds awesome. By the looks of it, the remnants of Hurricane Francine won’t reach St. Louis Thursday until that evening. Might be overcast, though, for the game. Would be nice to sweep the Cards.

RedsMonk65 09/11/2024

Those all sound like pretty good guesses. We’ll see …

Anthony 09/11/2024

All the roster moves suggested by our brothers in these posts sound great to me too.. BUT…theres one major move that must be made first or the rest wont matter. If that move isnt made the floor is 72ish and the ceiling 82ish im afraid no matter who is added or subtracted

Stan 09/11/2024

Greene,Lodolo,Abbott,Williamson,Lowder your 2025 starting rotation looks good to me.

CincyDo 09/11/2024

Beating Cardinals the next 2 games in itself will bring tremendous joy to Reds fan base, but then jumping them in division ranking as a result of a sweep will make us, probably just me, go out and stuff myself with skyline chili the next 2 days. Go Reds!

Eddiek957 09/11/2024

I agree wholeheartedly with post stating the Reds should play to win. This organization needs to be instilled with a desire to win. If Greene is healthy and as great our pitching has been the last ten games we need a starter. Last week I believe TBD was our probable pitcher four times. The players on our team has got to believe that if they put on a uniform someone’s keeping score and people showed up to watch them they can at least try to win the game
