ST. LOUIS (AP) — Paul Goldschmidt’s double in the eighth inning scored Michael Siani with the tiebreaking run, and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Cincinnati Reds 2-1 on Wednesday night.

Siani led off the eighth with a single and stole second despite the Reds pitching out on the play.

“My job is to get on base,” Siani said. “My role is to create some stuff and set the table for the guys behind me.”

With out one, pinch-hitter Alec Burleson was hit by a pitch. Goldschmidt, who had singled in the first inning, doubled to center off pitcher Buck Farmer (3-1), scoring Siani.

“He threw a slider that fortunately I was able to hit it and probably even more fortunate that he (center fielder TJ Friedl) didn’t catch it,” said Goldschmidt, who is 7 for 12 recently with runners in scoring position. “The game’s not easy. There’s always ups and downs. For the most part this year, I was pretty bad with runners in scoring position.”

JoJo Romero (7-2) got the final two outs in the eighth inning and earned the win. Ryan Helsley needed just eight pitches for a 1-2-3 ninth inning and earned his MLB-leading 44th save in 48 opportunities.

St. Louis starter Lance Lynn tied his career high with seven strikeouts in five innings.

“I love watching him pitch,” St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said. “He’s just a fiery dude, he yells at everything. The way he goes about it just ignites a little fire in everybody.”

The 37-year-old right-hander allowed one run on five hits and one walk.

“Winning and getting whatever hitter’s in the box still drives me,” Lynn said.

With his five-inning outing, Lynn reached 2,000 innings in his career, becoming the sixth active pitcher to reach that plateau. He is the fifth Cardinals pitcher to reach the mark, joining Andy Benes (2002), Bob Gibson (1969), Dazzy Vance (1934), and Adam Wainwright (2021). In his previous start, Lynn passed 2,000 strikeouts for his career.

“I was aware of the innings. I’ve felt every one of them,” Lynn joked. “The 2,000 strikeouts was pretty cool, especially when you do that before.”

Cincinnati starter Brandon Williamson, who has missed much of this season after having surgery for a Bennett lesion on his shoulder, pitched five innings. He allowed one run on three hits and two walks, striking out five.

“I was a little shaky, but I found it,” Williamson said. “I feel pretty good.”

The Reds took a 1-0 lead in the fourth on a two-out single by Santiago Espinal. He drove in Spencer Steer, who led off with a double and stole third.

St. Louis tied it 1-1 in fourth when Nolan Arenado hit his 16th homer, barely clearing the wall in left-center. An official review confirmed the home run call.

“That was a bad pitch,” Williamson said. “He hit a cutter up. He put a good swing on it.”

The homer snapped a 24 inning scoreless streak.

“We didn’t come out on top tonight, but the pitching was there,” Cincinnati manager David Bell said.
