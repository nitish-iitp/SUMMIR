Brandon Williamson Dazzles, but Reds Offense Quieted in 2-1 Loss
 Ashley Davis  09/11/2024 32

 

Brandon Williamson had another outstanding performance in his second start of 2024, but the offense didn’t have the same kind of night as the Cincinnati Reds fell 2-1 to the St. Louis Cardinals to even up this three game series at one win apiece.

Final	R	H	E
Cincinnati Reds (71-76)
	1	5	0
St. Louis Cardinals (73-72)	2	6	0
W: JoJo Romero (7-2) L: Buck Farmer (3-1) SV: Ryan Helsley (44)

Box Score | Game Thread

The Cardinals threatened in each of the first two innings when Brandon Williamson allowed the leadoff hitter to reach base. In the first inning, he walked Masyn Winn. A bad throw by Ty France on a pickoff play and a single by Paul Goldschmidt got Winn to third base, but Williamson got Nolan Arenado to ground into a double play to end the threat.

Meanwhile, the Reds were squandering golden opportunities. Jake Fraley and Noelvi Marte led off the third inning with back-to-back singles, but with runners on first and third with no one out, Lance Lynn struck out Luke Maile, Jonathan India, and Elly De La Cruz in consecutive order. In the fourth inning, Spencer Steer had a leadoff double. Santiago Espinal eventually delivered a base hit with two outs after an 11-pitch at-bat to drive in Steer. Steer had stolen third base for his 25th steal of the season to make it an easy trot home on the bloop single.

Nolan Arenado had an answer for Espinal’s RBI hit when he tied the game with a one-out solo home run in the bottom of the 4th inning. Williamson didn’t let the home run phase him. He allowed just one base runner after the home run and finished his night by retiring the side in the fifth. His final line was three hits and one run over five innings with five strikeouts and just two walks.

The missed opportunities continued for the Reds in the fifth inning. Marte led off the inning with a walk and stole second base, but was held up at third on a Jonathan India bloop single to center. It would prove to be futile as De La Cruz struck out looking and Steer flied out to end the inning.

Fernando Cruz and Brent Suter combined for two innings of shutout baseball in the sixth and seventh innings, but Buck Farmer did not get the same luxury. He allowed a leadoff single to Michael Siani in the eighth, and after a terrible throw by Luke Maile on a pitch out to allow Siani to swipe his 17th base of the season, Farmer put Alec Burleson on base with a hit by pitch with one out. The next batter was Paul Goldschmidt and he absolutely tattooed a baseball to straightaway center field, scoring Siani from second base. TJ Friedl made a valiant effort, but couldn’t come up with catch. David Bell intentionally walked Nolan Arenado and brought in Justin Wilson. Wilson retired both batters he faced, but the damage had been done.

The Reds’ offense went stagnant after the fifth inning, with the last 12 Reds batters being retired in order. Ryan Helsley, the co-leader in saves, finished out the game for the Cardinals to earn his 44th save of the season.

Key Moment of the Game

Paul Goldschmidt’s one-out double to score Michael Siani and put the Cardinals up 2-1 in the bottom of the eighth.

Notes

-With his single in the fifth inning, India snapped his 0-for-20 hitless streak.

-Nolan Arenado’s home run in the fourth inning ended the Reds pitching staff’s 24-inning scoreless streak.

-It was Lance Lynn’s first appearance since July 30 when he allowed one run in five innings against the Texas Rangers. Lynn has more wins against the Reds than any other team. While he didn’t get the win tonight, he did continue his dominance against Cincinnati by allowing only one run on five hits with seven strikeouts in just five innings.

Good to see Williamson out there and pitching well at that.

Andrew Brewer 09/12/2024

Nice re-cap. That the Reds went down in order over the last 4 innings… talk about being choked off. Too bad we lost this one. It should have been ours.

Mauired 09/12/2024

Another Maile start and another Reds loss. What’s new. I know I’m going to get that the team lost and it’s not his fault. Like his typical 0-3 and season .487 ops or that he couldn’t throw a runner out on a pitch out that ended up being the winning run of the game. Oh but he helps the pitching staff is the favorite excuse for his hidden value but the only problem is all the losing doesn’t support it at all. If Reds had just a decent backup catcher they would have won so many more games. 12-30 when he starts. Not his fault. Stephenson is just lucky when he plays and Reds have a winning record. Reds biggest priority in my opinion is to find a productive second catcher that’s not going to tank the record. I know a lot of people want an outfielder or something else. I have hope that the young players will get experience and improve. I have no hope a 34 year old catcher with 1.6 career WAR and .207 career average will ever help this team win games.

SteveAReno 09/12/2024

It would be such a help if he could regain his batting skill and hit for .207 again.

greenmtred 09/12/2024

Maile didn’t hit any better than Elly in this game. Maile’s having a terrible year, certainly, and we all hope that the Reds come up with a more satisfactory back-up catcher for next season. That said, since Brantley and Welch both say that he (Maile) is very helpful to the young pitchers, I accept that. Wins and losses on the days he catches wouldn’t reflect that in any meaningful way: we know he can’t hit, but there is a great deal more than one hitter’s performance that determines the outcome of a game. For that matter, due to streakiness or fatigue, how many risp has Elly stranded this season?

Tom Diesman 09/12/2024

I suppose you are a big supporter of starting Marte (.543 OPS) over Espinal (.703 OPS) at 3B since the Reds are 26-24 when Marte starts and only 38-48 when Espinal starts.

Redsvol 09/12/2024

All I want from these young starters over rest of the year is for them to take the ball every 5 th day and post a minimum of 5 innings. They do that and it will be encouraging for spring training.

mac624 09/12/2024

At least Marte is over the Mendoza line. Bet he can’t wait to put this season behind him.

Anthony 09/12/2024

Folks…weve awaken to what has the “potential” to be a dang good young starting pitching staff for years to come. So long as used correctly and not led to the IL parade. Always liked the crafty lefty Williamson. Has that John Smiley-Tudor vibe from years gone by. Just do 3 things in November and its very close. One of them is acquiring a middle of the order power-rbi bat. We’re close?

Fanman 09/12/2024

Exciting young team. Talented young pitching staff. Stable of young hurlers not seen in recent memory. Power bat needed. Possibly another couple of veterans. Same story though; ownership unwilling to pay enough to add pieces and put this team over the top

Rob 09/12/2024

12-30 kind of speaks for itself. I wonder how his OPS+ compares to other backup catchers. If he is in the bottom tier there, then that seemingly is enough evidence. Imo, the new backup needs to be solid defensively but offensively I think we could live with a 210 BA type guy. Luke is a good guy but has had a terrible year.

greenmtred 09/12/2024

It might kind of, Rob, but to determine the significance, you’d have to do a pretty deep dive: how did the hitters other than Maile do? Who were the Reds playing and how good were they? How was the defense, etc. For the sake of argument and easy math, let’s say that Maile gets one hit every 8th at-bat and a generic back-up catcher gets one every 4, which is probably generous for a back-up catcher. That’s one-half hit a game, I think. It would make a difference sometimes, but not every time–far from it, given how the Reds overall have hit. Add to this that what we’re analyzing is one out of four games. It would be good to have a backup catcher who could hit a bit, no question, but that is, to my mind, pretty far down the list of worries.

Rob 09/12/2024

I agree. It is also a 5 minute type decision that 95% of RLN could make. And you are right about a deeper dive being needed on the Maile starts. But 12-30 is a mighty compelling first data point.

The higher priorities and tougher decisions lie around 1) what valued young talent and prospects do we trade to get the 2025 pieces we need, 2) how big is the additional offensive need, and 3) what is our plan for starting pitching in September and October 2025. Some of these questions go away if management blindly believes we don’t need to trade 2026-2027 prospects for 1-2 big bats and 1-2 durable starting pitchers. As some of our younger players enter the arbitration ($$) cycle this winter, it seems to me that 2025 has to be the year we have the roster to compete for the Division title. Youth has its price as these guys begin to their 4th and 5th years. You don’t have talented fifth year players who are cheap.

Tom Diesman 09/12/2024

Re: “But 12-30 is a mighty compelling first data point.”

It’s only compelling to those who have a weak understanding of baseball stats.

Mauired 09/12/2024

You’re hilarious Tom. You have a weak understanding of common sense. If you put a bad baseball player into the lineup with a negative war and possibly the worst ops in baseball it will in fact contribute to losses. That’s how anything in life works not just baseball. If you have an woefully unproductive worker it doesn’t lead to a successful outcome for the company.

Mauired 09/12/2024

The guy has 3 hits, 0 runs, 0 RBI since the all-star break (not that he was much better pre all-star break) and you can’t accept the fact that he’s the reason Reds are 12-31 when he starts largely (not fully).

Yeah let’s just continue to ignore facts and reality. Reds have a winning record when Stephenson plays not because he contributes offensively but because he’s lucky and the team performs better on days he’s in the lineup and they forget how to play baseball when Maile plays.

Mauired 09/12/2024

Here’s a data point for you. Maile has the worst OPS for any active catcher in MLB with 50 games played.

Alex Jackson was worse but he was designated for assignment and sent to minors like Maile should have been months ago.

MBS 09/12/2024

Williamson is killing it. He hasn’t pitched all year essentially, and has been doing a rehab/spring training at the MLB level.

SultanofSwaff 09/12/2024

For me the key moment(s) of the game were the 3 strikeouts with a runner on third and less than 2 outs….potentially two runs that would’ve made all the difference. Same thing happened the last two games. The Reds have to be better situational hitters and their record in 1 run games reflects that shortcoming. Just to be clear, this is not me advocating for more bunting lol.

Williamson was our most valuable starting pitcher in the 2nd half of 2023, so to me his success is him picking up where he left off. Knock on wood, choosing a starting rotation next year will be a good problem to have. I’m gonna assume Martinez walks, so on paper my depth chart is:
Greene
Abbott
Lodolo
Lowder
Williamson
Aguiar
Petty
Ashcraft (whom I prefer as a reliever)
Burns

Given the injury history of this group, the front office would be wise to spend money again on a Martinez/Pagan type package of innings eaters who could also pitch in middle relief. Heck, just spend money period smh.

Rob 09/12/2024

We do appear to have some pitching depth for 2025. But about 75% of the guys on the list won’t have enough build up to be pitching in September and October. And that applies to minor league innings or major league innings …..they place the same wear and tear on the arm. Bottomline, we will need 1-2 built up, higher durability starters. 35 year old guys who regularly pitch 160+ innings. Maybe you trade1-2 on the list. We don’t need 6-8 25 year old guys who meet their innings limit in August.

Figuring out the pitching is secondary in my mind. We absolutely can not overestimate the offensive talent on the team. 26th in mlb and 13+ games behind the BrewCrew. As many on RLN said in July, this is not a1 bat fix….maybe if it Soto. But generally speaking I think the need is 2 near all star level bats. Keep repeating 13 plus games behind the injury plagued Brewers. Of course the Brewers semi replaced some of their injured with pickups from other teams. Our offensive replacements were generally Louisville guys who unfortunately provided zilch.

SultanofSwaff 09/12/2024

Here’s an idea that might make folks happy and kill 2 birds with 1 stone—fire Bell and make Maile manager!

greenmtred 09/12/2024

If the Reds added some good hitters and managed to avoid most of the injuries, Maile would likely be a very good manager.

old-school 09/12/2024

Some really good late season developments on the Williamson/Lowder front. Both look like credible SP candidates in 2025 and with the lack of durability with Lodolo and lack of consistency from Ashcraft, Reds need that. I think most of us would like to see something worked out with Martinez so he can add depth and consistency as a starter or long outings out of the pen piggybacked with an Opener in 2025.

I looked up Stephenson stats this year expecting to find he doesnt play as much at catcher compared to his peers, but he is actually only 1 of 3 catchers in the NL who qualifies in PA. Only Will Smith and Contreras Brewers have more and only 4 catchers in the NL have 400 PA.

Stephenson is 3 rd in FWAR behind Contreras and Bailey. Hes had a great comeback season. Ive not seen Bailey play much but his defensive WAR numbers look like Johnny Bench. Maile has been pretty much an automatic out as a hitter and many times hasnt been able to put the bat on the ball with a runner at 3b and less than 2 outs as his 35% k rate suggests. Reds have moved on from Barnhart and Casali in the past but backup catchers are back up catchers for a reason. If they were good defensively and were good with pitchers and could hit, they’d be the starter. Bailey’s back up in SF is Casali who is worse than Maile. See what Reds do in the off-season. It appears that the DH will be spoken for in 2025 with Candelario/India/France profiling more as hitters than defenders.

MBS 09/12/2024

I’d like the Reds to sign Jansen as our back up C. He’s having a down year, and was traded to the Red Sox.

2021 105 OPS+
2022 142 OPS+
2023 114 OPS+
2024 86 OPS+

If we got anywhere near 2023 #’s, or even 2021 #’s from him, we’d have a nice 1, 2 combo behind the plate.

I think Candy will soak up the majority of DH opportunities, but I think he’ll spell the 1B, and 3B positions freeing up time for Stephenson to get some extra AB’s. India should remain the 2B, so hopefully he won’t factor into the DH spot.

I don’t really know which stats are most relevant to judge the defensive abilities of a catcher, much less the game calling abilities of the catcher. That’s a rabbit hole I’ve never wanted to go down.

old-school 09/12/2024

@MBS, agree its hard to quantify that. I do remember a few seasons ago Castillo had a wildly disparate ERA with Casali catching ( low) vs Barnhart( high) Maile has been the personal catcher for Abbott mostly and Wade Miley had a personal catcher when he was here as well.(Barnhart I think).

Roger Garrett 09/12/2024

Not sure what big league manager said this but I believe it was the guy in Arizona after a tough loss early in the season.Every thing matters in the game good or bad but it matters.The Reds play a certain way and they do a lot of good things as a team but they also do a lot of not so good things.Problem for me is the not so good things,often the little things and we know what they are just don’t seem to be addressed or worked on.Another winnable game was lost because of the little things and Ashley touched on some of them.I said this early in the year i wasn’t concerned about the pitching and even after so many going down I can still say that.Most will look at this season and point to the injuries as the reason the Reds didn’t make it to the playoffs.Thats fair and there is some truth to it but thats not all of the problem.If the Plan to run at will,swing and swing harder at the plate is still the plan along with moving guys all over the diamond just because they have 2 or 3 different gloves then we will be talking again about the same things in 2025.Great job by Williamson and Friedl just took a bad angle on Goldy’s ball or we may still be playing.Everything matters.

Rob 09/12/2024

Or Mailes bad throw on the pitch out.

Andrew Brewer 09/12/2024

“Everything matters.”

That’s exactly right. Having one guy who doesn’t produce regularly at the plate was how the game once was when the Pitcher batted, and that guy was supposed to be able to bunt. Two things have bothered me the most this season, and that was poor decisions on the base paths, and bad ball and strike calls by the Umpire. A running team is perhaps more prone to outs on the base paths, but we had more than our share. Something has to be done about the umpiring, because balls being called strikes have hurt us repeatedly, and seemingly every game.

AllTheHype 09/12/2024

Reds have enviable starting pitching depth going into ’25. If everyone is healthy going into ’25, potentially at least 7 ML quality starters.

If FO can just tweak the offense this offseason with a couple solid pieces, no reason the Reds can’t compete given the pitching they have and return of McLain.

Rob 09/12/2024

Don’t over estimate the returning talent plus McLain. We are 26th in MLB in hitting and 13+ games behind the Brew Crew who have had their own injuries saga. That is probably more than a couple 260 BA 20 HR guys. I think the need is closer to near all stars with 850-900 OPS. And we have the ammo too to acquire such. The key question is the will and desire to try to win 90+ games. Or continue to believe Friedl, Steer, and India are all going to have bounce back years and hit 275+. No, we need upgrades.

Bill J 09/12/2024

I still like the idea of having a 6 man starting rotation. As far as a new manager we all know that is not going to happen. The small market team is not an excuse, Ohio has 2 MLB teams in small market cities in weak Central divisions one is in first place in their division the other 1/2 game out of last place in their division.

bruuuuuccceee 09/12/2024

14-27 in 1 run games, only better than the lowly White Sox. I’m optimistic that with improved health and better luck, the Reds will be a playoff team in 2025.
