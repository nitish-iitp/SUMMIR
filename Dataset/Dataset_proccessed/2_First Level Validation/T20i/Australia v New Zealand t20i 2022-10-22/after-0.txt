Watch T20 Time Out with Fleming, Moody, and Kumble

9.40pm That's all she wrote for the opening game of the Super 12s. Hope you enjoyed our coverage as much as we did bringing it to you. Until next time, this is Deivarayan Muthu signing off on the behalf of Ashish Pant and Chandan Duorah. Take care and cheers.

"New Zealand last beat Australia in Australia in December 2011. They've finally followed it up, 15 matches later, with a performance that maybe makes it all worth it," as Al Muthu puts it in his report. Finn Allen's opening salvo - 42 off 16 balls - was full of explosive power and immediately put Australia on the back foot. This was why New Zealand picked him ahead of Martin Guptill. Allen's blast allowed Conway to do his thing and anchor the innings. Neesham then stuck at 200 in the end to propel his side to 200.

In the chase, Australia lost their top three in the powerplay and there would be no way back for them. Santner dovetailed beautifully with Sodhi to pin down the middle order.  Top, top effort from the Black Caps to dismiss Australia for 111 in 17.1 overs. Not many gave them a chance to put it past Australia at the SCG, but they have ambushed the defending champs. Count them out at your own peril.

Devon Conway, Player of the Match: Special performance from the boys. Credit has to go to Finn [Allen], he gave the momentum for us. It's pretty special and I've seen him do time and time again. He's a young guy and he's fearless. The way Finn plays complements my game and it was a good surface to bat on. I felt timing the ball would give me the best chance for success. Victory over Australia on any occasion is a big up for us.

Good time to revisit our interview of Conway where he talks about his T20 evolution and methods against spin.

17.1
W
Southee to Cummins, OUT

Conway settles under this skier. Quite fittingly, he helps NZ seal the deal. NZ end their hoodoo in Australia. Possibly another cutter from Southee outside off, on a length. Cummins has a roundhouse swipe at it and can only top-edge it into the big gloves of Conway
