After threatening to get into the semifinals of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 in India, Afghanistan will again be the dark horses for the upcoming T20 World Cup. (More Cricket News)

The Afghans play all their games in the West Indies and with the tracks in the Caribbean expected to be slow, their spinners can become a real menace for opposition sides.

Led by star leg-spinner Rashid Khan, Afghanistan's strength will be their spin department consisting of Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Noor Ahmad, Nangyal Kharoti and veteran Mohammad Nabi alongside the skipper.

Naveen-ul-Haq, Fareed Ahmad and Fazalhaq Farooqi will act as support for their strong spin bowling.

While the bowling looks threatening it is the lack of batting firepower that might hurt the Afghans. A lot will depend on Rahmanullah Gurbaz if the batting has to stand strong.
