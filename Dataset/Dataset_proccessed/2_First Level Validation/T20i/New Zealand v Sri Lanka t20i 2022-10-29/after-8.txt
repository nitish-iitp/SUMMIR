!

Kane Williamson, the captain of New Zealand says that it was an interesting game and the wicket was very different from what he expected. Mentions that the ball stopped in the pitch, coming slower onto the bat and it was not easy at the start of the inning. Claims that Sri Lanka were good at the top after which Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips did well to build a partnership. Admits that it was an incredible inning from Glenn Phillips and any hundred is good but see to him work hard and take the team out of trouble was amazing. Adds that the bowlers came out and did well. Ends by saying that they wanted to be aggressive with the ball but they knew if they keep it simple the pitch will do its job.

!

The Sri Lankan skipper, Dasun Shanaka says that they started really well, especially in the first 10 overs and then goes on to applaud Glenn Phillips for the innings he played. Adds that they didn't bowl well in the second half and gives credit to Tim Southee and Trent Boult for the way they bowled at the start. Mentions that they just lost too many wickets inside the Powerplay and after that, it was always going to be difficult. Ends by saying that they still have a couple of games left and will look to bounce back.

!

Glenn Phillips (104 off 64 balls) is the Player of the Match. He says that the plan with Daryl Mitchell was simple as they were looking to build a partnership whilst being positive and put up a competitive total. Claims that he is there to try and entertain the crowd as much as possible but says that it was a complete team effort. Says that he felt cramps on the field but it was good to be back in the field for a few overs. Claims that he is happy with his progress and gives credit to the bowlers by saying that they were great. Adds that the way they executed the slower balls was wonderful and the wickets upfront always help. Ends by saying that they bowled well and they caught well and he is happy with the win.

The Presentation ceremony...

!

Earlier in the game, Kane Williamson won the toss and opted to bat first but New Zealand weren't able to get a fast start. Not only that but they were 15/3 inside the Powerplay before Glenn Phillips and Daryl Mitchell stitched together a wonderful 84-run stand. Mitchell played second fiddle as Phillips kept on peppering the Lankan bowlers with some eye-catching shots. Phillips did go on to make a brilliant century and the Kiwis were able to get beyond the 165-run mark as well. For Sri Lanka, Kasun Rajitha was the standout performer with the ball and their two frontline spinners proved effective as well. In reply, Sri Lanka just couldn't get out of second gear and the Kiwi pacers made sure that they picked up early wickets as well. All in all, it was a dominant display by New Zealand and Sri Lanka never really stood a chance having lost those early wickets.

!

Sri Lanka have had a long World Cup and have been unfortunate with injuries to a few key players but they will be disappointed with their performance in this game. First, they let go of their advantage when they were bowling and then with a big target to chase down, they lost way too many wickets inside the Powerplay. The top order failed miserably and only Bhanuka Rajapaksa and Dasun Shanaka could get muster-up runs for them in the middle order. With just a couple of games left for Sri Lanka to play in the Super 12 stage, they will hope that the rain stays away and their performance improves as well.

!

New Zealand had the momentum going into the interval and they made good use of it once the players were back out in the middle. Tim Southee picked up a wicket in the very first over without giving away any runs as well. Trent Boult then sent back a couple of more Lankan batters in the next over which got the game firmly in New Zealand's control. After that, the Kiwis kept on attacking and picked up wickets at regular intervals. Every bowler used picked up a wicket with Boult standing out with a four-fer as both spinners ended up with a couple of wickets each. The Kiwis are looking like the team to beat in this group for sure.

!

A clinical display with the ball and in the field from New Zealand and with this win, they remain unbeaten and build a lead at the top of the Group 1 points table. Sri Lanka's inconsistent showing continues and they will have to win both their remaining games in order to have a good chance of making the playoffs.

ISH SODHI TO LAHIRU KUMARA

OUT! STUMPED! That completes a comprehensive win for New Zealand! Ish Sodhi flights a googly full and outside the off stump, Lahiru Kumara charges down the wicket and looks to heave the ball to the leg side. He is unable to connect as the ball beats his outside edge and Devon Conway makes no mistake in collecting the ball before whipping the bails off. New Zealand have now won their second game and cement their position at the top of the table.
