Yadav's quick 50 sets up India for comfortable win

Suryakumar Yadav cracked a 28-ball 53 to set India up for a convincing 47-run win over Afghanistan in their opening Super Eights match at the T20 World Cup.

Yadav hit five fours and three sixes and shared in a crucial fifth-wicket partnership of 60 with Hardik Pandya as India posted 181 for eight at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados. Afghanistan’s reply never recovered from the loss of three wickets inside the first five overs and they ultimately fell well short, bowled out for 134, as the impressive Jasprit Bumrah claimed three for seven.

India had made a sluggish start with Rashid Khan (three for 26) instrumental as they slipped to 90 for four. Rishabh Pant (20) and Virat Kohli (24) were among the leg-spinner’s victims after Fazalhaq Farooqi (three for 33) had claimed the early scalp of captain Rohit Sharma. The situation changed as Yadav and Pandya (32 from 24 balls) came together before Axar Patel’s quick 12 further bolstered the total.

Afghanistan struggled in response, particularly against Bumrah, and were always struggling after being reduced to 23 for three.Azmatullah Omarzai hit a battling 26 and Najibullah Zadran scored 19, but the outcome was determined long before the finish as Arshdeep Singh (two for 34) and Kuldeep Yadav (two for 32) also shone.

A win without breaking sweat for India, but bad news for Afghanistan who take a dodgy run-rate with them into games against Bangaldesh and Australia.

The television switches to the Roses T20 game, but I can tell you that Suryakumar Yadav is the player of the match for his eye-popping fifty, though Bumrah must have run him close with three for seven.

WICKET! Noor c Rohit b Arshdeep 12 (Afghanistan 134 all out) India beat Afghanistan by 47 runs!

20th over: Afghanistan 134-10 ( Fazalhaq 4) A succession of swings, a succession of misses, until at last Noor makes contact, swinging Arshdeep over deep square leg for six. The final ball lasts for three deliveries as Arshdeep sends down two successive wides, and Noor is caught off the final ball of the match, going down flaying.

14th over: Afghanistan 91-5 ( Najibullah 13, Nabi 6) Jadeja, making a thick headband cool. Afghanistan ticking along, but falling behind.

I have learnt so many things doing the OBO – over to Sandip. “A swipe would be when you use a digital keyboard, such as those available on tablets or mobiles. I found out from my niece that it is using one finger, as compared to the usual two thumb technique. For instance, your name is a two triangle trace. ‘Tanya using swipe’ however turned out to be Tanya using swoop. o well.

“No matter which technique, you and your colleagues bring the whole world together!

8th over: Afghanistan 47-3 ( Gulbadin 10, Omarzai 14) Intrigue as the third umpire has to rule on whether the towel tucked into the back of Kuldeep’s trousers has kissed the boundary boards. Many slow mos but he seems to be ok.

“Halloa Tanya,” Hey there Sandip.

“Greetings from Stumptown, also known as Po[r]tland, in Oregon, in the PNW, where we are sitting on the Riverfront, and where it is slowly hotting up! The way it is happening, it will be 30C in a few hours.

“We, here are me, and mum! She is following the ball-bat action and me the bigger round ball action. She has already figured out, Sky Sports will show adverts after even number, Willow instead puts those nuisances after every over. Willow had all the desi foodie stuff, so we will be heading to the Indi-store to get some atta for ‘fulkas’ - the puffed rotis!

“Enjoy your time tickling the keyboard, or do you use swipes, or voice activated tech?”

Just bog standard typing I’m afraid. But I’m intrigued. What, I wonder, is a swipe?

3rd over: Afghanistan 23-1 ( Zazai 2, Ibrahim 8) Arshdeep with his second. Ibrahim slashes four then Kohli – Kohli! – somehow mis-times his leap at point and fluffs a pretty ordinary catch. He waves his hands about to ask how that happened. No -one gives him a rocket. A handful of singles

There is someone out there! Hello Adam Roberts
“Good Morning Tanya, Good Morning Everyone -

“May I start by commending you for a sterling effort following on from last night’s game in St. Lucia. [oh, thank you!]

“I, sadly, am missing this as I sit at my desk in The Cayman Islands, but it sounds like an excellent effort so far by Afghanistan. I have loved watching them so far and - as a Notts fan - thrilled that Fazalhaq Farooqi may offer some late-season solace.”

1st over: Afghanistan 13-0 (Gurbaz 11, Zazai 0) Arshdeep starts with a wide, and Gurbaz – third in the runs table this World Cup - pancakes the next straight down the ground for four. Arshdeep, struggling with his width , sends down another wide but a beauty has Gurbaz groping. Not for long though – he charges down the next, smoking it over wide long on for six. A natty start.
