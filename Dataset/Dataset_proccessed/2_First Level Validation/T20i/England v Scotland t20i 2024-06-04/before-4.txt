ENG vs SCO Dream11 Prediction: Venue and Pitch Report

Since it’s a day game, the track might slightly be on the slower side. Since 2023, the pacers have snared 65.62% of wickets, but spinners will also have a role to play. They will operate in the middle overs. The team winning the toss might elect to field first, with a total of around 165 being a fighting one.

Weather Report

A temperature of around 29°C, with thunderstorms, is forecast.

ENG vs SCO Dream11 Prediction: Probable Playing XIs

England: Phil Salt, Jos Buttler (c & wk), Will Jacks, Jonny Bairstow, Harry Brook, Moeen Ali, Liam Livingstone, Adil Rashid, Chris Jordan, Jofra Archer, Mark Wood.

Scotland: George Munsey, Ollie Hairs, Michael Jones, Richie Berrington (c), Matthew Cross (wk), Michael Leask, Chris Greaves, Mark Watt, Christopher Sole, Safyaan Sharif, Bradley Currie.

ENG vs SCO Dream11 Prediction: Top Captaincy Picks

Phil Salt: Phil Salt is a popular captaincy option for this game. Salt will open the innings and is in great form. He can score big.

Jos Buttler: Jos Buttler is the most popular captaincy option for this game. Buttler will open the innings and is known to play long innings. His wicketkeeping will also fetch a few points.

Will Jacks: Will Jacks will contribute with both bat and ball. Jacks will bat in the top order and will bowl at least a couple of overs. His bowling value will increase in Barbados.

ENG vs SCO Dream11 Prediction: Top Differential Picks

Chris Jordan: Chris Jordan has been selected by less than 18% of users as of now. Jordan will bowl in different phases, increasing his probability of taking wickets. He can make several inroads against a slightly weaker batting unit.

Mark Watt: Mark Watt’s selection % currently stands at 27.08. Watt is accurate with his lines and lengths, and England batters have struggled against left-arm orthodox previously. He can snare a few wickets.

ENG vs SCO Dream11 Prediction: Players to Avoid

Michael Jones: Michael Jones might not be as effective and can be avoided for this game.

ENG vs SCO Dream11 Prediction: Mega League Base Team

If ENG bat first:

Complete the team with three among Jonny Bairstow, Matthew Cross, Christopher Sole, Safyaan Sharif, and Mark Wood.

If SCO bat first:
