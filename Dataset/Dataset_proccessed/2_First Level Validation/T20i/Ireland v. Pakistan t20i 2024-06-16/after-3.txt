Team morale at ‘rock bottom’ as Pakistan face Ireland in their last T20 Cricket WC match today
By
News Desk

Pakistan and Ireland, both out of the T20 World Cup 2024, will face each other today in Florida, aiming to end their campaigns with a win.

Pakistan’s team morale is low after their poor performance. The players skipped practice on Saturday. The match’s outcome may depend on whether they can finish on a high note or if the weather will impact the game again.

An official confirmed that the team’s morale has hit ‘rock bottom’, with members reflecting on their flaws and missed opportunities during a combined dinner.

Pakistan has only won against Canada, losing their opening two matches to the US and India. Ireland, winless in all three encounters, had their third match against the US washed out.

Pakistan’s first match ended in a super over defeat to the US, failing to defend a target of 160. They restricted India to 119 runs but were seven runs short of the target. Against Canada, Pakistan won by stretching the match to 17.3 overs.

Ireland has not secured a win. In their opening match against India, they set a target of 97 runs, which India chased comfortably. They lost to Canada by 13 runs, and their match against the US was postponed due to rain.

Today’s match will not affect the final standings, as India and the US have already advanced.

A full match would help the reserves gain experience.

Pitch Condition:

The Central Broward Park & Broward County Stadium pitch is batting-friendly, but current weather conditions may make it slow, favoring pacers over spinners.

Weather:

Rain in Lauderhill affected the venue, with the India-Canada match abandoned. The outfield remains wet, and the match conditions for today are uncertain.
