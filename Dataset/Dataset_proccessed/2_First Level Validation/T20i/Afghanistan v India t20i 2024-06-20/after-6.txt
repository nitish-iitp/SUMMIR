Four big takeaways from India’s win over Afghanistan
India opened their Super Eights account with an excellent 47-run over Afghanistan in Barbados on Thursday.

AFGHANISTAN v INDIA: MATCH CENTRE AND SCORECARD

Having set Afghanistan 182 to win in Bridgetown, India’s bowlers did a fine job to completely control the chase, with the game being long-won well before the final delivery.

We take a look at some of the big takeaways from India’s outing at the Kensington Oval:

SKY's the limit for Suryakumar Yadav

Suryakumar's second successive half-century of the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 came at a strike rate of almost 190 - clearly impressive stuff, coming in at the end of the seventh over, and it was intriguing to hear him say afterwards: "I enjoy batting in that phase, between overs seven to 15, that's where teams try and control the game."

SKY most certainly did that for India, and his courage and concentration combined to create a powerful and impactful innings that bodes well as India look to go deeper in this tournament.

India’s middle order get much-needed time

India’s progress to the Super Eight stage was impressive, but the low-scoring matches in New York did not give their batters, particularly a stacked middle order, much of an opportunity to settle into the tournament in the manner they’d have liked.

But this game offered just that opportunity, particularly after Rohit Sharma (8 from 13) and Virat Kohli (24 from 24) struggled to provide a fast start at the top of the order.

SKY’s Player of the Match knock was clearly the standout, but it will be encouraging for the Indian selectors that every batter from three to eight was able to score at a decent strike rate, all making at least some sort of positive contribution.

Hardik Pandya’s 32 from 24 was particularly important, helping rebuild the innings while also showing the ability to clear the ropes that he’ll likely need as the designated No.6.

A score of 181/8 might not always be enough in this tournament, but India’s middle-order have now had the chance to get time out in the middle and will hope to kick on to bigger scores down the line.

The brilliance of Bumrah

The ever-reliable, ever-impressive Jasprit Bumrah put in another stellar display, taking 3/7 to stunt any chance Afghanistan had of closing in on the target.

He had picked up Player of the Match awards against Ireland and Pakistan - and must have been second on the list to get that recognition again.

Knowing that they can call on a brilliant bowler in prime wicket-taking form to turn the game in their favour is a mighty card that India hold in their pocket.

Rashid Khan remains reliably world-class

The quality of Rashid Khan is no secret, but his performance against India is a reminder that he is one of, if not the, best spinner in men’s T20 cricket.

He was outstanding in this game, helping tie India down and removing two of the big-name top three in Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant.

Shivam Dube was brought into the India side to target spin, but he also fell to the Afghan leggie, who gave his team a genuine chance of putting the world’s top-ranked team under sustained pressure.

His figures of 3/26 from four overs were comfortably the most economical of any of the six Afghanistan bowlers used, and those numbers don’t quite do justice to the control he had for periods during the middle overs of India’s innings.

He will have his sights set on Australia and Bangladesh now, and could well have a big impact on the outcome of Group 1.
