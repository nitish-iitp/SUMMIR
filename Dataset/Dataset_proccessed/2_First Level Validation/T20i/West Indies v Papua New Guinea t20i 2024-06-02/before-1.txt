Match Details – WI vs PNG:

Match: West Indies vs Papua New Guinea, ICC T20 World Cup, 2nd Match, T20 World Cup 2024

Date and Time: June 2,  02:30 pm GMT / 08:00 pm IST / 10:30 am local time

Venue: Providence Stadium, Guyana

WI vs PNG Betting Tips & Match Prediction:
Who will win the toss? – Papua New Guinea
Who will win the match? – West Indies
WI vs PNG Preview:

The West Indies will enter the T20 World Cup 2024 as one of the top contenders for the title. The hosts have been in excellent form leading up to the tournament, coming off an impressive series win against South Africa and a victory over Australia in a warm-up match.

While most teams require a collective effort to succeed in a major tournament, the West Indies have the luxury of relying on their individual brilliance. With immense power in their lineup, a strong performance from just two or three players can be enough to overcome even the toughest opponents. They likely possess the best batting lineup in the tournament.

For Papua New Guinea (PNG), defeating the West Indies will require an extraordinary effort. While upsets in T20 cricket are not uncommon, PNG appears to lack the quality necessary to challenge this formidable West Indies team, even if they play their best cricket.

WI vs PNG Possible Playing XI:

West Indies: Rovman Powell (c), Brandon King, Johnson Charles, Shai Hope, Shimron Hetmyer, Nicholas Pooran, Andre Russell, Jason Holder, Akeal Hosein, Gudakesh Motie, Shamar Joseph.

PNG: Assad Vala (c), Lega Siaka, Tony Ura, Charles Amini, Norman Vanua, Sese Bau, Kiplin Doriga (wk), Hiri Hiri, Kabua Morea, Alei Nao, Chad Soper.

WI vs PNG Dream11 Fantasy Tips:

Captain: Andre Russell

Vice-Captain: Brandon King

Nicholas Pooran, Rovman Powell, Lega Siaka, Roston Chase, Assad Vala, Charles Amini, Alzarri Joseph, Gudakesh Motie, John Kariko.

WI vs PNG Toss Prediction:

Both teams are likely to prefer chasing in this game. The weather in Guyana has been wet recently, with potential rain interruptions expected. With the possibility of the Duckworth-Lewis method coming into play, captains will likely opt to chase to better manage any weather-related adjustments to the target.

WI vs PNG Pitch Report:

The wicket at Providence Stadium in Guyana is expected to be conducive to good cricket. Both pacers and spinners will find some assistance from the pitch, while batters can score quickly once set, thanks to the fast outfield and short boundaries.

WI vs PNG Weather Report:

The weather forecast for the match day is not very promising, with a 70 percent chance of rain. Humidity levels are expected to be around 80 percent, and the wind speed will be approximately 15 km/h.
