WI captain Rovman Powell won the toss and chose to bowl vs Papua New Guinea

Sese Bau etched his name into Papua New Guinea cricket history by becoming the second batter from his country to score a fifty in the T20 World Cup match against the West Indies on Sunday. The left-handed batter's impressive knock follows in the footsteps of team captain Assad Vala, who achieved a similar milestone against Oman in the 2021 edition of the tournament. Bau's innings was marked by fluency and aggression against a formidable West Indian bowling attack. The 31-year-old showcased his skill by hitting six fours and a six, culminating in his fourth T20I fifty. A particularly memorable moment came when Bau dispatched three of those boundaries off Gudakesh Motie in a single over, underlining his dominance and timing.

WI vs PNG Live Score

PNG, making their second T20 World Cup appearance, faced an uphill battle from the outset. After winning the toss and opting to bat, PNG's innings started on a shaky note. They found themselves in deep trouble at 50 for four, thanks to an incisive bowling attack led by the West Indies' pace and spin combination.

Romario Shepherd initiated the damage early, claiming the wicket of Tony Ura in the second over. Ura, trying to navigate Shepherd's pace, edged the ball to the wicketkeeper, giving West Indies their first breakthrough. Spinner Akeal Hosein capitalized on the momentum, dismissing number three batsman Lega Siaka with a well-executed arm ball that broke through his defenses.

The pressure continued to mount on PNG when Alzarri Joseph struck, sending their skipper Assad Vala back to the pavilion. Vala, who scored 21 off 22 balls, offered a brief respite with a striking six over extra cover off Roston Chase, but his resistance was cut short by a sharp catch at backward point by Chase himself.

In the midst of the early collapses, Sese Bau emerged as the linchpin of PNG's innings. Bau's 50 off 43 balls was a masterclass in resilience and tactical shot-making, helping stabilize the innings. His 44-run partnership with Charles Amini (12) proved crucial in averting a complete collapse. Bau adeptly rotated the strike and found occasional boundaries, ensuring the scoreboard kept ticking.

However, once Bau fell, PNG struggled to accelerate, managing to inch closer to a defendable total. The West Indies bowlers, particularly their spinners, exploited the pitch conditions effectively. Hosein's early success was complemented by Fabian Allen and Roston Chase, who maintained tight lines and restricted the run flow during the middle overs.
