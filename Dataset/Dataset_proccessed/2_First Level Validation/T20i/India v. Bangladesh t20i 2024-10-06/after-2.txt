India Today News Desk
Gwalior,UPDATED: Oct 6, 2024 22:24 IST
India (IND) vs Bangladesh (BAN) 1st T20I Highlights: India beat Bangladesh by seven wickets in Gwalior to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. Hardik Pandya scored an unbeaten 39 while Varun Chakravarthy accounted for three scalps.
Sanju Samson
22:24 IST:
Right then, that is it from this game where India takes a 1-0 lead and will be looking to wrap up the series in the next game while Bangladesh will be hoping to level it. The 2nd T20I will be played on 9th October, Wednesday in New Delhi at the iconic Arun Jaitley Stadium. It will start at 1.30 pm GMT, but as you know, you can always join us early for all the build-up to the match. Until then, cheers and goodbye!
22:24 IST:
Arshdeep Singh is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his brilliant bowling spell. He says that there was a breeze going around from the end he was bowling. Adds that he did not get the wicket the way he wanted but was happy with it anyway. Mentions that he makes minor changes like with his wrists or fingers to bring in the variations. Says that the young bowlers have done well especially Mayank Yadav who had a good debut. Ends by saying that, this format is all about adapting to situations, conditions, and ground dimensions.
22:21 IST:
Suryakumar Yadav, the victorious skipper of India says they just tried to back their skills and tried to walk the talk. Mentions it was great how the guys showed character and selflessness. On being asked about the two debutants, Mayank and Nitish, he appreciates them and says they are interesting players and is looking forward to watching them do well in future games. On being asked about so many players to choose from, he jokingly says it is a good headache to have many options at your disposal when you are on the field. Concludes by saying there's always room to learn and improve in every game.
22:17 IST:
Najmul Hossain Shanto, the captain of Bangladesh says that they did not start well. Adds that in T20s it is important to play well in the Powerplay but they didn't. Mentions that the plan was to bat positively but they also need to adjust according to the situation. Tells that they need to focus on strike rotation and not only on hitting boundaries. Says that they scored 95-odd runs in 14 overs but lost too many wickets. Ends by saying that it is difficult for the bowlers to defend such a low score on a wicket like this, but still Rishad Hossain bowled well and Fizz delivered a couple of decent overs.

Presentation Time...
22:12 IST:
Varun Chakaravarthy is up for a quick chat. He says it feels like a rebirth for him to be back in the blues after 3 long years.  Adds he just wanted to stick to the process, and that's what he tried to do in the Indian T20 League earlier this year. Adds he doesn't want to think and express too much. Mentions he played a few leagues and got to learn a lot in the TNPL alongside Ravichandran Ashwin, and it was a good preparation for him for this series. Says once you're not in the Indian team, people write you and you just need to keep doing the job sincerely.
22:30 IST:
Earlier in the game, Bangladesh posted a below-par total with only Najmul Hossain Shanto and Mehidy Hasan crossing the 20-run mark. Arshdeep Singh and Varun Chakaravarthy were the pick of the bowlers for India with three wickets each while debutant, Mayank Yadav also performed well and got one. Hardik Pandya and Washington Sundar also chipped in with one each as well. It was a real all-round performance from the World T20 champions and the batters also made the chase look like a cakewalk.
22:07 IST:
Not much to talk about the bowling of Bangladesh and it was not helped by the fact that their batters did not show up for this game. They were put under pressure early on from the Indian openers and never seemed to recover from that. Mehidy Hasan and Mustafizur Rahman were the ones with a wicket to their name while the other one was a run out. However, there were a few positives, mainly the spinners. Rishad Hossain did not get a wicket but bowled really well and Shoriful Islam was also economical in his two overs and this is something they can build on in the upcoming games.
22:03 IST:
The target for India was not a big one, but the way they executed the chase was excellent. The positive intent was visible right from the start when the two openers took on the attack. Abhishek Sharma fell to an unfortunate run out but not before playing a fiery cameo. It was actually selfless batting from all the players and no one was going for personal milestone. Sanju Samson failed to convert his start again but showed his class in his knock of 29 off 19. SKY was exceptional and displayed a show of brilliant whips and flicks which also ultimately proved to be his downfall. With not much required to chase, Hardik Pandya and Nitish Kumar Reddy joined hands and made sure to finish the job. Reddy was the second fiddle while Pandya stayed unbeaten on 39 off just 16 balls finishing things off with little more than 8 overs to spare.
21:56 IST:
DOMINANCE FROM INDIA! The first T20I in this new stadium in Gwalior and the Men in Blue were simply brilliant with both bat and bowl providing an incredible experience for the packed crowd. The hosts take the early lead in the series with Bangladesh having their task cut out now.
21:54 IST:
11.5: Taskin Ahmed to Hardik Pandya, SIX! HARDIK PANDYA FINISHES OFF IN STYLE FOR INDIA! Banged in short and on the top of the stumps, Hardik Pandya stands tall, backs away, swings hard, and slaps the pull rows behind the deep mid-wicket fence for a huge six. Hardik kills the game with 49 balls remaining and 7 wickets in hand.
21:53 IST:
11.4: Taskin Ahmed to Hardik Pandya, FOUR! The ball's gone and so has the bat! Hard length outside off. Hardik cuts it hard and loses the grip of the bat. However, he connects it off the middle and the ball goes racing away to the deep backward point fence for a boundary while the bat flies to the square leg region. It's all happening here!
21:52 IST:
11.3: Taskin Ahmed to Hardik Pandya, FOUR! Easy peasy! Into the single figures now! Short and on off, Hardik Pandya arches back, ramps it over the keeper's head for a boundary. He doesn't even look at the ball as it dribbles away into the fence. Quite a raw expression from Pandya.
21:51 IST:
11.2: Taskin Ahmed to Nitish Kumar Reddy, Much fuller, on middle, Nitish Kumar Reddy flicks it with his wrists to deep square leg for another single.
21:51 IST:
11.1: Taskin Ahmed to Hardik Pandya, Taskin comes back into the attack, bowls a toe-crushing yorker on the pads, and bends Hardik Pandya who tries to flick it away. It goes off Pandya's boot to short fine for a leg bye.

Rishad Hossain drags his length, keeps it on off, Hardik Pandya gets a good bounce on his waist height, rocks back by using the depth of the crease and slashes it hard and over covers with a short-arm jab for a six. That was hit with brute force by Hardik.
21:47 IST:
10.3: Rishad Hossain to Hardik Pandya, Rishad hurries Hardik on this length ball, that skids through the surface. Hardik Pandya goes for a cut shot but gets a thick outside edge and Mehidy Hasan doesn't collect the ball properly. It lands just near him.

10.1: Rishad Hossain to Nitish Kumar Reddy, Slow through the air, nice and full, outside off, Nitish Kumar Reddy pushes it to covers and steals a single. A wayward throw comes to the left of the keeper and Das couldn't collect it properly. The ball deflects off his gloves and rolls to the short fine but there is a backup to prevent any other run.

Full and just outside off, Hardik Pandya knows the fielders are inside the ring and just lofts it over covers and mid off for a boundary. India need 22 more to win in 60 balls.
21:45 IST:
Drinks! There seemed to be some issue with Hardik Pandya and the umpires have decided to call for drinks. India are absolutely cruising along in the chase and the question is how quickly can they get the job done. The intent have been clear from every batter and it is to attack no matter what. Bangladesh have tried their best but defending such a score against this India side was never going to be easy.

7.5: Mehidy Hasan to Sanju Samson, OUT! IN THE AIR AND TAKEN! Mehidy Hasan strikes in his very first over and India are 3 down now. Mehidy Hasan bowls it full and flat and keeps the line of attack on the middle and leg stump. Sanju Samson clears his front foot to get some width and goes through the hoick across the line, but it is too close to the body and gets no power and timing at all. Goes off the inner half of the bat and straight towards Rishad Hossain at deep mid-wicket. Sanju Samson straightaway knew that he was in trouble after the point of contact. He departs for a decent 29 off 19!

... THE RUN CHASE ...
20:49 IST:
Well then, the first inning has flown by in this series opener. India has a target within reach to chase and will aim to mirror their bowling performance with the bat as well. Bangladesh on the other hand, will be required to bring their A-game with the ball. They do pose a threatening pace attack and would like them to contribute effectively. An exciting run chase up next in just a few minutes. Stay tuned.
20:51 IST:
Since the ball did some mischief too, Varun Chakravarthy came in handy and chipped in with a three-wicket haul to his name as well. India didn't let the opposition off the hook in the mid-overs, with identical bowling in the death as well, conceding only 16 runs and taking 3 wickets in the last 4. In the end, Hardik and Arshdeep did the cleaning of the tail effectively, eventually bowling them out in 19.5 overs.
20:46 IST:
India, on the other hand, began right on the money with Arshdeep setting the foundation in the very first over with a wicket. The new ball moved and got a bit of a variable bounce which helped the seamers to tie the batters up. It was Mayank Yadav though, who created impact straightaway in his debut match. First, delivered a maiden and then snagged his first T20I wicket, adding more trouble to the opposition.
20:46 IST:
Throughout, Bangladesh looked in a bit of hurry from the word go to accelerate and put the hosts under pressure, but it proved to be a two-faced sword for them. They needed a strong partnership after that initial collapse. But in contrast, they kept losing wickets and slipped down to 111/7 at the end of the 16th over. With an aim to ascend in the death overs, and Mehidy Hasan settled in well by then, he too, was left stranded at one end. As a result, Bangladesh, under steeping pressure, couldn't get the required momentum. Mehidy Hasan though, played well for his unbeaten 35.
20:45 IST:
Bangladesh started in a bit of a rusty fashion and lost their openers inside the restrictions. The batters tried to adapt to the pitch and tried to take the attack on right away. Hence, they could only mount 39/2 on the board in the Powerplay. In a desperate need to construct partnerships, Najmul Hossain Shanto attempted to launch a counter-offensive. He was the only one who looked settled but searched for partners at the other end.
20:44 IST:
A comprehensive bowling display by the Men in Blue through and through! They have reduced Bangladesh to just above a run-a-ball in this first T20I. To be fair, the tourists just couldn't get going in the innings and only Najmul Hossain Shanto along with Mehidy Hasan could cross the 20-run mark. 
20:41 IST:
19.5: Arshdeep Singh to Mustafizur Rahman, OUT! CASTLED! Arshdeep Singh wraps things up here with his third wicket! He bowls another excellent yorker, on middle, Mustafizur Rahman stays back in his crease and swings wildly but gets beaten all ends up. The ball goes through to disturb the furniture behind. Bangladesh have been bowled out for 127 runs!

19.4: Arshdeep Singh to Mehidy Hasan, Arshdeep Singh bangs this short, on middle, angling into the body of the batter, Mehidy Hasan goes for the pull but gets hurried. It takes the top edge and lands well before third man. They cross.

Halt! Mustafizur Rahman got the previous ball off the toe end of the bat and it took a very bad hit. He asks for a bat change. A friendly chat between Hardik Pandya and him as the former checks up the bat. The reserve player from the Bangladesh dugout comes out with another bat, hands it to him and Fizz is good to continue.
