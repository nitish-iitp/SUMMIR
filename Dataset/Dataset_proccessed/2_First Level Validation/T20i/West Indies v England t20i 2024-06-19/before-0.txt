The second round of the 2024 T20 World Cup starts on June 19 in the Caribbean islands. Here is all you need to know about the schedule for defending champions England at the 2024 T20 World Cup Super Eights, including full fixtures, match timings, and venues.

After over two weeks of mouthwatering contests in the 2024 T20 World Cup, the top eight sides are through to the next round.


The teams have carried their seedings from the group stage and have been placed into two groups. Defending Champions England are slotted in Group Two alongside England, West Indies and South Africa. Here is how the groups are divided:

Group 1: India, Australia, Afghanistan and Bangladesh
Group 2: USA, England, West Indies, South Africa

In a fair assessment of England’s campaign so far, the current titleholders were not at their optimum best in the group stage. A washout against Scotland, followed by a 36-run defeat to arch rivals Australia, pushed them to the brink of group-stage elimination. Against Oman, they gunned down 50 off in a record 3.1 overs to turbocharge their net run rate.

They went to the final group-stage match needing to win against Namibia to stay in the hunt for the second Super Eights slot. Persistent rain almost spoiled their party but in the end, they won 41 runs via the DLS method in a match reduced to 10 overs a side. Scotland's defeat against Australia cemented their place by the barest of margins.
