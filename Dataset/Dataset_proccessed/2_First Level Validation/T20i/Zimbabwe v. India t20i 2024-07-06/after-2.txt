'Would've been best for us if I stayed there till the end': Shubman Gill

India captain Shubman Gill was not impressed with his team's performance on the field and with the bat.

"We bowled pretty well, we let ourselves down in the field. We were not up to standard and everyone looked a bit rusty," Shubman said in the post-match press conference.

The skipper was also disappointed with himself for getting out a crucial stage of the match.

"We spoke about taking time and enjoying our batting but it didn't pan out that way. Halfway through we had lost 5 wickets, would've been best for us if I stayed there till the end, very disappointed with the way I got out and the rest of the match panned out," he added.

Washington Sundar kept India alive in the game till the final over but it was just too late for the World Champions.

"There was a bit of hope for us but when you're chasing 115 and your no.10 batter is out there, you know something is wrong," he concluded.

Shubman Gill put up a fight but was outfoxed by Sikandar Raza on a good delivery while Washington Sundar also battled it out till the end, but it wasn't enough.
