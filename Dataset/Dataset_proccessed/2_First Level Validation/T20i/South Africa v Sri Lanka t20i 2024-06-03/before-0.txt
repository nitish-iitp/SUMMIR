The Aiden Markram-led South Africa will look to win their maiden ICC T20 World Cup title when they begin their campaign against Sri Lanka on June 3, 2024, at Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York.
South Africa is part of Group D at the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup along with Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Netherlands and Nepal.
Notably, Proteas have never won a T20 World Cup title since its inception in 2007 despite having many star players over the years. Their best performances came during the 2009 and 2014 editions where they reached the semi-finals.
South Africa have put together a strong squad this time as well and they will look to produce an impressive performance in the mega event, scheduled to be played in the USA and West Indies.
The batting line-up has a good mix of experience and youth in Quinton de Kock, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Reeza Hendricks, Ryan Rickelton and Tristan Stubbs.
When it comes to their fast-bowling department displays, it has Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje, Gerald Coetzee, Marco Jansen and Ottniel Baartman. On the other hand, the likes of Keshav Maharaj, Tabraiz Shamsi and Bjorn Fortuin complete the spin department.
Ahead of the start of the T20 World Cup 2024, here is a SWOT analysis of India's squad:
Strengths:
South Africa have a lot of firepower in their batting line-up. The likes of Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Tristan Stubbs have that ability to single-handedly win the game on their given day.
When it comes to their bowling, Proteas have many experienced campaigners like Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje while the likes of Marco Jansen, Gerald Coetzee and Ottniel Baartman bring that excitement and killer instinct.
Their spinners Tabraiz Shamsi and Keshav Maharaj also play a lot of franchise cricket and they will be able to adapt to conditions well in the USA and West Indies.
Weaknesses:
The Proteas side doesn't have a genuine all-rounder in their line-up, which is very vital in T20 cricket. Marco Jansen has proven to be handy with the bat but primarily serves as their opening bowler.
The slow pitches of West Indies could make life tough for the batters. Apart from Klaasen and Stubbs, most of the South African batters struggle against quality spin.
Out of form Anrich Nortje is also a cause of concern for South Africa. During the recently concluded IPL 2024, Nortje was far from his best for Delhi Capitals and was eventually dropped from the side.
Opportunity:
South Africa have a great chance to put their history behind and win their first ever T20 World Cup trophy. Their only ICC trophy came during the 1998 Champions Trophy.
Threat:
South Africa have often crumbled under the pressure in knockout matches of ICC tournaments over years. In fact, during their last ICC event - ODI World Cup 2023 - they lost to Australia in the semi-finals.
The same thing can happen in this T20 World Cup as well and skipper Aiden Markram needs to be vary about it and lead from the front in crunch situations.
Predicted Playing XI:
Reeza Hendricks, Quinton de Kock, Aiden Markram (c), Heinrich Klaasen, Tristan Stubbs, David Miller, Marco Jansen, Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi, Keshav Maharaj
Squad:
Aiden Markram (c), Ottniel Baartman, Gerald Coetzee, Quinton de Kock, Bjorn Fortuin, Reeza Hendricks, Marco Jansen, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, David Miller, Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton, Tabraiz Shamsi, Tristan Stubbs, Reserves: Nandre Burger, Lungi Ngidi.
Schedule:
June 3 : Sri Lanka vs South Africa, New York
June 8 : Netherlands vs South Africa, New York
June 10 : South Africa vs Bangladesh, New York
June 14 : South Africa vs Nepal, St. Vincent
