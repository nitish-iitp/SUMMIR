Bangladesh suffer heartbreak again

That Litton Das run out. How many people will be talking about it tomorrow? In Dhaka, in Chattogram, in Sylhet. India had made a commanding total of 184 for 6, thanks mainly to a superlative return to the runs for KL Rahul (50 off 32), and another chapter in Virat Kohli's spectacular form, as he made 66 no out off 44. Suryakumar Yadav's 30 off 16 helped too.

But when Litton blasted seven fours and three sixes inside the first seven overs, Bangladesh had an excellent foundation. They were 66 for no loss when rains interrupted and curtailed the match. At that time, Najmul Hossain Shanto (Litton's opening partner), was seven off 16.

They should have been confident of scoring the 85 needed off the last nine overs (54 balls) upon resumption, particularly as the field was likely to be greasy following the downpour. But when Shanto called for a tight second, two balls into resumption, Litton's spikes failed to adequately grip the damp surface he was running on, and he was out by a about a metre to an outstanding KL Rahul direct hit, from just beyond midwicket.

Bangladesh lost their way after that, even if they rallied slightly towards the end to keep the last over interesting. They lost six wickets for 40 runs, in 33 deliveries. Nurul Hasan did his best to perform a miracle, but his 25 off 14 was not enough. Arshdeep Singh delivered excellent yorkers at the death, and India secured a hard-fought five-run victory, to take them to the top of Group 2.

It's a double-wicket over to follow a double-wicket over. This time, Yasir Ali and Mosaddek Hossain are out. And Bangladesh almost have their tail in.

Two wickets - Afif Hossain and the captain Shakib Al Hasan (who'd looked decent until then), holing out to the legside. And with the required rate over 10, he concedes just two runs, leaving Bangladesh needing 50 in the last four overs, which is an incredibly difficult ask.

Before Litton Das was run out, Bangladesh made 67 off 43 balls.

Since he's been out, they've made 34 off 28, and lost three wickets.

Shanto's gone now

He'd looked to take the scoring on, after Litton was run out. But now he's flat batted Mohammad Shami to Suryakumar Yadav at long on, who has run in to take a good, low catch.

Bangladesh fans know this pain. They know the feeling of being in a good position against India, before the opposition find a way to get back into the game and deny them. Is this another heartbreak for them?

KL Rahul brilliance gets Litton run out

And Litton is fuming. That's a throw from the outfield - Rahul races in from deep midwicket, picks up in one fluid motion, lets fly at the non-strikers' and hits the stumps direct, despite having little more than one stick to aim at. This is such a huge wicket, because the Bangladesh score right now, is down almost totally to Litton.

On replay, it looks like Litton's spikes are struggling for grip on the damp square, and that he's basically stumbling his way back on the second run. Probably would have made it if he'd been able to go full tilt.

Start in 10 minutes. We're down to 16 overs.

Bangladesh need 85 further runs in nine overs (54 balls), with all their wickets in tact. If Litton is around for five of those overs they have an excellent chance. Even if he goes early, they have a great platform thanks to him.

India's bowlers will need to do something special here, to avoid an upset.

Before the restart times came, however, Shakib was having an animated chat with the umpires, seemingly telling them the ground was unfit for play. His team's not the one that has to field on it though.

Better news?

According to the rain radar, the drizzle that remains should end soon.

In anticipation of this, the groundstaff seem to be taking covers off.

But it seems likely that we're going to lose overs, which may suit Bangladesh, who are well ahead right now.

On top of which, a greasy outfield means India's bowlers might find it tough to grip the ball.

Showers periodically blowing through

They are drying the outfield with a rope, but as they do that, more rain seems to be coming through, periodically. The whole square is covered now. It doesn't look an especially severe downpour, and this is a fast-draining ground. But while there's rain there can be no play.

Meanwhile, Mazher Arshad, Sultan of Stats, has this for us.

But on the off chance no more play is possible tonight, Bangladesh are well ahead of the DLS par score of 49.

Litton Das. Breathtaking.

Folks, we've had some great innings this tournament. We've had some outstanding innings in this game. But Litton Das has just completed a half-century in 21 balls, and he's still going fast. By the end of the powerplay, he's hit 56 off 24. This is a glorious start for Bangladesh, who thanks to Litton have surged to60 for 0 by the end of the powerplay.

His partner, Shanto, has four runs from 12 balls. This is has been a showcase from Litton so far. Already the best innings of this match - the highlight of which was the scooped over-the-shoulder six off Bhuvneshwar Kumar in the fifth over.

Just spectacular.

Litton rocks it in the first three

He has edged it twice - once against Arshdeep Singh, another time against Bhuvneshwar Kumar. The Arshdeep one clearly hit the ground before it got to Dinesh Karthik.

The one off Bhuvneshwar flew between the keeper and slip, and Karthik could only get the very tip of his glove to it.

But as he still survives, he is sending Bangladesh flying through the powerplay. Here's what the third over looked like. The boundaries are all Littons. Et the end of this over he was 28 off 11.

Kohli's insane World Cup
220
The no. of runs Kohli has scored in four innings, at this WC. It's also his average.

If you weren't already of the view that Kohli is the T20 World Cup's batting GOAT, just checking in here to let you know that after his 66 not out off 44 today, the man has 220 runs at this World Cup. Absolutely astounding consistency.

India's advance slows as wickets fall

Perhaps 190 isn't quite on the cards anymore. Dinesh Karthik charged down the pitch in the 17th over, expecting Kohli to run a single to Shakib at cover. But Kohli isn't interested, and DK can't get back in time.

Then at the start of the 19th, Axar Patel spoons one over the infield, but it's a straightforward catch for the fielder running back from cover.

India lose their fourth, but Kohli keeps pushing them on

Kohli's well into his forties now, the man striking at more than 130 despite not having hit any sixes.

Hardik Pandya thwacks a wide bouncer from Hasan Mahmud straight to backward point (was trying to lift it over him), so India lost their fourth. But such an excellent platform has been set, a score of 190 is not out of the question.

Suryakumar Yadav put on a spectacular display of wristy hitting, making 30 off 16, but is now bowled by Shakib Al Hasan, attempting to cut a ball that was perhaps too straight and too quick.

Nevertheless, we've also just got news he is the top-ranked T20 batter in the worls.

Kohli now the highest T20 World Cup scorer

Rahul gets to fifty (fair to say he's more than justified the faith in him), and gets out, mistiming a whip over short fine leg, and giving a simple catch to that fielder, off the bowling of Shakib.

Meanwhile, through the course of this innings, Virat Kohli has become the highest run-getter in T20 World Cups. Hard to argue with Sreshth's tweet here. An average in the mid-80s: mindblowing.

This is glorious batting. Utterly spectacular from both batters, but from KL Rahul in particular. Virat Kohli kicks the boundaries off in a 24-run over by Shoriful Islam, with a gorgeous checked-drive down the ground for four.

Then Rahul keeps his shape and larrups one into the stands over cow corner with a languid swing of the bat. That delivery turns out to be a (very tight) no-ball, and the next legal delivery he gets, he slices behind point for six. And then he used the depth of the crease to hit a back cut for four next ball.

India absolutely running the show now - 76/1 after 9 overs.

India "edge" the powerplay?

Yes, Bangladesh got Rohit, but thanks partly to at least four edges for four through third man, India have moved to 37 for 1 at the end of the six overs.

This doesn't seem like a particularly fantastic score, but the trend in this World Cup has been fast finishes for teams batting first, so long as they have wickets in hand. The scoring rate tends to skyrocket in the back half.

The first of those sixes I've already gushed about. The second, off Mahmud, was even better - a supremely-timed square cut off Mahmud that was like a firework into the stands in front of square. *drool emoji*

Rohit dropped! Rohit caught!

Hasan Mahmud makes up for a bad mistake in the field, almost immediately.

Fifth ball of the third over, he dropped a sitter off Rohit Sharma at fine leg, letting the ball bounce out after having needed to barely move to get to it. Rohit was on one then, but he was only able to make the run that that drop allowed, before Mahmud - at the bowling crease next over - had him slice one to point, second ball.

How much Hasan's drop cost Bangladesh, in the end.

Here comes the in-form Virat Kohli.

Rahul launches one into the stands

KL Rahul has faced 11 of the 13 balls in the first two overs (there was a no-ball). Although he played and missed at a few, and clearly does not seem in immediately good touch, he did produce an impressive pick-up shot into the deep square leg stand for six. Could this be the shot that gets him into an innings?

Rahul on Rahul

There may be an inkling of a worry for KL Rahul ahead of this match, as he has made cores of 9, 9, and 4 so far in the tournament. His half-centuries in the warm-up matches, though, suggest this is just a temporary dip, and that he's probably striking the ball very well.

Nevertheless, here's coach Rahul Dravid backing KL up. He says KL "has very well suited to these kind of conditions".

Shakib calls correct at the toss

...and he chooses to bowl first because his team is "not sure what is a good score on this pitch".

Rohit says he would have batted first anyway because "it looks like a good pitch" and "runs on the board always matters".

Here's how the teams line up: Soumya Sarkar is out for Bangladesh, who have chosen to beef up their left-arm seam with Shoriful Islam. Axar Patel comes into the side in place of Deepak Hooda, for India.

Welcome!

Hi all, welcome to the Rabindranath-Tagore-national-anthem-derby (we'll workshop the title), the winner of which will rise to the top of Group 2, and give their chances of qualifying for the semi-final a substantial boost.

When last these teams met in a T20 World Cup, India pulled the rug from under Bangladesh, who managed to lose a match in which they needed two off the last three balls. My friend Mohammad Isam writes a bit about that game in his preview.

I was there at the Chinnaswamy that night, and remember being heartbroken for Bangladesh. But also in awe of MS Dhoni's genius.

Anyway, six years later, these are very different teams. Do Bangladesh have what it takes to pull off an upset? Stay close.

If you're in the US, you can watch this game live on ESPN+ in English or in Hindi.
