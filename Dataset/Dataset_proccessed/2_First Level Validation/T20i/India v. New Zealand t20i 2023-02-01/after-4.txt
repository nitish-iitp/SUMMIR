In Short
India defeated New Zealand in the decider of the series at Ahmedabad
Shubman Gill led the way with a sensational 126*
Indian pacers feasted on New Zealand's mistakes in the second innings.

India remained unbeaten in 2023 after defeating New Zealand in the decider of the three-match series. Led by Shubman Gill's unbeaten 126, India were able to defeat Mitchell Santner and Co. by a massive margin of 168 runs - the biggest margin for victory from India against the Kiwis.

Gill, playing in his Indian Premier League home ground, produced an absolute masterclass and rescued India from yet another middling start. After opener Ishan Kishan's nightmarish outing, Gill held the innings with Rahul Tripathi and others and steered the team to their biggest-ever total against New Zealand - 234.

Shubman's innings took New Zealand out of the attack with the innings, but the credit has to be given to Rahul Tripathi as well, who started off the counter-attack in the powerplay. Tripathi was at 9 off 10 at a point of the time, and at the time he finished his innings on the daym he had amassed 44 off just 22 balls. Credit has to be given to Suryakumar Yadav for playing yet another small cameo and of course captain Hardik Pandya, who hit 30 off 17 balls.

The game looked done halfway through, as it was fairly unlikely that Mitchell Santner's men were going to chase a target this big.

After spin's domination in the first two games, India pacers stole the show ran through the NZ batting line-up in the powerplay overs, reducing them to 21/5 in 4.3 overs.

The falling of wickets continued as a hapless New Zealand looked defeated by the 10 overs of the chase. The visitors finally folded for just 66 runs in 12.1 overs as the pacers clean sweeped the 2021 T20 World Cup finalists.

Hardik Pandya was the pick among the bowlers, scalping four wickets for 16 runs. Besides Hardik Pandya, Arshdeep Singh, Shivam Mavi and Umran Malik picked two wickets each to put the final nail in the coffin for NZ in the final match of the series.
