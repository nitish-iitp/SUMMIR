Australia wrap up resounding victory against defending champions England
The old enemies met in a high-octane Group B clash and Mitchell Marsh led his side to a thumping win.
England v Australia in Bridgetown

Australia set a huge target and defended it brilliantly as they beat defending champions England by 36 runs in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup at Bridgetown, Barbados.

England managed 165/6 in response to a huge total of 201/7.

Scoreboard: England v Australia

Toss: England won toss and elected to field

Big hitting from Warner and Head

Australia were hitting out from the off, while England looked wobbly in the field.

David Warner was first to fall, bowled by Moeen Ali for 39 off just 16 balls - but by that point Australia were already on 70 after five overs.

Fellow opener Travis Head made 34 off 18 balls, and was removed in the next over by Jofra Archer.

Jos Buttler could see the match running away from his side and mixed up the bowling, which paid dividends, with Liam Livingstone removing Mitchell Marsh for 35, stumped by the captain-wicketkeeper himself.

And three balls later, Adil Rashid tempted Glenn Maxwell into a midwicket shot straight into the safe hands of Phil Salt, out of 28.

Chris Jordan got his first wicket when his width lured Tim David to sky into the hands of Livingstone by the rope.

The final over was made more difficult for England as their slow rate was penalised and they had to bring in an extra fielder.

But that did not stop Jordan from taking the 100th wicket of his T20 international career, removing Marcus Stoinis for 30 with a catch from Harry Brook.

And the next ball he removed Pat Cummins, running him out for a duck as Matthew Wade looked to get on strike.

Salt and Buttler start well, can't finish

Phil Salt and Jos Buttler made a fine start to the innings, with the boundaries flowing smoothly.

Head had a great chance to remove Salt at the boundary, but instead added six runs to his total, losing his footing and touching the rope as his hands batted the ball back towards the middle.

Then Adam Zampa made the breakthrough with his very first ball, Salt bamboozled by the line and playing on to his stumps, leaving the crease with 37 off 23 balls and England on 73/1.

And it was Zampa who did for Buttler as well, as the captain looked to reverse but missed his timing, making it easy for Cummins to take the catch.

Jacks toe-ended a Marcus Stoinis ball into the hands of Starc, diving forward to cling on brilliantly.

Moeen Ali enjoyed a delightful cameo in the closing stages, including a trio of sixes in one Maxwell over.

But he could not find a partner to stick with him, Jonny Bairstow managing 7 off 13 balls before being caught by Maxwell off Josh Hazelwood's bowling, as England fell further and further behind the required run-rate.

And soon enough Moeen too was on his way for 25, looking to push the scoring on against Cummins but finding only Warner's hands on the boundary.

Livingstone got 15 before he was caught by Starc in the shadows at long-off from a Cummins delivery, leaving it to Jordan and Harry Brook to close the innings.
