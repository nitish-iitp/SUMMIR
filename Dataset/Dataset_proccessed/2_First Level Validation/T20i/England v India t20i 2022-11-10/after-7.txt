India vs England Live Updates, T20 WC 2022, 2nd Semi-Final: India has lost the toss against England and has been asked to bat first in the second semifinal of the T20 World Cup at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday. The weather looks fine for now as captains Rohit Sharma and Jos Buttler walked out for the toss. While India is confident of putting up a spectacular fight against the English team due to their superior record so far in this tournament,  England will be hoping to spoil India’s party and face Pakistan in the final in MCG in Melbourne on Sunday, November 13. 

Experts have noted that no team, who has elected to bat first on the Adelaide grounds, has gone on to win the match. This is for the first time that India and England will cross swords in a T20I match on Australian grounds. 

India vs England teams at play

India: KL Rahul, Rohit Sharma(c), Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Rishabh Pant(w), Axar Patel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh.

England: Jos Buttler(w/c), Alex Hales, Philip Salt, Ben Stokes, Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone, Moeen Ali, Sam Curran, Chris Jordan, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid
