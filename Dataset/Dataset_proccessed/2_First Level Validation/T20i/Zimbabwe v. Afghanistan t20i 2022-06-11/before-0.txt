Afghanistan clean swept the one-day international (ODI) series 3-0 against hosts Zimbabwe after winning the third and final ODI on Thursday. Hosts were restricted on 135 all out after they fell prey to Rashid Khan's magnificent spell of 3/31 along with Mohammad Nabi and Fazalhaq Farooqi's 2/21 and 2/25 respectively. Later, Afghani batters chased the set total in 37.4 overs successfully and won the match by four wickets and 74 balls remaining. After a dissatisfying performance in the ODI series, Zimbabwe will be looking to recover from the loss at home ground and make every effort to win the upcoming T20 series, while Afghanistan on the other hand will be eyeing another series win to end their tour on a positive note.
