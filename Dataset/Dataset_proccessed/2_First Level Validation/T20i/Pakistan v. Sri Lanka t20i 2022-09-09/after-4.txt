On Friday night in Dubai, the final Super Four match of the 2022 Asia Cup features Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Both teams will face off against one another in the competition’s final on Sunday after each team had won two of their first two games. At 18:00 local time, the game gets underway at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.

In their last three games, Sri Lanka defeated Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and India while batting second. They will think they can win the final two games to claim the championship.

With only one wicket left and requiring 11 from the last over against Afghanistan, Pakistan appeared to be out of options. But after two sixes, they had triumphed once more. Pakistan will approach the field looking to overcome Sri Lanka.

SL vs PAK Weather Report

This Super Four stage final match occurred in Dubai under warm, cloudless evening skies. Early in the game, the temperature will reach its top of 36 degrees.

SL vs PAK Match Toss Prediction

Both teams have won their most recent games while batting second. Hence we predict that if either side wins the toss before this game, the captain will elect to field first.

SL vs PAK Pitch Report

As the competition has gone on, the wicket in Dubai has become quicker and simpler to bat on. The spinners will still have some turn, and we anticipate a par score of between 170-180.
