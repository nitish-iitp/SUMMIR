The second T20I between India and South Africa will be played in Cuttack tomorrow. Having lost a match which they should’ve won under normal circumstances, the hosts would be keen to stage a comeback by winning the second of the five T20Is to be played against the Proteas.

Barabati Stadium, which had last hosted an international match in the form of an ODI against West Indies more than two years ago, will be hosting a T20I after more than four years.

In what will only be the third T20I to be played at this venue, India have won and lost one each in the past. South Africa, who had played the inaugural Cuttack T20I in 2015, had ended up on the winning side back in the day.
