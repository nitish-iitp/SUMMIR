Pollard leads West Indies to 179-4 in England decider

Article FIRST PUBLISHED BY BARBADOS TODAY

Published on
January 30, 2022

BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AFP)— West Indies captain Kieron Pollard top-scored with 41 not out as the hosts made 179 for four against England in Sunday’s fifth and deciding Twenty20 international in Barbados.

England spinners Adil Rashid, Liam Livingstone and captain Moeen Ali returned combined figures of four for 54 at the Kensington Oval, with the series all square at 2-2.

But the pacemen were hit round the ground.

West Indies openers Brandon King (34) and Kyle Mayers (31) shared a stand of 59 before the run-rate slowed during the middle overs.

Pollard and Rovman Powell, a century-maker in midweek, upped the tempo in an unbroken stand of 75 that included 66 off the last 24 balls.

Pollard faced 25 balls while Powell smashed four sixes in a 35 not out made from 17 balls.

England recalled Saqib Mahmood in place of left-armer Tymal Mills only for the paceman’s first ball to be hit straight back over his head for six by King.

After wicketkeeper Sam Billings missed a chance to stump King off Moeen, leg-spinner Rashid made the breakthrough via a brilliant relay catch. Jason Roy clung on to a head high chance near the deep midwicket rope and under armed the ball to Phil Salt before falling over the boundary.

Livingstone removed both Romario Shepherd and King in a return of two for 17.  A googly from Rashid, who also took 2-17 but in four overs to his team-mate’s three, accounted for Nicholas Pooran.

Then came the charge to leave England needing a challenging 180 for victory.

8:15 pm  Right then! That is it from the coverage of this exciting series. West Indies have clinched the series by a 3-2 margin and they pose for some pictures now with the trophy. Happy faces in the Windies camp and rightly so as they have played some brilliant cricket in this series. The cricketing action does not stop here as we bring you the live coverage of Bangladesh Premier League, Pakistan Super League and the remainder of the Under-19 World Cup. So make sure you tune in for all these games and enjoy all the live action. See you there! Cheers!

8:15 pm  Jason Holder is the Player of the Match as well as the Series. He says that it was a classy finish. Tells that he didn’t bowl well in the previous game and he is happy with his performance in this game. Mentions that he was pumped and always loves to play at the Kensington Oval. He also appreciates the English crowd for flying down here and thanks the home crowd as well for supporting them throughout the series. Tells that he knew that he needed to improve his death bowling and he worked very hard in the nets to get better at it. On his relationship with Kieron Pollard, he says that he enjoys playing with him and he always thinks about the team and not about himself. Signs off by thanking Moeen Ali, Eoin Morgan and ECB for all of their efforts and says that he is looking forward to the Test series against England.

8:14 pm  Kieron Pollard, the victorious skipper of West Indies, starts by singing a song. He thanks his team for giving this victory and applauds his team for supporting each other. He mentions that the boys have worked tirelessly and they had a talk about how to go about things ahead and says credit should be given to all the boys for the effort they have put in. He tells that this was like a final and runs on the board are always crucial and they started well but failed to get going in middle overs. He says that the move to send Shepherd did not work and after that sometimes they have to consolidate. Signs off by saying that this was a total team effort and he is very proud of the way his team played.

8:16 pm  Moeen Ali, the skipper of England, says that West Indies were a better team and they played well. He adds that it has been good series. He mentions that they played well in the death overs and England will learn from this and get better. He informs that the new ball comes nicely on the bat and then it becomes difficult. He says that the younger guys did well in the series and they are proud of their performances in these conditions. He adds that West Indies were a smarter team today and that was the difference in the end. Mentions that he enjoys captaincy but Morgan is a brilliant captain and he doesn’t think much about captaincy.

8:02 pm  Stay tuned for the presentation…

8:17 pm  West Indies will be extremely pleased with the way they bowled and kept the English batters in check for the majority of the innings. Akeal Hosein set the tone upfront as he got rid of Jason Roy in the first over. They did leak some runs in the middle overs but it was the second spell of Akeal Hosein which turned the game in West Indies’ favour. However, it was Jason Holder who stole the entire show in the last over in which he picked up four wickets to hand England a series defeat. He also went on to become the first West Indian to grab a hat-trick in T20Is. All in all, it was a good overall display from the hosts and they deserved to win the match as well as the series.

8:19 pm  England had to chase 180 from 20 overs and they had to start well with the bat which they did as Jason Roy made his intentions quite clear in the first over but he also perished in the same over and England were put on the back foot. Although, Banton and Vince did steady the ship but once Banton was dismissed, England lost the momentum and they kept losing wickets after that. No batter managed to get in and get going and Vince was the lone warrior out there in the middle. Their skipper, Moeen Ali who batted so well in the previous game looked completely out of sorts in this one as he never really got going and took 19 deliveries to score just 14 runs. Billings swung his willow in the end but he ran out of partners and as a result he too lost his wicket in the last over. England would be disappointed with the way they batted in this decider.

7:38 pm  Jason Holder seals the deal for West Indies and the hosts clinch the T20I series 3-2!

Incredible scenes at Kensington Oval and the West Indian players get into a huddle to celebrate of what has been a terrific T20I series. England were in this contest at the halfway mark but once they started to lose wickets post that, they never looked like chasing it down and in the end they were just blown away by the brilliance of Jason Holder.

19.5W J. Holder to S. Mahmood, OUT! BOWLED! FOUR IN FOUR for Jason Holder! He nails a yorker this time and West Indies have bowled out England here! They are ecstatic but at first they didn’t realise that Saqib Mahmood was bowled but then later, they do and the celebrations go a notch higher. Jason Holder bowls a yorker on leg. Saqib Mahmood looks to dig it out but misses. The ball hits the leg stump and the bails come off. So Holder finishes with a five-wicket haul and West Indies win by 17 runs!

7:29 pm  Reece Topley is the last man in.

19.4W J. Holder to A. Rashid, OUT! TAKEN! Hat-trick for Jason Holder and he has sealed the deal for West Indies here! A length ball, on off. Adil Rashid goes for a big heave across the line. He miscues it.The ball goes high in the air towards deep mid-wicket and the fielder there Odean Smith takes a good catch. Jason Holder becomes the first West Indian to take a hat-trick in T20Is.

7:28 pm  Saqib Mahmood is the new man in.

19.3W J. Holder to S. Billings, OUT! TAKEN! Jason Holder gets his man and that should be it for England! Holder serves a slower ball, fuller in length, outside off. Sam Billings shuffles across and looks to heave it to the leg side but it goes off the top edge, high in the air towards deep mid-wicket. Hayden Walsh (sub) settles under it and he makes no mistake. Holder is elated and England’s last hope, Billings takes the long walk back to the pavilion.

7:26 pm  Adil Rashid walks out to bat.

19.2W J. Holder to C. Jordan, OUT! CAUGHT! Chris Jordan is disappointed but Jason Holder is pumped up! A slower full toss on off. Jordan heaves it towards deep mid-wicket and the fielder there Hayden Walsh (sub)takes a good catch. It is up to Sam Billings now to take England home but it looks like a very tough task now. West Indies are just a few good deliveries away now from a series win.

19.10 J. Holder to C. Jordan, Brilliant from Holder! A wide yorker outside off. Jordan backs away and in the end fails to get any bat on it.

19.12 NB J. Holder to S. Billings, NO BALL! Jason Holder has overstepped here! A low full toss on off. Sam Billings heaves it to long off for just a single. Free Hit coming up.

7:24 pm  Jason Holder to bowl the last over. Will he defend 20 runs?
