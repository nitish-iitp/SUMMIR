Preview

Pakistan will play against Ireland in the Group A match of the T20 World Cup 2024 at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium in Lauderhill. After getting eliminated from the race to make the Super 8 stage in the tournament, Pakistan will be looking to end their campaign on a high with a win. For Ireland, it’s vital to deliver a better performance in comparison to their earlier ones in the T20 World Cup 2024, to give themselves the best chance to go home with a victory under their belt.

Pitch Report

The Central Broward Regional Park Stadium in Lauderhill has seen two consecutive washouts in the T20 World Cup 2024, and the weather is expected to be no different in the remainder of the tournament here. The average first-innings score at this venue in T20I cricket is 166, which shows that the pitch could allow the batters to play freely if Pakistan get to take on the field against Ireland.

Team Analysis

Pakistan

Pakistan's batting lineup hasn’t had the best of times in the T20 World Cup 2024, struggling on a tricky pitch at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York despite Mohammad Rizwan’s decent contributions against India and Canada. Meanwhile, their fast bowlers have been quite exceptional in the tournament, with the likes of Naseem Shah, Mohammad Amir, and Haris Rauf finding their names among the top wicket-takers.

Ireland

Ireland’s top order has failed to put meaningful contributions on the board right throughout the T20 World Cup 2024, putting the responsibility on the lower middle order of George Dockrell, Gareth Delany, and Mark Adair to score most of the runs. The bowling attack for the Irish has been quite decent with the likes of Craig Young, Barry McCarthy, and Mark Adair picking up most of the wickets.
