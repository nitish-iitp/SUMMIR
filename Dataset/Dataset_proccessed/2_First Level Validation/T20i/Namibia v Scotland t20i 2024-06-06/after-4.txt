We are back after a short delay! The Scottish opened, George Munsey and Michael Jones make their way out to the middle. Ruben Trumpelmann to begin.

!

... THE RUN CHASE ...

!

For Namibia, they started well and ended well as in-between the spinners didn't control the middle phase. Mark Watt in particular who is such a reliable bowler had an off day as he leaked runs. However, Namibia pulled back thanks to Brad Wheal's late flourish with the ball. His three wickets came in handy and at crucial stage. Scotland will feel they are still in the game, they just need one good partnership. Can they build on the momentum? Let's find out.

!

Zane Green is up for a chat. He’s happy with the score especially after the wickets they lost in the Powerplay. Adds Erasmus played really well. Mentions the wicket is a little two paced.

!

That is some recovery from Scotland and they'll be happy with the score right now. Namibia though would have loved 10-15 runs more and they had a decent chance when Merwe Erasmus and Zane Green were batting together. The skipper was playing really well and got Scotland to a good position but his wicket started a snall downfall as Zane Green followed him. David Wiese didn't make a big impact too.

BRAD WHEAL TO BERNAND SCHOLTZ

Two more to end and Namibia end with 155! On middle. Shortish again. This is pulled towards deep mid-wicket. Two taken. Good last over for Namibia.

BRAD WHEAL TO BERNAND SCHOLTZ

Two! They checked for one-short but it is fine! On middle. This is tucked around the corner on the leg side. Two easy.

BRAD WHEAL TO JJ SMIT

OUT! RUN OUT! Really not sure where Smit was going there. There was no second. On middle. This is hit down to long on. They take one and Smit turns for the second but realises his partner is not coming. He turns and looks to get back in. The fielder fires it to the bowler who takes the bails off. Smit is short.

BRAD WHEAL TO BERNAND SCHOLTZ

Fuller and on middle. This is hit back towards the bowler. He gets a hand to it and takes the pace off. The ball rolls towards mid off. One taken.

BRAD WHEAL TO JJ SMIT

Shorter and on middle. Smit pulls but to deep square leg. Only one.

BRAD WHEAL TO JJ SMIT

SIX! Bang! That is well over and that is the ideal start to the last over. This is with the wind. Shorter and on middle. It sits up to be hit. This is pulled over the mid-wicket fence. It sails over the fence with the wind.

18.6

BRAD CURRIE TO JJ SMIT

Just the single! Boundaries have dried up at a time where Namibia would have loved a few. On the pads. This is tucked around the corner for one. Can they get to 150 is the question? 8 runs needed, one over to go.

BRAD CURRIE TO JJ SMIT

Two in a row now! Around off. Smit pushes it but can't get it past cover.

BRAD CURRIE TO JJ SMIT

Dots are absolute gold at this stage! There is one! Around off. Good length. This is pushed to cover.

BRAD CURRIE TO BERNAND SCHOLTZ

Just the one! On off. This is pushed towards cover for one.

BRAD CURRIE TO RUBEN TRUMPELMANN

OUT! TAKEN! Three wickets in quick succession and Namibia are losing their way here. Currie has another one. A slower one on the pads. Ruben Trumpelmann looks to go over the leg side but he picks the wrong side. There is a strong wind there and the ball holds up. The fielder at deep square leg takes a good catch.

BRAD CURRIE TO JJ SMIT

And again, just the one, fuller and on off. A slower one. This is pushed down to long off for one.

BRAD WHEAL TO JJ SMIT

That is a top over from Wheal. Just the kind you need at this time of the innings. He has got his side back into the game. On middle, a slower one. This is tucked on the leg side for one.

BRAD WHEAL TO ZANE GREEN

OUT! TAKEN! Another one bites the dust! Scotland have managed to take wickets at the right time so far. Excellent stuff from Wheal. Length and around off. Green looks to go over mid off but does not get the elevation he wanted. Jones takes it. The idea was right but the execution wasn't there. Had he got it over him, it would have been a boundary. Good little innings by Green but his side needed him to be out there for longer.

BRAD WHEAL TO RUBEN TRUMPELMANN

Just the one! Singles won't harm Scotland. Shortish and on middle. This is pulled through square leg for one.
