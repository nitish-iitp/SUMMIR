'We needed this win'

Pakistan captain Babar Azam: "We needed this win. We started well with the ball in the first six overs. If you take wickets then it is difficult for the other side.

"On this pitch the first six overs is crucial as it is a little double paced. But after six overs you can assess the situation, the pitch is a bit more settled and we could execute our plans.

"We will have the same mindset in he final game. I think the conditions will be better, which will suit both teams. We will try our best to win this match."

'It was difficult to bat'

Canada captain Saad Bin Zafar: "It was a bit disappointing. The pitch was not really helpful, it was difficult to bat, especially early on and just not a good toss to lose.

"They kept picking up wickets had we scored 130 plus we could have made a game out of it.

"We don't get to play a lot of high calibre teams very often. Aaron Johnson played really well and Nicolas Kirton's run out was crucial. It was disappointing but there are lots of positives to take away."

How does this match leave the Group A table?

Pakistan have chalked up their first win to just about keep their qualifying flame alive. They sit in third behind the United States, having played a game more. They'll need a win against Ireland in Florida on Sunday, and have to hope other results go their way.

Canada slip below their opponents to fourth - like Pakistan they have two points, but now have a negative run-rate so their chances of qualification are even slimmer. And their final game is against India on Saturday, not exactly a doddle...

'That was a much-needed win'

Player of the match Mohammad Amir: "As a bowler you have to adapt to conditions. They were demanding. I was trying to hit the right areas. As a professional you have to be ready for any situation. My role was clear with the new ball. I was very clear with my plans and that's why I am getting this success.

"That was a much-needed win to be honest. One more win and who knows?"

Let's take a look at a few of the highlights of that innings.

Saim Ayub survived a dropped chance but was dismissed without scoring any further runs.

Muhammad Rizwan and Babar Azam then put 63 on for the second wicket as Pakistan eased their way towards Canada's total, but Pakistan's captain fell a little before the close, with Usman Khan hitting the winning runs in the 18th over.

Well, I can't claim that was the most thrilling watch.

Pakistan hit just three fours and two sixes as they chased down their target.

It wasn't always destined to be comfortable though, this was the highest successful chase at this New York ground, which hasn't been a happy hunting ground for the boundary hitters.

Pakistan at last have registered their first win. They will have helped their net run rate finishing with 15 balls to spare.

And from the next legitimate delivery the match is done.

Tries to finish it with a big hit... fails.

Fakhar tries to hammer Jeremy Gordon over mid-wicket but the ball takes a leading edge and spirals into the air, with sub Dilpreet Bajwa running around from point to cover to take the catch.

A good knock from Rizwan. He is going to see his team home and if not I'll be very surprised.

4 runs needed from 18 balls

Fakhar Zaman lashes a single to the cover fielder off Heyliger's penultimate delivery, bringing up Pakistan's hundred.

Muhammad Rizwan comes on strike and gets three with a miss-field to pass the fifty landmark.

He moves to 52 from 52 balls, and that's the slowest fifty for Pakistan in T20 internationals.

If Canada just look to squeeze it a little bit and try to get it to a run a ball, they could have a chance.

What a soft dismissal from the captain, he's so much better than that. He will be disappointed in himself.

Babar c Movva b Heyliger 33 (Pak 83-2)

Oh. The partnership won't see Pakistan home.

Babar aims to cutely guide Dillon Heyliger down to the third boundary, but only manages to offer up a bit of catching practice for Shreyas Movva behind the stumps.

The Pakistan captain departs for a run a ball 33, and in comes to Fakhar Zaman.
