    "Gareth Southgate's side need to beat Slovenia to be assured of top spot and avoid facing hosts Germany in the Last 16.",
    "Slovenian striker Benjamin Sesko and his lethal right boot are ready to exploit England's pressing weakness.",
    "England manager Gareth Southgate has reportedly made a huge call on Trent Alexander-Arnold's spot in the starting XI ahead of Tuesday's Euro 2024 Group C clash with Slovenia.",
    "According to The Athletic, England are set to make a key alteration to their starting XI for Tuesday's final group match against Slovenia in Cologne.",
    "Euro 2024 Group C all boils down to the events of Tuesday evening, where England and Slovenia clash at the RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne aiming to fulfil their knockout aspirations.",
    "Slovenia have warned England they will be taking shots from distance because they don’t believe Gareth Southgate’s side will bother to close them down.",
    "The report states that Alexander-Arnold will drop to the bench for the Group C clash, with Chelsea man Conor Gallagher being promoted into the starting side.",
    "A midfield three of Gallagher, Rice and Bellingham will be looking to help the Three Lions to a win that would secure their spot at the top of Group C.",
    "Much has been made of England’s inability to press opponents, with captain Harry Kane stating they didn’t know who was supposed to go and when.",
    "The Three Lions hit the front early on against Denmark in Frankfurt four days later, however a stunning long-range strike from Morten Hjulmand forced a share of the spoils.",
    "The only goal the Three Lions have conceded here in Germany was when Denmark midfielder Morten Hjulmand took aim from 30 yards during last Thursday’s 1-1 draw in Frankfurt.",
    "Slovenian midfielder Timi Max Elsnik mentioned that England conceded outside of the box and are not the best at closing down the area 20-25 meters away from goal.",
    "Even a point would be enough to guarantee a top-two ranking for the Three Lions, who are two points better off than both Denmark and Slovenia, who have played out two 1-1 stalemates with the Scandinavians and Serbia thus far.",
    "By virtue of conceding a last-minute goal to the latter, Matjaz Kek's men sit third in the standings, but the formula for them is also simple; win and they are through.",
    "Gareth Southgate's men have accrued four points from a possible six courtesy of a slender success over Serbia and disappointing draw with Denmark, but they cannot finish any lower than third and will be confirmed as group winners with a victory.",
    "Without the presence of Jordan Henderson and Kalvin Phillips in the England squad, Southgate has often favoured Gallagher to provide running power and energy in the engine room.",
    "Interestingly, Slovenia have the edge on England when it comes to overall form in recent months, as Kek's men have gone unbeaten in their last eight matches, while the Three Lions have just two wins to shout about from their last seven contests.",
    "ITV's lead presenter Mark Pougatch has become embroiled in a journey from hell as he attempts to reach Berlin to host England's clash with Slovenia.",
    "Elsnik emphasized that Slovenia do not fear England and that a draw should be enough to see them through on three points.",
    "Boss Southgate is hopeful Pougatch will enjoy the game if he finally does make it to Berlin. England have endured a difficult opening two games so far, though are all but assured of a place in the knockouts.",
    "Elsnik stated that Slovenia's mentality is to not be scared of England, similar to their approach against Denmark and Serbia.",
    "Southgate added: 'The mood is very good. We know the world we live in, there will always be external noise but it shouldn't affect us. What's important is the internal. The performance is what we're focussing on. The results have basically put us in the next round already and now we want to top the group.'",
    "Southgate stated: 'Whatever I say is fairly irrelevant, we have to do it on the pitch. We're all on the same page. The route forward was pretty simple to highlight and we have to go and deliver it. I'm expecting we do that tomorrow.'",
    "Alexander-Arnold has started both of England's opening group games at this summer's Euro 2024 in a midfield three alongside Arsenal's Declan Rice and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham.",
    "Gallagher, 24, has been brought onto the field of play for Alexander-Arnold in both of England's matches at the tournament so far, with the Three Lions struggling for control in the second half of games.",
    "In their opening game of the major tournament in Germany, Southgate's troops secured a nervy 1-0 success over Serbia courtesy of a 12th-minute strike from Birmingham City boy Bellingham.",
    "Elsnik also commented on the design of tournament balls, suggesting they are made lighter and faster to produce more spectacular goals."
