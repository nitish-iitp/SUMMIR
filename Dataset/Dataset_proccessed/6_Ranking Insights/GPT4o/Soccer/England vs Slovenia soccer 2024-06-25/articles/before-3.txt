England 'make huge Trent Alexander-Arnold call' for Slovenia Euro 2024 clash
By Carter White

England manager Gareth Southgate has reportedly made a huge call on Trent Alexander Arnold's spot in the starting XI ahead of Tuesday's Euro 2024 Group C clash with Slovenia.

With the right-back slot for the Three Lions clogged up with the likes of Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier over recent years, the 25-year-old Liverpudlian has found himself being trialled in a new position for the Three Lions.

Alexander-Arnold has started both of England's opening group games at this summer's Euro 2024 in a midfield three alongside Arsenal's Declan Rice and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham.

In their opening game of the major tournament in Germany, Southgate's troops secured a nervy 1-0 success over Serbia courtesy of a 12th-minute strike from Birmingham City boy Bellingham.

The Three Lions hit the front early on against Denmark in Frankfurt four days later, however a stunning long-range strike from Morten Hjulmand forced a share of the spoils.

Southgate to drop Alexander-Arnold for Slovenia match?

According to The Athletic, England are set to make a key alteration to their starting XI for Tuesday's final group match against Slovenia in Cologne.

The report states that Alexander-Arnold will drop to the bench for the Group C clash, with Chelsea man Conor Gallagher being promoted into the starting side.

Gallagher, 24, has been brought onto the field of play for Alexander-Arnold in both of England's matches at the tournament so far, with the Three Lions struggling for control in the second half of games.

Without the presence of Jordan Henderson and Kalvin Phillips in the England squad, Southgate has often favoured Gallagher to provide running power and energy in the engine room.

A midfield three of Gallagher, Rice and Bellingham will be looking to help the Three Lions to a win that would secure their spot at the top of Group C.

Is the Alexander-Arnold experiment over?

During a managerial reign at England that can be characterised by pragmatism and practicality, Southgate's bold decision to try Alexander-Arnold in midfield has been a hot topic of discussion.

No one can doubt the Liverpool defender's ability to pick a long-range pass and open up defences, a quality that is precious, especially on the international stage.

However, spraying passes under no pressure in qualifying matches against Malta is a completely different game to hard-fought contests in major tournaments.

As has been apparent during the opening games of Euro 2024 for England, Alexander-Arnold is not extremely comfortable while facing his own goal in possession.

Southgate's reported decision to leave the 26-year-old out of the Slovenia match is not necessarily the end of his midfield experiment, although time is running out for the brave plan to become a success.
