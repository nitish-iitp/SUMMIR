How Italy could line up against Croatia
By Jonathan O'Shea

Aiming to seal second spot in Group B at Euro 2024, reigning champions Italy meet Croatia on Monday night needing just one point to ensure a place in the knockout phase.

The Azzurri may have only lost 1-0 to Spain last time out, but a tepid performance - featuring their fewest shots in a European Championship game to date - was followed by post-match recriminations, so a substantial change of personnel should be expected.

Due to a lack of bite up front, coach Luciano Spalletti - who has repeatedly aired his frustration with Gianluca Scamacca's work rate - will most likely bring in new forwards such as Mattia Zaccagni and Mateo Retegui.

In addition to Scamacca, established players such as Jorginho and Giovanni Di Lorenzo received plenty of criticism for their contributions on Thursday night.

Therefore, Matteo Darmian - a regular for Serie A champions Inter Milan last season - and Bryan Cristante could be promoted to the starting XI.

Captain and undisputed first-choice goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma is one of few men guaranteed to keep their place in Leipzig - Inter trio Nicolo Barella, Federico Dimarco and Alessandro Bastoni are also set to be retained.

While Roma's Gianluca Mancini could help reinforce La Nazionale's slightly dubious defence, Riccardo Calafiori may be entrusted to continue his partnership with fellow left-footer Bastoni.

Whether they feature at the heart of a back four or a three-man rearguard remains to be seen, as Spalletti has previously spoken of staying tactically flexible in order to fit each occasion.

Italy possible starting lineup: Donnarumma; Di Lorenzo, Bastoni, Calafiori, Darmian; Cristante, Barella; Chiesa, Pellegrini, Zaccagni; Retegui
