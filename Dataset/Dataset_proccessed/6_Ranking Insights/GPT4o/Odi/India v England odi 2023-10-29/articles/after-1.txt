So, India stay unbeaten - six wins in as many games now. And they have regained the top spot as well. England, meanwhile, stay rooted to the bottom. That's all from our side for this game. See you tomorrow.

Rohit Sharma: I think this was a game where we showed a lot of character. All the experienced players stood up at the right time and won us the game. Looking at how the tournament has gone for us, batting second in the first five games and then we had to bat first here, we were challenged. We knew the pitch had something in it and we had the experience in our bowling, so we wanted to get to a decent total. We were not great with the bat, losing three wickets in the first powerplay isn't the ideal situation. You have to then create a long partnership, which we did. But then we just lost wickets, including mine. Looking at the overall picture, I thought we were 30 runs short. [On India's bowling] You don't see that every day when you are defending such a total. Our seamers exploited the conditions very well, there was swing and lateral movement available. [Do India have all the variety in their attack?] I think so, we have got a good balance there. A couple of good spinners and seamers bringing in their experience. When you have a bowling line-up like that, it's important that the batters give them something to work with, and show their magic.

Jos Buttler: Very disappointed. At the halfway stage, chasing 230, we would have fancied ourselves. Same old story. Very disappointed. I wasn't sure about the dew, the gut failed said we should chase. [Did it make sense to absorb pressure after early wickets?] I think whichever way you want to go, you have to be committed. It's all about execution. It is. The answer is on a postcard, I think. It was a great start in the powerplay by the bowlers, the guys found some movement. The ground fielding was good. But the way we batted, we didn't back that up. [On Champions Trophy qualification] Yeah, we are aware of that and there's still lot to play for.

Deepankar DM : "Hate to jinx it, but honestly this Indian intensity and attitude has Australia 2003 feeling to it.."no matter what we are not gonna lose".."

For the record, England are still not out of the semi-finals race.

Rohit Sharma is the Player of the Match for his 87: After the first 10 overs, it was important to stitch a partnership. You have to play the situation as well and not just play your shots. If you have that experience, you should use it. But I still thought we were 20-30 runs short. The new ball was a bit challenging and as the game went on, the ball got softer and it was not easy to rotate strike.

For India, Jasprit Bumrah led the show with the ball, removing Malan and Root off successive balls. Siraj looked off-colour but Shami stepped up, sending back Stokes and Bairstow. After that, it was Kuldeep's turn who all but sealed the game by castling Buttler with a ripper.

9.20pm Another defeat for England, their fifth in six games and they stay at the bottom of the points table. It has been a puzzling performance from the defending champions, with no easy answers available. They are not this bad a team but somehow nothing has clicked. At the innings break today, it looked like they were back to winning ways but their batting just crumbled against a relentless Indian attack. Eight of their batters reached double-digits but only Livingstone (27) could cross 20.
