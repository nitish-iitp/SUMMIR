Glenn Phillips plunders T20 World Cup century, stumbles from field with cramps in huge New Zealand win

New Zealand's Glenn Phillips pounded a T20 World Cup century to set up a 65-run win over Sri Lanka at the SCG on Saturday night, as the Kiwis solidified their lead at the top of group one.

Such a massive effort did Phillips produce in a knock of 104 runs from 64 balls that he was left stumbling in the outfield with cramps during Sri Lanka's innings.

Phillips was substituted from the field during the 14th over after running to collect the ball and returning it to the bowler's end. The 25-year-old appeared ginger immediately, bending down to stretch both hamstrings before jolting in pain. He staggered from the field and drew medical attention.

Glenn Phillips set up a 65-run New Zealand victory in the T20 World Cup with a blistering century. AP

"He's gone, got the wobbly boot!" Michael Clarke said with a laugh in commentary.

"Normally when you go double hamstring, then you go to stretch them and you go in the quad, as well.

"Oh, there he goes!"

Phillips had powered to the middle at a perilous time in New Zealand's innings, arriving at the crease when the Kiwis were 2-7 in the third over.

He proceeded to score the second ton of this year's T20 World Cup, matching the feat of South Africa's Rilee Rossouw at the same venue on Thursday afternoon.

Phillips struck 10 fours and four sixes as New Zealand climbed to 7-167, ensuring a competitive total for the Kiwi bowlers to defend.

He pulled a Maheesh Theekshana delivery for four to reach triple figures, before ripping off his helmet, letting out a mighty roar, pointing his bat to the crowd and raising both arms in the Sydney sky.

Glenn Phillips became the second centurion of this year's T20 World Cup. AP

"The roar of delight comes out! Enjoy this moment, Glenn Phillips. You completely deserve it!" Mel Jones said in commentary.

"What a phenomenal knock this by Glenn Phillips," Dale Steyn added.

"And you can see the elation in him. Look at him. He is so stoked with that.

"What a fantastic knock."

Phillips' knock ended when he was caught by a cover fielder in the final over of New Zealand's innings.

"He has batted awfully beautifully tonight," Steyn said as the brilliant Kiwi returned to the pavilion to cheers from the crowd.

"He's put New Zealand into a wonderful position now as he walks off to this crowd.

"Even if you're a Sri Lankan supporter you will be cheering him on.

"Fantastic knock this by Glenn Phillips."

New Zealand's total of 167 runs never looked under threat, with the Sri Lankans crashing to 4-8 and being bowled out for 102 from 19.2 overs.

Left-arm quick Trent Boult spearheaded the New Zealand attack, capturing 4-13.

New Zealand is leading group one on five points, with England, Ireland and Australia locked on three points.

Every team in group one has two games remaining.

The top two sides from group one and the top two teams from group two will advance to the semi-finals.
