Glenn Phillips and Trent Boult were the heroes as New Zealand charged to a big 65-run wicket over Sri Lanka on Saturday night at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

New Zealand looked to be in a serious hole after losing three early wickets but Phillips stood up, smashing 104 off 64 to give his team a strong total of 167.

Phillips entered the action in the third over, with New Zealand in all sorts after losing two wickets, but proceded to hit 10 fours and four sixes in his 61-ball knock.

“I thought that was a pretty special knock and I take my hat off to how he played, that was unbelievable,” teammate Daryl Mitchell said.

New Zealand’s bowling unit then tore Sri Lanka to shreds in ruthless fashion, with Trent Boult taking four wickets in a particuarly impressive performance.

Saturday’s game took on particular significance after wet weather wreaked havoc the day before.

Group 1 is wide open after both matches in Melbourne on Friday -- Australia v England and Afghanistan v Ireland -- were washed out.

The win on Saturday sees New Zealand top the group and put themselves in a strong position to make the semi-finals.

Sri Lanka made a fast start, with Finn Allen and Devin Conway both departing in the space of three overs to put New Zealand in a heap of pressure and at 2-11.

Allen, who hit 42 off 16 in New Zealand’s win over Australia, went for just one run this time around after being bowled by an inswinger from dangerous spinner Maheesha Theekshana.

“It’s a beauty. It’s the modern-day arm ball... very well bowled,” Michael Clarke said in commentary.

The spin bowling continued to find success as Conway, New Zealand’s other opener, was dismissed soon after having being clean bowled after looking to launch it over extra cover.

It did not get any easier for the Black Caps as Kane Williamson went quickly, with a length ball outside off from Kasun Rajitha taking care of the New Zealand skipper.

Nothing was going right for New Zealand, that was until Sri Lanka dropped Phillips on 12 and it proved to be a costly mistake.

Phillips went on to bring up a 50-run partnership alongside Daryll Mitchell and steadied the ship after a shaky start, with Clarke calling it a “big miss” in commentary.

“You’d like to say they’re never easy but that’s as easy at it gets for an outfield catch,” he said.

“It’s a big miss.”

It was not just in the air though, with poor ground-fielding also making it that much harder for Sri Lanka to put a stop to the runs as Phillips powered his way towards a half-century.

“Just the discipline with their ground-fielding is letting them down,” Clarke added.

“What’s going on out there?”

Phillips would eventually bring up that half-century, doing so after another drop from Sri Lanka, this one from captain Dasun Shanaka.

“He did all the hard work, he got there,” Clarke said.

“The Sri Lankan fielding is costing them. As captain you want to hang onto that and set the example.”

Sri Lanka eventually had a breakthrough of sorts, although it was not Phillips, with Mitchell departing for 22 runs to end the 84-run partnership.

They just could not find a way to get Phillips out though, squandering a chance to run him out after missing a direct hit.

Phillips was eventually dismissed but far too late, having already put 104 runs on the board to put New Zealand in a strong position given their early struggles.

Unfortunately for Sri Lanka, they did not have much more success with the bat in hand, losing three early wickets and in need of one of their own players standing up like Phillips did.

Pathum Nissanka was the first to go before Kusal Mendis, their leading batter at the tournament, followed shortly after with Tim Southee and Trent Boult each claiming an early wicket.

Boult made it two though when he dismissed Dhananjaya de Silva, leaving Sri Lanka in a serious hole at 5-3.

It later became three as the wickets continued to tumble, Charith Asalanka the next to go for just four funs after picking up backward point with Allen in position to take the catch.

Mark Howard called it a “dialobical start” from Sri Lanka while Clarke was full of praise for New Zealand’s bowling unit.

“In Twenty20 cricket it’s usually a batter’s paradise, I’ve just enjoyed seeing enough movement for both the quicks and the spinners,” Clarke said.

Sri Lanka managed just 24 runs in the power play and immediately gave up another wicket right away, this one coming off Mitchell Santner’s first ball as Chamika Karunaratne departed.

The wickets continued to fall and it did not take long for Sri Lanka to be all out, with New Zealand claiming a comfortable victory.
