    "Wanindu Hasaranga had a pretty good campaign in the recent LPL, where he picked 10 wickets at an economy of 6.41. He also smashed 77 not-out in just 34 balls in Qualifier 2. Hasaranga has a terrific record in T20I cricket with 86 wickets in 52 matches at 6.67 rpo, striking every 13 balls.",
    "Suryakumar Yadav would want to pick up where he left off in the previous year. While he was dismissed trying a fancy shot in the first game, Suryakumar rarely goes two games in a row without a big score. The dynamic Indian batter was sensational for India in 2022, amassing 1164 runs at an average of 47 while striking at a mind-boggling rate of 187. Suryakumar smashed two T20I hundreds and nine fifties in the year."
