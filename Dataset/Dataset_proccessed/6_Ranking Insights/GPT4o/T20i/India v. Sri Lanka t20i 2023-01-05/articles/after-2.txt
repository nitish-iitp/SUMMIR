India vs Sri Lanka 2nd T20I Live Score and Updates

IND vs SL 2nd T20I Updates: A brilliant half-century by all-rounder Axar Patel and his blazing 91-run partnership with Suryakumar Yadav (51) went in vain as India failed to recover from early setbacks and lost to Sri Lanka by 16 runs in the second T20I of the three-match series at the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) Stadium.

The Men in Blue registered a thrilling 2-run win over the visitors in the series opener at Wankhede Stadium. Hardik Pandya took some tough decisions in critical situations to test the team and it turned out well for the hosts. However, they have to produce a clinical show in the second match to clinch the series.

The spotlight will be on Shubman Gill and Yuzvendra Chahal who failed to create any impact in the first T20I. Gill made his T20I debut on Tuesday but failed to score big on the occasion and was dismissed for just 7, while Chahal remained wicketless after leaking 26 runs in the two overs.

India vs Sri Lanka 2nd T20I Updates

Another excellent game of cricket but this time it was Sri Lanka who get over the line and levelled the three-match series 1-1. The Indian bowlers had a rough night at the office, especially Arshdeep Singh who bowled five no-balls which cost India big time in the chase. Umran Malik was the pick of the bowlers for claiming three wickets but he was also expensive by leaking 48 runs in his four overs. Young Shivam Mavi who had a dream debut on Tuesday had a forgettable night where he leaked 53 runs. Dasun Shanaka once again turned out to be the biggest nemesis of Indian team and scored unbeaten 56 runs, while opener Kusal Mendis also scored 52.

In reply, India lost the top-order early with just 21 runs on the scoreboard. Ishan Kishan, Shubman Gill and Rahul Tripathi played some loose shots which hurt India. Hardik Pandya also dismissed cheaply for 12. Deepak Hooda failed to replicate his form from the opening match and departed for 9.

Axar Patel and Suryakumar Yadav shared a crucial 91-run stand to keep India alive in the chase. Interestingly, Axar was the aggressor in the partnership as SKY played the anchor role to support the southpaw. In the end, Shanaka bowled a sensational final over to seal the game for the visitors.
