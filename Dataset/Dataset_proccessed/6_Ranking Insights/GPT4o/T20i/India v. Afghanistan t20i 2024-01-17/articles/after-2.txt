India vs Afghanistan Live Score Updates, 3rd T20: India spinner Ravi Bishnoi

India vs Afghanistan 3rd T20: Ind vs Afg: India beat Afghanistan in third T20 International after two thrilling super overs. Chasing 212, Afghanistan too ended with the same score.

India equalled Afghanistan's score of 16 in the first super over to stretch the match, but the visitors could not chase down a target of 12 in the second super over as Rohit Sharma's side picked the required two wickets through Ravi Bishnoi.

 Rohit Sharma's fifth T20 century and Rinku Singh's second half century led India score 212/4 in 20 overs. 

Earlier, riding on skipper Rohit Sharma's unbeaten 69-ball 121 and Rinku Singh's 69 off 39 deliveries, India staged a remarkable recovery to post 212 for four after slipping to 22 for four in the fifth over.

In reply, Afghanistan also ended at 212 with Gulbadin Naib hammering a 23-ball 55 to lead his team's stunning comeback.

Fareed Ahmad Malik was the most successful bowler for Afghanistan, ending with excellent figures of 3/20, even as his colleagues were taken to the task by Rohit and Rinku.

Batting first, India lost 4 quick wicket to Afganistan pacers, where Fareed Ahmad dismissed Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli and Sanju Samson. Both Kohli and Samson went to pavilion for a golden duck. 

While Azmatullah Omarzai dismissed Shivam Dube (1). Rohit Sharma and Rinku Singh first stabalised the innings and then hammered the Afghan bowlers. Rohit Sharma's (121*) smashed his 5th T20 century, and this has become his highest individiual score. Also, with this, Sharma has become the only batter with 5 centuries in T20 cricket. Rinku Singh too scored his half century (69*), as India have scored 212/4 in 20 overs.

Rohit Sharma-led energised Indian squad mulls to sweep the three-match T20 series against Afghanistan after defeating the latter by 6 wickets at Holkar stadium in Indore on 14 January.

India is faceing Afghanistan at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore on Wednesday for the last and third T20 match. The match between India and Afghanistan will be broadcast on the Sports 18 network and will be live-streamed on JioCinema from 7 pm (IST) onwards.

It is expected that the Indian management may make some changes in the playing XI as they are trying to provide opportunities to players who have been sitting on the bench.

On the other hand, Afghanistan will try to salvage some pride in the final encounter.

Before this T20I match, both India and Afghanistan faced each other three times in the T20 World Cups once in the Asia Cup and twice in the previous bilateral series. India have won all five matches.
