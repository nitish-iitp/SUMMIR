India’s final Group A match at the 2024 T20 World Cup on Saturday was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to wet outfield, with both the teams awarded a point each.

With incessant rains in Lauderhill, Florida, the fate of the game was hanging by a thread already and despite the weather being clear by the time of the toss, the outfield wasn’t cleared for a game by the match officials.

🚨 UPDATE 🚨

The #CANvIND match has been called off due to wet outfield.

The game, even if it would’ve went ahead, wasn’t going to affect the next round as India and USA had already confirmed qualification for Super-8.

India finish the group stages with 7 points and at the top of the table while Canada finish with three points from four matches – having previously defeated Ireland.

On Friday, Pakistan’s hopes of making into the Super-8 were dashed as the game between USA and Ireland was also abandoned at the same venue.

Babar Azam and Co are yet to play their final game – against Ireland – but consecutive losses to kickstart their campaign had already done the damage to their campaign. In their first match of the tournament, Pakistan were stunned by the USA in a Super Over whereas India bested the arch rivals on June 9 in a low-scoring thriller.

As it stands, India and USA have made it to the next round as have Australia, West Indies, Afghanistan, and South Africa. Two more spots are up for the grabs – one each in Group B and D.
