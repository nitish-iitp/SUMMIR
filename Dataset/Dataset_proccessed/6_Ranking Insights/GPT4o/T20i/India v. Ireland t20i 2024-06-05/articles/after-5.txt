India vs Ireland Highlights: Rohit Sharma-led IND began its T20 World Cup 2024 campaign on a wonderful note as they defeated IRE by 8 wickets. Captain Rohit Sharma slammed a magnificent half-century and completed his 4,000 runs in T20 internationals.  
India vs Ireland Live Score Updates: India captain Rohit Sharma plays a shot for six runs against Ireland during an ICC Men's T20 World Cup cricket match at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in Westbury, New York (PTI)

India vs Ireland T20 World Cup 2024: Team India captain Rohit Sharma slammed a wonderful half-century to lead his team to a 8-wicket victory against Ireland in the first match of T20 World Cup 2024. Paul Stirling-led Ireland was restricted to a low score of 96 runs as Hardik Pandya and other pacers did a wonderful job at the New York stadium. Arshdeep Singh leaked some crucial runs in the death overs, which boosted Ireland's score. 

India won the toss and skipper Rohit Sharma has decided that they will bowl first. The Indian national cricket is playing with five pacers today. 

Rohit Sharma-led Indian cricket team is all set to kick start its T20 World Cup 2024 campaign at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, New York, on Wednesday as they will play their first match against Ireland. Team India will enter their first game with confidence as they secured a massive victory against Bangladesh in the warmup match, and the India vs Ireland game will set the tone for the upcoming India vs Pakistan thriller on June 9. 

The Indian cricket team landed in New York in the last week of May and engaged in intense practice sessions and team-building exercises ahead of the tournament. The viewers will keenly look out for India's opening duo, as some reports have suggested that Virat Kohli might open with Rohit Sharma, as Yashasvi Jaiswal didn't display a very impressive game on the position in the Indian Premier League (IPL).

Don't count the USA and Canada matches, I am talking about the real matches like Pakistan and even against Ireland. Their new-ball attack is decent," former India opener Aakash Chopra said.

India vs Ireland Live Score: Former opener's top order recommendation

India vs Ireland Live Score: "Not much should be read into a warm-up game, as sending him at No.3 was maybe about giving him more game time. If he explodes in the last five-six overs along with players like Hardik, (Ravindra) Jadeja or even an Axar Patel, that can really be the game-changer. Suppose in a game, India still have Rishabh at the dugout for the last eight-nine overs, it will surely keep the opposition under pressure," former India opener WV Raman told The Telegraph.

India vs Ireland Live Score: Rohit Sharma on New York pitch condition

India vs Ireland Live Score: "There is a square of four pitches. I don't know which wicket we will be playing on. So, who knows - the wicket that we are playing tomorrow might be a good wicket to bat on. So, it's all about adapting," Rohit Sharma told reporters on the eve of the match.

"I didn't get to watch the game. I was a little busy with my family, who arrived yesterday. But no, I certainly know how the pitch played, hearing from my other teammates. We've got a lot of guys in the team, and the support staff was talking about what happened in that game. But, again, all I can say is we'll make the best decision possible for these conditions, whatever the best level we feel. We'll just go to the ground and have a look at the pitch," he added.
