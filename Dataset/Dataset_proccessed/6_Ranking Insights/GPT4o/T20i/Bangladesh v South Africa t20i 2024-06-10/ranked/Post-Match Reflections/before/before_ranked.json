    "Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto: 'I think this is a match we should have won. Last couple of overs they bowled well, it can happen in cricket. I think Rishad is very good. He's worked very hard and is showing our skills. We've struggled with leg-spin the last 10-15 years, we've got lucky. Thanks to all the supporters, I hope they come to the West Indies as well.'",
    "Player of the match Heinrich Klaasen: 'It was not a nice one to watch, it was good that the boys got it over the line. The wicket is not too great for strokeplay. David showed us how to bat on this wicket in the last match and we applied that today. We were about 10 runs short. Luckily we've got experience in the changing room. We had to play with less of a one-day mindset today. It'll be good confidence for the boys, we've had three pressurised games now.'",
    "South Africa captain Aiden Markram: 'I think it got pretty nerve racking in the final over and it can make you mentally tired. Sometimes when you get on the right side it makes for good entertainment. Fortunately that ball could've gone anywhere and if that catch was missed it would've been a different conversation. Luckily we got on the right side of victory. It all depends on the situation and where you want to drag the game out or use players to attack and take wickets. The seamers were bowling really well and we wanted to drag the game out. It was fantastic for Klaasen and Miller to get some runs and the two of them were a great partnership.'"
