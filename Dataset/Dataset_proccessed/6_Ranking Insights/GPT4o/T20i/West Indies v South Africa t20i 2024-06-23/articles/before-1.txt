Powerplay game the focus as West Indies gear up for key Antigua clash
A win in their next fixture against South Africa places the West Indies in a good position to make it to the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 semi-finals.

After an unbeaten run in the group stage, the Men in Maroon were rocked in their first Super Eight game when England defeated them by eight wickets. However, they bounced back with a comprehensive nine-wicket win over co-hosts USA on 21 June.

Not only do they gain two crucial points, but also improve their NRR substantially. They’re now placed second in the Group 2 table and a strong win in their next game can help seal a semi-final spot.

Super Eight standings - Group 2

South Africa sit at the top of the table with four points to their name and a net run rate (NRR) of +0.625. England and West Indies are at two points each, but the latter are ahead based on a superior NRR of +1.814 as compared to England's +0.412. USA are at the fourth place with zero points and an NRR of -2.908.

This means that irrespective of the result in the England-USA fixture, West Indies can secure a semi-final spot if they manage to win against South Africa and maintain a superior NRR over Buttler's men.

Up against Proteas on Sunday evening, West Indies all-rounder Roston Chase looked at his team’s Powerplay game as a crucial determinant in their ability to control the contest. Courtesy of an attacking knock from Shai Hope, West Indies cruised at closer to 9.5 an over during their Powerplay.

“I just think that most of the times when we control the power play, whether batting or bowling, that's when we come out on top,” Chase, who secured a Player of the Match award for his 3/19, said. “In the last game when we lost to England, we struggled in that period after the power play. We spoke about that, and the guys came out and executed it well today.”

Given their strong start, West Indies were able to carry on the momentum and completed a chase of 129 by the 11th over. Chase believed that once West Indies had a good start, they had enough firepower to make the most of this momentum in the death overs.

“I mean, it was only probably four overs outside of the power play, we finished it kind of quick. But I think that that's the main focus because we know in the end we have the power at the end.

“So, it's just for us to control that power play with the batting and our bowling, and then for us in the batting to keep the momentum going to that seven to 15 period where we fell down horribly against England.”

West Indies went up against South Africa in May and recorded a 3-0 series win. Despite this recent advantage, Chase was cautious to read too much into that result given how many first-choice players were missing from the respective teams.

“Obviously, there would have been two different teams, us, and South Africa, have different players in the World Cup. But this is a different series now. This is the big World Cup.”

Instead, Chase wanted his side to focus on the present and the upcoming future.

“And obviously, they have stronger players in their setup as well. They haven't lost a match as yet in the World Cup. They will be high on confidence. But it's just for us to go there, put that series behind us, put every game that we've played so far behind us, and just focus on that one to come.”

Despite South Africa’s undefeated run, West Indies weren’t going to budge away from a contest.

“We're going to be coming hard,” Chase said. “So, we'll collide, and whoever's the strongest, I think, will win. So, it's just for us, as I say, to just go there and give it your all. As I say, it's a win-win situation.

“You can't lose, so it doesn't make any sense going up there and fooling around. I mean, put the focus. Find a way to just put that focus in whatever you have to do, whether it be batting, bowling, fielding. Just go there and zone in. And obviously, too, the main thing is to enjoy.”
