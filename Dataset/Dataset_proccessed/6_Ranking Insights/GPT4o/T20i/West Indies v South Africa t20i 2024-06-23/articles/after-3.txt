West Indies have set South Africa 136 to win at North Sound in their Super Eight match of the T20 World Cup.

The two-time champions were restricted to 135 for 8 in their 20 overs after the Proteas put on a superb bowling performance.

Kyle Mayers, who came into the team for the match replacing Johnson Charles, hit 35 off 34 balls on a tricky pitch in Antigua after West Indies lost Shai Hope (0) and Nicholas Pooran (1) early.

Roston Chase (52) added 81 for the third wicket with Mayers before the West Indies lost their way in the middle overs.

Spinner Tabraiz Shamsi took 3 for 27 while fellow twirler Keshav Maharaj had 1 for 24 in his four overs for the Proteas.

South Africa won the toss and asked the West Indies to bat.

The winner of the game will join England in the semifinals of the T20 World Cup.
